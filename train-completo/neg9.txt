                                                    Is there a particular reason most international travel is by plane rather than helicopter. I assume it's cost, but why are jets cheaper than choppers?                                                                                                                                                                           Beyond the visuals - what are the mechanics, gameplay loops and narrative flaws it would need to address?               I'm skeptical too, but the timing at least makes sense.   If this is happening, I am intrigued to see how they'll address some of the elements of the game that haven't aged too well. The Don Corneo segments especially...      Because seriously, the developers of Donkey Kong Country Returns deserve to burn for those rocket levels.                                                                    	104
 Caught in a landslide,   http://youtu.be/2T3l_QabfkA Found it!   I seem to recall it being a commercial for Universal Studios when they added that 3D King Kong segment to the tram.    Can't go wrong with an IPA!   Ooo that ass movement!   Nice! I've been training all my life for this! What's the respawn rate?   Yea it didn't seemed like the guy was well trained in boxing. He wouldn't block most of the time. And I couldn't stop seeing a giant "R" tattooed on his back.   	7
 so liberty much rothbard   It tastes like Lamburger Helper.   I'm surprised it hasn't broken an axle yet.   when it was more like a Pizza Village    It's a space station   He knew. He was just letting them hang themselves with their "we make everything on the premises ourselves" lie.  For one, they had no commercial baking equipment in the kitchen.   He knew she was lying the moment she claimed she alone made all the desserts and baked goods in addition to "running" the kitchen.   The NRA won't be happy until children can buy full-auto machine guns at 7-11.   He's hoping for that Fox News gig and the Regnery publishing deal.   ... and few others.  What will the Republicans do for votes and money when they lose their favorite "Culture War" wedge issue?   The Party of Spite.   He's building a Clone Army.   God, please save us from those who claim they are on a mission from You.   The Gunbertarian Downvote Militia will not be pleased with this story.   150 years on, and the rage is still there.  Now imagine it as hundreds of years, as in the struggles between the English and the Irish.  Or imagine it as thousands of years in struggle, as in the Middle East.  An excellent case can be made that the Charleston church slaying victims were modern casualties of the Civil War.  Can we remove this poison from ourselves, or is it simply in our nature to seek conflict?   Maybe that's what he uses in his up-do.    Ha, Obama could eat a ham sandwich  And they'd still say he was a secret Muslim    $100,000 to speak before the very soldiers he crippled with his lies.  I still don't know why BushCo isn't rotting in the Hague.   The loons the American Right has cultivated for over four decades are now coming home to roost.   Donald Trump represents the vulgarity of the the last 45 years of angry Republican populism distilled into one bottle: a foul brew of Nixon, Reagan, the Bushes, Gingrich, the Tea Party, etc.  To wit: pride in greed, narcissism, paranoia, a lust for power, a hunger for prestige, quick to anger, and reactionary military attack based on conspiracy theories and/or flimsy/manufactured evidence.  The GOP and those who fund them have built an America where a candidate such as Trump can even be taken seriously; it's left to all of us to deal with the results.   It's the most "Windows-y" of Apple-created apps.   This reminds me of a similar case from Southern California in 1970.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)   They had to use Kafka-Kuffs.   Finally, some courts are starting to deal with the GOP's election fraud.  Is it any surprise, then, that McConnell's Republican-controlled Senate is declining to approve any more judicial nominees for the remaining two years of President Obama's tenure?   All your water is belong to us.   This is probably the first honest thing she's ever said.   How many of them wouldn't even be there if it not for his lies?   The Party of Spite.   Has Alternet been taken off this sub's "banned" list too?  If so, good news!   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is nothing but a lobbying group for pushing far-right wing "trickle down" economics.  Unfortunately, because of the name they chose for themselves, people are inclined to believe any crap they spout.   Actually, it's the Confederate apologists that need the history lesson.   Why can't they let go? It's been 150 years, and the Confederate flag is in no way a thing to be proud of.  Is it just spite?   [Relevant.](http://jonmcnaughton.com/content/ZoomDetailPages/OneNationUnderGod.html)   Given the Republican base these days, I'm not so sure.   That was not meant to be a factual statement!   The 'Forced Birth' crowd will hate this one.   There are many who have a special interest in seeing that stories like these aren't widely distributed.  This is why *Salon*, *Talking Points Memo*, and even *Mother Jones* (for a time) were for so long effectively banned under the fallacious and Mod-imposed "Rehosted Content" rule.   The de facto ban on *Salon* and *Talking Points Memo* was recently lifted, demonstrating that some Mods are receptive to reason. However, *Media Matters* (and others) still suffer under this artificial, Mod-imposed ban.  I believe that Reddit's /r/politics community should reflect *the community*, not the whims of Mods who seek to censor content which they may personally find distasteful. Reddit is meant to be a Free Marketplace of Ideas, based on user-submitted, user-curated content.   Do others agree?   This is gross-out stuff.   A once-great American political party reduced to a tree stump upon which only vulgarians, morons, and charlatans perch to preach: this is what the Republican Party has become.  I know there are hundreds of thousands of sane, decent Republicans out there across America whose stomachs are turned by displays such as these.  For the nation's benefit, may these Republicans rededicate themselves to reclaiming their party's voice from the ill-tempered, rage-filled man-children who have come to dominate it.   It's surprising that this incident hasn't received more attention.   Why would Rand Paul, who evidently imagines himself a qualified candidate to lead the Executive Branch, consort with Cliven Bundy, who is proud to announce to everyone he meets that he "doesn't recognize the federal government as even existing"?  Rand Paul is clearly reaching deep into his father Ron Paul's well-worn bag of grifting tricks and "LIBERTY!"^TM dog-whistles. Those gimmicks still seem to work on the crowd of oddballs who have fallen for Ron Paul's innumerable scams and paranoid conspiracy theories for decades.   It was a decision made by right-wing Mods to conceal how truly unpopular right-wing ideology is.   Sounds like the Kochs' "American Legislative Exchange Council."   [A Reading of the Declaration of Independence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETroXvRFoKY)   The Kochocracy is supplanting the government of Wisconsin.  They plan on doing to Wisconsin what Koch Industries has already to their home base state, Kansas.  Wisconsinites: please don't let this happen. The nation needs you.   Be prepared for *Stormfront* copypasta passed off as "proof."   *[crickets]*   It's getting harder and harder for "Liberty-Lovers"^TM to hide who they are and what they support.   This is what the Republicans have reduced themselves to.  It's not the 1980s anymore, guys. You can't just say shit like this and not be laughed at, let alone expect to get away with such crap unchallenged because you're constantly shouting "FLAG!" and BIBLE!" and "MURICA!"   Whatever happened to all the loonies out at Bundy Ranch?  The ones who vowed to shoot their brothers-in-arms "The Oath Keepers" for desertion?  Watch the video of these "Patriots" holding their little rage session here. [Back at the Bundy Ranch, Its Oath Keepers vs. Militiamen as Wild Rumors Fly](http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2014/04/30/back-at-the-bundy-ranch-its-oath-keepers-vs-militiamen-as-wild-rumors-fly/)  Aren't they just *so* tacti-*cool?*     Will Chris Christe support Paula Dean?

Similar behind-the-scenes  "Digg Patriot" hijinks were revealed among right-wing extremist Mods, and (presumably as a result) the worst of them are no longer Mods there.   Many of their hand-picked successors remain, however. These Mods remain quite fond of censoring legitimate user submissions under the flimsiest of pretexts if such stories do not align with their dogma, or reveal causes/personalities they support for what they are.     It seems like rightwing policy is based more on what feels correct then what is actually correct.  To me, it seems like rightwing policy is based on what feels spiteful, no matter the damage.    Donald Trump is the 'id' of the Republican Party.  It's not a pretty sight.   The Republican Party now pretty much consists of the independently wealthy and the Amway sales reps that worship them.   Trump is only acting as he always has. It's American society that has shifted from beneath him.  This isn't the 1980s anymore. Narcissistic, hateful, bigoted, swine don't get free passes these days, no matter how many billions in holdings they've accumulated, or how high they wave the flag.   [It's depicted here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Clippy-letter.PNG)   Rich white guys need to find a new role model.  Rich white guys never thought Trump a role model.  Poor white Awway salesmen thought Trump a role model.    According to Trump, you're lucky they didn't rape you.   Or maybe the Confederate flag's time has gone, and it's finally time to recognize that it's a vestigial embarrassment of our nation's darkest times.   Clarence Thomas was never qualified to be on the Court in the first place.  Bush I nominated him. Bush II also did grave damage to the Court with his picks. If for no other reason, this history alone is enough to vote against the would-be Bush III.     he is married to jinny/ginny/jeanie Thomas, a tea party platform lobbyist who has benefited directly from Clarence's rulings  [And who cranks-calls Anita Hill.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130688438)    Why soft-launch so early?   Here's my recent take:  It's a play to the the Republican's key demographic: poor, angry, rubes who fantasize daily "if this country wuz only run right, ***I'd*** be a Big Shot."  The worship of and reverence for incalculable personal wealth (to which many on the American Right cling) blinds them to their own low status and decreasing possibilities. (Witness the kind of voters that fall for people like Trump, Perot, the Kochs, etc.)  Almost inevitably, their support boils down to the old "well, he's rich, so he must be doin' sumptin' right" canard.   Then why all the deletions?   Because every Amway salesman fantasizes about being Trump.   I'd love to see a further fissure in which the Gunbertarian/Sovereign Citizen types abandon the Republicans and form their own party.  They largely have (see the Paul Libertarians-Chuck Baldwin Constitution Party, ) but they always come home to vote against the Democrats, because "damn lib'ruls."    "And was the raping *legitimate?* If so, the woman's body has a way of shutting that whole thing down."  Todd Akin   It's a hate fest wrapping itself in a pity party.  That's the 'id' of the GOP ever since Nixon. [Listen to Nixon's 1952 "Checkers" speech here for a prime example of this enduring trend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjwBDH-vhY)   It's a play to the the Republican's key demographic: poor, angry, rubes who fantasize daily "if this country wuz only run right, ***I'd*** be a Big Shot."

He's the "rich, large, and in-charge" type that every Republican male fantasizes about.   Chickens from the 1980s are coming home to roost for the GOP.       Honest question though, have any Democratic runners spoke out against Trumps attacks on Latinos?  When an enemy is in the middle of destroying himself, don't interrupt him.     It's starting.   To say nothing of the integrity.   Donald Trump is the personification of 1980s GOP greed and self-worshipping arrogance.  How fitting that he still finds ways to come ever closer to the pride in unvarnished avarice, malicious ignorance, and unrepentant braggadocio of that bygone era.       He wants to control *all* the bridges.   Reagan's image is already featured on the National Debt.   Reddit's 'Gunbertarian Downvote Militia' remains very active.   They're hoping to land book and tv deals on the Fox/AM radio 'Wingnut Welfare' circuit.   I wonder if Rand talked with Cliven Bundy about this at their private meeting?   They certainly share a lot of fanboys.   Good. We don't need a return engagement from Polio.   They'd make a great GOP ticket.   Why would I expect him to? He's a useful idiot for the Kochs.   He and Cliven Bundy should share a blunt in honor of Aqua Buddha.   Scott Walker: another tool of the Kochs as they try to recreate the Deep South in the Midwest.   True. How many times did the play the loop of that asshole riding his horse up on a dusty knoll and waving the American flag around?  In Bundy's own words, he "doesn't recognize the Federal Government as even existing." But he was certainly proud to wave the flag of the United States for his cheesy Fox "I'mma PATRIOT!!1!" photo-op.   Because it's more barely disguised Neo-Confederate "States' Rights!!!" Libertarian bullshit. And Rand Paul learned from the King of all the "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM  fraudsters, his own father Ron Paul, as seen here:  [Ron Paul's Neo-Confederate "South Was Right" Civil War Speech With Confederate Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)     [The Chilling Anti-Government, Cliven Bundy-Loving Facebook Posts of the Alleged Las Vegas Shooters: Jerad and Amanda Miller's Facebook and YouTube likes included the NRA, Rand Paul, FreedomWorks, and other right-wing championsand videos justifying the killing of police officers.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/jerad-amanda-miller-las-vegas-shooting-cliven-bundy-anti-government)   The existence of the Koch Brothers' ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council).   biased headlines  The headline is "Rand Paul meets with rouge rancher Cliven Bundy."

The ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) Republicans have used since Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign  an exploit designed to win power through divisiveness and embitterment  will soon cost the GOP more votes than it wins them.  The Right (the Evangelical Right in particular) is losing the Culture War it started. Once, they called for bans on certain music because they feared the backwards messages allegedly hidden in popular songs would lead America's children to become Satanists  *and were taken seriously by many.*  How might these Culture Warriors respond to their many and recent setbacks?   Ron Paul was and is a right-wing conspiracy theorist and Confederate apologist, among many, *many* other faults.   Fine, as long as she doesn't wind up Naderizing the election.  Take a moment to imagine the Supreme Court selections of *any* of the Republicans before lodging the usual protests.    Also exorcisms.   A 'Strict Constructionist,' he.   I'm not comparing them as equivalent. That's your attempt to put words in my mouth.  What I'm saying is that the Wingnuts must feel especially demoralized this month given how much phony "moral concerns/we're superior and God-favored" bullshit they've excreted all over the American body politic for decades.  Got it?   It's part of an especially demoralizing week for the Right. They're losing all the fights they've started these past few years. (Marriage rights, health care, Confederates repackaged as "Real Patriots" through 'Tea Party' Astroturf, etc.)   And their false yet eternal "we've got high morals and them damn lib'ruls don't" delusion is crumbling from beneath them: the Duggars, Hastert, and now "Ms. Abstinence Only" Palin again.  It's hard for the American Right to keep the "we're Righteous Culture Warriors, fightin' the Good Fight of the Lord" play-acting going when the nation is finally realizing it was four l-o-o-o-ong decades worth of bullshit contrived to divide us amongst ourselves all along.   It's been a very bad week for Wingnuts overall.   On their own altar, every fifty years like clockwork.  And for what?   And scandalous acts of Duggary.   Source? (if other than Stormfront message boards)   I wonder who this Job Creator^TM votes for?   Nixon's ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy), a gambit which the Republican Party has exploited for nearly fifty years to hold power, is crumbling.  What will the Republicans replace it with?    damn good thing we aren't all judged by the actions or our children or other relatives.  Or the Duggars.      That sounds closer to a call to overthrow the government than violating the Constitution.  Right-Wing Nut-Jobs/Militias are making a lot of noise lately. Worse still, they've become VERY agitated at all developments in the news this past week  the shunning of the Confederate flag, the Obamacare ruling, the marriage rights ruling...  When these people get pissed, they go big. Anyone who doubts the rage and insanity that powers this crowd of [*The Turner Diaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries) fantasists need only remember that after the Oklahoma City  Timothy McVeigh was apprehended wearing a "Sic Semper Tyrannus!" shirt.

How about a fight for the liberty of women? oh wait it's TX   It should be noted that the ***real*** momentum behind the marriage rights push began when it was shown that the Mormon Church spent heavily to kill a California ballot proposition on the legalization of gay marriage.  Thanks for the assist, Utah! It probably would have taken another generation if not for your efforts.   That's *three* social wedge issues the American Right has lost in just a week: the Confederate flag, PPACA, and gay marriage.     Abstinence-Only Education!   It's a verbal abortion.

Otherwise, it's just a matter of hiding behind a label with the direct intent of killing content, and further demonstration that some Mods enforce rules (which in some cases *they themselves* created) arbitrarily, with zero input from the user community.  Mods ***MUST*** be willing to defend and justify their decisions, not seek to deliberately hide them from the community's view. So, if you *must* label something, let the story stand so we as users can have a clearer vision of what the rules are and how they are applied.  You'd like us to obey the rules, right? How can we know what they are if you insist upon instantly hiding examples of violations behind a cloak of secrecy, in some cases in less time than it could have possibly taken for a Mod to read the article?  If Mod's decisions are justified, the logic of a rule's application should be self-evident, don't you agree? So why hide the content and the label away from public view?  If a Mod can act as judge, jury and executioner, how can we know that the Mod acted fairly and ethically, especially when the article is suddenly buried from the view of our user community? That makes it *seem* like there's something to hide. Those who cannot (or refuse to) justify their actions should not be the position to control user's access to content in the first place.  Is the need for Mod transparency on these decisions not clear? Do we disagree on that most basic of points?

  I think it's a shame he doesn't write the blockbusters he works on.   I love Pale Rider. I feel like it's Eastwood's forgotten Western - or maybe that's Hang 'Em High.   If Season 3 was half its length, it would have been the best season.   Also, less visually interesting. In fact ugly and messy. The action in this episode is actually horrible.   Really? I didn't think Charlie Work was all that funny, the plot was a bit stupid and I struggled to suspend my disbelief for a lot of it. Frankly, the cinematography still isn't that great. The show still feels like it's being filmed by three friends for $100 and IMO that's part of the charm, but it doesn't create good looking shots. In fact, a lot of the shots were pretty terrible.    Not a lot happened in 5a, but they sure made up for it with a lot of great moments. Do you remember the train episode? Jesus! That was awesome.   And Game of Thrones and Homeland experienced a drop in quality. I think the golden age is well and truly over.  I keep looking at shows I thought were great last year and now I'm not too fond Hannibal has forgone story for the sake of artiness, Community found its way further up Dan Harmon's arse, Better Call Saul was tremendously disappointing and I have nothing but low expectations for the next season of Fargo. Also Parks and Rec is over. :'(  I've enjoyed Archer, Daredevil, and even The Walking Dead more than I've enjoyed the aforementioned shows. The Walking Dead!! I think the golden age of television is over.    Jon Favreau's dialogue is so underapreciated, I think it's a shame he doesn't write the blockbusters he works on. I imagine his voice working best on Shazam! His dialogue through a teenaged voice would be interesting to hear and I also think Shazam's DC's funnest hero and Favreau is Marvel's funnest director (sorry Gunn and Whedon fans).  Other than that, probably Branagh to Aquaman. If anyone is going to give the Big Orange the respect he deserves, it'll be him. Also, he'll probably add some Shakespearean touches which would be much appreciated.   Ha! I knew this one!  /u/train_subject1185 - 1: Life - 99   This is the right answer. M   Sorry, but it was months after Peter died when they announced the new Ultimate Spider-Man. I get the sense that Peter wasn't just killed off to be replaced. It makes a lot more sense in the continuity of Ultimate Spider-Man which I'd recommend reading as it's very accessible for a non-comic book reader like yourself.   He's got to earn that paycheck somehow.   Everything pop culture knows about the character comes from the movies which was a pretty inaccurate depiction of the character back then.    Alan Ball deserves a mention.   The Dollar Trilogy. Clint is a real prick in those movies.   I was eleven-ish and watched The Good, The Bad and The Ugly with my dad. The finale is almost completely superfluous to the narrative and could have been done in three or four shots, yet Leone takes five minutes to express relationships between characters, build tension, show off some pretty Spanish landscapes and play some kick-ass music. That's when I realised what film was capable of.   It's kind of weird because it sounds so fake, yet it's so enthralling.   A few months and it's working great.   I'd prefer to see him take his Hal Jordan into Live Action.   Dark Reign and Annihilation would make my day.    Why Big Koala instead of Des Kangaroo?   I now feel like an idiot. Of course I should run Des Kangaroo. I probably left it out for some stupid reason like the card art annoys me.  I'll add Naturia Beast.     Thanks man, you've been very helpful. I feel like this deck is going to run a lot faster now.   Thanks, I think that's helped a lot.  -1 United We Stand  -1 Closed Forest  -1 Mirror Force  -1 Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest  +2 Royal Decree  +2 Mystical Space Typhoon  +2 Effect Veiler   This puts the deck at 42 cards, do you think that may be too big?   Thanks. You've got me all excited.   Really? Sorry to be doubtful, but do you have a source?   The aim is to try and summon monsters from the extra deck as quickly as possible using the Raccoons' swarming abilities or Obedience Schooled. You can do this by using Junk Synchron to special summon a level two beast from the grave to synchro summon a level 5 *or* XYZ two level 2 beasts to summon Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu *or* searching for the material for Koala-Koala - with Pon-Poko, the Raccoon Rascal/Baby Raccoon Tantan or Obedience Schooled - and using Polymerization to fusion summon it. Using United We Stand whilst Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu is on the field can lead to some strong tokens. Tokens from Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu can have their attack borrowed by Junk Warrior to give it ridiculous attack. You can do a lot of these combos within the first turn creating a FTK.  I have no idea how this stacks up against the current meta, but I've really enjoyed using it and felt like sharing.    **Monsters [24]**    * Big Koala  * Junk Synchron x3  * King of the Swamp x3  * Tree Otter x2  * Mogmole  * Wind-Up Kitten  * Pon-Poko, the Raccoon Rascal x3  * Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest x2  * Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest x3  * Sea Koala x2  * Baby Raccoon Tantan x3    **Spells [15]**    * Raigeki  * Polymerization x3  * Ayer's Rock Sunrise x3  * Rank-Up Magic Astral Force  * Obedience Schooled x3  * United We Stand x2  * Closed Forest x2    **Traps [1]**    * Mirror Force  **Extra Deck [15]**   * Master of Oz  * Koala-Koala x3  * [Any four level 5 Synchro monsters, I opted for Frozen Fitzgerald, T.G. Hyper Librarian, Armades, Keeper of Boundries and Ally of Justice Catastor.]  * Junk Warrior  * Diamond Dire Wolf x2  * Daigusto Phoenix  * Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu x3   Do you have a deck list I could peek at?   Three Photon Satellites and the Calculator or XYZing Number 64 then getting a token with high attack and Junk Warrioring.   I mixed them with Koalas and have found that pretty effective. I just use a lot of staple beast cards and support.   Robbie Reyes wouldn't be.   Two = tons? Okay then. Moon Knight is capable of holding 13 episodes IMO and I think Pascal is a great choice white or not (although, I would have preferred him as Doctor Strange).   Even if it's Terry Crews?   Is Teen Titans: Year One any good?   I love Southern Bastards. It's gloriously written and really shows Aaron and Latour at their best. A TV show would be fantastic, but I believe there needs to be more source material for it. Maybe in three-four years. I wish we were getting more than one arc every eight months though.   I want change to have a sense of progression. My favorite period of Avengers comics is the 2004-2010 run of crossovers (Avengers Disassembled, House of M, Civil War, World War Hulk, Secret Invasion, Dark Reign and Siege). I love this period as characters grow and change. We got a new Cap, Thor died and had a change of setting, Iron Man battled inner demons and went from being on top of the world to the bottom of it and Hawkeye went from hiding in Eastern Europe to leading the New Avengers and calling out Norman Osbourne on live television. These were clear character arcs that lasted years and as a result felt like advancing seasons of a TV show - exactly how /u/AlphaNeonic seemed to want comics. I just wish some of the actual events had been a bit less crap and the solo books contributed to the overall story arc a bit more.    Yes, but the mythology is weaker. Although the fight scenes are why most will watch it.   The Raid 2 is a much richer experience for seeing the first one   The Raid    I've got a feeling this is becoming the next underrated gem, but who cares when its that good?   Godzilla director? Awesome. I think that movie would have been great with a stronger script. His visuals were awesome.   Ketchup   Everybody should just watch Slow West anyway.    You wouldn't try to adapt the fucking Mona Lisa into a movie.  Don't give them ideas.   Come on, the worst Marvel movies are only mediocre. Nothing as tragic as Green Lantern.   I'd rather see their Transformers or TMNT than Bay's bastardisation.   Would it? That's what they did for 50 years before The Dark Knight Returns and that's what they still do whenever Mark Waid or Grant Morrison writes the characters.   If he wasn't too old, that'd be perfect casting.   You're right, this isn't a dispute. The comics are worldwide - I'm a fan in Europe and I know of many fans in Asian countries where they are translated. The movies are about making money the most efficient way they can and diversity is one of them.  TL;DR - Comics are **global**, movies are about money, you should fact check.   So pretty much a different deck.   You're not really doing this, are you? Literally millions of people in China went to see Age of Ultron. Literally millions.    Cloak and Dagger appeared in like 2 issues of The Runaways. Replacing them with Doc Strange wouldn't make too big a difference.   I really don't want Nico without the rest of the Runaways, but Cho is awesome. You could plop him into most Phase 3 movies and he'd work. Imagine if he was one of Peter's classmates.   Lightsworn-Timelords? What's that?   Ever since AMC set up thousands of new cinemas in China.   Absolutely. It'd be the wrong decision. If we had to have an Asian hero, I was rooting for The Wasp as she's Asian in teh Ultimate Universe.   The aim of this deck is to to win via three methods.  A) Use a set of Photon Satellites to reach an absurdly high level and attack with the Calculator  B) Use Junk/Road Synchron in combination with the Photon Satellites to synchro summon high level monsters  C) Use the Photon Satellites to XYZ a range of monsters  D) Use Junk Warrior whilst the The Calculator is on the field with a really high attack  **Monsters [19]**  * Photon Thrasher *x2*  * Road Synchron * Shining Angel *x3* * Honest *x2* * Junk Synchron *x3* * Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter *x2* * The Calculator *x3* * Photon Satellite *x3*  **Spells [16]**  * One for One * Polymerization * Accellight *x2* * Machine Duplication *x2* * Upstart Goblin *x3* * Gold Sarcophagus * Inferno Reckless Summon *x3* * Photon Lead  **Traps [5]**  * Mirror Force *x2* * Call of the Haunted *x3*  **Extra Deck [15]**  * Twin Photon Lizard * Road Warrior * Stardust Dragon * Black Rose Dragon * Goyo Guardian * Frozen Fitzgerald * Junk Warrior * Ally of Justice Catastor * Underworld Fighter Balmung * Number 23: Lancelot, Ghost Knight of the Underworld * Constellar Pleiades * Number 50: Blackship of Corn * Evilswarm Exciton Knight * Grenosaurus * Wind-Up Zenmaines     Asians are a small, small minority.  1 in 19 Americans are of Asian descent. There are 16903324 Asian people in living in the USA.   There's no reason not to have both - unless you worry about to many people with a similar skillset - but I think it's unlikely they'd want to add another member to the Defenders this early on.   If I don't want to bone him then the casting is wrong.    Race is important to many, many people, but the writer wasn't using it as a case against Iron Fist, he was saying that Iron Fist better use mystical elements to justify choosing him over Shang-Chi. But, the MCU only has one Asian hero - why would one more hurt? I know it would certainly please a lot of people to have Shange-Chi.   Arr you flexible on the blue eyes?   From the director of Swingers comes The Edge of Tomorrow.    ITT: People mistaking the Thomas Jane Punisher for the first one.  Edit: to people saying that I'm ignoring the title. People are still referring to the 2000s movies as if they're the only ones. I know this thread is about those in particular, but this the posts in this thread make it very clear that not that many people are aware of the '89 film due to their phrasing, *not* because they're not mentioning the film.     Likewise.   Sorry - you're right. The superhero genre is extremely constrictive. Definitely check out Understanding Comics as it's really enlightening and has improved my understanding of cinema as well.   I honestly believe the *medium* - comics aren't a genre -  is one of the most complex there is and Watchmen only succeeds in that form. Check out Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics.  Personally, I think the only way the movie could have been more successful is if they changed the story to suit the form much better.     I'm a strong believer in, if someone has explained something better than you would, direct the person asking to the person with the answers.  So here are some links to points I generally agree with.  https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/377635/watchmen_underappreciated_a_victim_of/crkc0tt  https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/377635/watchmen_underappreciated_a_victim_of/crkg10m  https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/377635/watchmen_underappreciated_a_victim_of/crkeflu  https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2t7vbk/watchmen_look_at_the_bottom_computer_screen_they/cnwwiqt  https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/377635/watchmen_underappreciated_a_victim_of/crkg10m   I don't mind the movie (I think it's OK), but it's fundamentally a misunderstanding of the graphic novel.    Is Summer Wars better than The Girl Who Lept Through Time which is the only one of his folms I've seen and I wasn't too fond.    Is Summer Wars better than The Girl Who Lept Through Time which is the only one of his folms I've seen and I wasn't too fond.    I really like what Jason Aaron is doing right now, granted, I'm a big Aaron fan.   As a big fan of Daredevil and Punisher comics, I think I have a pretty good idea. Daredevil doesn't approve of Frank's methods. They clash as Daredevil tries to save someone from Frank. Frank and Daredevil team up to take down the big bad and Daredevil doesn't let Frank kill anyone.   Daredevil is fantastic, but I wasn't too fond of the last episode. It felt surprisingly superhero-y.   I'd say so. But also: Zodiac.   I expect all of Marvel's Netflix series will be grim 'n' gritty, but the ABC shows will stay relatively light (that said, MAOS' finale was somewhat grim). I imagine a few films may be darker, but they'll never get as dark as Daredevil. Doctor Strange and Black Panther have potential to be darker, but as did Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World.   Ehh. Not really a Snyder fan, but I didn't really mind Man of Steel. That said, I'm really looking forward to seeing Cyborg, Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Shazam! on the big screen. I know lots of people love him and that's fine, I just wish they didn't give Snyder so many movies as I don't really like his style. If Terrio can give his movies a tighter structure, then I should be good then, but I still don't care much for his action and I don't think he's very intelligent. Misunderstanding of Watchmen and Superman aside, I feel like he throws in symbolism, but doesn't really follow it through and it kind of bugs me. Was Supeman Jesus, the American Dream or humanity's last hope? I'm unsure because Synder kept telling me he was too many different things without telling me why. If a producer or a writer can help hold Snyder's hand through exploring his themes and ideas, that'll be great.  I just watched Gone Girl and I'm certain Affleck will make a great Bruce Wayne. Still unsure on Batman, but I'll stay open minded.   I'm a fan of the Marvel formula, but I'd really like them to try something different from here on out and Phase 3 seems to be promising that.   Gwyneth Paltrow's strength being dead in a box?   Try Greg Rucka's run. Best Punisher I've read not written by Ennis or Aaron.   Urgh. Civil War. Don't use that as an example of good characterisation.   BKV's Doctor Strange: The Oath  Bendis/Maleev on Daredevil  Christopher Priest on Black Panther   I'd only mind because Clark alreqdy has a love interest and I'd like to see them together for a few movies.   Preferably comics, but I'd happily read books as well. I'd prefer books that are good rather than ones that are just important plot-wise.   Really, really good. The art is phenomenal.   What did you think of his other two episodes from S5? Conquer and Remember?   Submersion? I believe that you mean immersion.  I - personally - don't think it affected immersion at all as they put the tribute right at the end of the movie as there was no story left to take you out of. But, different strokes, I guess.   I'm confused. I'm in the UK and I can purchase them. What's your problem?   Trust me, not many people here know that much about the industry.   Not a fan of the Walker tribute?   Preacher? I'm sure that's going to be a TV Series.   I'm expecting the eighth one to be called F8.   It's probably just an attempt to certify what happens in these comics matter. Not sure it does though.    Marvel could definitely do with a series akin to Star Wars Legacy or Knights of the Old Republic. I think they just wanted to take advantage of the almost completely clear chronology and add some stuff to the original trilogy. Still iffy on Han's wife, but otherwise the stuff they've added has been great and I'm especially looking forward to the Soule/Maleev Lando series. I think they should explore some other genres though. Imagine a neo-noir police procedural in the Star Wars universe written by Greg Rucka or a quirky romantic comedy about two gay Gungans who fall in love in a prejudiced society by Matt Fraction?   Dark Horse's Star Wars was great, but I'm loving Marvel's more.  Marvel's feel more like the movies and -generally- the art is better.   I consider this to be a much ignored chapter in Brubaker's Captain America run.   Probably a controversial opinion on this sub, but I'm not too big a fan of Dickerson as a I think his action is just too clumsy and Too Far Gone is one of the show's messier hours. His action is unclear and lacks any real weight. I think he tries to make it feel "real" and it suffers for it as it makes the show look like a bunch of middle aged guys flailing about rather than the unisex set of badasses Nicotero demonstrates. Maybe the former is more in keeping with The Walking Dead's tone, but it's not really fun to watch.   Straight forward? Did you not see What Happened and What's Going On? It's probably the single most pretentious and arty episode of the show and I love it.     Does it have influences from that genre? Sure. Does that mean anything? Not at all.   Shut-up ye mutie scum.   I really liked the second New Mutants book and the New X-Men that followed. Hellion, Rockslide, Pixie, Prodigy, Surge (what are you up to now Surge?), Wallflower, Icarus , X-23and Dust all stand out in my mind.   To Kill a Mockingbird changed my views on masculinity and racism and I think I'm a better person for that.   Seriously, every episode he directs is a vast improvement compared to the others. The action is cleaner and cooler, some shots are artier and he can use symbolism really well and he always gets really creative with blood and gore. If he directed a movie, I would be first in line to see it. Does anyone have any ideas for pre-existing properties that he would direct an adaption of well?    Also, Cyclops was right.  Eh. Cap was a dick and all, but I still can't condone everything Cyke has done. At least Cyclops was interesting.      I hope they give Scott something really interesting to do in the next modern movie. I'm loving the arc he's currently finishing in the comics and I'd love to see a cinematic take on that.   Jackman's Winter Soldier score is great, but I prefer his X-Men: First Class score. Sometimes I'll just blare Magneto out of my speakers really loud.   Look at 5 Centimetres Per Second    TIL   Vertigo TV. Not really sure I'd count it as the same thing as DC.   Agent Carter and Jake Chisel.   Brian Michael Bendis wrote Ultimate Spider-Man for 15 years. He's reknowned for having a love it or hate it, naturalistic style of dialogue that tends to bounce back and forth between characters in short sentences. Google some examples.   As long as it's in Bendis-speak.   I disagree. I believe it to be the episode before where Michael J Fox plays the doctor with OCD and everyone is jealous of him and then they realise he's more troubled than they are.   Giving people who have prime comics, is a good way to attract more people   The apps have improved greatly, but they could do with better smart panels for older comics, a higher resolution and two-page viewing.    The ending of The Usual Suspects    With Batman as a dad? No bloody way.  	116
 BAW GAHD THAT MAN HAD A FAMILY      AWESOME. Thanks.         Honestly think this is Mos' magnum opus (no rhyme intended).  The lyricism is out of control. And premonitory, especially for 1999.   Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a key,    A five minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free.    40% of Americans own a cell phone    so they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home.    I guess Michael Jackson was right, "You Are Not Alone".    Rock your hardhat black cuz you in the Terrordome,    Full of hard niggaz, large niggaz, dice tumblers    Young teens in prison greens facin life numbers,    Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients,    Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation.    This new math is whippin motherfuckers' ass    You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add  It's mathematics.    whiskey and coke or you are doing fat lines and drinking booze.  porque no los dos?   Yesssss. Good. Let the peasantry flow through you   pew pew  honestly though, I feel like this might be the one and only time I as a console gamer can feel just a litttttttle bit superior. I maybe game 4 hours a week normally. This weekend I had a booze fuelled coke fest with my buddies playing Batman and it's INCREDIBLE.   I dont remember that in Going Clear... at all...   I dunno, it's pretty disappointing he won't come out as gay. Everyone in Hollywood knows. It's no secret.   ... what?     "rage trance" isn't an excuse.  Sure, but a mental health condition might be. Or brain damage. Have you ever seen a video of a person acting like this? There's usually some logic to people's actions, at least fuzzy logic. This type of attack makes no sense.    That made me think it was more than just road rage. It's like he's coming out of a rage trance. The guy at the end of the video seemed to know him as well, and was treating him gently, like he's seen it before. I don't know if outright rage is symptom of any behavioral or psychological issues, but I wouldn't be surprised if this guy has had these kind of moments before. And that's not normal.   This is the best description I've ever read....... Spot. Fucking. On.   I feel the need to point out it's the Muslims that are violent towards UK soldiers.   Coincidentally, the man who led the gunpowder plot, Sir Henry Tucker, is my ancestor. If it wasn't for the Continental Congress going back on our deal to give you all our gunpowder in exchange for the lifting of a trade embargo, we'd be American today, instead of... *shudder*... British.      Non American chiming in here. Not only are Americans good hosts in America, they're good hosts outside of America as well. The British are awful when it comes to socialising. Americans (and Canadians) will be your best friend for the day just because you ordered their favourite beer. They'll strike up a conversation with you about golf because you wear a Calloway hat. I went to boarding school in the US and the number of friends I've made outside of America based solely on the school I went to is astounding.  You guys were my saving grace when I was living in England.   Give it a shot   Can't believe I've never seen this. Baw gahd chuckles were had.   Oh honey...   C'mon let's be real here. Wearing kilts? They're asking for it!   Even better that it's a 14 year old writing it.   WORLDSTAR   Bermuda checking in. We're the pimple on your tectonic ass   sauce?   A while back I upvoted my own comments on an alt to see if my total karma went up. I know. Bad, bad juju. Unidan etc. I was young and naive    Doesn't matter. Still fapped.   doot doot   Shit. There's no context. The thread was asking girls what was the most arbitrary reason they've ever chosen to have sex with a guy.      No, I dont like it because you presume your link to wikipedia completely nullifies the entire argument of the article. Which it doesn't.   Dammit. I was so ready to mount my high horse and pretend I wasn't the least bit worried when they rejected me back in my uni days.   No offense, but I feel like Bernie's endorsements is a game of "People That Don't Matter" Bingo.  Up next: Jonathan Lipnicki Endorses Sanders!   THe annoying part is that GallowBoob is actually a really good looking guy. He posted a pic of himself in his sub, IIRC. And this is coming from a man normally petty enough to denigrate other men sheerly for their better looks.   You're totally right. A simple link to wikipedia is far better than writing an intensely well researched article in the New Yorker, a known rag for shills and pansy liberals. A tip of the hat to you, good sir. You've bested Ms Lepore.    straddled with massive debt  I'd love to be straddled by anything at this point   Sounds like you're captaining the caboose into assumption junction.    ...  "Unattended babies can drown in bathtubs"  "That's hardly universal law...."   Try not using wikipedia.  http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-lost-amendment   Oh I dont bother with the comments. I have loads of other sources but I use it to make sure I don't miss anything big.   THere's a vast difference between the original and modern interpretation of the 2nd Amendment. It wasn't until a republican did a "history" on the amendment in the 50s/60s IIRC that people began interpreting it as "the right to have a gun". Up until then it was known as the Forgotten Amendment, because it was solely to do with the people's rights to "bear arms" against a tyrannical government.     Power does corrupt though. They've done studies.    did... did you just say meow?   Kinda like Shadow, Chance, and Sassy...  ^^^I'm ^^^sorry   Here's the thing...   I'm sure it's awesome sitting on a high horse demanding companies do what you say without paying them. You can't have ethics in journalism when your primary customer is advertisers. As I said in another comment, I run a tiny regional magazine and I've had advertising pulled for writing a bad review, putting me in the red for the quarter. What do you propose I do? Keep writing bad reviews until my company files for bankruptcy?    I'm a journalist and I keep tabs open on rising submissions in /r/worldnews and other news subs. So technically Redditing IS working.   /r/retiredgif    Finding it hard to breathe up there on your high horse? I don't disagree but fucking hell you have to love yourself to quote yourself. Get a life.   More talking about the whole of KiA. I've posted here before trying to explain this, but nobody wants to listen.   Gaming journalism is probably bottom rung on the ladder of importance for the Guardian or TIME. They're far more concerned with making money so that they can insure their journalists in war zones, buy new equipment, offer competitive salaries for new hires etc. Clickbait pays for that by pageviews, upping the value of advertising on their site.  That could EASILY be done away with if people started paying for news on the internet like they do for newspapers. But people don't want to pay.  I run my own magazine. I've written bad reviews of restaurants and had them pull their advertising, putting me in the red for the quarter. Trust me, nobody likes doing it, but it's the only way to survive right now.  I wish people understood that instead of getting on their high horses and braying about stuff they aren't remotely familiar with.    They aren't selling shit. You're the ones that demand FREE content. If the internet was willing to pay for news, there might be reason to uphold ethics in the name of journalism. Unfortunately, many have to scrape to survive, in which case appeasing advertisers becomes the primary objective.   HA! That's my uncle's name. And his nickname is Mad Dog!

Without IV's, should be interesting to see if he can even get hydrated before the fight in the first place   BINGO NAME-O   I mean, Reddit DID do it. You can't pretend the shitparade over Pao had nothing to do with her resignation.    What it looks like is the whole of reddit was moving toward something Victoria was not comfortable with, if rumors are to be believed. Pao as the face would naturally take the heat, but there's nothing to suggest it was her decision alone to move Reddit in whatever direction it was that Victoria disagreed with   "resignation" could very well mean "dethroned by the board"   Shit. I swear I knew that. For some reason I was thinking he and Hulkenberg were the same person... God knows why   Wait. Is there talk of Magnusson not staying in F1?   People get pissed because I admit to speeding on a motorcycle, gettings lots of tickets etc. I may not obey the rules of the road to a tee, but I'm 1000x more aware of what I'm doing than a teenage girl going 10mph below the speed limit listening to James Blunt in the AC and texting her friends.   My godmother is in charge of putting together the Vanity Fair Oscar parties every year. I've been 3 times. That's her. Nothing fake about it. You're probably just a bit peeved such a beautiful, talented woman actually happens to act like a regular person.       I am suffering serious cuddle withdrawal after breaking up with my gf. So yes. Yes, cuddles are needed.   It still takes a shitload of work to develop a compelling story from Campbell's work, but I'm not sure I'm ready to believe it was Lucas alone who developed it. I was a script reader with BBC and I saw plenty of great monomyth structured stories that were trashed for their ambition alone. Core concepts were good, great even, but had such a large scope it wouldn't be financially viable, even with the Lotto money GBR uses to fund British film.    :(   I've never heard anyone echo my feelings about HD vanilla so perfectly. Come to my bed. Bring HD vanilla and famous amos cookies.   That's because Lee has fencing training.   He's not a mastermind. He just read Hero of a Thousand Faces. Star Wars follows Campbell's monomyth to a tee.   A continuous tab, I mean.    They still let people have bar tabs? Only place I get a tab is the fucking coffee shop   banned  EDIT: OH I'M SORRY I THOUGHT WE DID MEMES HERE   I feel like this needs to be said A LOT MORE OFTEN   In Russia, you dont make the memes.

This is 1000000x worse without the YIPSKIDDLEDOOOO and the terrified kid yelling at his wasted dad    We live in (at least in the West) a society where any time a man does something against a woman it is given far too much attention... it helps to show that both genders are equally capable of doing horrible things and that it isn't just men doing it.  Any rational person knows this. MensRights is more than welcome to have that end of the market about male issues. I, and many others, don't need constant reminding that people can be cunts regardless of gender.   When new people come to the sub, they tend to vent a lot because they're not used to having a place to talk about the things they experience.  For this exact reason, the sub has done more harm than good, as that venting has evolved into a weird conspiracy that feminism is actively trying to suppress male issues and vice versa. The reactionary women-bashing by some has become a trademark, not just on reddit, but in the media as well. One can vent without perpetuating the idea that men concerned with male issues are diametrically opposed to female issues.   they're talking about the double-standard that an athlete is going through because he was assaulted and had the audacity to hit a woman back after she kicked and punched him  Again, another thing I believe does more harm than good. "Equal rights and equal lefts" is massively popular. I think the manly thing to do when a (presumably weaker) woman assaults you is to restrain her instead of punching her.    I have! Last I checked I had a top 10 post on there hahaha. I feel, though, there's less focus on issues that affect men, and more focus on man stuff. Which is great, obviously.   Unfortunately I feel a distinct separation from that sub these days. When I first got on Reddit it was awesome, but it's become associated with values I actively dislike. The top posts usually have something to do with injustices perpetrated by women against men, and I just don't feel those are the things that deserve much attention.  I love women. I love feminists. Not the kind that go to Tumblr to conduct their slacktivism, but women who break gender stereotypes or devote their careers to causes beyond teaching "Women's Studies". One of my best friends, a volunteer abortion clinic defender, hates that stuff as much as I do.   I want a place that recognizes the difference between working to better their respective gender, and a place that bitches about the problems affecting their gender. I'm not sure /r/mensrights qualifies at this point. Two years ago it certainly did. Notsomuch these days.  EDIT: literally just checked /r/all and there's a top post from /r/mensrights about how female models make more than male models. EXACTLY what I'm talking about.    Cheers brother! And thanks for being the first to post. Hopefully we can help this sub grow and find like-minded redditors.    hahaha cheers.  "KNIGHTS OF BROHIRRAM, MOUNT UP!" was my battle cry whenever I had nights out with the boys. Seemed only natural.   Unfortunately I don't have friends like that. I have plenty of guy friends, just none I feel comfortable discussing my issues with. Not that I mind, but I get called a faggot just by having a glass of wine. We're brutal to each other, which is fun at the right time, but doesn't exactly foster a trusting environment.    I really like this sub. It's just only for asking questions. You can't post content here.  	105
 At this point in the election cycle, some people are delusional enough (and fueled by media over-coverage) to believe that Mike Huckabee and Donald Trump actually have a chance also.    Very nice. Is there any way to send an order of spanikopita to my 3D printer?   It will come and I look forward to using it. But these things have a LOT of bugs to work out, as complex systems like NXT and BitShares have shown. I give Ethereum years, not months, until there's a functional system that's fully tested and attractive to outsiders.    Peeling back those allium layers.   More like telegraphs.   Thereby removing their DNA from the human gene pool.    We're slowly taking them over, though. Organic food, an influx of immigrants, pot farms, same-sex relationships on TV...The South is changing fast. Just give us a few years, or decades.    Madison Bumgarner almost allowed a cycle's worth of hits today before recording an out.    And so his DNA was voluntarily removed from the human gene pool.    Heads up, Toledo. Here come the Hut.    Exactly what I was going to write. Perfectly said.   The bat flip is one thing. Standing at home and staring at your hit for that long would make you some enemies in MLB.       Pablo will whack at anything. He puts a lot of bad pitches in play and a surprising number of them end up as hits.      Ah, volunteers for the one-way mission to colonize Mars...   I read a CNN article last year about someone creating a 3D-printed pizza. I think they extrude the batter, cook it, and squeeze on some sauce and cheese, etc. If we can send encrypted 3D pizzas to one another, then who needs cash?   Peertracks   Scott Walker has the Kochs backing him, so he won't go away that easily. Rubio, I think, is overrated in terms of his mass appeal; FL voters seem to prefer Bush.    Wow, this is quite a testament (from the press release):  Some of the biggest digital currency exchanges have been hacked and the rest are looking over their shoulders says Banx Capital CEO and Founder Mark Lyford. BitShares is offering their SmartChain as a safe, level playing field for use by the whole industry. It can serve as backbone network to all the exchanges as a way for them to trade with and against each other. With shared order books we will have deeper markets, tighter spreads, and greater liquidity. And since our customers keep their own keys while trading on this network, combined with hierarchical multi-sig capabilities  we cant get hacked, and our customers cant get hacked.   Fascinating, but how do you see a trend over time? I see a snapshot, but that doesn't tell me there's been any increase, decrease, etc., if I am not familiar with previous numbers.    And plenty of waves, if anyone can commercialize that energy without environmental consequences.    Hacked?   This story has a certain aroma to it, rather like the whiff one gets driving through Vidalia or Walla Walla country at a certain time of year.    Bob Dole was quoted as saying the same thing a couple of years ago: that Nixon and Reagan wouldn't have a chance in today's party.    Looking at Venditte's minor league splits, it's pretty clear he's been lights-out against lefties and so-so against righties and switch-hitters. It will be fun to watch him, but my guess is he'll mostly be used as a lefty specialist for now.       Great news! Could be a game changer.   If you live in Texas, please do not vote for this jerk again.          This is starting to remind me of the gubernatorial recall election in California in 2003 when 135 candidates appeared on the ballot. There can't be too many more potential second-tier candidates in the Republican Party; they're all running for president already. At this rate, someone's going to win a primary with a single digit percentage of the vote.    They didn't pay him the big money for nothing.   Summers has been on the board of the Lending Club, so he knows firsthand that there is money in P2P.    More Americans probably want Bernie Williams to be president than those clowns.    Exactly right. This is not some tribal dude, but a lawyer who probably has never touched a goat or a cow. He is in it for the publicity.    Nomar was one heck of a pinch hitter when he was in LA.    Even if he's just pandering, this makes him evil.    Beautiful. Although there are some stretches of Big Sur where you definitely don't want to "drive off" the road!   I'm just having fun with you. Always appreciate your hard work work in promoting and explaining the possibilities in the crypto world.    Have you gone centralized on us, Adam? What happened to Dogeparty?     	42
       It is about saving rich people's money. $10.82 is not seriously a lot of money and is around what the minimum wage should be in the OC ($11.00).                                                   THe Goat Hill Tavern especially during Founders HOurs.                                    Please get out of the race O'Malley.  This race should between Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  You are not wanted.  Ms. Clinton and Mr. Sanders should have serious policy debates that will help the Democrat party in 2016.                                                I want to become a hike leader for the Sierra Club, but I need get my CPR/FIrst Aid certification.  Where is the cheapest place in the OC for getting certified?                                       I have a roommate who works for company that specializes in resolving traffic tickets.  You can call him at (626) 280-3300 for a consultation.  Sorry, for the advertising, but if you want some paid representation, he is more than willing to help you.            I have the hardest time with sitting down to watch a TV show especially when it does not interest.  I can sit down and watch an espisode of GOT fine, but I struggle to watch reruns a lot of other shows.  I also live in at house where there is one TV and I have to be especially sensitive of other people's TV needs.  I usually spend my time on the computer where i can surf website to website and look at what interests me.  However, I believe that it aggravates my ADHD even more. I do not struggle with problem at work where I have lazer sharp focus and can do my jobs for hours on end even it is especially repetive.  Yet, trying to watch a TV show to be a difficult ordeal and I just cannot sit down and watch a TV show until its conclusions unless it is GOT where I force myself to watch the entire episode.  And I never watch movies because I know that I cannot stay still because I am on the computer the entire time.  Do people with ADHD struggle with same struggles that I do and just avoid TV   Yes, I have a huge issue with it especially if there is a lot of people interacting in a very small space.      Self-awarness  is the best tool to deal with it.   I do it a lot but not in front of others. I do ir especially if I have to walk far more than five minutes                      People should learn not to trust the GOP unless they explicitly and genuinely believe that what is right for business is the right for the country.   The GOP has no interest in workers rights.                                            The federal government should pass the minimum wage based on cost of living. That means the minimum wage would be lower in red states and higher in blue states. Locality-based minimum wages have a higher chance of passing the GOP Congress than a universial minimum wage.                        Crisco. It is my Burning Man nickname    2L of Mountain Dew and Pepsi.   lSd               This is what happens when (i) you vote for Conservative and (ii) Labor fails to brand itself different than Conservative-lite.  Labor needs to be the party that stands up for preservation of social welfare because the government serves as an internal control against the excesses and failures of the capitalist system.   While there is better ways probably to root them out, I still prefer the military option right now.  Any type of rebuilding projects that involve US contractors would be mired in corruption so it is not our job to rebuild Iraq based on our horrific record with monitor and tracking outside contractors responsible for the jobs.      Does alcohol causes a majority of rich men have unmanageable relationships that tear part of relationships, businesses, and families.  Just because you are wealthy does not mean you escape alcoholism.    A real alcoholic .  Recovery literature defines alcoholic as " Our whole life and thinking was centered in alcohol in one form or anotherthe drinking and finding ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used to live. Very simply, an alcoholic is a man or woman whose life is controlled by alcohol We are people in the grip of a continuing and progressive illness whose ends are always the same: jails, institutions, and death. "   The question are they real alcoholics.       I guess the sheeple got their leader.   Move with roommates where everybody has to share one TV. That is my problem. So I barely watch any TV.            The only real way is get money out of money out of politics and go to proporational representation system like other European country.  But that still might not get the result that you like               Than it is time to starting throw CEOs in jails.   This is the Achilles heel of Republican budgeting and why the Laffer curve never worked properly.                  Go down to the local courthouse and ask for your court records.  Show the courts records to the employer            However, one huge difference between Bernie and Obama campaigns in the 2008 campaign is that the Bernie's race and gender will neutralize the Obama racism that happened during the 2008 campaign.  However, the Republicanism will use the socialist death label to death and use Sander's anti-interventionist to drum up that Sanders will bring the terrorist back.  Unlike Hillary, the GOP could not resort to the personal character attacks aganist Bernie that they can use aganist Hillary Clinton all of the time.    In some ways, Bernie would be attacked on policy stances and would not be attacked on race, gender, and personal character attacks that Obama or Hillary faced.   Yeah, but what about financial stablity. Financial stablity is defined as "Just because your business is making money doesnt mean its stable. Stability is the ability to withstand a temporary problem, such as a decrease in sales, lack of capital or loss of a key employee or customer. Analyzing your cash flow and a variety of negative scenarios will help you determine whether or not your business is financially stable."  That is very important.  No profits = no jobs.  We are not going to be in socialist utopia any time soon and lot of Americans will not accept it. I prefer socialism but I am also a pragmatic realist that understands that capitalism will be the system of the US for a long time.   The military should destory its excessive equipment because the mission of the police force is not urban pacification but to protect the citizens against violent offenders. I see no active restraint in doing this.      Wasteful spending at its worst.  Money is better spent on NASA, social programs.   Why would anybody celebrate cops dying in the line of duty?  This is time of mourning not rejoicing.            And replace with what? Small city-based police forces. Look, at Bell for example.  Compton is another example of medium city police force that needs to be disbanded.   What is so bad about that? He killed 3,000 people and so he deserved to die even though 09/11 was an excuse by the neoconservatives to inflict war upon states that did not do anything to the US.   ISIS would have to couple of those planes.   Of course, Rick Scott wants to appease the tea party than deal with the future of his state.  He is a such dumb governor.         The problem about Labor is that it did not properly branding.  Branding is "your promise to your customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products and services, and it differentiates your offering from your competitors".  Labor did not promise any real change or any difference than the conservative problem.  Also, the Conservatives feed into the white's view of xenophobia and will make "Fortress England". Also, a lot of white people in general that I know support the business agenda because they in some day that they will benefit from the system that primary favors the rich instead of realizing the system in the long run is unsustainable and needs to replace with something else.  Therefore, in some ways, the proletarians are the dumb ones themselves because they favor the burgerious agenda.  But P.T Barnum once wrote "There is a sucker born in every minute".   Again, there is little detail in mechanics of TPP and how it works. Lengthy articles in the NY Times and serious discussion on Bloomberg and CNBC that discuss the mechanics of TPP would bring the agreement into the daylight.  I think corporate elites are too paranoid and too dishonest these days to face the sunlight, but in reality, the sunlight would expose the flaws and the strengths of TPP.     The whole NC legislator is dysfunctional bunch of misfits who answer to corporatist lobbyist and have no idea to how to properly state. I state that the whole legislature should be recalled.   Kids today have no manners.   Until the details of the treaty are made public and allowed for public scrutiny, I cannot support this law.      Loved that movie.      Obama is listening to the investment bankers and not you, the average citizen.                           So is the private sector any better?                      Just curious      I have an interview with the State next week in Van Nuys and I increasily becoming frustrated that I had not one single offer of employment with the state despite having twenty plus interviews with them.  Some of them I can unprepared but a number of them is where I ex  I just want to nail this one interview and get it done.  The only problem is that I am a (LEAP) candidate which is the program for the state to hire disabled employees even though I qualify for the position on pure experience alone.  I just want some links to a Youtube video or some other resources to assist me. I have in a formal vocational training program right now so I have an instructor that can help, but we just need to find the right resources so he has more information to help me. (Note: I am mainly applying to Office Technician positions).            I am very interested in getting involved with Bernie Sanders campaign and helping the campaign get started in Orange County. I do not have time to donate my time to the national campaign, but I can donate significant time during evenings and especially weekends to the campaign.  Does anybody know about the campaign starting here.  I do know there is a litany of progressive organizations that are in the county which I am not involved with, but any campaign involving Bernie Sanders would require extensive coordination with these groups because they prefer their input into any how the county-wide operations is ran.          Well, then all of the cities who want to raise the minimum wages have a point.                                 Time for war crime trails at the Hague.     	194
 Stone, first man to lose hand from slash and regrow it shortly after to continue playing and throw some punches at the end.   His passive proc will help him out. Shield based on Max mana and increased burst to spells.  Makes playing Ryze more of a timing game and less of a spam all the buttons one.   *in the black   Of*   The sound track though!   When you understand probabilities you will be less frustrated. Example: If you have a steal rate of 5% for a particular item, thats a 1 in 20 chance  (not great but not terrible), the issue arises when you fail to consider that consecutive steal attempts do not increase the odds of getting the item. Every attempt is still only 5%, it's a common phalicy to believe independent events alter probabilities. So my advice...be patient.  	6
 That OJ chase was a really big deal. Kind of made the white bronco legendary like the Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am, KITT, or the General Lee.   I hear they may be. Saw a prototype doing the auto show rounds over the winter.   Yes, but you generally use lower compression pistons in a supercharged or turbocharged application.   LOL maybe, but they built the short block rather stout from the get go. 1000+ HP has already happened on stock internals.         Gotta be Cru Jones. Winning at Hell Track really changed him...   Clarification: The optional F2 ProCharger head unit is capable of supporting 1600HP. Not sure if the internals are rated to handle 1600HP BUT it is a low compression, all forged rotating assembly from the factory.        	10
 I'd start with Novare Res: Crab Rangoon grilled cheese and over 500 beers.   The Great Lost Bear has a good beer selection but food is hit or miss. Its also next door to Maine Brewing Supply if you like to homebrew.   Kings Head has an awesome draft selection. Only time I've ever seen Allagash Dubble on draft.  Also, and most importantly, go to the Allagash brewery! They do free flights and often include beers you *can only get there*. Their house beer is pretty good! All you have to do is walk in and show them your ID. Good deals on bottles there too.    Disclaimer: I only practice MSR and have no experience in other ryu-ha.   I saw the other video on that you mentioned r/koryu. I'm impressed by his dexterity and agility but to be honest his posture feels wrong *to me*. He leans forward a lot which is more evident in the other video. That said I know nothing about this ryu-ha so can't speak to why he maintains that posture (which is probably correct in their practice!). Its always interesting to see the nuances of each school. Thanks for the vid! It was a good watch   All I'm seeing is Warcraft 2 terrain tiles. Zug zug.   I'm on to you Harold Camping...   Mainer here... Though I completely disagree with LePage about everything on a deeply fundamental level, I have to admit that he is nothing if not blunt and honest. I do appreciate the fact that he tells it like it is regarding his *political* intentions and beliefs (Again, I could not agree with the man any less about any thing). However, in any other regard: To steal from Lewis Black "He says things that he should think and shut his fucking mouth"   Can confirm; am scientist. I wish this point would be made more frequently and to a larger audience than those who are irritated enough by Michael Moore to read through these comments. Let me go to my lab and grab you an up-vote!   Beautifully done film. Certainly worth checking out. A bit more of a dramatic take on the samurai genera.         In response to the shooting the state building lowered the American flag to half-mast but left the Confederate flag flying at full-mast. They  said it was because the flag can only either be up or down and the 'flag pole' was not designed to fly half-mast.   TLDR; White supremacist shoots up black church. State lowers US flag to half mast but leaves confederate flag at full mast. State refuses to remove flag and says its a 'conversation for another time'. People *finally* start to realize what the confederate flag stood for and go WAY too far trying in to not look racist (like removing Civil War apps).   Wow... I somehow didn't make the connection between the book cover and the house.  Regarding the band - That was one instance where I felt that there was some sort of dissociative identity among the narrators. Zampano created his entire thesis and Truant created details of his life; why not create the band as well. At least then he wouldn't be alone in his insanity and it seems that loneliness is part of what's making his anxiety worse (per his anecdote about his doctor friends). Also, the parallels between Truants childhood and Navidsons are very similar. The mom who left to become an actress, there were a lot of reflections in Tom from Lude, etc. Unfortunately it's impossible to know what is real with Truants narrative.   I think that you hit the nail on the head and made another connection I have not - The book was intended to use our own discomfort and insecurities to pull us in and change shape depending on who is 'in' it... just like the house... Damnit I fell for it!   *spoilers ahead* I just finished house of leaves; it was an awesome read and insidiously creepy. I did notice one thing... there were too many parallels between truant and zampano and I honestly got the feeling that either there was no truant or that there was no zampano. I feel that they're the same person. Truant confabulated  frequently; he openly admits this often but we don't know unless he tells us. It also seems zampano made up the Navidson Record... I feel they're the same person. Hell, maybe its all Truants mother!   Thoughts?   Your dad looks like Liam Neeson. I feel bad for the barber who took his hair...    Irreversible. The ending threw me into a three day existential crises. The ending is more depressing than all of Requiem for a Dream   For good kisses call 867-5309   Edward Norton as Deryk Vineyard. Not one person could have done it better. Michael Chiklis could maybe have come close at best.   Too real... Too soon...    Went to college with a girl named Novette. Her dad sold his corvette when he found out they were pregnant   Regardless of what OPF has become I think people like you are one of the high points - having fun while realizing someone has to clean up the mess and not being a jerk. In all seriousness, thanks!   I have to agree with u/mydogcecil. Its like most of the local vendors and artists bailed and all of the OOB bullshit came in. I saw a lot of 'local artists' selling literally the exact same items at several tents; even when it wasn't the standard tourist trap items (fake sea glass, mass produced pepper grinders and cutting boards, etc). That being said I DO hope that it brought some business to the local spots but sadly I'm sure that Starbucks sold enough frozen coffee mochafucklatachinos  yesterday to open a fourth Old Port location. In my humble opinion it feels like Old Port Fest became more about bringing in out if town cash for minimal overhead than showcasing what the city is all about. This months artwalk would have been the perfect OPF (real Portland restarants and food trucks, legitimate Portland artists selling crafts they actually made, local musicians, etc) This weekend just felt like a walk through OOB and it really bummed me out.  	20
    Thanks! I tried looking online for this and couldn't find any answers. Probably wasn't wording it right, but I knew I could rely on r/drugs   Hey all, just a quick question on mushroom cultivation! If I were growing psilocybin mushrooms, had the cakes in the terrariums, and mature mushrooms, how would I actually pick them? Just yank em out of the cake? Or pinch it so there's a little of the stem left?   "decapitated by a flying fish" fuck you Terraria    The solo in Time is definitely one of my favorites of theirs    Heh I realized I should've clarified that it was for her dog, just too lazy to edit   One of my relatives uses a thunder shirt for when it's storming or during long car rides. Works incredibly well.    I have obe's often with dxm. I just get really comfortable and wrapped up on blankets and then lay back and close my eyes. Usually works.    Oh they knew it was a rip tide. That's why the jet ski guy pulled up and said to swim to the left. Also, when I got to shore, that guy told me how to swim if I'm stuck in a rip tide. I honestly don't understand why they wouldn't at least try helping me back to shore. I realize I was still swimming, but I was exerting every drop of energy I had. If I didn't reach walking depth when I did, I have no doubt that I would've just given up and accepted my fate.    Exactly what I thought once I made it back. I was clearly struggling out there. Even if he just moved out of the way of the wave, why would he not come back?    Right!? Even the one on the life guard chair didn't help me because it looked like I was still swimming fine. In reality, I had accepted my death as soon as I saw the giant wave.    So I visited the ocean for the first time ever today. My friend and I were having fun getting smacked by waves and whatnot, but were slowly going out further and further. At one point I see him further out than me, and to the left, so I started swimming that way. Since the waves were pretty big I couldn't really see him on my way over. Next thing I know I'm way far from shore, and the waves are getting pretty big. Little did I know, I was stuck in the rip tide. At this point my friend had already started heading back because the life guard was whistling, which I hadn't noticed.  So now I'm way out there, being pushed back more with every wave. I was swimming as hard as I could, but making no progress. Finally a life guard comes by on a jet ski and tells me to swim left. Well I look ahead of me to see how far I was and then I hear him zoom away. Upon turning around I see a giant wave headed right at me. Well that shit took me way up in the air, and then way down in the water.  Luckily I managed to surface, and swam harder than ever to get back. When my arms weren't doing the trick themselves, I started kicking off really hard with every stroke. Finally I get back to standing depth, but I was too tired to even walk. I just let the incoming waves knock me closer and closer. When I reached the shore itself, the lifeguard was standing maybe twenty feet away telling me to go over to him. Took one step and almost collapsed because my legs were like jelly from kicking off so hard.   After that, I layed in the sand for what seemed like an hour catching my breath. I have never felt to hopeless in my life, or so tired. I was honestly on the verge of giving up out there because it was so tiring trying to swim against the waves. Of course, when I got back my friend told me that the first thing the lifeguard asked him was if I was drunk.   Tl;Dr first trip to the ocean results in me almost drowning. Legs turned to jelly, and my mouth was salty.      Well I woke up with insane munchies, and I don't really remember much of how the end of my night went. I do remember watching some movie about airplanes. All in all, a good night   Well let me say, this is fucking great. As soon as the first one hit me was I getting great colors with my eyes closed. So, as any logical person would, I took two more an hour later. Wish me luck, I'm going in.   Luckily I was solo for this ride, but I can't even imagine trying to hide some that obvious   What's the point of tripping if I'm not allowed to  cut off a few heads?   That pretty much sums up how my trip went. Good to know own there are other trip trippers around.    I'm still in motion, but so far so good. Already peaked unfortunately.    I'm having fun on the road, and you should definitely tell us about your court story!    Yeah I always skip her too. She makes me uncomfortable.    After taking it as much as I have in the past, I don't even feel high below 500mgs. So this is a pretty average dose for me. And I've only gotten sick once or twice from it, and that was back when I first started doing it so I'm not too worried.    I've done it in worse places, and I'm pretty sure this won't be too bad. I'm just going to be sitting in the ac listening to music, so I'm not too worried. If I hadn't done this stuff so many times I wouldn't even consider doing it where I am today haha   Hey there fellow drug users. Well long story short, I have a 25 hour bud ride ahead of me, so I figured why not take some dxm to make the ride a little more fun. Just finished taking the 720mgs, and my bus should be here in about an hour. I'll be updating this as the high progresses!  Edit 1: just for clarity, I'm more than experienced with ole dexter, so the dose is enough for a good third plat. I typically don't vomit on it, but just in case I took it about an hour before the bus, because that should give me a chance to gauge where nausea will be. My plans as of now are to listen to a few albums of floyd or the dead, and when the peak begins I'm going to watch the move "Woodstock: three days of peace and music"  as its filled with great music.   Edit 2: well my phone died before we even left the first state, and my peak arrived as I was switching busses somewhere. Now I'm just tired and  bored.   	24
 This made me giggle! I love it! Beautiful pup!   He probably only has to fill it once a year.   We've seen them in some really random places, but this one just blew me away.       They are such wonderful, intelligent, and loving dogs. I fell in love with him the moment I saw him. He was the runt. The discount puppy (free because they were going to put him down), and I can't imagine his litter mates turning out any bigger or more beautiful than him. He's quite an amazing pup!   I plan on it! He's just gorgeous!   Thank you so much!   He's a German shorthaired pointer.   This was taken in Utah.   Utah   Thank you!   Utah, his first road trip out of Oklahoma.   Thank you! He's a tough one to photograph. He will never stay still long enough!         You have to quarantine them in your home for 180 days or in a quarantine facility in Japan after arriving, if the 180 days are not up, to ensure they are free of rabies.   Okinawa.   Hahaha! That's awesome! Such a pretty kitty!!   We moved to Japan and he became severely matted during the transport.   This is by far the best I've seen! I love love love it!!! Thank you!!!!   Yes, my husband is.   It's really amazing! The food is to die for, the beaches are breathtaking. The people are sooo polite. I'm really loving it.   He is a Maine coon... Very long haired.   We just moved to Okinawa, Japan. There isn't really a winter...   I'm not sure if he knows or not. My other cat keeps hissing at him and they are best friends of 3.5 years. He had a beautiful coat before. I will let it grow back out.  	25

I guess we could argue this all day,and truthfully, I wouldn't kick her out of my own bed for eating crackers, but seeing her in any movie immediately ruins it for me.   If her acting were better I wouldn't be forced to notice her looks.   If Emma Watson had a pointy chin and could only open her eyes halfway.    Kristen Stewart - I cannot find her even remotely attractive in any role, but especially the pasty chick in the Twilight series.   I've asked several times for sources on that subreddit and I'm either ignored or directed to the individual's blog where I'll also find no sources or citations. Additionally, they'll cite wikapedia, which is a good starting point for sources relating to a topic, but I don't trust the website for consistent accuracy.   r/askhistorians - The crap they post there for answers to historical events/people make working historians cringe, plus if you ask for citations or where they got their information, it's treated like you've made a personal attack. If a citation is provided it's usually from a history channel show, which is a whole new level of crappage.    I worked at a restaurant in the Omni Hotel, San Diego, that was owned by a guy who donated so much to the George W. Bush campaign he was rewarded with the ambassodorship to New Zealand. Meanwhile, waiters/waitresses at his restaurant were forced by management to participate in a "fake-a-break" program. Employees that worked more than six hours were forced to choose between working through a thirty minuted break or taking that break during the busy period and losing out on tips. If anyone spoke out about the "fake-a-break" program, they were harassed by management. While stealing hours from his employees, the restaurant owner enjoyed a fat government paycheck with perks.

       that is awesome    Read the Post Before You Reply       that was my thought as well. I just want the team to stay around, moving to MLS ensures that whereas the needless competition with another soccer team in the cities would most likely dissolve the team.

I don't think enough people give expansion into the Southwest proper shrift. El Paso, Albuquerque,   Tucson would be nice fits.    I think Calgary should be a priority in Canada over Hamilton (though I like the idea of Hamilton). And Omaha would be a great bridge city too    West coast proper it would have to be San Francisco or Sacramento, San Diego, and even though it's a sad city Fresno.      yeah, more than understandable   after traveling to watch the Loons in Indy, my wife is seriously considering taking off to see them against St. Louis. it's a 4 hr drive for us from Kansas. be nice to see other Dark Clouds                                                                  I just finished a Goodreads giveaway, but I'm continuing to offer a deal.

I really just suggested rice as an afterthought for others. Maybe couscous instead? I skipped the rice for my plate      good ideas all, but I like my peanut sauce thick so it works for me   all good ideas, thx for sharing them with me. I'm still a noob when it comes to cooking so a lot of my stuff is trial   error.   [Sriracha Peanut Chicken](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/foodisphere-sriracha-peanut-sauce-chicken/)     Peanut sauce was relatively easy to do consisting of only three ingredients:   1 cup Natural Peanut Butter   1 tablespoon sriracha   Quarter cup coconut oil   Add all three into a pan, stir on low for about fifteen minutes or until smooth. Set aside.  Sriracha Peanut Chicken    Ingredients:   1 cup of natural peanut butter   1-2 teaspoons of red curry paste   quarter cup of coconut oil   1 tablespoon sriracha (or to taste)   1 pound of chicken breast tenders/chicken breast cut into cubes   Directions:   Heat your pan on low. Add coconut oil and red curry paste and stir until mixed. Add peanut butter in stages and stir. You might want to increase the heat slightly (depending on your stove) but I wouldnt go much over the low setting which should be enough to make the sauce creamy. Once smooth and creamy, add the chicken cubes. Stir the chicken in the sauce to make sure its as covered as possible. Cover the pan and let the chicken cook. Check on it occasionally and stir so that the sauce doesnt burn to the pan. I also added about a half cup of water once the sauce started to thicken around the chicken just to keep it relatively smooth rather than gloppy.    Cook for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Serve on rice with the peanut sauce.

Asking the questions was less about quality and more about just how am I (if I am) crafting an inclusive work.  To your second point, you're right. When I originally thought of the story I wanted to have my 'hero' be trans but then I realized I wasn't knowledgeable enough to write a convincing character. Still hoping to in the future.                                                 thanks for this information, looks like a good site. unfortunately, $300 is well too far out of my price range   good idea, I just may. thank you   I think a team in Hartford would be great.

Whatever. I get it. I don't agree, but I get it. But I don't think I make enough to afford a real artist to create a cover. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to find or query artists?

 Thank you!   I'd prefer if the bits where they are themselves was live action filmed during the game.    Just a little short film. It will be on my portfolio to get into college. I've done skits and stuff before but this is my first time working on something serious with other people acting in it.    I'm shooting my first short film today and currently getting ready for the actors coming over. I'm pretty nervous and very excited.       That's the excuse they use for the comics, I don't know if it's been mentioned in the TV show. But in the comic universe they've said the Zombie mythology was never a thing.    It's amazing how different Spaced is about Star Wars between the first and second season. Mostly because Phantom Menace came out between the two.  Also the voice of Darth Maul is featured in both.    Thanks. Looking forward to it!   I think it helps that they're playing characters.    Where's the face OP?   Looking forward to it.   Yes! Thank you so much. That's perfect. I'll make a post here when it's done, and I'll send everyone who was in it PM's is well.   Yeah on WTF, I think, Rob was talking about how he doesn't really consider himself and actor and see's himself being a writer or a director after Sunny.   Thanks!   I have a few friends who have never seen Star Wars and I've recorded them telling me the plot of the movie from what they've heard in pop culture. I'm going to edit it into a big supercut to try and create a story that resembles some amount of sense, and I'll probably animate some of it.  However I need more clips to make it the way I want. So you haven't seen Star Wars, have a spare five minutes and half a camera/webcam/camera phone could you please record yourself describing what you believe the plot of Star Wars is beginning to end?  Then just pop it onto youtube and post it on here or PM me. Obviously if you do those things I'm assuming you don't mind the footage being put into the final project (Which will just be put onto youtube.)  I believe this has been done before but just with one person, plus this is just a little Summer project for me.    I'm also from Ireland and was very confused while reading this thread.   Someone actually sort of did this. They watched every movie referenced in season one.   I need all of the spoilers.   I really, really loved the last scene in this with the homeless people.   It's been just as long as last time.   Sky are normally pretty good at airing things close to it's original airing so I'm very happy about this. It'll fit nicely there.   Oh shit. This loop really could go on forever.   While were on the topic of CBB crossover universes. The comedy bang bang tv show and the movie "The Interview" have a big connection in that Ben Shcwartz plays an agent in both, but is only named in CBB. So in my head canon it's the exact same character.    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/trivia?tab=mc ref_=tt_trv_cnn  This is going to be tougher than I thought.   That would be impossible though, since the references will always be to previous movies. Everything you watch will have been made before the movie you watch.    If someone else creates this chain I'll do it. I just might not be that good at spotting the chains.    Because I want to see what it's like. DVD's, webplayers, nothing will do it.   holy shit, that shark is amazing.         there was a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes with that one though.   I'm back now!    They're releasing it on a radio show that's not UTU2TM??   http://tinychat.com/khsunny786  Subreddit: /r/teenagerstinychat   Well you just ruined What We Do In The Shadows funniest jokes.   That was a very strange trailer. It felt like a clip cut out of an actual trailer.  Also yay the invisible friend. He's not really a monster he was just a human stuck in a world of monsters.   A new series was just published a few years ago and they still always put out reprints.   I've gotten excited about this project "finally being made" too many times in the past. I won't believe anything until there is a trailer.    Yeah Blue Screen is still used a lot, but it was used the most up until they changed to green for Superman.   They mostly used blue screen until Superman. And then they were like: shit we need a new colour.   The real life of this sub is actually in "new." A lot of great discussion happens there that never even makes it to the front page. If you stick to "hot" you're going to have shitty time.    Also the list of other names they were going to call Magnitude is the list of names Jeff says as he says bye to everyone leaving the party.  Magnitude will always be Ben from Tracy Beaker to me.   So does that mean we will probably get that episode, because I love that lineup.   I hope they release some other poster in that style for them movie.   What's the Heidecker Gelman ep everyone is talking about in the AMA? Is it real or a bit?   Scott, when are you we going to get an Entourage recap on CBB for the movie??? I need to know what happened.  Edit: whoops someone already asked this. By the way if people do want to see Scott's take on the entourage movie he popped during the entourageathon and spoke about it.     	47
 I keep meaning to try them. Are they wheelchair accessible? I know of a few places around here that I can only get into when I come with other people.   Nice building. Shame it's packed full of crooks and traitors.   I really like Iron Hill. Their porter is fantastic and their food is none too shabby, either. Pricey, though.    West Chester, actually, which isn't terribly far. My girlfriend and I like to pop by Conshohocken for furniture now and again. We'll have to check out some of their beers.   I had tried Prima Pils, and you're absolutely right. Tasted like a lemony-orangey Tsingtao.    The laws definitely take some getting used to, but where I live has so many bars nearby that the switch is super easy - if a slight bit inconvenient. I'll have to check those places out once I have an occasion to get into the city proper.   Downington is actually really close to me. I might do just that.   The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds.  The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South.  The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle.   That actually sounds incredibly interesting. I'll have to give it a read.   Well, I had never stated that the factory committees needed to go away, as consensus is more often than not the best decision maker. Unfortunately, consensus can be difficult to build in conflict or crisis situations. I suppose that functional titles are fine in placid or sedentary organizations where change is slow in coming, but rapid and dynamic fields demand hierarchy. Hospitals and armies, for example, need ranks and authority. Factories, supermarkets (which should ideally be replaced by growers and farmers markets), and many technical fields can function quite well under the initial Soviet model.   But yeah, fuck Stalin and his revisionist, reactionary ways. We agree there, I think.   Unfortunately, this was tried by the Voyenrevcom after the Russian revolution. Ranks, much like every other form of organizational hierarchy, were seen as bourgeois and oppressive and were thus done away with, replaced by functional titles. This worked quite poorly for the Red Army and served as an abject lesson. Unfortunately, hierarchy of some sort or another will always be needed, be it in offices or factories or the battlefield. The challenge is to ensure that everybody is compensated fairly and has equal opportunity to advance within this structure.   Coming from Georgia, I'm glad to hear this. They have some decent beers and I'm sure people will enjoy them.   I'm in the Philly area, to be more specific. My taste gravitates towards lagers and pilsners and I tend to not enjoy beers that are excessively citrussy, so I don't often find myself drinking ales. Pilsners, porters, and lagers are my go-tos.    Right. That's literally the first Confederate National Flag with the seal of Georgia added. Exactly as I said.   Send a mod message. I'm sure they'd love to do such a thing.   A few people have already made posts about it, so there's definitely interest.   [Insert shameless self promotion of my design.](https://i.imgur.com/n55ZjuE.png)   Would Dr [REDACTED] approve of using D-class personnel on such a [REDACTED] without [REDACTED]?   An airborne strain of the FEV, combined with lingering traces of the New Plague, have probably led to pretty much every organism in North America carrying mutatious viruses to some degree. Realize that the Enclave had to resort to kidnapping Vault populations for FEV experimentation in Fallout 2, as everybody else was a carrier. This isn't conjecture. It's all plainly stated in game.   This is what I came to say. Realize that to make something nuke proof will require a degree of flexibility in order for the structure to better absorb seismic shockwaves from ground detonations (which are actually quite rare in nuclear doctrine, as most nuclear exchange scenarios call for extensive use of airburst detonations, maximizing damage over a larger area. The extensive radiological contamination and presence of obscene amounts of, erm, fallout leads me to believe that the Chinese of the Fallout universe favored ground detonations.).  Anyway, in order to counter the almost earthquake like forces at play in ground detonations, many real world underground shelters, like nuclear silo control rooms, were built with hinges and joists pretty much everywhere. Realize that by the outset of Fallout 3, Vault 101 was over 200 years old. These joists and joints and hinges would have corroded and decayed. Honestly, I'd have expected the whole place to fall apart much sooner. We can engineer structures to survive a nuclear war, but humanity will never outlast the sands of time.   Well, technically, zero isn't a negative integer so it's not like there's any problem with there being a Vault 0.   There are apparently 43 of them.   Just out of curiosity, is this the Exton, PA one? I've never seen Boscov's anywhere but there, but apparently they're a chain.   If this doesn't fit here, I'll gladly remove it.   I didn't know they had a subreddit, too. Subscribed.   That's just Carl. He's friendly.   To say that what capitalism is is inherent on the states it's produced is as flawed as Calling soviet Russia an authentic communist state  Hm. Those are terms that I'd understand. Got a source on that book? Is it in wiki commons or anything? I lean Marxist, if only because I'm fairly convinced that mankind can never possibly build Communism, but am always open to exposing myself to other points of view.  I do suppose, however, that my biggest problem with capitalism lies in its inherent ability to exploit and corrupt - much the same problem present in most strains of Socialist theory, mind you. Any time the exceptional are allowed to rise, they will generally abuse said power and exploit the proletariat. Advancement, it has been proven, rewards low level sociopathic traits to a degree. Further, the disabled and the elderly seem to have very little place in capitalist societies unless they demonstrate incredible intellect. Being a merely average cripple myself, that's a bone of contention for me.  Socialism, while *horrendously* flawed, seems much less ethically distasteful than capitalism in every form that I've encountered it.  I just realized that this has turned into a debate, so I apologize profusely if you weren't looking to get into one tonight.   Basically, yeah. Anybody who says that the Chinese people who built the railroads weren't slaves might not be dealing with the fullest understanding of history.   Well, capitalism can be viewed as an outgrowth of feudalism. It's vast power in the hands of private individuals. It's hereditary wealth sustaining the upper classes. It's the few and the powerful owning and controlling the means of production. They're really quite similar, fundamentally speaking. In many parts of the world, the practical differences between capitalism and feudalism are more or less down to semantics.   Well, "paid." It's rather like what happens in a lot of sweatshops or in Scientology's Sea Org. You're paid, but when it's not in [scrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip) you're docked for things like food, healthcare, tools, training, and mandatory housing. What they charge you for these things often ends up costing more than you make. Happily, they have a solution for you. Just work off the balance of what you owe. But you never work it off. You'd leave, but some grubby sheik has your passport and the factory is locked. They've bought the cops and you don't know the language. So you're stuck.  Isn't capitalism just wonderful?   Pretty sure anybody well versed enough in American history to know of the Confederate national flag knows that the founding fathers were a bunch of slave owners with designs on killing pretty much all of the indians.   Reality, mon ami, is seldom fun.   The Confederate national flag was invented by bigots. Ideologically, it's a lot less palatable than the Battle Flag.   That's sort of disappointing, but it sounds reasonable enough.       Realistically, I'm not sure where this thing could keep the vast amounts of fuel it would surely need to carry a person or any meaningful quantity of cargo around for any useful length of time - especially under battlefield conditions.   I'm going to find a way to project this onto random street corners at 3 AM. I'm sure people will enjoy that.   Curse your affable and agreeable nature! You bring shame on the internet's proud tradition of petty anger!  Not all of them, although I am uploading a horror video as we speak. My horror short story readings are all located [in this playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5NKk7FnEK6iOkWiIKAQSQHpaWzO1ybhn)  The rest are principally product reviews and whatever strikes my fancy.   Glad we were able to smooth this over so reasonably! I hope you liked my performance of this, by the way. I intend on doing tons more, as it's a lot of fun and people seem to at the very least sort of favor it to a degree.   Ah. I wasn't getting uppity. I suppose I was being defensive because I thought you were being a bit too persistent in posting that. And I didn't mean to imply that you'd posted it twice in the comments. Poor wording on my part, terribly sorry. Rereading that, I did come off as terribly defensive, didn't I?   Now, as an artistic decision, I defend what I did; but I can also see some merit in what you're saying as well.   As for the window, I had also picked up on that. I wonder if I shouldn't start tweaking things more before I read them?    As I stated in the comments of the video, where you felt the need to post this ~~twice~~ additionally for some reason; the knock on the door was supposed to be the noise. I was experimenting with changing things up a bit from the original.   The thing that's not right is evident if you pay attention to the window.   Governer Purdue had promised to restore the 1956 flag, or have a referendum on the matter. In any case, a deal was reached behind closed doors that kept it from even coming to a vote, and this was seen as a grievous betrayal by many.   So what *are* the other Southern flags that haven't been twisted by bigotry?   Well, Chelsea Manning is something of a special case. What she did was treasonous, but it was a treason motivated by a strong conscience and sense of ethical propriety. Seeing as how so much good came of that leak and the public now knows much more about the horrible things our government is doing, I'd say that it's a justifiable treason.  Besides, you'll often find that your Chelsea Mannings and Edward Snowdens are motivated by deep seated patriotism. We could use more traitors like them. If you want some traitors to be angry at, look at the ALEC and Wall Street thugs who stole our country from the working man.    Well, it's more like if Germans went around flying Black, Silver, and Red flags and remembering the Germans who fought in WWII while disliking (or perhaps feeling no particular way about) National Socialism. Nazism =/= German pride. In much the same way, Racism =/= Southern pride.   The Confederate Battle Flag isn't so terrible. It was simply the banner of a group of men who fought back against what they saw as an invasion from the North and is therefore a perfectly valid symbol of rebelliousness and Southern heritage. It's the first national flag of the Confederacy that was forged by a bunch of slave owners for a government designed to keep black people in bondage. That one seems to get a pass, though. It's even in the state flag today as a 'compromise' from when people got offended about the '56 flag. It seems like a step backwards to me, but whatever.   This. People who say that the Confederacy was treasonous forget that the Union was a voluntary association of equal states. The Confederates were bigots and racists, sure. The Confederacy was many highly unpleasant things. But was it treasonous? Not at all.   Based on [a story](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2ocnvo/wait_somethings_not_right/) posted in /r/shortscarystories by /u/morasyid.

The rest is pretty well mixed.   I think the mods are removing comments in here, fyi.   Except that the Georgia flag has the state seal added, so it's not *exactly* the same.   Actually, I'm in Philly. A fairly affluent part of Philly, I'll grant, but nowhere near as diverse as affluent areas of Atlanta or Charleston.    Look harder to find that black people and latinos weren't in my daily life? I'm sort of confused, here. "Look harder," you say? I've seen all of five black people since I moved North and no latinos. They tend to stay in their own areas. In the South, whites, blacks, latinos, and everybody else mingled pretty freely. I think you might be wrong here, aghalide.   As I said in the other reply to this comment...  I just recently moved out of the South after living there all my life. I saw far more racial integration in the South than I have since coming to the North.   I just recently moved out of the South after living there all my life. I saw far more racial integration in the South than I have since coming to the North.   If you know English, it's not too terribly difficult as compared to Russian or Japanese or Arabic or something. It's also pretty much a given that you can find speakers of the language on every continent, if not in every country. It's a very rich, widely spoken language and I can't stress enough how awesome it is.  Visit us at /r/learnfrench if someone here convinces you better than I can.   In many, many ways the wounds of the Civil War still bleed very deeply in the South. That said, it's also actually a little better about race in some ways than the rest of the country.   Oh, Bungie. You used to be cool. What happened?   France has always been America's bro and I will personally punch anyone who says otherwise.       My interpretation of the situation back in California is that the East Coast Brotherhood is on a much better material footing than the home chapter, but hasn't got as much in the way of leadership and strategic expertise. The DC Brotherhood simply lacks the scribes, Elders, and veterans that California has. So I think that it's tough to say that either one is really stronger, they just have different strengths.  That said, given the West Coast's political situation, I feel a lot less hopeful about the California Brotherhood's long term prospects than I do the DC Brotherhood's.   I wish you could see it like I do, Shepard.   I'm usually an AK purist, but this thing has a really aggressive and almost post-apocalyptic look that I'm really liking.   Was it... Was it good? I tried to go for an Ian McDiarmid sort of thing.   There are times that I forget about the millennial to snake people extension I have installed. This was one of those.         Well, I've never seen the Heart of Lorkhan and HK-47 in the same place at the same time.   No, see, due to privilege it's not enough to be egalitarian. You've got to only be pro black/brown. Being pro everyone is the new KKK.   Does anyone actually believe this or are those two notes people calling her a deluded cray cray?   Well, those things do give nationstates a much better *standing* in the great footrace that is human development and progress, so the analogy holds.    This is good. The reason so many shootings happen at churches and schools is because nobody expects they'll return fire. Gun free zones kill.   It's also easier to use! WIC exists, and if you've ever been a cashier you know how much slower those are.    Looking at it through that lens, I suppose I can see how that would draw people.   And his science fiction was pretty okay, I guess. There were certainly better pulp writers in that era, but there were also worse people churning out SF literature. But that didn't sound like scifi. That sounded more like some kind of gibbering rant.    What was he smoking?   As a paraplegic, I love seeing stuff like this advancing so much.   Oooh, I'd love to see those.   Honestly? No idea. Airplanes are a bitch if you're in a wheelchair and there's no way my car will make it that far. I still don't even have a hotel. This may be the first year I miss.   Looks about like what I'd imagine.   The Flatwood Monster is one of my favorite cryptids. Sadly, it was probably just an owl. Adrenaline does funky things to one's memory.   I... I liked the muppets.   Got this on vinyl. Good stuff.   It's kept me playing, at least.   Fuckin' knew I'd heard that somewhere.   But don't they promise stuff like superpowers and immunity to disease as you move up the bridge? Isn't the tech supposed to hold the cures to all of one's ailments?    If anybody with any org experience wants to correct me on CoS's modus operandi, feel free; but I'm pretty sure it would go down exactly like that. My experience was with Christian faith healing schysters, but I'm pretty sure all of these charlatans work the same way.   Fellow disabled guy, here. (Spina bifida and above the knee amputation specifically.) I always sort of assumed we'd be more exploitable to them. Your local Sea Org con artists would likely promise that by working up the bridge, you could gain the ability to walk. When you naturally failed at this, you would have to be reaudited. They would frame it as your failure and you would be forced to take more and more classes and spend more and more money. The tech would never be to blame for this, for LRH's technology is flawless.    This. I tend to get around 100 views on the videos I bother to share. I've made all of like 50 cents in the past few days, but the e-satisfaction is real.   It's quite often associated with the South and its rural areas are pretty similar, culturally. You'd be surprised. It sort of reminds me of the coastal South in a lot of places.   You might just be on to something.   I'm glad you agree. I adore the South, so if we could get a new flag that represents the whole region and all races that call it home, I'd be very thrilled; even if it's not my flag. Southern pride will be much more attainable and palatable if we can shed the symbols of the Confederacy and heal the past divisions amongst our people.   And I suppose Malaysia's flag is too American? Or, perhaps, Ohio's flag is too Puerto Rican? Or maybe Puerto Rico's flag is too Cuban. I mean, I get your criticism, but stripes and triangles are sort of broad at this point.    I had considered that, but I'd rather the stripes be dominant than the triangle. It was down to this design or another for me and the other way had the triangle jutting much too far out.   Texas, West Virginia, and Maryland; actually. The South is a cultural region comprising a bit more than just the former Confederacy. There are many states that never seceded which are at varying times by various people identified as being Southern.   Ah, damn. So it does. The perils of using flagmaker with very little skill in the program, I'm afraid. Glad you like it, though!   I love the South and much like Cascadia and New England, I believe it deserves a regional flag of its own. However, the old symbols of the Confederacy are much too divisive to represent a region and its aspirations for the future. Therefore, I felt compelled to use what little graphic design skill I have to put forward a replacement.  The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South.  The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds.  The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle.  What do you think? Comments and suggestions are much appreciated. I just wanted to have a flag that all Southerners - white, black, asian, and latin could fly proudly as a banner of their home region.   EDIT: Might as well ask so I can tell what I'm doing wrong, but why's this topic suddenly getting downvoted?      I sort of wondered what was so awful about Georgia's flag in OP's opinion. Text on a flag? I'll grant that that shit is dreadful but I don't find the flag gross. The Saudi flag is gross. Georgia's is merely ill composed.   This stereotype of the South being racist needs to stop. We have a lot of problems, but we're no more racist than the rest of the country anymore (Mississippi, perhaps, notwithstanding.) I bet you've never even been down here.   Things like this make me wish even more that call centers had unions.   Holy shit, we need to get rid of the Saudi government and kick their lobbyists out of the country.   Excellent. Hopefully international postage won't be too murderous.   Hm... Perhaps in slow motion and the color fades to black and white?   The caveat to working collections is that you've got to have a hard heart and thick skins. Between the sob stories and the abuse, you'll see why the turnover is so bad there and why they need such good benefits.   I was inspired by you and /u/walterwoodsiv and decided to narrate this. [You have been warned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AGu5UHkoT8)   With very little background in academic psychology, mind you, I do sort of wonder to what degree mental illness can impact racism. I know that racist tendencies are often an outgrowth of ignorance, a lack of exposure to the world or overexposure to the wrong parts of the world, but a lot of the overt racists I've seen and talked to have a lot of wrongness going on in their other behaviors, as well.   "Annexation"   "Annexation"   Thus driving residents of the Donbass closer to Russia, it seems.   Good. I don't want my tax money going to Poroshenko and his corrupt flunkies.    The flag I was referring to is actually more broadly African than I thought, but it's Marcus Garvey's [Pan-African flag.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-African_flag)  I, too, had ancestors on both sides of the conflict and rather like a German who had ancestors in World War II, I'm proud of what my forebearers achieved, though not who they achieved it for. The Battle Flag might not be the most progressive emblem out there, but to me it characterizes my home, my ancestors, and my heritage. If there's a Confederate flag that's offensive, it's the first National Flag, but that seems to be viewed as the more benign flag for some reason.   But this is dangerously close to devolving into a rant. I'm quite well read on the war and even moreso on its aftermath and lingering effects on the South and its development. I gather that you are, as well.    A fine gun. If I ever desired a carry gun other than my Makarov, it would be a CZ-82.   Nope. That's an earlier gun which is basically an automatic Tokarev. Can't remember what it's called to save my life.   The Viking isn't apparently being received too well. I really doubt it'll wholly replace the venerable and respected Makarov. Hell, some cops still use Nagants from what I've heard.   We haven't got one, that's why. There's a flag for black Southerners, a flag for white Southerners, but nothing that represents all Southerners. We really need to fix that. Cascadia and New England have flags. I'd say the South is certainly distinct enough to have its own flag. Hey, mods. How about a new subreddit flag design contest?   Thank you for your kind and civil defense, Hymen Destroyer.   Other than apocryphal stories I can tell you from my father and grandfather who often saw it displayed proudly by whites, blacks, and others throughout the South before the mid-eighties, I can point to its use in the armed forces [as seen here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#20th-century_popularity) and to its history as a symbol of rebellious elements of the New South from pop culture, such as the Dukes of Hazzard. Beyond that, though, I'm just a guy who likes the South and would rather not have the only distinctively Southern flag seen as a symbol of bigotry. I mean, if the Confederate Battle Flag is a symbol of evil then the US Flag certainly is, yet you can fly it without anybody batting an eye.   Dude's pointing out the safeguards of the legal process. The shooter might be not guilty by reason of insanity or something. I don't think he deserves to be mocked or downvoted simply for suggesting we heed the safeties of the criminal justice process.   As a Southerner, I know what you mean. Yes, the Confederacy was an explicitly racist country but the Confederate Battle Flag is quite nice and for a good stretch of the 20th Century wasn't really seen as a racist symbol.   But now it is, so much like the Rhodesian and South African flags, it's better not to fly it.   It ended up being incredibly self defeating since Mugabe more or less ended up wiping out all the White Rhodesians and forcing them to move away. Had Ian Smith just conceded and let democracy take hold, it would have gone about as well as South Africa which, while far from perfect, is a much better situation for everybody all around.   That Davy Crockett cannon is downright freaky deaky.   Hopefully 4 will clear that up. We do play as a guy from that time period, after all.   Pao's gonna be so bankrupt.   Yellow on white? C'mon, Germans. I thought you had taste.   An HMG for every gay pot grower and an anti-materiel rifle for every transsexual! That's the dream, right there.  But if we could seriously get a pro gun candidate who could do something like funding universal healthcare and education, that would be just peachy.   That could do.   My vending machine is sort of broken, too. Every time you put a dollar in and press the coin return button, it'll give you back four quarters. Works every time!

Yeah, copyright stuff has never stopped ripoff makers. The Eastern European ones may have some trouble as their countries of origin crack down in an attempt to appease the greater Eurozone, but the East Asian, South Asian, and Middle Eastern knockoffs should be fine.   If anyone wants to see it in action, I made a review featuring it and a few other choice discount store items [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HNgdK5ib8 list=PL5NKk7FnEK6jULAoBzbj4PWxkSf7wtIJA index=10) Because I have all of my priorities in life totally together, it's part of a series of terrible product reviews I do.      I remember back in my day. Shit was coming unchained all the time. It was a real issue. Then Sir Thomas P. Shitchainner invented the un-offable chain and the rest, as they say, is history.   It's Always Sunny in Austria   Ooof. That's gonna take some serious headcanon to resolve.   Wait, does that include sleepstrubating or do we just phase out sleep with caffeine?   "Weeee! Intestines!"   Neat. I like being right. It's sort of rare. It must be what The Master feels like all the time.   I can't seem to recall if the sign said that was the gas price specifically, as my resolution was shitty for that stream, but it doesn't have to be gas. Remember, many cars were running on nuclear fuel by then. My hypothesis (just off the top of my head) is that it was the price per gallon for reactor coolant, or possibly water. If the sign actually said "gasoline" it could even be a repurposed old gas sign considering the relative newness of nuclear cars. Did the station have actual gas pumps? I can't remember.   Of course, the dollar may have been drastically revalued by then, though this is slightly unlikely given that a Cryslus Corvega costs "only" $199,999.99. Unless it's a super luxury car, a dollar may be worth about a quarter of what it is in the real world right now.   This is a rather difficult place to be in. We can't just pick and choose when we want to use profiling. We have to either admit that it has a place in sentencing and policing or do the egalitarian thing and discard it on the grounds of individuality skewing such models beyond usefulness. Tough spot to be in, I'd say.   Heh.      They killed Galaxies for this tripe.    What in the actual fuck?   Cults are one of the most unnerving things out there to me.

The Event by Jamie Heppner, post apocalyptic with a twist. Good vs Evil where the Evil is a teenage boy with almost unlimited power and the good is his twin sister that he has tormented his entire life.    I have been writing for over 8 years, even with only a few readers some reviews trickle in now and again.  And the free promos help too.   I write awesome books that get great reviews, but almost no-one reads them...   Also mentioned two phones...since you forgot.   It basically means there is an unpaid bill tied together with ownership of the car. So if a person were to buy that vehicle, they are now responsable for the bill as well.   The car could be taken to sell at no notice by the person holding the lien to pay off the debt owing.  Generally, it's a great way to say, don't buy this.

Free till the end of today. 5/5 stars on paperback version.   Trying to convince people to read your work is very hard, free helps, but it's not an answer.   Even now I have a free work available and it's barely being touched.   Better in the long run to have some loss now to gain readers later.   Same here...sounds like we need to swap stories.   Makes for some interesting reading, or nightmares...   Just need the right motivation. I didn't know I could write a book until I tried.   Was scary the first time I had a stranger read it though...family will always tell you that it's good. Strangers don't have to worry about telling the truth.    Awesome, thanks for taking my offer.   Enjoy!   Nope, can't say I know her...   If you decide to grab a copy, I would love your take on it :)     Don't know the rules in this sub, but here is to breaking the rules on Christmas eve!  After a tragic accident leaving Dario with nothing he finds himself with a strange ability to enter the world inside a mirror.   Now he must decide if this is a gift, or a curse set to ruin what little life he has left.   First book took 2 years. Next two were faster.   This is my third one, Mirror Thief. I like it the most, but it's the shortest of the three. Good read if you are interested. 5/5 Stars so far...   Explain, perhaps I can help?

This one though has been often looked at as dystopian, yet I think it's more post apocalyptic fantasy.    Many people have already posted that this is obviously not a tracing. Nice work.    I will tell her you think so.  :)     Or, how about this...  My niece drew a piece for my nephew, she showed me a picture and I though...hey that's cool!   I posted it here.   People actually liked it.  And the conspiracy theorists climbed out of the woodworks and made way more out of a little picture than was actually there?   The link to original artist has already been provided, but should you miss it, here it is again. Sorry I didn't have it at first, honestly didn't know this was already done.  Here is the Facebook of the artist of the original photo.   https://m.facebook.com/Pertheseus    On mobile is a short form for...have my cell in my hand, heading out the door to work and can't add it this second. Now I am at work, pulled up a tab and am going to edit it.  :)    Didn't know this was already done, and very happy to credit original artist. Thank you all for supplying the links. I will add it to my post as soon as I am off mobile.   Actually I was a fucked sleep. Is it a copy of someone else's work? Cool! They had a great idea.    Actually, she took the picture.   But yes, stick men and I get along very well.     I will have to see if she is willing to release a copy right for you. ;)    F    I wish I could take some credit. She's amazing, am hoping to twist her arm into making some book covers for me.   She made this on a whim for her brother. He's on a bit of a Zelda kick these days.       In the infancy of the internet I thought I had fallen in love. It turned out to be a joke played on me by a woman that had her own heart broken by another. She couldn't hurt him, so she decided to hurt someone else the same way she had been hurt.  I learned from that mistake myself and have regularly found others falling for similar traps, and sometimes helped them see it for themselves. Other times, I am happy to say, it wasn't fake.  I have even thought I should be writing a book about it. At least my experiences anyway.

Funny, I couldn't give a shit if it says "by" or not. If that is what it takes for you to not read a book, you need to look inward first.    No. I'm sorry, whatever that was that I just read, you need to take it down now. And this is coming from someone who published too early as well.

Hey! Thanks! That looks awesome.       Hard to type with an accent that makes it sound the way it should :)     Piston broke.   Amazon ranks free books different than paid. You might even hit #1 in your promo (I have at least twice) but the minute it's over your title drops off the face of the internet.  Even price structure changes where you sit in rank catagories.   Amazon isn't willing to help indies any more than a big traditional publisher. The best way to get your work in front of people is to write the next book. Then, the next one...and one more after that.      Nope. Every one of my books starts with a few characters,  a situation, a problem, and then I just write down what they do to fix it. If I feel it starts to drop off I add some excitement out of their control and watch what they do.   Miracles if you are bad. Not much if you are good.    I know long term parts experts in Ford and Dodge. I will show them both tomorrow and maybe get a hit for you. Worth a shot.   I see that price on PC...I would grab it, see what happens!   I am guessing yes. Since there is no way to stop the smoke from drifting back in. It might not be as strong, but it will still be there.   Yes. Both links are coming up at 29.99 for me. Hence, do you have "Another" link?     I remember making my Mom laugh so much she would cry. I wanted to do that all the time for her. It was nice to see her happy. I don't get to see that often these days.     Can't see it at 9.99 anywhere. Do you have a link?     This is something no-one can answer for you. For every person out there the experience is going to be different. For me, it was a comfort, but she sat (sits) in a chair most of the day and complains that no-one will visit her.   For my wife, it was a childhood of belittlement and trauma that she is still working to get over even at 30 years old.   Some will say you were blessed with this, others say how sorry they feel for you.  All I can say is, when you get the chance to be a parent yourself, just be there for your kids. It's more important than any of the toys or privileges out there.

"The Event" is told from a post apocalyptic view, where electricity as we know it no longer works. However, it does not follow the lines of reality very closely.   Also be warned, if this were a movie, it would have an R rating. Turns out teenage boys with no rules and almost unlimited power really know how to get into trouble.    It doesn't matter where they are now. As long as you are there, a piece of them remains.

Power to everything. But nothing kicks up. Complete failure.   Talked to a tech buddy and he thinks it's the same thing. Absolutely nothing comes up on boot. Not even an error.    It was fast at least.   It will take time. Not sure...Thank you.   It was quick. It was painless. Last night, it coughed. I was playing Dragon age, and loads were slow. I thought...I should update my drivers tomorrow, just in case. This morning...the motherboard...I...it...  Still too painful. I'm sorry.  And moble typing...it hurts.      Get a friend to put booster cables on it for half hour with their car running. That will trickle charge your battery. If/when it starts take the cables off and disconnect the positive cable from your battery. Car runs? Your alternator is good. Car dies? Your at is toast.   Just about as basic a test as you can get.       XCOM I have to load that one up all the time. Blowing up aliens is just a blast.    Perhaps look at this one.   Dragon Age: Inquisition   It's real time, but you can pause for strategic players. I am REALLY looking forward to it next month.    While not a turn based game, I found what I had been missing (and I think you too) when I started playing the Demon Souls/Dark Souls games. They are real time, but the...hard play style brought back the fun.   Now, if that isn't your taste, there are still turn based games out there in RPG format.  XCOM for instance. Not a classic RPG but still a hell of a game, in all its forms.   And for the life of me, I remember seeing a new game coming out very soon that is all turn based combat in an RPG form, but the name has left me!   I am sure another Redditor will remember it and add it here...or I will in an edit once I can stimulate my fogged brain.    Well they are normally more rugged. Odds are she doesn't have it hooked up right and it's timing out. (Wrong input perhaps) That would make it seem like it's just going black.   Phone the authorities.   It doesn't matter if he knows who it would be. It's better to do it while someone is still alive.  And better to not wait. Now is a good time.    	110
 When playing GTA, I have gotten bored and at times decided to do this. Here are some examples,  - Standing on top of a building with a sniper rifle and waiting to shoot the passenger of a convertible. (Kennedy assassination)  - Shooting up a fast food resturant. (San Ysidro McDonalds Massacre)  - Flying a commercial jet into a skyscraper while shouting "Death to America" and "Allahu Akhbar" in a mock Middle Eastern accent. (9/11)  - Doing typical GTA rampages in a black Senitnel (BMW 3 series coupe) since it closely resembles Elliot Rodger's car.  - I tried to see if I could find a church with an accessible interior in order to do the recent AME church shooting, but didn't find one.

The current Nissan Altima is about as big as the Maxima of the early 00s and the current Mercedes C-Class is about as big as a W210.               RX7         The Mercedes E Class is available as a sedan, wagon, coupe, and convertible and so was/is the BMW 3 Series. The Audi A3 is available as a sedan, wagon, convertible, and hatchback. Up until the about the 70's or 80's, most mainstream American and Japanese cars such as the Chevrolet Impala or Datsun 510 came in a full range of body styles. My guess as to why this ended is because the demand for coupes and wagons is no longer big enough for non-luxury manufacturers to offer a full line like this.   The SL has been losing it lately and that redesign looks pretty good. Also, is seems weird to me that back in the 70's and early 80's the SLC was a 2+2 version of the SL, but now it's going to be the compact roadster.

I noticed that brown thing in the background that looks like an old Cadillac.   Cadillac, in 1970, still had it all together and were still producing what were seen as the premier American luxury car. As the decade went on, they became bigger and more garish, until they downsized in 1977. From 1971 on, they also cheapened their cars and decreased quality control. By the mid 1980's they came out with the downsized, front-wheel-drive econobox looking Cimarron, DeVille, Eldorado, and Seville. The cars also became more attainable from 1971 on, and more so by the 80's, competing with less prestigious Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Chryslers, and Mercurys. Currently, Mercedes-Benz still makes good cars, but some of them are relatively garish and they also recently introduced the lower priced, standard front wheel drive CLA and GLA. The CLA and GLA compete to an extent with loaded Toyotas, Hondas, Chevys, etc. Both brands seem to have introduced lower-priced models to profit off their preceived prestige that was acquired over many decades.         Makes sense, I see far more debadged CLAs, GLAs, C-Classes, 3-Series, A3s, and A4s than I see say, E and S-Classes.         https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolseley_15/60   If you think thats bad, look up Rich Kids of Instagram.   What ever happened to domestic rice?   How can the 1980s Lincoln Town Car be so similar to a Rolls-Royce and have stayed on the market for a full decade?      Is it one of those shows where everybody brings their 35 year old beater or rice burner Civic and calls it a car show?         As a regular reader of [Curbside Classic](http://www.curbsideclassic.com), and an occasional reader of [Old Parked Cars](http://www.oldparkedcars.com), two sites based in Portland that write mainly about old cars that are not in show condition and have been found parked on the streets by their authors, I was expecting to see a lot more old shitboxes. In particular, I was surprised that these albums didn't include a bunch of diesel Benzes and 70s-80s American cars (in both poor and well maintained condition, but generally poor), as those sites seem to make those types of cars seem really common there. The Saabs, Volvos, E30s, Benzes, Eagle Premier, and Japanese cars however, are in line with their typical fodder.   OP already stated that there is no such thing as an S45.   There is no such thing as an S45 AMG.      Just had to post this: https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3038/2617328775_3b5c600e2c_z.jpg?zz=1   I guess to be unique. Kind of reminds me of how I used to think it would be a cool idea to buy a BMW or Benz and rebadge it as a 525tds, E280, or whatever other model not available in the US so that it would look like I were driving a Euro model and feel like a diplomat.      Also, you wouldn't be able to import it into the US for another 7 years.  OP's post history indicates that he is from Qatar.      This is how you know a car is becoming affordable.   Cars like the Mercedes S-Class and new generation BMW 7-Series have so much tech and driver aids. They also have higher powered engines and lighter materieals that in the past. What could the next generations of these cars be like? More tech?, self-driving?, or just further improved rehashes of the same thing we have now?                           GTA pedestrians in real life.   The Buick Regal and Lesabre weren't exactly cars that the public oohed and ahhhed over.  From regularly reading Curbside Classic, I've heard that Regals and Cutlasses were considered aspirational vehicles in middle America during their time. They had a reputation as a middle class "I made it" or "I've grown up" car in a way similar to how people today view the BMW 3 Series.   Mercedes-Benz AMG GT  BMW M4  E46, E92 M3 - Have been called the last of the "Analog" M3s.  Dodge Challenger and Charger Hellcat - The ultimate muscle cars at this point.  Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8  Chrysler 300 SRT8   Buick GNX, Grand National, T-Type, Lesabre Turbo, etc. They were all high performance versions of otherwise staid luxury cars with more agressive, sportier styling, similar to what AMG does with Mercedes-Benzes.                  Does this count? http://i.imgur.com/mGdqzQF.jpg         That's why this is called r/shittyopinions                        https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8479/8213521015_53224f9be0_b.jpg   BMW 335i  Mercedes C350                  Cancer kicked his ass.         When I see a car broken down on the side of the road, it generally seems to either be a 15-25 year old German luxury car or a 10-20 year old GM econobox.   http://imgur.com/lZO7MUP            I hope to god this never happens.   Would the world population be lower or higher? On one hand, sociopaths tend to be more sexually active since they have low impulse control and a high sex drive, on the other hand, they are more likely to kill since they don't value human life.   Not this again             That's how Lexus, Infiniti and Acura all started.   But it just seems strange that their direct competitors offer comparable cars in the US but Audi hasn't attempted to compete with them here. E.g. A5 Sportback is similar to 6 Gran Coupe and CLS and RS6 is similar to E63 AMG S and M5 Competition package.      They don't give us the RS3, S3 Avant, RS4, RS6, and A5 sportback, even if some of these cars have their direct competitors' counterparts sold here.            I was thinking about trolling /r/futurology with this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJG9EZF2wJg     	162
             Putting up posters about men's issues is always a fun thing to do. Certainly seems pretty successful activism and really brings men's human rights into the real world.            Feminists are notorious for their contempt for stay at home mothers. Patricia Hewitt actually described them as a "real problem":  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-184662/Mothers-stay-home-problem.html   His previous abuser was Cheryl Cole, one of the most famous female singers/celebrities in the UK over the last decade or so:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Cole   This is the second time a woman has boasted about the violence they've perpetrated against Cole, the previous case being his ex-wife who put the remarks about her domestic violence in her autobiography and therefore profited from them.  Neither woman has been subject to the slightest attention from police, despite them both openly confessing to serious violence in writing.  One particular interesting part of the article:  "Carla added: "No-one tried to stop me hitting him  I think that is because of Ashleys bad karma.  I did it for my sister. Ashley has caused her a lot of issues."   Info on is previous abuser: http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4575392/cheryl-cole-book-showdown-with-cheat-ashley-cole.html#  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2214348/Cheryl-Cole-How-vitamin-jabs-helped-cope-Ashleys-adultery.html                                                         Pretty historic for such a decision to be overturned, I believe this is the first ever such case!   In case people are wondering why this is an men's issue - all the victims were boys and the woman who declined to prosecute the perpetrator is a radical feminist.                                                 The saddest story about circumcision is also from Canada  Technically, the saddest ones are all the hundreds of deaths of babies and young children.         Rather old story, but was recently removed from Google's results so i thought it was worth posting.      Another story taken down by Google.      This story is rather old but has been removed from Google search results so i thought i'd share it here. The following addition link has also disappeared: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4093123.stm   Quite an interesting story anyhow.       I realise the story is old, but Google recently removed it from their search results so i thought I'd share it here.  This link has also been removed from Google: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7506139.stm      There are also outright lies too with no factual basis whatsoever.   The claims in the article are BS. CAFE simply named a number of groups who it hoped to work with. Secondly, there a hundreds and hundreds of studies showing that 50% of dv victims are men so again their claim is true.  Finally, your typical feminist website/pamphlet will contain at least one completely debunked factoid concerning domestic violence (usually several), so if people really have a major problem with misleading claims about dv then they need to start targeting serial offenders, i.e. vast numbers of feminists and feminist organisations (not to mention government departments)            Would you be open to the same happening with the school work of millions of boys given multiple studies show blatant sexism in grading by female teachers?                     On the other hand, if they have a male only workout area then the pricing might actually be legal due to the lesser facilities offered to women.   Apologies for the terrible headline.      Possibly the worst headline ever, but certainly an interesting and rather distressing article.                                   If you're not welcome at an event, do us all a favour and do not show up.  CAFE's original ban (in 2014) went against ever single Pride rule imaginable and was therefore invalid. As for this year, there still hasn't been an actual reason given other than "complaints", the complaint clearly haven't been investigated, nor deemed as valid reasons for barring Pride.  **Pride are now in a situation where anyone can make any complaint about any group and as long as there are a dozen of such complaints then that group can be banned forever!** It doesn't matter how ridiculous or false the complaints happen to be, the organisation just gets banned simply becasue of a handful of ridiculous or politically motivated complaints.                                          I've made it so the link skips the first 26 seconds becasue the audio is poor quality at the start      She'd certainly know a thing or two about tricking young girls...            Disclaimer: I do not support Cancer Research UK and I'd discourage anyone from donating to them due to their long and continuing history of sexism against men. However, the rest of this video is fantastic so it's still worth sharing.            And Pride too.   That's sort of true, though under 18's do tend to get a pass from the media and from some feminists as they aren't actually evil men yet. There's potentially a few years available for activism from a privileged position, where attacks will be less severe and he might actually be listened to.   This video is proving to be rather popular of late, would be interested to hear people's thoughts. Personally I didn't like some of the tactics used by the interviewer and appreciated how Mike highlighted what she had done.            I'm new to posting in r/undelete so I hope I got everything right. Not sure how to tell how high in r/all the vid got, but it certainty was popular and the video seems to have gained 40K views.      Mike's website is http://j4mb.wordpress.com/ for those who were impressed by his performance. He's looking to raise 25,000 to fund 50 like-minded candidates at the next election.      Almost 100K views for this video now, really impressive.   It's important to emphasise that the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, not becasue of any facts surrounding the case. Furthermore, in the example you cite those involved have apologised and accepted that they did terrible things, Solo has failed to apologise for her conduct and actually attempts to play the victim!  I agree she's innocent until she's found guilty, though I'm also certain that no male in her position would be representing the US team and we really should be treating all athlete equally regardless of gender.      If she was a regular gal working a 9 to 5 job her employer couldn't fire her or 'punish' her because of domestic violence.  Well her 9 to 5 job is perhaps playing for her club side. Here's she's being giving the privilege of representing her country on a world stage, something that actually distinguishes and elevates this above all the other cases it is being compared with.       Mike posts news updates and articles on the J4MB website every day, well worth keeping an eye on his site:  https://j4mb.wordpress.com/  If you enjoyed his video then maybe consider becoming a member of the party: https://j4mb.wordpress.com/party-membership/  (members can live anywhere in the world, it's not limited to the UK)  You can even apply to stand as J4MB candidate at the next election, again you don't even have to live in the UK to do so.            Actually I think the format would have a lot of potential were it explained a little more clearly.     if the first thing in their manifesto wasn't about restricting women's access to abortions  The format of the manifesto is chronological - i.e. it deals with foetuses, then babies, then children and then adults. Also, while I'm not all that enthusiastic about the inclusion of the abortion proposals, it's incredible how people try to twist it to pretend it's extreme. In reality, according to this link, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6235557.stm the party is only proposing the exact same time limit as in place in **Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia**. It's the current UK limit of 24 weeks which is the extreme and out of touch policy relative to other developed nations.   The statements on their Facebook are too puzzling really in order to allow a 5 star review as of yet and they do appear to have lied. I think we should wait a little longer to find out what really happened. (Yelp reviews are still possible, so that would be the most obvious location for feedback).       That's because it's mother's groups and child protection groups making progress, not us.  True, though I haven't seen much involvement from mother's groups in this case, it's the intactivists who've been at the forefront of this. their case is certainly made a hell of a lot easier with the mother being pitted against the father in this instance but whatever the case this is still a major victory for us right now. I certainly haven't ever heard of a case of a hospital and doctor wanting to mutilate a boy and then backing out at the last minute entirely thanks to a campaign to save him from their knife. And if we make it unacceptable for the hospital to mutilate Chase against his will then the natural extension of this process is to make it unacceptable for hospitals  to mutilate any kids just for the hell of it.     Many thanks to all those who were involved in helping to protect Chase.  Note that he's still at risk for the next 60 days and we may have to go through all this again with a different hospital.                              Her comments are the exact opposite of reality. The lack of a bedroom subsidy actually hits separated fathers far harder than anyone else becasue their don't have primary custody of the kids therefore they don't get to have a bedroom for their kids, meaning no overnight stays becasue there's no suitable place for the kids to sleep.                                        This is one University.  There have been a lot of near identical incidents elsewhere. It's not even isolated to the UK either, there have been cases in Canada and the US too (though the UK student's unions seem to be the most successful at banning groups who help men)                   The title is taken from the article.   It's from last year but seems we missed it that time around.         This is a British story   **The Qantas idea of "safety" is to assume every single male passenger is a paedophile**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_seating_sex_discrimination_controversy#Qantas_and_Air_New_Zealand  Please boycott this airline if you can (though I guess ruining their videos also helps)             John Lukic would surely be the goalkeeper in a best non-capped XI                           Thanks, one of them made the front page today and I received gold for it, it's nice to be appreciated.               Perhaps most of those 1 in 5 men suddenly find themselves in such hostile work environments that they leave within a year or two. It's probably technically correct that 20% of new primary school teachers are men, but if half of them are hounded out of the job within a year or two then we're not going to see any increase in male teachers.                           Why are we linking to this crap? Please use an archive in future.                       	199
 They're stylized depictions, not necessary to be 100% proportionate. I think they look even better than in the anime. Less cartoony.    I agree, I'm casually playing through ALBW right now and to be honest all it does it make me want to play the old GBC games. Seasons was always my favourite of the two.   I can't say anything bad about ALBW (Although going in blind I thought it was going to be incredibly short until the Lorule world was revealed) but the Oracle games and even LA DX definitely have the nostalgia factor for me, and that's the main reason why I play Zelda so they win. Plus the puzzles were definitely more difficult back in the day. I replayed the Oracle games last summer and still constantly found myself looking up walkthroughs for puzzles. ALBW hasn't given me as much trouble so far...      Lower amounts of DXM is just kinda like being stoned/drunk at the same time, not full blown disassociation    I know it was a parody but it still doesn't make punching him in the face seem any less appealing.   /r/neckbeardnests   Nice one man!    Yeah there's usually at least a couple player summons before most boss areas.   yeah but Mike didn't finish college or go to law school. He got expelled for helping the Deans daughter cheat, fucked up his chance to go to Harvard the legit way.    ahahahah holy shit i'm dying, that was too good!    I stared at this for like 5 minutes before I figured out it was a photo. Looks like some weird ass computer game or something lol  edit: actually is it CG? I honestly can't fucking tell if it's CG or just has a fuck load of artefacts. [7]    I always assumed it was set in the present, which would make Harvey 43 and Mike 34 according to the Suits Wiki. That doesn't seem right... I always placed Harvey in his mid to late 30's and Mike in his mid 20's.  However, the show has been on for 4 years (5 seasons) and obviously each season doesn't cover an entire year in their universe. According to the wiki, 2007 was the year that the Daniel Hardman embezzlement incident took place, and the current events take place 5 years after that, making it still 2012. This puts Harvey at 40, which seems reasonable I suppose (still imagined him younger, since he's portrayed as such a wunderkind), but Mike is still 31.  Am I missing something or does that seem too old? He never even made it to law school and undergrad/college prep is only like 4 years max, plus he got kicked out early. Are we supposed to believe he just kicked around as a bike messenger for 6~10 years before that one random encounter at a law office sparked his desire to "become something more than just a bike messenger" again? Sorry if this comes across as incoherent or my math is wrong, it's late lol.  *edit: just saw there's literally a question about their ages on the front page already lol. Still, I feel as though the ages seem off. Anybody agree?     Aaaah those 90's breakbeat vibes given me the warm fuzziesss    Stoked. Regis is king    Paying attention to key or "energy" isn't too important with techno, especially if you key-lock. I used to religiously mix by key via Traktors' built in key detection, and it can help you clean your mixes up to an extent if you're just starting out or do lots of melodic stuff, but honestly in the long run I found it just limits creativity.   I now just organize my music by genre, mood and sound. For example, I keep banger peak-hour big room tracks together, the groovy, more techy stuff together, the deep hypnotic afterhours stuff together, etc etc. That way depending on the crowd and the gig, I can easily just throw together a mix of stuff I know will work well together, without having a playlist completely set in stone.  edit: I'm also in the habit of weeding out my main playlists of "filler" tracks so that I don't end up relying on them too much for transitions. If you know two tracks work great together, chances are you've already played them in a mix so I try to avoid getting stale by sending overused tracks to purgatory.         I heard it    It would be better if his soul count went up after the guy fell    LOL   Game of thrones season 2, Assassins Creed brotherhood and my god damn sweater...   If this were University he'd be thrown out, if this were the real world he'd be sued, but since this is Youtube he gets away with it and that pisses me off. Regardless of how well made his videos are, all of the ground work is done for him and he doesn't even credit the sources for his blatantly ripped off material, yet still makes a livelihood from it. This kid can go fuck himself, seriously.     /r/submechanophonia   betcha there's tons of spiders in those sheds.   I think she's almost become like a sister/family figure for him. So of course he loves her and he relies on her, but he has no qualms about fucking and developing feelings for other women. (like Scotty)   So predictable hahah    NG+ LGK is a lot harder coz dat shield tho... nah who am I kidding, still a relatively easy boss.   Soul Vessel if you really need to change things up, but just power through it until you've completed everything at least once. Shulva is definitely the easiest of the DLCs, and Sinh is a really fun fight once you get past all the shitty poison enemies and traps the level has to offer.    Daamn    Looking Glass Knight, formerly known as the Mirror Knight    yikes mate, sorry...      Alright I know this could have been posted in DarkSoulsPVP but this sub is a LOT more active so forgive me.  Basically I just want to know how fight clubs work. Is it just any dude who summons a bunch of blood/dragon pvpers on the bridge (or wherever the current popular spot is) or is there more to it?  I've inferred from my limited pvp experience and just browsing this sub that to wave and then bow when you're ready to duel is the polite way to initiate a friendly fight. Is this true or am I overthinking it?  I have summoned people on the bridge just to have them immediately return to their world so i'm a little bit confused as to what the etiquette is haha.  edit:typo    Lud   Zallen fight was exhilarating, mostly because I knew if I lost I'd likely never make the trudge back to fight them again. Thankfully I got them first try.    Almost impossible to choose between Velstadt and Sir Alonne for me. Both have the most interesting lore, fight areas and character designs to me. I like fighting monsters, but I like duelling honourable warriors even better.  *edit: Can't forget about LGK. Velstadt, LGK, and Alonne are my hombres.    LOL so glad i'm not the only one who immediately saw the Yee face!   My fave is always when i'm invading and I lure them (via relentless mocking gestures) into an ambush or better yet off a cliff or something. Throne room in NG+ or the shakey bridge right before the Dragon Shrine are good spots to fuck with people    Apple juice jokes aside, you done good mate. I learned from this post.    It's sorta rude if you know the person, but the fact that they're strangers and it was pre-made make it totally understandable..     Great looking setup, 3P is the way to go for productivity!    Everlast Knight with maxed out Path of the Dragon for dat Ancient Dragon swag.    Yeah I know, just more common to see the opposite like he said.    You restart the play through if you die. Don't recommend unless you hate yourself.     Still prefer those guys to the damn exploding mummies in 2   I think he's saying that generally Microsoft users last gen converted over to Sony this time around.   The Winnipeg drummers playing the march of a thousand farts..As is traditional for the royal family.     the previous homeowners must have either been super narcissistic or super kinky   fine work! Definitely checking out the rest of this guys deviantart page.   That's fucking cool. I'm jealous.   I knew a kid from Mexico named Jaguar Paw. To be fair his parents were ethnic Mayans or something but still... that's gotta be rough.      Wow I played this game like a year ago but I must have missed this. Nice find! While not a unique concept, I feel like this is still definitely an homage. The helmet even looks like the Heide Iron Mask from DaS2.   Another platformer with a pretty obvious bonfire reference is [Shovel Knight.](http://ell.akamai.coub.com/get/bucket:12.21/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/31bddd53536/c717421fc6ab7d04de7c7/med_1405622170_image.jpg) It's not really an easter egg but the devs openly admit to loving Dark Souls so in my mind it's an homage.      lol @ Lady of the Darkling... talks like Brienne of Tarth but looks like fucking Ginny Weasley    Is this real life? Looks amateur hour    I just want a rainbow name!    You've got a real Hannibal Lecter vibe going on there   Alva helm Heide mail Loyce everything else. All of the most baller metals.    This is awesome. I love this.  I usually make all my friends start a new character on DaS1 when they come over. Usually they make it to the first asylum demon encounter (without a weapon) die a few times, and shove the controller into my hands...    I love Fitzpatrick, I do... but Beck's live performances are just SO POWERFUL     Not going :( i'm sure some of the sets will make it to podcast/soundcloud though    goddamn Cologne Cathedral looks fucking amazing, I can never get over it    I hope he gets better    Some have titanic flying fire breathing lizards    classy chessboard    Same story different game. I should really dust off my Maschine...    Boy do people ever love talking about why they love mechanical keyboards.   Black Iron or Elite Knight.

 I live in the philly area and recently i have seen major throttling. This wasnt ever an issue before.   I had scabies too 7 yrs ago and it honestly changes your life for the worst. Fear and anxiety def take over.   Had a coworker tell me that her daughter just got back from a scabie infected region and my body activated all of its defenses just at the word of it. I hate scabies!   Yea. Even hulu is like this.   Both comcast and fios have their on-demand services that i guess you can say competes with nefflix.   They want u to switch out.    Yea same here. Its bull crap   Most of the times it 5/5.   I have unlimited data and havent met the 5 gb threshold but im still being throttled crazy. Anyone else facing similar issues?      He means would he be ok with other giving respect space to other religions. I think.   Im being serious. Not sure why it was downvoted.   So did ya get the job or naaw   There are tons of resources that state that to reduce anxiety one must meditate.  What's the Christian version of Meditation?    Dude u win the internet today! Loved the originals. I cant wait for this!   If someone doesnt then I think we as a community should.    I am going through something similar and I would highly recommend seeking a therapist.  I have been going for a year and though i havent fully recovered I am at a point where I can somewhat function better in life.   One of things that I keep hearing about for improving recovery is Mindfullness/meditation. Still learning about this while being careful to not get into some eastern religion tantra.   Cardio helps out alot with depression. Go for a walk or exercise and you will see improvements.    Im from philly. Where can i sign up?   I meant murdered in the ring.    Thats how pacquiao would state his death wish. Mayweather would basically murder him for humiliating him like that.   And then cries   Or let next yr play out and see how it goes. Dude is known for injuries.    He should change his name to Mariota!   Mariota says he doesnt want to play for Chip   Im surprised at how easily it destressed me! Thanks!   Its a valid bet. Most likely guaranteed returns.   I think mostly everyone wants Pac-Man to win. But we all think realistically Mayweather will win. If this fight had taken place few years ago then maybe Pac-Man could've won.  All that said though, I hope Pac-Man wins!   The way to get out of a burnout is to take pleasure in life.  Some ways to do that : Make real connections with people. Hard to do. Find fun things to do. Play sports, games, movies, etc. Workout. Minor achievements till you're on track. Being positive.     Yupp reached this point after trying alot of alternatives. Fixing the symptoms instead of the causation.   Still working on getting to 100% percent but getting there slowly.   weather right now is in the 60s F. Cold but leading into Spring. Best time to plant seeds is in fall, and the next best time is in the Spring. I'm going to take my chances with Spring. I've delayed it too long.   til dont read forbes   Not an expert nor even an amateur. So take my suggestion with a grain of salt.  My lawn is for the most part in a crappy situation too. So I also got fed up with it and called a local landscaper. He is going to dethatch, aerate, apply a mix of blue kentucky grass seeds (maybe in your case apply bermuda grass), and then apply fertilizer after 6-8 weeks. So those are the steps to recover it seems.   Nope. Whats senpai?   I dont get it   It is and were still doing the typical stuff. But i just dont mix food with girls. Not my thing.    U smell right      Sweet thanks!   How can I get a ticket if I dont own season pass tickets. Seems like a fun time.   With Omega-3   That made me lol   I tried this and it just doesnt taste good.   What do you guys do when the Bible starts to get boring   I have a very hardtime making decisions. And people have said that go with your gut alot than trusting anything else.     Oh well dude. Life happens.     i like it  	45
          Good golly, brah.                              Ok so then explain to me what FWIW means?   I didn't know there was a stove business...   Maybe you should pop over to /r/gaybrosgonewild in that case...haha   Honestly ashamed this still goes on in a supposedly "civilized" Internet forum.   What use are reading comprehension skills? The curtains are just fucking blue, why can't you people study something useful like STEM??                                                                                                           	53
 Would you like a full build list? Edit: No, D90s with 205/55 fronts and 225/50 rears    It's on jackstands right now    I did some 400 first, then moved onto 1000 for the really fine look. I still haven't decided if I'm going to go for a matte or gloss clear yet    Oh please. I've already work on suspension and brakes. I did it because I liked the idea and I think it's a great tribute to 356s and Magnus Walkers cars. I didn't do it to save weight, but because it looks pleasing. I'm not trying to be an expert, but I highly doubt that creates any drag at all. If it helps you sleep at night, I can stuff some tin foil in there and Bondo right over it.   I know full well what they're worth, like I said earlier. It's my car I'm going to do what ever I want to it. And I think it is far from rice if it's actually a purpose built track car.   I actually just bought some Hankooks, my wallet hurts after buying those. Let alone Hoosiers    To each his own, but this is my car so I'm going to do what I want to it    I'm thinking about getting plexiglass quarter Windows and added louvers to them like his 78 SC. I do have a matte black fiberglass header panel that's going on    Thanks! I was thinking about something like that for the other side, only my drivers side has a script handle so it would look weird if I just pulled that piece of plastic trim off the other side       Awesome, thank you so much    I'm currently in the process of building my 944 into a track car, and by any chance do you remember what you did to make the front splitter/ valence under the front bumper?   Steel front rotors?   More pics of the 911 pleaseeeeeeeee   Valid point, I just feel since they're so similar and by the same manufacturer it wouldn't be as extreme as comparing "Prime" vs BBS   I know they're D90s, I think that clubsport just sounds better than D90.    Damn that sucks... Glad you're okay though       Thanks, I scuffed them with some 400 grit sand paper, used aluminum wheel cleaner, wiped them up with wax and grease remover, then I painted with Rust-Oleum copper metallic spray. They came out very nice for coming out of a can.      Yeah Massachusetts represent!   Can confirm, 944 NA box is absolutely garbage, can't even handle it's own power    Awesome, definitely going to do the tonight    Yeah to each his own. I think the vents themselves are fine it's just the horizontal black strips in them. I know it's supposed to be like a 935, but it just doesn't look right    I plan on doing a few this year. Would you say that having autocrossed before, it helped a little but with finding out the limits of your car? And did they have in car instructors? I'm pretty excited to actually get out on the track this summer. It's something I've been waiting to do for a very long time.   I love the front end of the slant nose, I just think that they would look better without the rear quarter vents    Hakosuka would be way better    Gorgeous color    What I should have said is that I don't think you'll be able to find one that has the fit and finish of a factory slant nose    I agree, the slant nose is pretty cool but I'd hate to see another 930 molested. Most of the aftermarket slant nose kits just don't look right either    That is my number one dream car, unbelievably jealous    Awesome, I love the speedhunters tires   	32
 I can't believe that Louis Armstrong is not on these lists!  Come on folks, he invented Jazz singing.   Big upvotes for Blossom Dearie and Cecile McLorin Salvant.     I agree Anita and Ella were the great Verve rivals, and as a pure Jazz singer Anita might have had an edge.     Well, that makes it right then.    As the mod of the /r/badlawyer subreddit I can attest to this.  Really it's fraud, perjury, theft, and violence that will get you tossed.  Amazingly though, there is a former major crime prosecutor in Cleveland who while coked up shot his girlfriend at close range; went to prison for 7 years; and, who was reinstated.  Amazingly the same court disbarred a longtime civil attorney who didn't file and didn't pay income taxes (no fraud involved.)   Go figure.   Great suggestion by /u/Ihearcolor -- I'd also suggest that you stay close to us.  Do the daily check-in and share here with us.  We're not like the rest of Reddit.  This is a full on support subreddit and snark-free zone.   You're doing it right double-D!      True.   He opened Pandora's (Sarah's) box.         Nah, he always writes like that--but, there's some information there that's not being covered anywhere else.   Sarah Vaughn  Rosemary Clooney  Ella  Louis Armstrong  Johnny Hartmann  Nat King Cole  Frank Sinatra  Nina Simone  Julie Christy  Tony Bennett (with Basie)     Yeah, the irony.      You pull this sort of shit with the feds you get an obstruction of justice charge.                           LOL--in Cleveland we have a couple of days off.   I had a great Heineken t-shirt that said, Grab a Heinie.  I loved it.  It became a paint t-shirt when I stopped drinking.  Then a rag.   Here's what I did when I was learning (and I'm far from a master)--off the bike in off season focus on abs and squats.  Strengthen your core muscles, but get super strong at the hover squat position by sitting on a stool and rising and holding at 4 inches, 6 inches, and then controlled seating (not collapsing back onto the stool).  Then as you ride, learn to jump up from the saddle and use your body weight to push the pedal down, alternate with sitting and riding at a higher rev.  Then back up on the pedals.  This should become instinctive.  Good luck.   Hooray!     Yeah, bad role model. I'd find a new sponsor.  BTW, I have a co-sponsor that I totally admire but this is his Achilles.  Since he's my co-sponsor this issue bothers me not at all.  It's his character defect.   I think this is great.  We get lots of username changes for this stated reason.  It's sort of like losing the beer t-shirt after being in recovery for some time.      You know the way, /u/gonegirl1022--focus on not drinking TODAY, and plan to make the same decision tomorrow. Good luck.   When you ride a bike, don't think about your destination instead think about how beautiful the ride is, how great the pedal stroke feel is, how you want to be right where you are right now--then lean in.      /u/bigndfan175 is Bonus Buddha Baby!   Yay!   [The Boy who wouldn't hoe corn.](https://youtu.be/1M9-2t5csY4)   Optics.  He's failing at optics.   I think it is so true that anniversaries, mile marker celebrations are super important for the reasons you stated, Slip.  I like to point out to newcomers with 7 days, 14 days, 30, 60, 90 days that their achievement of those milestones lend credibility to what they say about the journey that someone with years (and in your case, decades) can not have.  But, as always you paint a poignant picture, my friend.  Thank you.            Yes, ELECT ME and I'll take you to war in the Middle East.

Welcome /u/megame23 -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It lays out how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  When you're up to it, maybe there are some ideas there that will make sense to you.  Good luck, I hope you join us.   Welcome /u/Jadiki to r/stopdrinking.  I thought I'd share the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) with you.  It's what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I try to share it as part of the "handshake at the door" to the SD sober journey.  Good luck to you.   Ah, yes, the courage of media whoredom.            And his Dad.   This is what Obama asserted was the only alternative offered by critics of the Iran-Nuke Deal.   How cool would that be?  War with Iran, sheesh, these people are idiots.      This is a great essay on political trolling.      Good for you.   Fear  Amends   Dry People, Dry Places  Fitness  Work  Dating   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what; honestly, keeping SOBER in Cleveland Thursday.  Beautiful weather today, and I'm happily bike commuting.   Not let's see, what might be Sen. Menedez's position on the Iran Nuke deal?      This reminds me of the quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson that was in my first comment at the original Honesty Week post:  "Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.  From this I take: judge the truth to yourself and speak it to yourself and if necessary to others; but be open to the idea that what you take as fact may not be fact and so you have an obligation to correct not only your mistaken belief, but speak the truth to others even at the cost of pride and ego.   $1.8 from Trump.         Incredibly smart post.   Welcome /u/0_000--let us know what we can do to help you.            Go into lakewood park and walk due north to the lake.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of construction there now, so I don't know how close you can get to it.     I am sorry that this was your experience.  When I got sober in 1986 (for the first 15 years) the only "loss" I thought I had sustained was my relationship with my first wife who had been my childhood sweetheart.  I did lose that relationship but like JBH I was able SOBER to sit down with her one time and express my sincere regret.  Unlike JBH it was way too early in my recovery and I'm afraid it sounded like nothing but words, meaningless words.  And the damage I had done by then was not repairable with words.  As JBH points out, honest words gain credibility with honest actions.      I am not going to drink TODAY in solidarity with you.   Wow, awesome!  I see where Slip has already added you to DINOs.   Bridgegate   LOL, I'm amused and all you had to do was describe the idea.   Thank you for being having the courage to be honest.  I would encourage you to go back through your post and comment history and try and get as honest a grip as you can on why you decided to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Why was it important in the first place?  And now, what do you think you're missing?   You know if you ever read [my Saturday Share](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) how relapse worked out for me, so I'm not going to lecture you.  I will say that if I knew then what I know now--I would have begged my friends to lock me away until the impulse passed.  I barely averted death, for what?  To pour alcohol down my face!  What a waste.  My friend, I understand the impulse.  If you spend anytime sober you probably can't avoid the thought that you're missing something.  New craft beers, fine wines, parties, events, sophistication--in my experience it was all tears and ashes and tragedy.                [My wife loves Firefighters, and she's a lawyer not a firefighter.](https://www.ffcommunity.com/)      Hang on to the hope, it lights the way.   This "terrible," "awful" deal is all about engagement with historic enemies.    Double-D this is a delight.   I'm not good with internet hugs; but I will offer you some hope.    My marriage was past due for divorce when I returned to sobriety in 2009.  We both had had destructive affairs. My HS sophomore son was trying to figure out if he was gay; my HS senior daughter was pregnant.  I was losing my professional license AND going to federal prison.    Flash forward nearly 6 years, we are still married and very close and affectionate.  Life is complicated and relationships are complex.  My son is an award winning professional actor, comedian, and college student; my daughter is a college student; and, my grandson who lives with us, is the light of my life.   What changed?    Me.  I changed.  I got sober and stayed sober.  I dealt with my legal consequences honestly.  I went to counseling and stuck with it.  When my daughter needed recovery I was at every family night.  I did not change my wife or kids, I changed ME.  And as I changed everything around me changed.        I am half-way through this bio-history by Tim Weiner and it is bringing it all back into sharp focus and with almost all of the mysteries surrounding these years--solved.  Riveting is not too strong a word.      Overdue process.    What is wrong with citizens expressing their concerns about the military potentially infringing on their rights?  None whatsoever.    But if this is the first you've heard about it, then you have been living overseas or off the grid.     This is really strange.  When the folks (including CJ Maureen O'Connor) claim judges need a pay raise because they are overworked and underpaid, Judges like Russo graphically illustrate why this is bullshit.     Missed it; thanks.         I think this is right.  Here's what I KNOW happened: he enters a guilty plea to a federal felony and as part of the pre-sentencing process there is a standard psychological assessment that turns up paranoid and delusional disorders that are concerning to US Probation and the Bureau of Prisons.  As his behavior under their supervision becomes more bizarre--instead of sending him to prison the US District Court seeks a mental health assessment and recommendation.                     This is one of the major steps forward in my life when I got sober.  I decided that I would "give in" to the world as it is; not as I would have it be.  When I did this everything got better.  As a metaphor, it's like a lot of athletic endeavors: when you ski, road cycling, play tennis--if you let go and lean in, counter-intuitively you gain control.  I had to stop "forcing" myself on the world.                           Love it!   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; another SOBER hump day in Cleveland.         Hey, /u/swiggitty -- I'm glad you came out of lurk and posted.  Welcome to the sub.   What worked for me was getting a support network in place BEFORE I set out to confess my sins, or make amends.  The wisdom of others was essential to me in avoiding unnecessary pain on those I hurt.  I'm not saying that I was taken off the hook in any respect--but, I found effective ways of getting honest and making appropriate amends.  Hard on myself, easy on others was a good rule of thumb for me.            You probably can't read the new posts and comments on /r/stopdrinking for anytime without coming across a slew of posts in which newcomers talk movingly about shame, guilt, remorse, and regret over past misdeeds.  Most of our misdeeds, as bad as they were, harmed only ourselves, but usually we hurt close family, friends and co-workers.  If you are anything at all like me you wanted a clean conscience and you felt the immediate compulsion to run out and confess and apologize.  STOP.  Honesty does require amends, often confession or apologies but as I said yesterday in my [Brutal Honesty post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3d67e1/brutal_honesty_is_not_honesty_its_mostly_just/) don't confuse honesty with brutality.  Our need to get honest is not a license to HURT others.  Ever.    So how do we move forward to right past wrongs?   AA meetings helped save my life, but I augmented them with seeing a psychologist in my early days sober.     Glad you made it into the lifeboat.  When I came back from a relapse in 2009 I was losing my professional license, and going to prison.  I got sober and changed my entire life.   Why not go to an AA meeting?  I would if I felt like you feel, in fact I go when I'm feeling great.   Hey, /u/Kev131 -- did I share the [Baby Steps post with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something in what I did to stop drinking and get sober will be helpful to you.   Welcome /u/Allied_Biscuit to /r/stopdrinking  Maybe you aren't an alcoholic but living without booze makes a lot of sense.  One of my closest friends in the World is a leading Class Action attorney and philanthropist--a total teetotaler.  Like you he had a family history of alcoholism and he CHOSE to not drink.  And yet he is the life of any party he's at.  So at this [link is the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which summarizes what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck.   Ha, ha, ... perfect.         Sorry.  I probably wouldn't have posted the link at all but one of the newer mods took down my link to the TimesDispatch story about the Circuit affirmance of the corruption conviction as off-topic.  This article points out why it is totally on-topic.   Beautiful comment.  It gives me goosebumps.   Surly Long Haul Trucker            Great update.  Good luck on the interview!   Welcome /u/Garrosh1981 to r/stopdrinking--I did (and do) the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I see you're hesitant about AA meetings, so was I.  I'm glad I went though.  Good luck to you and welcome aboard.   I love traveling sober.  I hit up AA meetings wherever I go: Cape Cod, Florida, Chicago, NY, Toronto, even...just out of town.  It's a remarkable way to get out of the tourist or travel bubble and feel at home anywhere.      Pretty much the standard advice for newcomers to /r/stopdrinking who don't really know if they want "to quit drinking" and who consider themselves "borderline" is--don't quit.  Quitting drinking implies permanence.  Instead STOP drinking for 30, 60 or 90 days and see if abstinence helps you get some clarity about your relationship with alcohol.    Of course, many of us feel tremendous empathy for your horrible childhood, but it's not that unique in reality.  There are those of us with much better and those of us with much worse upbringing. Many of us can wallow in the misery of the memory of rotten parentage.  The question really is: what do you want to do with your life.  Personally, I chose to live and free myself from the legacy.  I do something I call [the Baby Steps every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) to stop drinking and to get sober.  Thus far I'm in a far better place than I've ever been.  Come jump in the lifeboat, if only for a month or two.  Begin with a decision not to drink TODAY, only.  Good luck.   In recovery, (for me, AA meetings) there are systematic ways of approaching the changes I needed to make and a process for making amends to the people I hurt.  Meditation is a huge part of that process in my experience.   Great comment.     Keep using this forum for this confessional or any other sober purpose; we are your support community focused on helping one another stop drinking.      She made them smaller.

A moral imperative to reduce suffering in animals does not mean that animals must have rights. Just as a moral imperative to keep your city clean, or not to tread on the garden flowers doesn't suggest rights for the city or flowers.

I've asked Dr Marvizon about the seeming contradiction. Will report back if I hear anything.   This is meant to be a scientific forum. Dr Mavizon is discussing the capacity for different types of suffering. He needs to define it because IT'S SCIENCE. You don't argue "it doesn't matter which way the blood flows, as long as we all agree its moving". He is explaining the different ways in which humans and animals can suffer and the different capacities different species have for it.   "A measure of self-awareness and deep suffering exists in elephants and cetaceans, which also have a highly developed anterior insula and ACC with von Economo neurons."

 The vast majority of studies find limited or no interaction between dietary Mg and Ca intake and absorption of each mineral.  When massive amounts are ingested, the transporter proteins approach their limit; if one mineral is consumed in much greater quantity than the other at these levels, then it will inhibit absorption of the other.  Many studies have established that these effects are rarely, if ever relevant to actual human mineral intake (because the quantities needed to produce this effect are so high).  Note that this is only relevant if the minerals are taken in a form that will dissociate into + and - ions before absorption; this is probably not the case for amino acid bound minerals, which will generally be absorbed along with their amino acid.  The antagonistic effects referenced in the second paper refer not to absorption mechanisms, but to the ways that Ca and Mg interact once inside the body (i.e. after absorption).  This has to do with how the body uses Ca in muscle contraction and nerve signal conduction, and how Mg interacts with those systems because of its similar physical properties.  If you're curious about how these minerals interact inside the body, you would do well to pick up a basic physiology text and read the chapters on muscle contraction and nerve signal conduction.  That last paper was a study of only 5 individuals, conducted about 50 years ago.  It is not a good source of educational material for someone trying to understand how the body absorbs and uses calcium and magnesium, which is far better understood today than it was in the 1960's; its only relevance today is historical.  In practice, there is no need to consider absorption interference between minerals - as a consumer, you can just follow the recommendation of your doctor, or the sane advice of a respectable nutritional columnist (such as those you could find on WebMD, etc).   Bleghhh :(  An obvious fiction.   ###Submission Statement  This editorial presents a timely and insightful exploration of a passive, isolated, and entertainment dependent generation, with particular emphasis on the sociopolitical implications in our increasingly totalitarian society.  Not everything the author had to say is particularly convincing without prior agreement on the reader's part, but his writing is very thought-provoking.       It wasn't a direct comparison, and I actually felt the example was appropriate.  I know it's popular on Reddit etc to dismiss anybody who mentions Nazism while discussing current events, but that doesn't mean it's correct.  Totalitarian societies, including our own, inundate the public with a steady stream of propaganda accompanied by mindless entertainment. They seek to destroy independent organizations. In Nazi Germany the state provided millions of cheap, state-subsidized radios and then dominated the airwaves with its propaganda. Radio receivers were mounted in public locations in Stalins Soviet Union; and citizens, especially illiterate peasants, were required to gather to listen to the state-controlled news and the dictators speeches. These totalitarian states also banned civic organizations that were not under the iron control of the party.   The corporate state is no different, although unlike past totalitarian systems it permits dissent in the form of print and does not ban fading civic and community groups. It has won the battle against literacy. The seductiveness of the image lures most Americans away from the print-based world of ideas. The fascination with the image swallows the time and energy required to attend and maintain communal organizations. If no one reads, why censor books? Let Noam Chomsky publish as much as he wants. Just keep his voice off the airwaves. If no one attends community meetings, group events or organizations, why prohibit them? Let them be held in near-empty rooms and left uncovered by the press until they are shuttered.     I've actually researched this topic in some depth, and my views are based on my own review of research in curcumin bioavailability conducted over the last several years.  Anyone can google the subject and learn for themselves that the gain in bioavailability of expensive proprietary preparations like the one you recommend is actually quite similar to bioavailability of curcumin + piperine in the appropriate ratio.   I think your best bet would be to either google calcium and magnesium absorption, or pick up a basic physiology text and read the chapter on the small intestine (depending on your level of interest).   That doesn't seem like a fair characterization to me at all.  It seems like you came with the explicit goal of disproving *something*, without regard to whether that something was actually an intended claim of the author (or actually false).   What a pleasant surprise; it is long overdue for Reddit to have a place to discuss anarchism that is both civil and untainted by political moderation.  Thank you both for your work - I trust that the sub will improve immensely under your stewardship as a platform for reasoned debate.   Where's the **trigger warning** OP?  You patriarchist cisgendered white oppressor scum!   It's extremely rare for the best, most extreme version of a supplement to give the best return on investment.  Better to go with the advice of /u/Breal3030 above:  get curcumin and piperidine in some cheap form and take a little extra.  You'll get the same effect as spending $$$ on the ultra super bestest most bioavailable form.      I pretty much agree with your analysis, but reject the conclusion that only idiocy can explain David Cameron's position on encryption.  Politicians often push for legislation that they know will not pass, and which they do not want to have pass.  They may wish to force other politicians to commit to opposing the legislation; they may wish to create apparent evidence of their deeply held political convictions.  They may wish to distract public or political attention from some unrelated topic.  They may wish to pass related legislation that is less extreme or more nuanced.  Etc.  I think it is much more likely that David Cameron's position is simply disingenuous.   Fair enough. 3   Look, I get it - you think I'm a tool.  I don't really care.  My purpose in commenting here has been to expose a false claim, by showing why that claim was false.  I have not claimed any special authority nor knowledge.  I think you would benefit from some basic self-education in the methods and history of science.  Goodbye.   No; in fact, neither of us knows.  If you intend to post authoritatively in science-based subreddits, you should gain a basic education in science.  Everything I have said in this thread is implied by the basic principles of science.   Fair enough - I was wrong, that is the tolerable upper limit for supplemental Mg set by the NIH.  It's worth mentioning what that limit represents.  A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.  This is the amount that the NIH has good evidence is safe for anybody to take, every day, indefinitely.   That is true, and I'm aware of it.  However, this property of glycine does not imply that taking magnesium glycinate in any particular dose is likely to have caused the symptoms described.  An appropriate source would be something like a clinical trial showing that a comparable dose of glycine produced similar symptoms.     **You are not a source**.  You don't have any way of knowing why whatever experience you had occurred, whether it was caused by glycine or magnesium or something else entirely.  /r/Supplements is a science intensive subreddit, and for good reason - science is the best basis we have for making judgements about what supplements to take.  It is not appropriate to make authoritative claims about how supplements work and why on the basis of your personal experience.   I don't believe that this is true for amino acid bound minerals; they should be absorbed via the normal route for that amino acid, and not by the Ca/Mg ion transport.   Do you have a source for that claim?  It sounds plausible, but I have never seen any evidence.   I'm fairly certain that you're wrong about that.  Do you have a citation?   I wouldn't pay any attention to it either way.  When you notice that this sensation is distracting you, just return to the technique you're using (which, presumably, doesn't include messing around with emergent sensations in your body).  What you're describing sounds like a very common experience, and one that I've also experienced now and then.  Sometimes it comes along with other, stranger experiences, but usually it's just that forehead pressure.  I feel sensations in other parts of the body people like to talk about as energy centers sometimes, too.  I just keep doing my technique and let the experience be whatever it's going to be.  No big deal.   I guess we won't agree on this.  Why should you participate?  Because you care about other people, about the fate of your descendents, and of the species and the planet.  If all you'll ever care about is yourself, and you won't be satisfied until you're free, then your best bet is probably to kill yourself right now - you're in for a miserable life (ironically, one that seems to have been pulled right out of a Hollywood revolutionary meme).  Anyway, if you want to debate what makes a good life, we could do that - I think it's an interesting topic.  But somehow I don't believe you're interested in changing your views on that in the slightest, nor on presenting a genuine argument for your own views.     All the numbers are right there in the passage I quoted...  Poll found 59% of Russian respondents saw US as a threat. Of those 59%, 31% were worried about a possible invasion. .59*.31 = .18, rounded up to 1/5.  Slow down - all you needed to understand that for yourself was a level of reading comprehension and arithmetic skill possessed by older children in most civilized countries.    From that perspective, there is no point - I can see why you'd like to believe that immediate revolution is possible.  But strong desire is not evidence, and revolution is not possible in this political climate.  I hope you don't take what I've said as a claim that all we should do is pursue change through within-system political action, writing your congress-person and voting and so on.  That would be naive as well.  I think there's a role for that kind of thing, but only when we organize.  When 500,000 people march in the streets and write their representatives and vote a certain way, it does make a difference.  Laws change, politicians change, public awareness and debates change.  It's a small step, an incremental victory.  But that alone won't get us much at all.  There's also a role for violent protest, property destruction, radical political discussions and so on. When systems disruptions reach a certain scale, they also force change in the action of corporations and governments, which must adapt when vulnerable capital is destroyed by activists.  These things are also small, incremental victories (at best).  They effect public opinion and shape debates, and they may change the policies of those in power for the better at times (by making oppression more expensive).  They may draw interest to anarchist ideas and causes.  But it's no revolution.  You aren't going to overthrow the fucking government at a rally, or burning down a housing development or whatever.  This stuff is incremental change, laying the ground for a future dramatic shift.  Some people are better suited to masking up in black and setting police cars on fire in a protest setting; others may be better suited to arranging letter-writing campaigns and politically correct rallies.  Still others may be better suited to starting a cooperative business, which may also be a community meeting place for local political groups run by those inclined to such things.  You know, all of that is really important.  It's all laying the ground for greater incremental change, which may eventually enable that dramatic shift we'd all like to join in our lifetimes.  I think we can appreciate it for what it is, and have good lives even if that shift doesn't come for a very long time.   It could only happen if you received secondary screening for some other reason.  This can happen for all kinds of reasons, and perhaps even at random; you don't have to have done anything wrong.  I don't know whether they check this at all, but would assume that they could during a secondary screening (they empty your whole bag and look at everything).   The title claim is not true, and is a central claim in the article linked.  The [source](http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/05/13/russians-see-u-s-threat/) for that claim is linked in the article.  It states:  According to the Russian polling group Levada Center, 59 percent of Russians see the United States as a threat, reports Global Post.  ...  Of those who said the U.S. is a threat, 31 percent are worried about the possibility of an American invasion and occupation of Russia.  That is obviously quite different from the 1 in 3 claim in the title.  At best, it could be construed as a 1 in 5.  Even that is a great stretch.  This isn't very good journalism.  The piece misconstrues its evidence in an attempt to convince Americans that WW3 is just over the horizon, and that ordinary Russians are worrying about a US invasion.  Well, why does Vox want us to believe that so badly?  It obviously isn't because it's true - if that were so, they would have cited evidence that actually supported their claims.   This is a bad idea.  OP has the packaging from their pharmacy.  If they open up the bag to look at your pills, you want it to look like you ought to have the pills.  Prescription drugs in a Tylenol bottle look suspicious.  In a pharm bottle with your name on it, not so much.   **You sure showed her**.  Who cares?  Go start a cooperative or throw a brick at a pig or something.   I do the same, but have yet to be selected.  I gave this a lot of thought the first time I was called.  On the one hand, I felt a visceral resentment at being compelled to participate in this cruel and inhuman system.  On the other, I could not ignore the possibility that by being on a jury, I might save some fellow person from the violence of that system.  I remember waiting in the courthouse the first time I was called, just waiting around for hours before we went for selection, wandering the halls a bit.  And one of the security guards suddenly told me to sit; once I did, several police officers walked quickly past, escorting a woman who was handcuffed to one of them.  She looked so sad.  They went into a courtroom.  Not long after this, I decided that I would do whatever I could to get on the jury if I had the opportunity.  I couldn't ignore the potential to help; it was just so awful to see that woman, confined by those horrible people, facing the possibility of imprisonment.  When we were called into our courtroom for selection, all that happened was that the judge gave a brief speech about the greatness of the American trial system - and then sent us all home as the defendant had just accepted a plea bargain.  A lot of big important thoughts for nothing. :P   I think that's a naive and unrealistic view of the present situation.  There is absolutely no possibility of revolution, in that sense.  Now is the time for gradual, incremental transformation and growth.  With a solid foundation, sudden, dramatic shifts can happen in time (as they have always occurred in the past: in a context of incremental change).  Political candidates can be a part of that; your framing of revolution now vs. embracing useless liberals as our savior is simply not applicable to reality.  We can use politics to increase awareness and shape debates.  The goal isn't to elect an anarchist or some idiot idea like that.  The goal is to use politics to serve our subversive aims in the long run.  Pretending we can just skip to the revolution is simply naive, and I think betrays a lack of understanding of how dramatic political change has occurred in the past and can be expected to occur in the future (and perhaps an excessive appetite for actions movies).  edit:  Filled this out as you deserved a more considerate and nuanced reply than I first gave.   Yes, you'll be fine.  It isn't a high volume, and it doesn't look sketchy - it's an obvious personal use amount, in the packaging from your pharmacy.  If it comes up, you'll be able to talk your way out of it by just telling the truth.   I have to agree: OP hasn't even attempted to establish that educational games of the 90s failed, and has an uphill battle to fight if they want to try.  Gizmos   Gadgets was a great game, and taught many good lessons about how to understand engineered systems and manipulate them to achieve a goal.  It also taught many basic lessons of science education (e.g. how to classify and understand different kinds of energy in a physical system).  It is one of many fun and effective educational games from the 90s.      No shit he's not a revolutionary; nobody in their right mind would claim that he is.  Who cares?   I really think it's a very childish attitude to reject all attempts at within-system or incremental change - a lot of folks here even oppose attempts to bring anarchist ideas into the  public's political consciousness.  Anarchism will not happen overnight, and it will not happen through a revolution that wasn't preceded by a long, incremental undertaking to *at least* bring anarchist ideas into public awareness.  It can only happen with broad public support and participation.  **It is great news that there is an American presidential candidate talking about labor empowerment and workplace democracy.**  It doesn't mean he's a good person, or an anarchist, or that him being president would get us closer to anarchy, etc.  It's good because it's bringing anarchist ideas, or ideas closely related to anarchism, into the public's awareness and into the set of ideas that can enter mainstream political debate.  There can't be an anarchist revolutionary American politician - how could there be, when the goal of such a person would be to tear down the American political system?  Saying "don't be fooled, he's no revolutionary" is incredibly childish and naive.  Of course he isn't a revolutionary - nobody with the slightest understanding of revolution could possibly believe that he is.  So I would argue that this is about as good as it can get in American politics.  Are we going to have mainstream political debates about fucking *labor unions and worker ownership of capital?*  That appears possible now.  These ideas are extremely intuitive to working class people - this could produce a lot of support for a movement toward a genuine participatory democracy in this country.  It's a lot easier to get to an anarchist revolution from participatory democracy than it is to get there from Republican vs. Democrat sheeple politics.       Yeah - that's a really bad idea.  There is plenty of good evidence that eating tons of sugar is awful for you, regardless of the source.  There is nothing natural about eating tons of sugary fruit all the time; it is not part of our evolutionary heritage.  It is not good for you just because it is fruit.  It's heavily bred, relatively healthy **candy**.  The original plants these foods are descended from were 9/10 seeds and nowhere near as sweet.   So what?  Decision making shouldn't be based on absolutes, but on what we can do to improve things.  Weakening cartels seems like a good thing - that they will survive doesn't contradict this.  They'll be weaker.   Oh, my mistake.  Yes, I still argue that cats may as well go out.  Oh my god - people disagreeing on the internet!

Support our family farmers and the American Way of Life^^TM !  **God Bless Amur-cah!**    I think your workaround would successfully dodge the system, and would give the players an edge.  But as I see it, the goal isn't to eliminate all possible ways to gain an unfair advantage.  The goal is to make it inconvenient enough that nobody would do it.  I think my proposed solution would accomplish that for a wide range of player populations, as you can adjust the cutoffs as population grows.  When the player population is low, the computational resources needed are low, and so are the costs to the player for cheating (it's easier to cheat because you have more repeat matchings with friends).  So you set the cutoffs to be quite generous.  This means you have to run the statistical analysis on a greater proportion of players, but that's ok because there are few players.  When the player population is high, the computational resources needed to do the statistical analysis are very high.  The resources for identifying an abnormal winrate remain reasonable, though - no statistical analysis necessary there.  So you set the cutoff for an abnormal winrate much higher, and analyze a lower proportion of users.  That's ok, because users are rarely matched with friends at random in a high population; it's relatively harder to cheat anyway.  So I think with appropriate cutoffs for initiating analysis and for sanctioning the player, this system could make the attack you suggest infeasible in both high and low player populations.   I'm not sure I understand; are you claiming that human death and bird death is equivalent for my purpose?  It isn't, simply because human death is not inevitably violent and painful.  Old age is not a cause of death in prey animals in the wild.  Old prey animals are almost universally consumed by predators before any "natural cause" can take them.  Besides that, though - the question of responsibility and not wanting it seems like a reasonable objection to me.  I just don't have any problem with it, personally, unless what I'm doing is actually making things worse for the birds.  Responsibility alone doesn't matter to me.  I don't eat animals, because it disgusts me - but also because if I paid for meat, I would be contributing to the meat industry and its horrible treatment of animals.  I would be enabling them to harm more animals, and making the situation worse.  But what if I came across a dying animal in horrible pain, that couldn't be saved.  You bet I would kill it right there if I could!  I'd gain responsibility for its death, but I'm quite sure it would be the right thing to do, as it would reduce the animal's suffering.   Interesting discussion, thanks for linking.  I especially enjoyed this:  The Occupy camp in the richer section of town was nice though, the rich folk would go home at night and hire off duty officers to guard their tents (which were brand new and top of the line, bought just for the event). I had the feeling those protesters might not have fully understood the movement. The younger officers picked up some nice extra pay though.   Yeah, I think you're onto something there...   Or go to your local library!   Extremely misleading title.  If you want to make that claim, you should at least use research in whole organisms.  There is much more appropriate scientific evidence available from that recent mouse study, if you want a thread to discuss how this effect is applicable to human use.   Instead of forced anonymity, you could do this:  First, have no party mechanic for FFA (as you described).  Second, have the system analyze win rates periodically for users whose rate indicates unusual success.  Use a statistical analysis to determine whether each player's wins can be predicted by their being matched with another specific player.  Check if the prediction can be done both ways.  Players who both consistently win more when matched together than not, to such a degree that it cannot be chance, are sanctioned.   There is nothing wrong with it.  It sounds like the smell built up in the air in the bottle while it was left closed for so long.  As long as it's in capsules and the capsules haven't got wet or anything, if you air it out the smell should not return strongly.  But even if it does, it's just what NAC smells like.  The NAC itself hasn't changed.   I don't see how it matters what they're killed for.  If someone killed me, I would object because I don't want to die, and I don't want to feel pain.  I don't really care *why*.  I see it the same way with animal suffering.  It's bad because it hurts, and because the animal presumably doesn't want to die.  Like, animal cruelty is not less bad in a slaughterhouse than it would be in a torture chamber.  It's bad because of the suffering, not the motives of the killer.   That number is probably skewed by inclusion of feral or rural cat populations.  Sadly, they cite no source - so there is no way of knowing what the figure actually represents.  It should not be used as evidence for any specific population's longevity.   Oh, no worries.  I like to bring out the evidence when a conversation turns to empirical questions, such as whether cats are killing a significant number of birds that wouldn't otherwise get killed by some other predator.  Thanks for the link.  It gave strong summaries of studies in which specific ecosystems' stability was compromised by cat populations (e.g. a park in California with ground-nesting birds lost its ground-nesting birds).  So it appears that cats can definitely mess up some ecosystems.   Thank you!  That second article in particular, I found very balanced and thought-provoking.  I suppose that in practice, the question of harm is treated as subjective.  But the question of whether a particular species is a threat to the stability of the ecosystem is an empirical one.  It looks as though outside of island ecosystems and certain niche habitats for ground-nesting birds, cats are not a major threat to ecosystem stability.   I have a hard time seeing how if the victim would soon die some other gruesome death anyway.  This stuff isn't happening in a vacuum; these animals are all going to die.  So it seems to me that if cats can be shown to make the situation worse, then what they do is morally relevant.  But if it can't, I have a hard time seeing why it matters which gruesome awful death birds suffer.   You could use the technique to build a set of roots, which is then used to build a full vocabulary by combining and elaborating on these.  From the OP's words, you might make roots out of "ray" and "loah", "etia" and "nav"; then use "in", "gni", "man", "ero" etc. as prefixes and suffixes.   Everything you said makes sense, but you didn't cite a single piece of *evidence*.  I could as easily write paragraph that sounds as true and supports the opposite conclusion, but they couldn't both be true.    Wild animals die, and get maimed, etc.  It's a fact of animal life.  If my cat doesn't kill a bird, it will probably suffer some other painful, violent death as a prey animal.  Unless cats can be shown to increase the cruelty of an ecosystem, I don't think cat-induced horrible deaths are morally relevant.  This is an empirical question; *where is the science?*   Praise Jesus!  God Bless Amur-cuh!   the study found no significant correlation between genital dimensions and race or ethnicity, although Veale points out that **their study was not designed to probe such associations, because much of the data used were from studies of Caucasian men.**  Obviously this meta-analysis is not evidence of a difference, nor of a lack of difference.   I've seen the numbers estimating how many birds and small mammals outdoor cats kill each year, but I'm failing to see any demonstration that this is harmful to the ecosystem.  Can anybody offer evidence that it is?   Traditional Western Christian values have been proven to be effective mechanisms to promote the function of society.  Interesting...   Presumably this sample is drawing a larger proportion of non-Asian men than a worldwide representative sample would.  So you'd expect OP's mean length to be significantly longer than the worldwide average.   Haha, yes.  When I first started lifting (late in college), I "grew" about 3 inches.  Some of that just had to be a really late growth spurt, but a good bit was the result of strengthening my postural muscles and getting my spine back to its natural position and length.  Glucosamine might facilitate some of those postural effects, according to the discussion in that paper you linked.   He's a Republican senator from Kentucky.  He has to support the coal industry to stay in office.  Political candidates positions are **not personal**.  They're strategic.  Some of Rand Paul's positions make me feel like vomiting.  That's true for every major candidate for president I've ever seen; some of Bernie Sanders' positions are absolute garbage, truly asinine ideas designed purely for popular appeal.  These people are politicians in the American political system; of course they're going to have some horrible positions from the perspective of any reasonably intelligent person.  I would vote for Rand Paul in some matchups; in others, I wouldn't.  You could do a whole lot worse, sadly.    DINOs   What's a DINO?    At best, that could be an argument for further research to test whether a longer trial would produce more growth.  But lets do the math:  in the clinical trial, they took glucosamine or placebo for 2 months.  You took glucosamine for 6 months.  Your height increased by about 25mm.  Their height increased an average of 3mm.  Imagine if they had continued the trial for 4 more months.  You'd expect another 6mm, right?  So a total increase of 9mm on average.  Even if you assume the most favorable possible interpretation of the results, the effect found that study cannot possibly explain your experience.  At best - and this is an extreme stretch considering how weak and contradictory the results of that study are, and how unlikely a continuous, 6 month long growth induction by glucosamine is - it might explain about a third of your height change.  It's interesting to fantasize about, but I don't believe there is an actionable hypothesis to had that involves glucosamine inducing growth.  If you read the study itself, you'll see that their data are extremely weak: the two examiners doing the height measurements disagreed with each other throughout the study; their height measurements have an error range that's about as large as the reported effect.  The distribution of height changes among participants has a st_dev approximately equal to the reported mean.  For perspective:  this level of variation in height is easily accomplished by a wide variety of chiropractic interventions (e.g. a 2-second back crack).  Just adjusting the alignment of the spine is more than enough to induce a change in height of several mm.  There's a reason this is published in a chiropractic journal, and not a reputable scientific journal of physiology, developmental biology, etc.  Chiropractors are not scientists, and a chiropractic journal is not a source of scientific knowledge.  If this did gain publication in a scientific journal, it would be published as a preliminary trial; the only reasonable scientific conclusion to be drawn is that more research is warranted.  I'm not saying it's all woo woo or something - just trying to put this in perspective.  There is no scientific evidence that glucosamine induces growth in the sense you've imagined.   You don't know whether it worked for you - you only know that you took this stuff, and 6 months passed (during which a hundred billion other things happened), and now you're about an inch taller.  This experience provides no evidence whatsoever that glucosamine can cause people to grow an inch.  You have as much reason for believing that pretty much any other thing that occurred during those 6 months caused you to grow.  Think about it.  Which is more likely: that study with the placebo controlled double blind trial of 40 people was wrong about how much growth glucosamine induces, or you're wrong about your causal attribution?  It's unlikely that you're both right.   From the study you linked:  'The increase was not huge - it was between two and four millimetres - but this is a significant finding-Osteoarthritis affects an enormous number of people.  'Glucosamine could be helping to reverse the pressures caused by standing upright. It could also be regulating the production of cartilage components. Supplemenation may either increase the total body height of the average person or reduce the amount of normal spinal shrinkage during the day.'  So the effect was very, very small - 2 to 4 **millimeters**.  If that's the best scientific evidence for glucosamine induced height increase, then it seems extremely unlikely that more than a few millimiters of your change in height could have been caused by glucosamine.     Huge landmass, no clear reason for many existing national borders.  In the real world, national borders tend to follow strategic geographical features.   No need to be condescending.  Your post wasn't very clear (still isn't, to be honest).   Now gays can marry!  Isn't that great!  God Bless America!  This is so great, I'll just forget all about that huge fucking ~~trade~~ multinational corporation empowerment treaty that's about to ream us all in our collective sociopolitical assholes.  Yeah, let's just talk about ANYTHING ELSE OH GOD PLEASE GET MORE STORIES ABOUT WHATEVER ISN'T TPP QUICK, THEY GOT BORED BITCHING ABOUT FLAGS   There is a third: the one who would have sriracha and avocado in the fruit bowl, too.   Please tell me they'll ship us dank beans for our bitcoin?  **Shut up and take my money!!!**   Well, you're in the wrong sub for that (probably the wrong site, too).   The sarcasm runs deep with this one.   You might perceive it differently if you were part of the half of the species who gets excluded by this.  Or I guess you might not.  I am also a man; it doesn't seem relevant to me.  My objection is rational, not personal.  I agree that my extension to racial slurs is a stretch.  But think about it:  how effective is it, really, to give an important word two contradictory meanings?  Can you really use "man" to refer to half of the species at the exclusion of the other half, and also use it to refer to the entire species, without causing confusion?  Is there anything *good* about doing this?  The reason the word "man" was formerly used to refer to the entire species is complex, but in essence is something called *patriarchy*.  The male sex has long been seen as both superior and as the default human state.  This is why the word *woman* exists: we refer to half the species as a modification of the other half (essentially: wife of a man).  Isn't that fucking weird?  Well, I think it's weird.  The word woman is widely accepted by women and men alike as perfectly fine, so whatever.  But why use the word "man" as though it represents a gender-neutral word for humanity - it hasn't been that for over 800 years (it was gender-neutral over 800 years ago, before modern English had formed, and before anything like "woman" was a word).  It strongly implies that men are somehow more fundamental to humanity that women, which is obviously not a helpful connotation when we're talking about our species.  Anyway...thanks for engaging me in dialogue.  Always nice to get something that isn't a one-line jab on Reddit. :)   I'm neither.  I just don't like to see language used in a needlessly pompous and exclusionary way.   Yeah, I see it similarly.  I also tend toward reasoned debate.  But some people like mockery, and don't care for reasoned debate.  And it does seem that these people have to mock *something*; the mockery will continue.  I'd rather see them mock with a decent intention, like in im14andthisisdeep and iamverysmart etc, than just mock for no good reason.    Sex and relationship experience is an incredibly important part of the human condition (especially in my demographic)  I won't dispute this.  Sexual relationships are a central part of the human experience.   and I think I am missing a key component of my humanity by not being part of this.  Yeah, you are.  **But**:  I am a defective human being.  That is ridiculous.  You have no reason to think of yourself this way.  I hope that I can convince you that all this negative thinking about *yourself* is baseless.  It's not your fault, and this doesn't mean there is something terribly wrong with *you*.  Sex and relationship are considered normal in society, so I am right to feel embarrassed at having no knowledge of something so basic and universal.    You have more knowledge than you think.  I was surprised at how automatic everything was when I was in my first few relationships.  You know, I didn't have to learn how to do very much at all; some social customs, sure, but it really wasn't that important.  I knew how to show interest; I knew how to express sexual feelings, and to see them in another person; I knew what to do in the bedroom well enough.  All of this seemed to have been prepared in advance, to be running on some combination of instinct and unconscious social learning over the years.  You know, the biggest problems I had were from things I learned from relationship advice and watching movies / pornography.  Once I had deprogrammed that bullshit, no problem.  Human beings know how to have sexual relationships out of the box.  Not consciously - but when the time comes, you'll have a pretty clear sense of what to do if you aren't busy thinking a bunch of stupid shit you learned "about relationships."  That's just me and my experience, but I'm not special.  My first relationships were late, and I was an introverted nerd in high school and much of my college career.  Once I was comfortable enough to approach people, everything just worked.  Like it should!  You're the product of fucking millions of years of fucking.  Sex is in you.  Sex and relationship experience is something that needs to be worked on to be perfected.   Yeah, maybe, I dunno.  Relationships are definitely something you can get better at.  Sex is too, but I really don't think it's a big thing.  The first time I had sex, my partner had no idea it was my first time (one time thing).  The next time I had sex, that partner had no idea it was my second time.  They all assumed I'd had sex plenty before, because I was old enough to have and I seemed to know what I was doing.  But relationships...yeah, there is a learning curve.  But you'll figure it out, and you're surrounded by similarly inept people.  This isn't exactly the golden age of human interaction; lots of folks just do the same shit they saw their parents do when they were growing up, and learned unconsciously - they're pretty much at your level, as you've got that inborn and unconsciously learned set of rules too.  If you pair up with someone who's a bit awkward like I'm guessing you are, and you both genuinely like each other as people and as sexual partners, it'll work out fine.  You'll both learn together, you know?  It's sweet.  And you don't have to read a how-to manual first, you just have to go meet a lot of people until you happen across a match.  So yes, there's great depth of learning and growth to be had in the social aspect of a sexual relationship.  That's good news, because that experience is available to you and your future partners.  It makes it exponentially harder to find meaning in life.  I get that.  Yeah, you should be directing significant resources at finding friends and mates right now.  Though once you've done that, I think you'll find the meaning of life or whatever is just as elusive as ever.  Still...it is nice to be able to share the human condition, such as it is, with a close and trusted partner.  But yeah, you won't find the holy grail in another person.  So if that's your quest, it really isn't that relevant.   I was reasonably careful not to frame it as man/woman, but men and non-male people.  Why can't we all just be men?  Because "men" has an existing meaning - a meaning that meaning excludes about half of the human species, and that isn't going anywhere.  People will continue using the words "man" and "woman" to talk about each to the exclusion of the other (there is nothing wrong with that in my view).  So it's no good to have *either* of those words also used for 'all human beings,' unless you're ok with implying that men are *extra human* every time you refer to humanity as "man."   No, you didn't.  The connotation matters; the way an idea is framed *matters*.  It has a powerful effect on how something reads, even if you understand the literal meaning intended is in conflict with the presentation. Just saying, after the fact: "oh yeah, that sexist language that excludes have the species: yeah, it really doesn't.  women are men too!" doesn't fix anything.  If you think that was a good fix, then by extension you should think there is no problem using the word nigger to refer to black people in conversation.  What?  The literal meaning is just "black person" now - all that slave stuff is long behind us!  Why are you people so upset about it!   You must be either very attached to me be wrong, or not very smart, or not really paying attention.   If a person claims to be rational in all things, but is irrational about something, then that indeed would be hypocritical  I suppose it would be, but it's not what I was saying at all.  My "rational person" does not have to be completely, perfectly rational in all things; they only need to be rational enough that they can't hold plainly false views on the subject at hand.  Anyway, who cares.  This isn't an interesting point; you aren't engaging in a genuine attempt at debate.  Just trying to show yourself that I was wrong about *something* - doesn't seem to matter what, as ever post you make a new false characterization of what I've said. :P    Interesting take on it.  I can see how this *could* discourage a person from a genuine attempt at intellectuality, at thoughtfulness and insight.  But I see it more as ridiculing fairly transparent attempts to look super smart and insightful without doing the legwork to actually become intelligent and learned.  You know, I think it's a good thing to give harsh negative feedback sometimes.  You could nip something in the bud that, if continued, would waste a huge part of someone's life.   I think you misunderstand me.  Being irrational isn't hypocritical, no.  But a rational person *claiming to hold a plainly false view* is **absolutely hypocritical**, because it is not possible for a rational person to *actually* hold a plainly false view.  Or, if you want to use a very narrow definition of hypocrisy that only operates on ethical views, just stick "ethic" in there instead of view.  My arguments still run just fine that way.   Ahh...ok, so you assign moral status on the basis of inborn human biases that cause us to value another being's life on the basis of how close it is to *us*.  Yes, we have a fundamental disagreement about where morality comes from.  I acknowledge the *experience* of loved ones being more important than strangers, of those with close genetic similarity to oneself seeming more important than those who lack it, but deny that this has any direct relevance to the question of whether any particular entity's wellbeing is ethically relevant.  It seems to me that to do otherwise would serve as justification for racism, speciesism, and a whole host of other really awful ethical positions.  Anyway, cheers. :)   **Ohh, the great wonder of *man*, and *his profound* search for meaning in the words of *great men*.**  p.s. **Penis.**  I feel quite strongly that it is intellectually dishonest to offer quotations in outdated, man-centric sexist language as though they are great and profound, implying that there is no problem at all with using language that excludes the non-male half-ish of humanity from a conversation about something entirely independent of masculinity.  If the idea is so great, it will survive a light revision of pronouns.   I wonder: what do you mean by thought-stopping?   Beautiful.  I love the contrast of realism in the knee, arm, and face, with impressionist droplet and heavy brush patterns that dominate the rest of the view - especially the implied bounce or splatter in the strong vertical of her calf and the brush patterns that rise up from where her foot meets the (assumed) ground, and the splashing sloshing spiral of her dress where it meets her thigh.   Bleh, who cares.   Regarding potentiation:  I'm afraid I haven't seen any research investigating this.  There is a strong body of research into piperidine (black pepper) as a bioavailability enhancer for curcumin and other natural supplements, but this is a different question really.  I haven't seen any research about galangal, but there is also strong evidence for ginger's cox-2 inhibition.  I don't believe it's been as thoroughly investigated, though - I could be wrong, I just haven't seen any good evidence to recommend a dosage etc.   ...  .......  Huh.  Hypocrisy is essentially pretending to hold some belief, standard, virtue, feeling, etc., that you don't actually hold.  Yet you see nothing hypocritical about someone claiming to hold an untenable ethical standard, that conveniently allows the slaughter for food of *only those animals that that person's culture happens to slaughter for food*.  The way I see it, if I can show that an ethical standard produces ethical claims that are plainly false, then I've shown that it is hypocritical for any rational person to claim that they hold that standard.  This is because a rational person can't be expected to hold an obviously false belief; any person doing so must be a hypocrit.  So whether the standard is wrong, alone, may not be relevant - but if the standard is grossly, obviously flawed, that alone is enough to demonstrate hypocrisy on the part of any reasonable person claiming to hold it, and so it is a poor candidate for changing OP's view.   On that account there is no such thing as objectivity. All thought is a subjective experience in that way. You've defined objectivity out of existence. Yet, objectivity exists. So there is a problem with your definition.  I don't think so.  I was quite careful to include the possibility of objectivity (although that is pretty much an untenable position for other reasons), and the clear allowance of inter-subjectivity.  My point is that rationality can operate on and communicate about both subjective and not purely subjective phenomena.  I'm being very careful with my language so as not to claim that objectivity is possible, but only that *if it is possible, rationality can work with it*.  I guess we disagree about that - probably because we hold very different views on what objectivity and subjectivity are.  A discussion of such views seems beyond the scope of this conversation, to me.  I don't think there is always a clear why for an ethical rule - at some point it is a brute fact. "X is the rule" because "X is the rule". And the answer to why is simply because it is.   If this is the sense in which you're writing, then...well, that's a lot to swallow.  You really believe that an ethical rule that affords heightened moral status to animals on the basis of their being companions to human beings is as fundamental as the speed of light?  And you take the speed of light to be established by a tautology...when in fact, it is established by a far more complex justification that took long decades of observation, debate, and mathematical modelling to come about.  This makes no sense to me; it's really quite astounding.  Either I misunderstand you, or you've confused yourself.   In this case though the answer to why is because companion animals are not just objects but also subjects. Humans can enter into an "I/thou" relationship with companion animals (in Martin Buber's sense). While livestock are objects and not subjects. We can only enter into "I/it" relationships with cows. Confronted with the other we are indebted to the other and owe it certain obligations - including to refrain from killing the other.  Interesting...  I disagree that there is any necessary difference between dogs and cows in this regard.  I guess you view cows as objects, and don't believe that they have subjective experiences?  Or their subjective experiences only matter if it's something that humans can relate to?  It seems quite plain to me that the *kind* of relationship I can enter with a dog is the same as the kind of relationship I can enter with a cow, or a human being for that matter.  It's a limited relationship based on communication through these evolved perceptual and social systems that I have as a human, and that the animal has as whatever animal it is.  The relationship varies in scope and ability between individuals; my relationship with my spouse is deeper and more powerful than my relationship with my cat.  My relationship with an uneducated fool is not as profound as my relationship with a trusted colleague.  But to me, all of those entities are conscious beings that suffer, and it would be equally wrong for me to hurt any of them unless I had very strong justification.  So I don't see the nature of any particular human relationship as a basis for establishing ethical status for any particular entity; to me, its relevance to ethics is only in its utility for humans as a means of investigating which phenomena indicate the presence of another entity with subjective experiences that are good and bad (from that entity's perspective).  edit:  Interestingly, Martin Buber's view was that the "I / Thou" and "I / It" faculties of relation were both equally operable on animate and inanimate objects.  So cows are in!    from where I'm sitting rationality demands objectivity  I don't believe that it does.  Rational thought is a subjective experience in exactly the same way that emotions are.  Rationality can be used to convey inter-subjective or perhaps objective statements very easily, and emotionality cannot.  But rationality *is a subjective experience*, and can be applied to subjective experience just as well as it can be to supposedly objective reality.  For example, I could count how many times I felt happy today.  Tomorrow, I could tell you: I was happy 37 times yesterday.  It's a perfectly rational (in this case, mathematical) judgement based on observation of totally irrational, purely subjective emotional phenomena.  It isn't objective - only I can make the observation.  But it is rational.  But that's not my view, my view is that the ability to communicate emotions to humans is one way we identify companion animals. I don't need to know what percent is begin communicated just that some are.  Ah - so you're actually promoting a rule-based ethic....something like "companion animals should not be eaten."  This is what I'm getting at about binaries.  A binary is a variable that can either be true, or false (or 1 or 0 - it has two possible values).  Rule-based ethics, such as "things in category X should not be killed for food", are essentially a series of rules based on binary variables.  You're either a companion animal, or you're not.  This is why they don't have the same measurement problem as systems dependent on continuous variables (e.g. suffering, which can be great or small or anything in between).  They have plenty of other problems, though.  In a rule-based system, you still need to determine whether a rule has been satisfied, whether condition X is met or not met in each specific case.  Is this animal a companion, or isn't it?  That isn't a trivial question.  It also isn't as big a problem as the measurement of continuous things like suffering, which could be anywhere on a broad scale of values.  But more importantly - *why should anybody care if an animal is a companion to human beings*?  What relevance does this have to whether it's wrong to kill that animal for food?  I get that this would be convenient if you wanted to go around believing it was ok to slaughter pigs, and not ok to slaughter dogs, but *convenience doesn't motivate an ethical claim.*  What's so great about being a human companion, that it demands ethical status?   It doesn't matter to you whether the ethical standard itself is flawed?  In this case, I could just hold an ethical standard that what most people think is ok in my culture is what's ethical...and you would apparently say that isn't hypocritical.  Somehow, I don't think this is going to change OP's view. :P  "It's right *for them...*"   Well, you ignored most of what I said...I'm having a hard time taking this as a serious attempt at conversation.  But ok...  No. Every consequentialist ethical theory that claims to be purely objective has this problem. That's a small subset of all ethical theories.   This is too narrow, I believe.  (Incidentally, you've misunderstood me to be supporting a purely objective theory, which I am not)  If quantified measurement is a requirement for a consequentialist theory, then it seems it would be a problem for any theory that bases ethical status on any non-binary variable.  It's equally a problem if you base your system on whether emotions are being communicated to human beings or not - how much are they communicated?  A lot?  42%?  How do you decide?  You can't, of course.  So you must accept this as a limitation of any theory that depends on a non-binary variable.  Binaries don't have this problem: if you base ethics on a system of laws, you can determine well enough whether this or that legal condition was met or not, and limitation of measurement is of a different kind.    I could easily assume that suffering is only occurring when I observe it and fall into the same error.  This would be an error in your ability to determine the facts of the situation, though - not an error produced by the ethical criterion itself.  How do you measure suffering? How is it quantified?   This is an important question, and one which has been written on and debated extensively by ethicists and other philosophers.  It is not an insurmountable problem for any ethical theory.  It's also equally a problem for just about any ethical theory, though.  How do you measure and quantify whatever it is that you use to determine how good or bad an action is?  Every ethical theory has this same problem.  Suffering isn't subject to "pure and rational judgment" because it is inherently subjective. Does dropping a hammer on my toe cause more or less suffering than being turned down for a date? Does killing a cow quickly and painlessly cause more or less suffering than not being able to afford steak? Does committing suicide cause more or less suffering than living a full life? You can't measure it, you can't compare it, it isn't subject to an objective analysis.  Hmm...  The way I see it, the only comparisons that are relevant are those between two possible outcomes in a single moral dilemma - so let's consider cow slaughter vs steak, since it depends the least on worldviews about life after death, what makes a good life, and so on.  What causes more suffering - instantly, painlessly killing a cow, or denying some people the experience of eating that cow?  It seems that by definition, the cow's death causes no suffering at all, so we'd better slaughter it and feed it so as not to disappoint anybody.  This is a problem for an ethical theory where actions are only wrong if they cause suffering, and there is nothing wrong with depriving goodness - the potential for this cow to go on living a good life is irrelevant, so as long as it causes *any suffering at all* to deny people the opportunity to eat its body, we have to say it's better to kill the cow.  We could invoke an ethical theory that takes good experiences and bad both into account, and seek the best balance of the two.  In that case, it might be wrong to kill the cow painlessly unless greater goodness could be derived by eating its body than would be loss by depriving it of its remaining years of life.  So it'd probably be good to kill it if some people would otherwise starve, or if the cow was going to die soon anyway (which seems about right).  This is probably better than invoking a theory based on human perception of cow emotions, which would probably not have anything to say anyway - this cow is not going to express any emotions during its instantaneous, painless death.  So your idea would imply that it was ok to kill the cow - or any being at all - any time, so long as it's instant and painless.  Incidentally, there is no existent system of meat commerce that involves painless slaughter, nor that slaughters animals that weren't raised to be slaughtered - usually raised in terrible conditions that cause immense suffering.  So the hypothetical is irrelevant to the realities of any actual case of mass meat production.  Even a strictly suffering-based ethic would find almost all modern meat production to be clearly, unequivocally unethical.  You can't measure it, you can't compare it, it isn't subject to an objective analysis.  I disagree.  You can't measure it, sure.  But we can certainly compare.  It's rough, but it's better than nothing.  Just because our ability to judge these things is limited by subjectivity, does not mean it'd be better to make no judgements at all and declare all ethical propositions to be equivalent.   You know, when you frame it as **vegetarianism** people tend to make a big deal.  But most women I've known ate so little meat I doubt they'd notice the difference if it just wasn't around for a few months.  She might gradually adjust with you, without even giving it much thought, even without you having to call it anything..    I'm not suggesting that's the only ethical criteria. You could only reach that conclusion if it were the only ethical critera.   No, no.  I could only reach the conclusion that one is perfectly ok and the other is wrong if that were my only criteria.  But using both a sane criteria (actions are wrong if they cause suffering and there is an alternative that causes less) and your criteria could lead me to think that two things that cause equal suffering are not equivalent, only because one of them isn't as emotionally salient *to me, the observer*.  That would be a mistake.  My example isn't black and white, good vs evil - it's a case that would be clear-cut that's made fuzzy if you judge with fuzzy logic.  My point is this:  your suggested way is a poor way of deciding ethical questions, and should be disregarded in favor of superior means.  Human emotional salience is simply not a good ethical criterion.  It produces all kinds of errors.  It awards ethical status to robots and television screens, if they look cute enough; it reduces the ethical status of retards and animals that don't resemble us visually.  It makes no sense to use, even as *one factor*, because that factor simply introduces error into what could have been a pure and rational judgement based on a superior ethical criterion (such as the suffering caused by a proposed course of action).      Why aren't the euphoric effects mediated this way? I thought that reward and euphoria (the "liking" aspect in "wanting vs liking") are the same thing - can reward not feel euphoric?  The reason there are two words is *precisely because they are not the same thing*.  This is the central finding of all neuroscientific work in addiction and reward pathways - that reward is distinct from experience (how it feels) and also from whether you *like* it (your preference).  Everything else is built on this groundbreaking discovery, which was made decades ago.   I don't believe that it does - at least, not so quickly as you claim.  Can you offer a citation, so that we know more precisely what you're talking about?  Perhaps it's just your choice of language, but you seem to have a somewhat anthropomorphic view of the mechanisms of drug metabolism and of tolerance.  The body does not forget or remember how to metabolize drugs; the liver produces enzymes that metabolize drugs.  The liver does not learn new enzymes; every enzyme your liver will ever produce, you already have a gene for.  The rate at which it produces each enzyme, and each enzyme's effectiveness, can vary in response to a wide variety of factors.  For example, the presence of alcohol induces the liver to produce alcohol dehydrogenase, which breaks down alcohol.  if you drink all the time, your liver gets quite good at producing alcohol dehydrogenase.  This produces some of the variation in response to a drug within an individual over time; how much of the variation is explained by metabolic factors varies by drug, and by other aspects of the situation.   I don't believe that your views on tolerance are in accord with existing scientific consensus; also, I believe that you conflated tolerance and dependence when discussing the ease with which former addictions can be renewed.  Do you have any citations to support your claims - in particular, about single-dose rebound tolerance?   I disagree that it is ethically relevant.  To me, what makes something good or bad is what effect it has on some sentient being, and whether that sentient being suffers more or suffers less because of it.  Whether I can understand it or not doesn't matter one bit - it might lead to me making ethical mistakes, but it does nothing to change *what is right or wrong*.  It's wrong to torture dogs, because it hurts the dogs.  It's wrong to torture cows, because it hurts the cows.  I don't see any distinction at all.  If I also used your criteria, it could only lead to errors.  I might think it was less wrong to torture a developmentally disabled child than it was to torture a healthy child, because I can't relate to the developmentally disabled child's emotions as easily.  Or I might think that torturing a dolphin isn't as bad as torturing a cat, when in truth, it's probably worse to torture the dolphin (as dolphins are more intelligent and aware, and will therefore suffer more).  What good is an ethical criteria that produces errors like that?  It only complicates and confuses the issues.     the ablity of dogs to express human emotion (or mimic it...  Well, by this way of determining whether a living being's suffering is morally relevant, it would be more ethical to slaughter and eat a person who's been paralyzed than it would be slaughter a healthy dog. :/  Your emotional expression / mimicry based ethic has serious flaws.   I disagree with your assessment - I don't believe that you or I have any way of knowing where Voat will end up, based on the little knowledge currently available.  I do see the parallel you're talking about, I just don't think there is any way to predict a complex future situation like that.  All kinds of things could happen.  Given the choice right now between Reddit and Voat, it seems fairly obvious to me that conversations that depend on a strong free-speech platform more than they depend on a massive audience are generally better served on Voat for now.   I also found this concerning, but this doesn't make the two sites equivalent in their degree of censorship and content manipulation.  Voat is still a far more open platform, with less corporate advertising influence, a far more transparent voting system, presumably no vote manipulation, and with far less moderator censorship.  Only time will tell if it will remain this way, but for now, it is superior as a free-speech platform for the vast majority of users (not so much for jailbait, doxing, and stolen nude photos).  	104
 That form requires four stamps! I'm demoting you to rank 658!   Well that was a load off my mind   But surely you must have some other pitchforks we could take a look at!   Paging /u/pitchforkemporium   With a hammer mod I don't see why a clone would be a problem, but my girl only buys clone tube mods. She's bought two so far, and both have fallen apart on her. So I'd be a little careful at least. Rdas are pretty basic, so I don't see any problems with buying a clone of them.    I have an authentic myself, but I've seen some pretty great clones too. I won't buy any clones personally, it just seems like the quality is often times worth the price.  Plus bragging rights!   It hits like a freight train! I have an el diablo tube mod that I really like the look of, but I just can't put that hog down.   I've done a little of it myself but I really like machining fantasy weapons. When I was younger I went to a festival with her and there was this guy who had a truck he blew glass out of. The whole side of the truck folded out into a stage and he'd do shows. It was pretty awesome haha.   The hog is my favorite mod by far. Just wish I could carry it a bit easier! That dewberry cream actually belongs to my woman, I can't stand it honestly. When I bought it for her I thought I'd just use the dripper from a 30 to get it out but I eventually just had to use a funnel. Definitely not my favorite bottle!   They use a small plunger like device, its very crude and will kill all the children ever.   My mom's a glass blowing hippie, my dad's a machinist by day and a drum and bass dj by night. Not sure if that's carnie material, but its a nice thought lol   Hey! You leave my Styrofoam out of this!!  I have a few, but I'm having trouble tracking 4 battery cases down. I'm gonna fab my own out of some wood when I get around to it.   Also, for those who are interested, the black faces on the back wall are flat glass my mom gave me, she blows and sells glass at local carnivals.         The TV isn't actually there. Watch the way it shakes when if hits the ground.      "What's going on here? Is that blood on the grooaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHH"   Very rarely I'll find a wonderball, is that the same thing?

 Thanks for the link. That's some extreme harassment. Seriously, poor guy.    What is this about?   Down in Fillmore for work. Such a beautiful day :)   You're right. So how do we start the revolution *now*? What do you suggest we do at this very moment?  We need stepping stones. Building communes is one way to show folks anarchism can work.    True. I'm sure their own countries have remote areas where they could settle.    Where my clarinetists at! There's at least twenty of us.    The future is online education. Some legitimate colleges (like Arizona State) are starting to offer full degrees online.    Disagree. You can always move to somewhere remote (Siberia, Northern Canada, etc) where, yes, you'll be technically under state rule, but you'd be so far removed from society that no one will care.   I've long thought of setting up a commune in the Western US to do just that. Something akin to Slab City.    People actually live here   If you're good at telling bad jokes, add some.     One time I stole a pen from a government office.   That quote is absolutely helpful, I'll definitely say something like that. Thanks!   Yes! Wound up with a net positive of one stapler and a basket of fruit.   MTurking, and reviewing my job offers (currently sitting on three, and possibly a fourth).  One of my offers requires me to work with Aussies. Not sure how I feel about that.     If I can, I'll give you an example I just used myself a few hours ago.   Me: So I've previously worked in [non-related industries].   Manager: Then why are you looking for a job with solar?   Me: I'm looking to get new skills and learn new things, and I know solar is an up and coming industry. Plus my family back home is getting solar panels so that gave me the idea to apply.   That was it, and the hiring manger was impressed.  :)   Something creative, different.    Generally that's a good sign. You usually need two pieces of government documentation to prove who you are, for security purposes.     Another thing is if you're applying for something outside your industry, just say you're trying to diversify your skill set.    Are you more or less applying to the same industry? If so, it shouldn't be hard to give a similar answer each time to certain questions. I mainly apply for sales/customer service jobs, so no matter who's asking, I have similar answers prepared.    So, I've been job hunting for a while and was at an interview today and completely screwed up. I was *not* prepared to negotiate salary, and when asked what I was expecting for pay I just said ten to fifteen, not realizing they meant salaried (when I was thinking hourly).   I do have an offer from another company at 15/hr + commission. If the company I interviewed with today calls me back with an offer, can I counter with the 15 (assuming what they offer is less when I do the math)? Or am I screwed?    If you're American, there's plenty of land to do something like this in the western states (Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho). And your be left alone, mostly.    See if you can donate to a local chapter. I work for the ARC (Services to Armed Forces), and our office could always use physical and monetary donations.     Non-profit and customer service/sales. Thanks for the suggestion!   Thanks! I'm definitely bad at keeping my shirt straight. I think you're right about a solid color.    So far I've done a grocery store, sales (offered), a warehouse (offered), and I have a call center and a solar panel technician interview today.    Thanks! Pants definitely are a bit on the bigger side. I guess I haven't seen it as much of a problem, but it doesn't mean I can't try something more snug :)   Here's how I've been dressing for interviews this week (business causal).  Thoughts? Not sure if the colors work for me.   http://imgur.com/VkvQRJ2     I've had a total of 5 interview this week, and got an offer for a $15/hr sales job. I suspect I'll get offers from the other places too. It's nice to have choices.    Ran a mile. Nearly died.    Only share if they're really specifical   Are we invited?   Lots of silence, lots of pot lucks, and no crying children :)  And a LOT of theological diversity. Met a guy once who said he was a Lutheran-Quaker hybrid. Who knew that was a thing.    Deism! I wish that was an option.    It's pretty easy to spot cliches and tell folks which ones should be removed.    I have one, and I get double takes from people. Like, I'll ask for my credit "cahd" and people think I'm speaking Norwegian.    Why do you drive manual like some sort of commie?   Three favorite drummers, go   [Adding to the fire](http://okcupid.com/profile/leftclickmyface)    What;s your favorite cereal?   I'm sorry, what is that?   Military Mentor. I need more clients :c   Do you have a Bostonian accent?   What's it like living in oil country?   I've done VISTA, and now I'm with S/N.  Let me say I much prefer S/N, as I'm allowed to do direct service. Within my first week as an S/N, I was meeting clients, handling their cases, and feeling good about my job. VISTA (which dos not allow direct service) didn't give me that feeling. I'd have clients come into my organisation's office asking for help, and I couldn't give it. Felt bad.  That said, I feel like VISTA can give you better job experience after your term ends, as what you're doing will typically be more professional.    Some of us are just bored at work, man.    What was dating like for you in your teen years?  I was an independent white kid.   Probably Craigslist. I've seen a lot of stories of people getting their gear back by checking there.   The clients cases I have to deal with tomorrow. I'm near positive one of them is lying to me to get benefits he probably doesn't qualify for.   Close! You're thinking of the *Shakers*, who were an offshoot of Quakerism. They lived in Massachusetts and died off about three centuries ago, due to their abstinence.  Modern Quakers practice sex, although due to a lack of proselyting, Quakerism *is* dying off. Most Friends are older, so the faith will probably die out by the end of the century.   I have, sort of. I converted at 15 on my own, was active for about a year or two, then went inactive because I just wasn't serious about it. Went four years without religion until I found the Quakers.   Now various life choices have placed my in Provo, so I've started attending services again. It's a hard transition, and I'm working on getting my testimony built back up. If I fail to believe again, I'll still attend services so I can learn and make friends. What's been nice is my bishop and a few others know I'm not LDS, yet they've all been very accepting.    The company that owns my apartment complex and a few others sent an email to everyone today saying various bikes and even a car have been stolen from some of their properties recently. If you keep your bike locked up in a garage, I'd recommend moving it your room (if you're allowed to).    Be on the lookout!   "But isn't that freedom of speech?"  No, I won't give context.   Khakis, red polo, brown shoes for the first. Easy v   I'm going through Adecco now. So how was your overall experience with them?   Thanks!   Thanks!   Try craigslist. Guaranteed success.    You didn't fill out the "Message Me If" section. I've come to think that's a pretty important part, so I wouldn't ignore it.   I had some flexibility with mine, but only by a few days, as I was driving cross county to get to my service project.    Did some selfies today at work. Which ones are good, which aren't?  http://imgur.com/a/zWaE4     I feel you. I served as a VISTA in central Wyoming where there was absolutely nothing to do. I wound up leaving my program, as it just wasn't a good fit, and now I'm with the Red Cross under S/N in Utah.  Let me say that I had extreme anxiety for a few days after my VISTA term came to a close early. I was only able to really make it by moving in with an aunt in Salt Lake. So I recommend trying to find some contacts before you quit and move, people who would be willing to help you out in a pinch.  If you don't know anyone (and it doesn't seem like you would), find a job first. Being unemployed sucks.   Worked with veterans under VISTA, never took a drug test, nor was the need for one ever mentioned.   To find a job that pays me in dogecoin   That's neat! So it's a government run lottery, right? Never played so I wouldn't know :)  I'd pay my rent in advance and fix up my car!   What'd you spend it on?  If you won 500, what would you do with it?   Would you do your best friends job for a month?   This is a good point. I'm a government employee, and I have a strict set of rules I have to adhere to when working. For example, I can't do anything regarding unions, can't do any sort of of work related to politics, and so on, for the same reasons you said.    Good luck out there, stay positive.    Work! Visiting a veteran in his home tomorrow, and might be doing some work recording a couple vet stories.   I've used a picture which, if you reversed Googled it, would you lead you right to a news article about me, giving you my full name and some things I said to the press.  I wouldn't care if someone did that. I was a "public figure" briefly, so whatevs.   I'm fairly upset at myself. Went to a concert on Friday with a group of friends from church, knowing a girl I like would be going as well. We all went (there was maybe 8 of us) and stayed as a group *the entire time*. I could never manage to find a moment to pull the girl aside and ask her out.  I was stressing out about it the entire time.   There's another church activity tonight, so maybe I'll have better luck there (though I doubt it). Grrr.     A lot of animal rights activists fight for animals to be better treated, not totally free. So, for example, a lot of actives don't think cows and pigs should be kept in small cages and physically abused. Some will argue those animals should be totally free from ownership, but that's not the majority. They just want the animals to have a good life before being killed for food.    Only sometimes?   I remember watching the process. She liked me, I went to her profile and saw nothing was there. I refreshed for a second and saw her building her profile. Watched her do the whole thing while she went from green to red in no time.    Bad spelling and grammar should not be a good indicator.    Going out with a friend, watching the rain. It'll be a good night.    Removing the negative subs would cause such a huge uproar. It very well could push more people to voat.co   But don't you want to know they can't live without oxygen!?    Assume you have total control and can do anything with the site.    It's going to turn some women off, for whatever reason, but you can set your preference to search for all who like bi men, which will include bi women. It makes the search easier.    He's used Tinder, and got a brief relationship from that.    I have a good friend who's blind. He can easily use the Internet using a program called JAWS, which more or less lets him browse the internet and use a computer. I've seem him use an iphone too where he just swipes in certain directions and the phone will tell him where he's at (settings, Facebook, etc)    I'm listed as Bi. No idea if it hinders me with woman, but it probably does. That said, most if my high matches are bi women, so at least there's that.    Get drunk, ask to kiss her, nothing to lose.    /u/Trollabot train_subject1687   Bummed. Went out with a few friends tonight to a concert. Wanted to ask out a girl in our group but never got the chance to. Will try again Sunday when I see her again.    I expect my partner to cook everything. If they refuse and force me to cook, we'll need good home owners insurance.    What have you got to lose other than a few bucks and some time?    Problem is, if he says no in the balloon, there's no escape from it being an awkward encounter. That does sound nice though.

There's always /r/SaltLakeCity or /r/Utah   Actually, if that *really* is the case that would be fine. She'd probably get a hot chocolate or something. Plus, some Mormons *do* drink coffee (even though they aren't supposed to).    It's a little worse in terms of diversity down here in Provo.     VERY. I'm in Provo, Utah right down the street from BYU. Mormons get married *very* young compared to other faiths (which is why Utah is the youngest state-there's a high birth rate). I'm within the Mormon dating scene, and right now everything isn't that bad, but I imagine it gets harder during the school year. A lot of women leave for their missions too, which saturates the market (female enrollment at BYU dropped when women were allowed to serve at a younger age, starting a few years ago).      No. I've been on 5 or so dates. All were well.    No. Some people just don't drink. She could be a Mormon.    Thank you for the response. I personally know nothing about RIDE other than it's existence, so this was very useful.    My church (Quaker) does this, like many other Quaker churches. Someone will share a thought prompt, and others will respond if they feel moved by the spirit.     Where are you doing this?   Not really. If they have a great profile, then they have a great profile.    Try turning him on and off again.    Thanks! I'm vaguely aware of those denominations, but don't know their theology much, so I'll look into it :)   Like which ones? I can think of the Unitarians and Quakers, but neither have creeds about believing in the Bible, nor do they have any sort of religious doctrine.   (I'm only asking because I just don't know what sects you're talking about, and I consider myself a Christian, so I'm just curious because I like exploring different denominations)   Like?   True, but most sects would agree with the verses proclaiming the importance of marriage and the shaming of adultery.    No. My grandparents married at about 20 (grandma) and 40 (grandpa). Love is what love is.   So what did support tell you?   Yes it's a bad move, I wouldn't do that.    I was in Japan with a student travel group for two weeks. One of our stops was Kyoto, which is a really pretty city. Being an adventurous 15 year old, I decided to leave our group hotel in the middle of the night to explore the city a bit. Eventually, I got lost and started panicking.   Then, I saw a police officer. Thank goodness! So I approach him.  "Sumi-ma-sen, do you know where ABC hotel is?"  The police man shakes his head and says, "No English."  I say "arigato" and turn around disappointed. But then I remember my hotel had a specific coffee shop inside of it, so I turn around again.  "Sumi-ma-sen...Starbucks-u?"  The police man smiles and points me the way. I was very thankful for capitalism that day.   	110
 A high sodium intake will make you look bloated and it will make you heavier on the scale due to water weight, but it won't actually increase adipose tissue percentage. Sodium contains 0 calories, and so it doesn't actually go through your body's metabolic pathway.    Unless you've been diagnosed with anorexia or some other related disorder by a health specialist and you literally look shredded to the bone, I'd argue that this is very unlikely. Simply put, if it jiggles it's fat, and if there's still clearly visible fat, then there's still fat to lose. Plain and simple.    Hats off to you, my friend! Congratulations on your achievements so far and I'm sure it's just the beginning!    When I was at 25% body fat... People told me 'wow, you look good now!', yet I had a clear belly, had low self esteem and thought of myself as an ugly fatass back then...   When I was at 20%, people told me 'you're good, you don't need to lose weight anymore!' Still had no visible abs, still thought I was ugly, still didn't like myself, kept going...  When I was at 15%, people told me 'dude, your dedication is amazing, and your physique too, but I think you can stop now'... Bullshit, I still saw no abs, still had plenty of excess fat...  Then, after 6 years and a half, at the age of 21, I finally hit 10% or close to it. Now people weren't saying 'you don't need to lose weight anymore', they were saying 'dude, amazing lean muscular body! How'd you do it?'  Morale of the story? Whatever people tell you, smile, ignore them, and keep doing your thing. People will be unable to understand, they will be jealous, they will claim to be supporting and helping you, yet most of what they will be doing is throwing their laziness and ignorance in your face. It will be hard, but their negative thoughts, beliefs and attitudes will serve as the fuel that will help you keep going when you will barely be able to hold on, when it will feel like the hunger is literally killing you from the inside, when you'll be so tired that every single regular workout will feel like crossing a mountain.   You may not relate, but that's my experience anyway. I had no support from anyone, not from my relatives, not my friends, not from my co-workers, not from my classmates. They all had shitty eating habits when I started, and they still do to this day, and they never helped me in anyway whatsoever or tried to understand how I felt.  But all along, all I could think of was how gratifying it would feel to manage to push the limits of mental fortitude and discipline, and to see the beauty of which my body was capable with the right knowledge and work ethics. And I can tell you from personal experience now: it is indeed the best feeling that I have ever experienced. There is nothing quite like looking at yourself in the mirror every morning and telling yourself that this amazing body that you have is the result of YOUR own hard work!  And it sounds strange to say, but with their support, I don't think I would have succeeded as well. Their negativity made me who I am today, for better and worse. I became quite cynical and alienated, but I am closer than ever to the body of my dreams and it is healthier than it has been in my entire life prior to now.    And I don't know who the author is, but my favorite saying now is: 'OBSESSED' is merely a word the LAZY use to describe the DEDICATED!       Bloating is mostly dependent on diet and on whether or not you're using the appropriate drug. Sure, these compounds induce bloating quite a lot, but you can always minimize it by eating clean and having an AI on hand.    Going to start my first cycle in 2 months from now. I'm currently at 12-13% adipose tissue (I can tell because my rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles are clearly visible). Goal is to drop to 10% in order to minimize the estrogen conversion rate, and then inject 500 mg of testosterone enanthate weekly for 12 weeks. I'll be using an aromatase inhibitor from week 1 to 14 (might stop earlier if no early gynecomastia onset), and 2 SERMs from week 15 to 17.   Stats:   Age: 22  Height: 6 ft.  Weight: 185 (12-13% at)  Training experience: 6 years  Diet will be isocaloric, with fructose and sucrose consumption in the morning and post workout only, 4 even and evenly spaced out meals, 500 calories above TDEE.  Workout will be full body workout style routine first month and a half, either GVT or FST-7 in the second month. I will be using various supplements, including a liver support one (yes, liver support is important even if you're not running an oral compound), but I won't post the names unless someone asks me because the list is long.   Might also run one or two daily doses of GHRP/GHRH during those 3 months, haven't decided yet if I feel like spending an extra $200 on injection gear lol.    Yes, but most products that contain cocoa also contain sugar, unless you buy unsweetened cocoa powder or another form of pure cocoa.          If you're eating milk chocolate or candy, there's a problem with your diet to begin with, and that problem won't be solved by replacing it with a slightly less unhealthy substitute. The problem with cocoa is that it's highly caloric and yet not very filling, meaning an overweight person can easily eat 800 calories worth of 80% dark chocolate and still be hungry 30 min later. Chocolate should be avoided altogether for those who wish to lose weight, IMO, its only benefits are the micro nutrients and these can be found in much healthier food products.       The only thing that is beneficial in cocoa is the micro nutrients, which can be found in other food products that aren't as caloric or rich in sugar, such as some fruits and vegetables to give only one example.       In my opinion, this discrepancy between hunger and energy expenditure is the reason why rapidly reaching a new 'weight loss' low in the overweight   obese is simply not an effective long-term solution. If you're an experienced athlete who 'nasty bulked' for 3 months and now wish to go back to your pre-bulk weight, then sure, going on a relatively big caloric deficit or even using a dangerous drug such as 2,4-Dinitrophenol might work. But if you're obese or overweight and you want to go from there to a 'visible six pack weight', first, it has to be slow and steady, and second, you have to accept the fact that there will be mental pain from hunger and all you can do is resist it and minimize it by eating lots of dietary fibers and other nutrients that increase the 'gastric fullness' effect that can be obtained from eating. I have been there. Being hungry all the time is hard, but right now, given what we understand of the human physiology, there seems to be no other way.       Full text available here: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/274080879_Effects_of_branched-chain_amino_acids_supplementation_on_both_plasma_amino_acids_concentration_and_muscle_energetics_changes_resulting_from_muscle_damage_A_randomized_placebo_controlled_trial  Courtesy of /r/AdvancedFitness      I have been questioning their findings as well. IMO there's a lot of evidence that BCAA availability is one of the factors for mTORC1 pathway stimulation and subsequent proliferation of muscle tissue cells.       I would question their methodology and subsequent findings. There is evidence that certain BCAAs, especially leucine, increase proliferation and activation of skeletal muscle cells via the mTORC1 pathway.   'Conclusion:The damaged muscle was **not** able to get benefits out of the increased plasma branched-chain amino acids availability to attenuate changes in indirect markers of muscle damage and muscle metabolic alterations following exercise-induced muscle damage.'            I don't eat at Mcdonalds ever but I don't think it's as bad as a lot of people think. It's only bad because people use going there as an excuse to stuff their face.    Apologies for misunderstanding then. Like I said, I just think that what I inferred from my own pieces of information was plain wrong.    I think you're saying that because you didn't really understand any of what I wrote. 'Outrageously wrong' is some big words. I think all the information I gave out is true, but that my assumption that it equals in it being physiologically impossible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time is very short sighted, I'll give you that. I didn't take into account the fact that, even though fat is in fact always being produced via the mTORC1 pathway, it is balanced out by the fact that some of that fat is also constantly being oxidized to produce energy, like you said.       There are no plateaus when it comes to fat loss... Either your scale weight is affected by other factors, like water weight, due to your nutritional choices, or you need to adjust your caloric intake. If you're at a daily deficit, you're losing weight period.       Thanks for your input. I really appreciate that type of well written answer.    What exactly are you calling bullshit here?       This is troubling to say the least... In this study they discovered that high fructose consumption creates a vicious circle that can ultimately lead to death. High blood pressure causes the heart to require a larger supply of oxygen, and when the body cannot produce enough of that from fatty acids, it will start using sugar instead, by causing the liver to metabolize more fructose. However, fructose in itself raises blood pressure, so this sets off a dangerous chain reaction of which the final outcome is heart failure.    This is troubling to say the least...

If I'm not mistaken, ageing-related disease risk is already being treated with second generation mTORC1 pathway inhibitors.   mTORC1 over stimulation is already well known to be associated with various diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.    I sincerely hope it works out for your boys, sir! (or madam!)  They live in a formidable era of technological advancements, that is for sure.    To add to what you said, the baroreflex is basically a mechanism by which specialized neurons found in the blood vessels of mammals known as 'baroreceptors' communicate blood pressure information to the posterior part of the brain so  homeostatis can be maintained. The baroreceptors 'measure' blood pressure and when it is inappropriately elevated, the baroreflex react accordingly by increasing the amount of water in the bloodstream.    This is the first time that scientists have demonstrated the neurological mechanisms by which dietary salt can promote hypertension. Pretty interesting to read.                Nice discovery, but gene therapy has already been used to treat muscular dystrophy. Recently, Follistatin, an inhibitor of the TGF- superfamily of proteins (which include myostatin, a gene that limits the growth of muscular tissue in humans), has been injected into children suffering from muscular diseases using an adeno-associated virus in order to successfully treat them. After 2 weeks of regular injection, the children had increased muscular mass and strength and were able to actually walk and could function more 'normally'.   Study is available [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322757).          Actual gold.       Steroids are used by the vast majority of professional athletes throughout the world.... It's not just North Korea. =/            The long-term effects of caloric restriction on humans are unknown. We can only hypothesize. No longitudinal study has ever been conducted.    This quote has been used too many times, now it's cheesy.       Yes, speculation. But there needs to be more research in order to test these theories on actual subjects.    Sadly, I don't have answers to these questions. More research needs to be done to answer these, but research on human subjects in the fields of biochemistry and nutrition is costly and hard to make reliable...    The ignorance is giving me a headache...    If I might be selfish, I would really like to see some more research done on the long-term effects of sustaining a high fat and low/no carbohydrate diet on fatty acid utilization during high intensity exercise in athletes.    The mTORC1 pathway is always activated unless you are ingesting literally no calories.  To answer your second question, the mTORC1 pathway is, simply put, a double edged sword, in that, the more it is stimulated, and the more muscular and fat tissues will be produced.    And for your third question, I never eat dairy when I'm cutting, but I cannot attest as to whether it makes more of a difference in practice than being at a caloric deficit alone would. But based on the research I've done, it most definitely does.    Simply put, eating more dairy products is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as it will result in increased production of both muscular and fat tissues.    I know this is going to be somewhat complex science, but please keep an open mind as you read. I want to show you some of the science behind why, beyond just caloric intake, nutrient choices actually affect one's ability to lose/gain weight. I have amassed a vast amount of research over the recent years and I now firmly believe that, for optimal weight loss, one should avoid dietary proteins from a dairy source and, instead, eat mostly ones that come from certain animal/meat sources.   The reasons for this have to do with a vastly complex biological structure in the body known as 'mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1' (mTORC1). mTORC1 is a protein multicomplex. To understand what a protein multicomplex is, one must first understand the basics of biology and biochemistry in relation to human physiology. One of the most important organic compounds in the human body is the amino acid. Amino acids are formed with the most basic elements of life as well as almost everything that exists - the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. There are hundreds of known amino acids, but the ones of interest here are the twenty three ones that are said to be 'proteinogenic', meaning they are used to form proteins, the molecules that perform virtually every single physiological process in humans. When you eat foods that contain proteins, those are broken by the digestive system into amino acids, and these are then used to reform proteins involved in various physiological processes.  How are amino acids used to form proteins? Well, simply put, they are combined together with a bond and into chains known as 'peptide chains', and these chains are in turn combined together to form proteins. Sometimes, however, a larger-than-usual number of peptide chains will be put together, resulting in a protein multicomplex, a vastly complex multi-task molecular structure. An example of that, like I said, is mTORC1.    The role of mTORC1 is essentially to 'create' and then 'activate' all other proteins in the body, and its functioning depends on the availability of certain nutrients and growth factors. In other words, it is responsible for the production of all tissues in the body, including muscular and fat tissues. In the context of weight gain/loss, the more mTORC1 is stimulated, and the more adipose tissue is produced, and vice versa. So, in order to lose fat optimally, you need to not only shrink the body's fat cells by forcing it to use its own reserves of nutrients, but also to limit mTORC1 stimulation. The first factor is achieved almost exclusively by being at a daily caloric deficit over an extended period of time, but the second one is achieved through other means as well. And this is where the relationship between dairy and animal/meat proteins comes in.   Basically, mTORC1 stimulation is dependent, like mentioned above, on five elements that relate to nutrient and growth factor availability:  1) the presence of two hormones, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1);  2) sufficient cellular energy (ATP, which is produced via processing of ingested nutrients from food in the body's main metabolic pathway);  3) the presence of essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine  4) the presence of another essential amino acid, glutamine  5) the presence of saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid  Now let's look at all five points in relation to dairy and animal proteins and mTORC1 stimulation.   1) Dairy proteins, particularly whole milk, cheese and whey protein, have a much greater insulinemic index than any meat protein, mainly due to the fact that they are hydrolyzed (broken down into molecules by water) much more quickly in the intestine,  thus resulting in a greater insulin and IGF-1 response and therefore greater mTORC1 stimulation as well.  2) In order to be activated, the mTORC1 pathway needs ATP, the body's unit of energy. ATP is produced in the metabolism, via the processing of nutrients from foods. Simply put, as mentioned, when foods are digested, they create an insulin response, and the role of insulin is essentially to 'push' nutrients into the metabolic pathway. Therefore, the greater the insulin response, and the more ATP the nutrients transported will produced. Also as mentioned, dairy protein foods create a greater insulin response than meat protein foods do, and therefore, they result in greater mTORC1 stimulation as well.   3) Dairy products contain more leucine. For example, whey protein contains 14% leucine, compared to 8% for meat.  4) Glutamine has a synergistic relationship with leucine, in that it serves as a 'gatekeeper' that ensures leucine uptake by the neural pathway that leads to mTORC1. Dairy protein foods contain more glutamine than meat protein foods do. For example, milk protein has 8g of glutamine per 100g, compared to 4.75g per 100g for beef protein.   5) Palmitic acid also promotes MTORC1 stimulation. Some of the foods richest in palmitic acid include oils, fatty meats, cheese and whole milk. However, the particularity of dairy products such as whole milk is that over 98% of their fat content is made of palmitic acid, making them especially efficient at promoting mTORC1 stimulation.    So, to summarize, the two main ways to promote weight loss are, 1) to make the body's fat cells shrink by forcing it to use its own reserves of nutrients, this is mainly achieved by being at a caloric deficit; 2) to limit mTORC1 stimulation; mTORC1 is a protein multicomplex that is ultimately responsible for the production of all bodily tissues, including fat tissue. The second factor, like I've said, is often overlooked, but the truth is, new research is increasingly finding correlations between MTORC1 overstimulation and a vast array of diseases that have been plaguing society in recent years, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and cancer. For this reason, evolutionary novel behaviors, such as regular consumption of pasteurized milk, might prove dangerous for society in the long run, and might also very well amongst the underlying causes of the increasing rates of obesity...   **Sources**  Bihuniak, J.

Eating 100g of pure cocoa with nothing else added, maybe. Cocoa in its natural form is an excellent source of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, rich in dietary fibers and in various vitamins and minerals, and low in sugar.  But 100g of actual chocolate, with all the sugar included? I find that hard to believe.             Sodium isn't a macro nutrient, and it doesn't contain any calories. It's required in small amounts in order for your body to function properly, and, unlike what the media like you to believe, eating a little more than you're supposed to isn't extraordinarily unhealthy if you're in relative good health and live a healthy lifestyle. If you respect your target caloric intake and make appropriate food choices on a daily basis, supplementing your meals with table salt is certainly the least of your concerns IMO.    Yes. Most definitely!   Then eat less. The main determiner of whether your muscular tissue increases when lifting weights is caloric intake. If you eat more, you will pack on more fat, but also more muscle. If you lift weights while staying at caloric maintenance, on the other hand, then neither will increase; fat and muscle tissues will remain constant while strength will increase.    That lifting will make you 'bulky' is one of the biggest and most irritating myths to have ever been created and spread. And it spread like a cancer, too. Listen, my friend, lifting weights will NOT make you bulky, and neither will lifting 'heavy' weights. First, what WILL make you bulky by society's standards is YEARS of weight lifting combined with eating at a caloric surplus and injecting testosterone and other related compounds.   Also, in controlled lab experiments, rep range vs weight doesn't have any impact on muscular hypertrophy what-so-ever. The only thing that lifting 'heavy' does better is increasing intracellular connections both between the various muscle groups and within each muscle group itself, in turn allowing for better linear progression in the gym.  Lifting weights alone will NEVER make you bulky. And, actually, neither will lifting weights combined with eating at a caloric surplus. You will get more muscular from doing that, yes, but certainly not 'bulky'. Increasing muscular tissue is healthy, and it's especially important as you age, as it allows you to keep functioning normally, not be weak physically, and also protects you from a vast array of aging-related diseases, such as osteoporosis.    I remember when I first started cleaning up my diet and being at a caloric deficit, I couldn't go on for more than 2-3 hours without putting something in my mouth. The first times I went on for long period of times (5h+) without eating anything in order to not go above my target caloric intake, I would walk around the house like a paranoid person, repeatedly opening up and then closing the fridge looking for something low in calorie that I could eat.  I would go to sleep every night feeling down quite a bit and I would dream of when I would finally wake up and eat something. I felt quite miserable pretty much on a daily basis back then, guess that's the price to pay for not giving in. It did feel great though in the morning when I would wake up and realize that I had managed to respect my caloric intake the day before, so there's that.   But over the years, hunger has become really easy to 'resist'. In fact, it doesn't bother me anymore. I can go for 8-10 hours without eating anything, and function normally and still be happy and not go to bed craving for literally anything to eat every night. I didn't really see the process of myself becoming more 'hunger-resistant' happen, it just kind of happened after weeks and months and years of feeling like crap and irrationally dreaming about food. It wasn't sudden, I never felt like I wasn't craving as much at first, but now looking back I can definitely say that I feel better without eating than I used to a couple years ago when I started living a more healthy lifestyle.        Yes, but when it comes to studies on eating habits and caloric intake manipulations, humans aren't very reliable subjects... So it balances itself out, in a way.    Honestly, no idea. They used a newer strain of rats, known as  Brown Norway/Fischer 344 F1 hybrid rats. This is a calorie-restricted strain that is known for gaining extra longevity when used in caloric restriction experiments but for some reason it doesn't show up on any of the rat strain databases that I know of.    Are you implying that rat studies are not reliable?          If someone can edit the title, I forgot to add [Non-human subjects] to the title. This study was done on aging rats known for their extended longevity.         And that's where his Karma pick comes from (LPL).

Thanks captain obvious.                      I think it depends on what you value most in life. Personally, I was traumatized by being overweight as a kid and teenager, and so as an adult maintaining my aesthetic physical appearance and healthy life habits is of the utmost importance, far more important than anything else in my life, even obsessive, and there is nothing, not any person, no matter how I feel about them, that will even come before my desire to maintain a strict lifestyle by my own standards. I understand that I might be a unique case and that it isn't like that for most people, though, I'm just speaking from personal experience.    tl;dr: it wasn't the relationship itself, but an increase in caloric intake caused by a lack of understand of the principles behind nutritional science and brought about by the commencement of the relationship. Like I said, poor eating habits will be poor eating habits regardless of other factors involved. There's no causal relationship like you seem to believe. You can fall in love, and have solid understanding of nutrition, and this will not happen.    You mean those social gathering events where people overeat by ingesting alcohol and eating foods rich in saturated fats and sugars? Impossible, I never attend such events.             Are you implying that I'm wrong?    Sounds to me like you're looking for an excuse for your poor life habits. Dating does not mean you have to overeat. There is a wide variety of things that you can do with your partner/friends and which don't involve the action of eating.    The short answer is: there is no such thing as a 'plateau' when it comes to shrinking cells in adipose tissue. Simply further reduce your caloric intake, and weight loss should resume.     If being in a relationship makes you eat more, you're dating the wrong person. A relationship is supposed to bring something positive into your life, to enhance what you already have and therefore make you happier. If the person you're dating is hindering your weight loss progress with their life choices, like I said, it might be time to go separate ways.    Misleading title. There is no such thing as 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' foods, unlike what society believes out of ignorance. Caloric intake and nutrient choices are what matters, but no nutrient or nutrient combination is inherently good or bad on its own. It's the overall diet that makes the difference.    This.      Agreed.   It is. But increases in transport rate of nutrients have been shown to be a double edged sword. A simple example of that is the fact that insulin can increase transport of nutrients into skeletal muscle cells and activate ribosomal protein pathways, and yet also increases adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides and inhibits the hormone-sensitive lipase pathways.   The role of mTORC1 is merely to activate protein translation... Whether that is a good or bad thing depends on an unimaginably high number of factors.    This post would be more well-suited for a sub such as r/fitness. Here, we discuss serious scientific work that relates to nutrition and physical exercise.          There is much safer way to induce accelerated tissue regeneration locally, it's the use of Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide and Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone compounds. On the other hand, this technique proposed here would probably be much less expensive to use in the long run.

They found no difference in cognition between various macro nutrient ratios, yes.    Nope, most of my friends and relatives eat to socialize, understand nothing of the biochemical principles behind nutritional science, and have overall shitty life habits. I've been on my fitness journey for years, and the farther I've been into it, and the more cynical and isolated I've become. Society is ignorant, and I've come to despise ignorance quite a lot. Long story short, not supportive, except for a few of my Biochem classmates who actually understand these things. They're the people I mostly talk to nowadays.    http://jn.nutrition.org/content/145/4/691.short  This new study was posted in the Journal of Nutrition of the American Society for Nutrition. They tested partially hydrolized whey peptides (PHWP) and partially hydrolized gelatin (PHG), two compounds that contain branched chain amino acids, over a period of 8 weeks on women (aged 18-65) who were losing weight at a steady pace.  When they compared the results using multivariate statistical analyses, they found that the PHWP preparation caused significant improvements in regards to overall weight loss, fat to muscle tissue loss ratio, insulin action, and cardiovascular health.  Like the title states, BCAA metabolism wasn't significantly affected, but the PHWP preparation caused changes in metabolomical patterns that seemed to improve overall health in these women on a caloric deficit.    They found that partially hydrolized whey peptides (PHWP) and partially hydrolized gelatin (PHG) moderately improved overall weight loss ratio, fat to muscle tissue loss ratio, insulin action and cardiovascular health in obese middle aged women on a caloric deficit. When they compared the results using multivariate statistical analyses, PHWP was more significant.   Really simply put, they found that partially hydrolized whey peptides (PHWP) and partially hydrolized gelatin (PHG) moderately improved overall weight loss ratio, fat to muscle tissue loss ratio, insulin action and cardiovascular health in obese middle aged women on a caloric deficit. When they compared the results using multivariate statistical analyses, PHWP was more significant.    What exactly do you not understand, tell me. I can probably answer your questions...    I disagree, and let me explain why.  One the reasons why people initially fail to eat less, in my experience, is because they are unable to consistently less, partly due to their nutrient choices. It's not as simple as telling a person to simply 'eat less', you have to change their nutrient choices in order to enable them to do so, or else, in some cases, they are simply not going to be able to start eating less to begin with.       Whoa, I apologize. For some reason I didn't even remember!!    How is this a repost? Pretty much sure I've never posted this before, and this doesn't seem to have been posted before by anyone else either.             More sugar means a greater insulin response, which in turns means greater fat tissue uptake rate of triglycerides yes, but this only matters if you are at a caloric surplus. If I was you, I'd be much more concerned about the effects of insulin on hunger and satiety.    Sure, caloric intake is what matters... But nutrient choices usually decide whether people are able to consistently respect their caloric intake or not in the long run. By saying 'it's just calories in, calories out' and not at looking what you eat beyond that, you are setting yourself up for failure. I work with obese children whose family is also obese most of the time, and I have seen this happen so many times... Saying 'a calorie is a calorie' is disregarding the fact that there are undeniable differences between the effects of each macro nutrient on satiety, metabolism, hormones, etc..    Nope, trust me, if you know a lot about nutrition, then you know how to use the physiological processes that can prevent you from overeating. People think they're food scientists because they understand the 'calories in, calories out' concept and track their caloric intake on MyFitnessPal... It is much, much more complicated than that. Yes, at the end of the day it's about energy balance, no denying that, but nutrient choices are generally what decide whether people are able to consistently respect their caloric intake or not. Have you ever heard of someone who is on a diet of mostly fats and proteins and also obese? I sure haven't. And, in my experience, even when people track their calories, it never works very well when they eat a lot of foods that are rich in sugar and low in fibers; these people tend to go on huge binges after a while and that ruins all of their progress.    You weren't taught that in school, because the basic biochemical principles behind nutritional science *aren't* taught in school. This is one of the underlying roots of obesity and other metabolic diseases in my opinion... along with our cultural tendency to eat as a mean of socializing, people's inability to differentiate between actual hunger and the desire to eat due to an exogenous factor (boredom, stress, the pursuit of reward, etc.), and the fact that food marketing companies are making a big buck out of getting people hooked onto sugar rich foods.   It's the exact same thing. 'Dietary' merely refers to the proteins which are obtained from consumption of food and then broken down into amino acids for a vast array of purposes. But the issue is that most people don't actually know the types of food that contain proteins.    I have a major in Human Nutrition and I'm currently majoring in Biochemistry with a minor in Education. I wish someone would have told me about how the average person is completely ignorant of what they're putting through their mouth daily. I'm a substitute high School Biology teacher, and I also work with morbidly obese children, and most of the time the rest of their family is equally obese; most parents don't even know what a dietary protein is...                            That's why I keep changing up my routine... Different variations of deadlifts (stiff leg, snatch grip), squats (back, front, box), different angles for the bench and dumbbell press exercises, different forms of cardio (running, alternating sprints and fast walks, elliptical, stairmaster, etc.).    No, but I socialize a lot less than I used to do. I've stopped associating myself with people who look unhealthy and have unhealthy life habits.

I don't believe metabolic homeostatis should be maintained for too long. Evolutionary speaking, living beings best grow and/or evolve when they are constantly forced to adapt. Also, it's in our nature as humans to seek continuous self-improvement in the realm of physical capabilities... Many ancient societies believed that the ideal man is the one who is on a perpetual quest to better both his body and mind... that only he who was a warrior, and then a philosopher, can become a leader (for example, with Plato's principle of the Philosopher Kings). And you can't do that by maintaining homeostatic balance, because it's simply not as efficient, regardless of what you're trying to do; in order to attain your goals, whether it be to become more muscular, stronger, faster or more endurant, sacrifices must be made.    You don't maintain. You pick up resistance training and start being at a caloric surplus again so as to increase the amount of muscular tissue in your body. Being strong and muscular to a certain extent is almost as important for health and longevity as not being overweight; it improves quality of life, especially in later life, and has protective effects against a plethora of diseases (such as osteoporosis).          For weight loss, all that matters is the type of energy balance you end the day with. And the food choices you make only matter insofar as they allow you to end the day with a negative balance.  It's simple:  Caloric surplus = positive energy balance = fat tissue increases. Caloric maintenance = metabolic homeostatis = fat tissue remains the same. Caloric deficit = negative energy balance = fat tissue decreases.  This is the only reliable principle when it comes to weight loss. Everything else is either ignorance or a marketing ploy that takes advantage of said ignorance.    'Hepatic' simply means that which relates to the liver. The glucose from food is mainly processed in the liver.    I can assure that I understand the findings. But I'm somewhat out of touch with what regular people understand. I study Biochemistry and Human Nutrition and work in a faculty lab, and most of my friends work/study either in the same faculty or in related disciplines, such as Pharmacology, Neuroscience, Medicine, Kinesiology, etc. So the people I interact with on a daily basis understand these things very well.    Pretty much, unless, like you said, your purpose is to continuously increase muscular tissue, in which case you would also continuously adjust your caloric intake so as to always stay at a positive energy balance despite the increase in lean tissue.    It definitely supports the use of a glucose metabolism supplement while bulking, such as one that contains corosolic acid.    Definitely, but it simply isn't discussed in this study.    Positive energy balance = you end the day with more energy than your body needs = caloric surplus.  Negative energy balance = you end the day with less energy than your body needs = caloric deficit.  Even energy balance = metabolic homeostatis.    Oh wow. Thank you. I hadn't seen this mistake. I think my auto-corrector actually did that...    I understand your point. I just dislike overly simplified explanations such as the one that asking to 'ELI5' implies, because, even though they enable the uneducated to get a better understanding, they often do at the cost of losing in accuracy. Science is very complex... things can rarely be explained both simply and accurately at the same time, in my opinion. I would rather take more time and give the person a more in depth explanation of the related concepts like I'm doing here.    No, unfortunately, I don't, but the person who does will become very rich. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly widespread amongst laypeople due to the rise in obesity and other metabolic diseases. The causes are unknown and the research is ongoing, but it's most likely related to dysfunction of various metabolic processes as a result of long-term malnutrition, like I said, or at least the current research is looking into that.   	173

 Oh of course not but Fabian will more than likely still say it   If this actually does happen expect stuff like "Christian was my mate, I thought he was staying, there was a lot of broken promises" etc  The usual shite really   It's his release clause   Yeh we definitely should have spent 32.5 million on someone who will sit on the bench, definitely. Also for people who will comeback with Di Maria he was bought to be a starter not sit on the bench it's just not working out at the minute where as benteke wouldn't displace Rooney   Because he was only on loan and still a United player, save that for when he gets a permanent move not when United still own him   Cool   No shit   Same    But we literally have nobody like schweinsteiger, we lost vidic, Ferdinand, evra, scholes, giggs (on the pitch) so quickly that we don't really have any leaders, we have Rooney who can drive us on but he isn't a leader in the mould of a Keane, Vidic or schweinsteiger    Yeh   England. No, they are inconsistent, seemingly don't actually care about the football being played or the fans one iota, easily bullied and just seem like bell ends   We aren't going to sign him   I only post on mobile, United    Now they just have to sign him off us, Real and Arsenal according to the Chilean media   AD the Dutch paper   I'm assuming she told you to keep your foot raised and keep pressure on it and get out of her house and go to a hospital    http://imgur.com/3Ad0rD4  Should hopefully see the discolouration now   Yeh he has the white strapping but I wasn't talking about that, note the brown bandage underneath that further down the arm  	18

 I think the kid at least deserves an audition. But if he can't act or something, I think we should let the casting directors figure that one out, because Han Solo has some very big shoes to fill.   All of UK doesn't have it   You can be in charge of the parades at the end of ROTJ.   Man this is awful, never been to /b/ but didn't know their sense of humor was so shitty.   I don't want Star Wars to go down the path of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Every film in the MCU is formulaic and uninspired. The Marvel movies aren't films as art, they are films as a product. I don't know about you but I much prefer films as art, and I believe Star Wars films have been art for the past 30 years or so. The MCU is entirely forgettable, and that's what Star Wars will become. Soon, Star Wars won't be special. It'll be another peg on the Hollywood machine, and it makes me sad to think about.   Telling the backstory of every character cheapens them. You know what Obi-Wan did while on Tatooine? Nothing. He was a hermit who hid around watching Luke grow up. That's what I think. Maybe you think something different. But if we get a trilogy of Obi-Wan films, then both of our personal backstories are rendered void. And instead we get some generic blockbusters about how Obi-Wan secretly dueled with a Sith or something. I don't want that.   I know I'll get downvoted for this but I'm speaking my mind anyway. What you call enrichment of the Star Wars universe, I call the cheapening of the great original story.   So has comic con started? What are the important dates and times to remember?   I don't know if I'd have the balls to be a smuggler. I'd probably drop my cargo at the first sight of an imperial starship.   Do your patients frequently lose the will to live?   I think I'd like to be a droid mechanic. Building new friends and having fun at markets on Tatooine would be quite the life.   The point of this question is what would you be if you were just a typical citizen in Star Wars, not special like Jedi or particularly talented like Bounty Hunters. Not everyone can be unique like them. Some people just have to be moisture farmers and stormtroopers and cantina band players.   Coruscant. That's the place with the most adventures to be had.   Can't wait for a remastered version when the soundtrack for TFA comes out.   Yeah but the good thing was that you could dismiss it. I, as well as many other people, only care about the films. The EU was great because it allowed for the people who were hungry for more SW content to have access to it. But let's face it, if you made a movie about a cloned Palpatine, or whatever other ridiculous, glorified fan fiction makes up the EU, it would be trash, and it would also detract from the original films. But that's just my two cents.  Same goes with Rebels and Clone Wars. Disney can say that Ashoka is canon, but most people would agree that no, Anakin didn't have an apprentice.   I don't want to know what happened to Han before ANH. Let the viewer decide, because it doesn't matter. I don't want to know how Boba Fett came to be, the mystery that surrounds him is his best part. Don't shove characters into movies based on the fact that people like them, because it can destroy the artistic integrity of their story.   Star Wars is a vast universe of endless wonderful possibilities. Tell a new story for Pete's sake.   This question of "What happened between this episode and this episode?" and "What happened to this character before this episode?" will ultimately destroy the Star Wars franchise. It's fine as books but we're seeing it start with films like Han Solo. Soon there will be a Greedo movie and a Wedge Antilles movie and a young Lando movie and a movie that took place between ANH and ESB starring Leia and Chewie. Or maybe it's just me.   If they had a trailer they would show it at Comic Con, then do an online release after the panel. You just have a confirmation bias.   "There's 100% a trailer this friday guise!"   No new trailers at comiccon - EW  "Oh, I'm being told something from my source... There's gonna be something big this friday! It will bring down the internet! But I can't say anything about it."  Yeah, I don't buy it. He's obviously riding on the assumption that they will show something important at SDCC, then he can say he saw it two days earlier.   The Star Wars twitter account said that they had been following him ever since he did a live read of a Star Wars script as Luke Skywalker. I doubt he's attached to the role of Han Solo.  [Link](https://twitter.com/starwars/status/618634972593700865) and [link](https://twitter.com/starwars/status/618640973271302144) to said tweets.   The more that is revealed about the anthology films, the less optimistic I am.   This is one of the scariest things for me. We get so many Star Wars movies that it loses its magic.   We had three Han Solo films. They were called the Original Trilogy. We don't need any more.   I'm really hoping for unknown actors. It's pretty much a Star Wars tradition.   Anthony Ingruber, the guy who played a younger version of Ford in Age of Adaline. Or Tye Sheridan if they wanna go really young like Marvel and Peter Parker.   If they cast Chris Pratt I will lose my mind.   Adam, are you looking forward to Star Wars: The Force Awakens this year? What are your hopes for the movie?   We are not getting a trailer guys. Occam's razor. It's much more likely that we're not getting one than JJ and EW pulling off some elaborate surprise.   Usually people want to know if a film is good before they buy merchandise. Imagine getting a Jar Jar Binks toy 6 months before TPM came out.   I wasn't an avid leak follower back then either but I can tell you that the novelization of TPM came out at bookstores over a month before the film even came out.   Imagine this announcement: TFA IS HAVING ITS RELEASE DATE BUMPED UP TO OCTOBER!  I'd be fine with no trailer if that was the case   Just a friendly reminder that if you are wrong come Friday, we will all grab our pitchforks and you will be dead within the hour.   I think what they really want to avoid is important plot details getting out, then the general public getting spoilered, then everyone getting mad at JJ.   They know that people will stop at nothing to figure out the whole plot.   He's not dead. [He merely became one with the Force.](http://i.imgur.com/ixjWbqS.jpg)   That's exactly what someone would say if they wanted to surprise us with a brand new trailer       Ok good, dont want to let Steve Jobs take my money   Wait, is it exclusive to iPhone?   Very cool stuff. One thing I hope for the new trilogy is that there aren't too many Jedi. The OT was great cause there was only a few Jedi remaining, and the PT kind of took away from that with the crazy amount of Jedi. An oriental actor with a samurai style is very intriguing though. Also good to see that Asians actually exist in this universe.   Nowhere. The comment is merely discussing this post.   According to a few leaks, Kylo Ren is Han Solos son.  He also [](/s "kills Han in TFA.")  edit: don't know why I'm being downvoted it's the established truth in the TFA leak community.   I think having MVS die wouldn't give as much of an emotional impact as Han dying so I think he should be the one to go. Keeping the old guys around too long could soil this trilogy IMO.   I think it will happen in TFA, and I hope it does, because I think it's a great plot point. However, I am mad that I won't get the full effect because I'm already expecting it. That's what happens when you browse this sub I guess.   Just got done watching About Time, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and 500 Days of Summer. I was wondering if there are any other similar movies in this genre. Bittersweet, romantic, melancholic, and make you think about your own life. It's not just typical Nicholas Sparks romance crap, it has some quality to it. Thanks!    **About Time**. It's very melancholic and romantic, and gives you that funny bittersweet feeling inside. Would recommend for anyone who likes romcoms. Also, I would love to hear some other people recommend me some films based on this one.   I feel the same way, but "You are not my father" honestly sounds like something they would do.   Yes witty banter is fine. I was referring to the CGI Nyong'O that is described as "funny". Sounds reminiscent of Jar Jar.  	43
 I like to think of it as sharing what I have to offer (   )   I posted this at like 3 am last night but thought more people would see it if I deleted and reposted during the day. So you're right.   If fucking only. This was my friend's conversation actually, and he said the most they ever talked about was homework.      Hey Nick! I was lucky enough to be in the audience in Bloomington, IN last month to hear you lay it to our governor for an hour and a half. I laughed/clapped my ass off. I've been trying to apply paddling my own canoe to my every day life. My friends and I actually waited in the lobby to try to get you to read part of a script we were working on. My question is, how can someone make an impact on people they don't know? How did you know cancelling your Indianapolis show would make as big of an impact as it did?   I thought of myself as a big macho scary movie fan until I watched the canal alone at 3 am. The final scenes had me with my blanket up to my eyes, which were as wide as they could be.   Prepare yourself. [Eric Wareheim's CREEPIEST music video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV7VNhzFLOQ)   Okay don't                     What if i'm both? por que no los dos?

He didn't want to be a roast duck. Also, how do you feel about using cream of potato in gravy for biscuits?   Over the summer off the coast of South Carolina, my father and I witnessed a red ball appear floating miles at sea from our condo balcony around 11:30 at night. Of course we thought it was a flare and wondered what we could do to help this lost ship, but the red ball remained visible for a few seconds until going out. About 15 minutes later, the same red ball appeared, then split into two floating balls out at sea. Have you ever heard anything like this before?       Eating biscuits and gravy covered in mustard changed the way i looked at both individually. Imagine.   I may or may not have went through a phase where I would create fake pizza coupons, then when the driver shows up i tip them and they don't know the company well enough to not accept it. I also created a bunch for drive throughs and would say i took an online survey.   I can already feel the welt from reeming my knee on a brass jawbone.   Oh no! It's "idle-glass-of-water girl!"      Mr. Nobody. I know sometimes when a movie is overly complicated just to be complicated it adds the feeling that the producing team is trying too hard, but with Mr Nobody I felt as though i was trying to solve a mystery called what the fuck is going on.   Why did you quit Franklin and Bash, besides the fact that every episode is essentially the same?      When I was eleven I wrapped my pecker in scotch tape, starting at the head and spiraling down. Once I got to the base and the now purple crooked toothpick was beginning to hurt, I knew mistakes had been made. So um, scotch tape.   Riff Raff. I bought my girlfriend a ticket for her and myself to see him 2 Christmases ago, thinking he was funny in anything I'd seen him in. He had FOUR OPENERS, then I realized I thought he was funny because he was joking with his routine and lifestyle but when he came out and danced in his dumb clothes it wasn't a joke anymore. Plus he poured Croc into my underage girlfriend's mouth. Riff Raff if you're reading this I hate you.   Oh shit! Now I have to clean my closet to look for them :c      On toga day of my senior year, a strange autistic kid asked me if togas were flammable. He then asked the teacher for a lighter.

 Yeah, I think that races won matters not win rate. You can have a win rate of 100% and only compete once.  I'm not saying that he's not a good rider. But I don't think that he's the most talented rider.   Win rate doesn't matter really. Ago is the rider with the most wins followed by Rossi.   The trouble with saying "talent" is that it's really subjective. Races won is really the only metric that we can use. And it's what counts in racing.   Define "talent". If you mean winning races then I think you're wrong. And winning races is all that really matters.   Where's the data? What does "best" mean? Muscle activation can be measured these days and I would prefer to see this list broken down by some sort of actual data showing how much more activation these lifts provide than their counterparts.   It depends on what you're trying to get out of coaching and what that coach can provide. Are you looking to learn how to program? Are you looking for coaching on your technique?  Don't forget that just because someone is strong doesn't mean they are a good coach.    I disagree. I'm in San Diego and I can be on pretty quiet roads in less than an hour.  edit: autocorrect   We seem to be on a good upward trend.

How come he slowed down instead of just accelerating through that?    My shins used to get pretty bloody but once I got better at my form they stopped bleeding.   I disagree. They just aren't passionate about racing and racing does nothing for them in terms of development. I imagine they see it as a waste of time and money to participate in racing.   Which is a shame because their bikes definitely have the potential to do well.   I don't think that Ape is tarnishing their image really. They aren't a well known brand and they are getting what they need out of GP by actually racing. They have proven that they can do the WSBK thing pretty well already.

       No paywall here. This is the rest of the article, aside from the actual decision which op linked above.  "Federal agents do not have unlimited power to search laptops and other electronic devices without a warrant at the border, including airports, a federal judge in Washington said.  U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected prosecutors arguments that a laptop was like any other container that could be searched at the border without a warrant. The border search doctrine had limits when it came to electronic devices, Jackson wrote.  Given the vast storage capacity of even the most basic laptops, and the capacity of computers to retain metadata and even deleted material, one cannot treat an electronic storage device like a handbag simply because you can put things in it and then carry it onto a plane, Jackson said.  Jackson is the latest judge to confront warrantless searches of electronic devices since the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling last year in Riley v. California. In Riley, the justices said police generally must get a warrant before searching a cellphone, acknowledging the vast amount of personal information those devices hold.  Citing Riley, Jackson said she would apply the same approach as the high court and weigh the degree to which defendant Jae Shik Kims privacy was invaded when his computer was searched against the governments national security interests. Kim, a Korean businessman, was traveling home from the United States in December 2012 when a U.S. Department of Homeland Security special agent seized his laptop and sent it away for a forensic examination.  She wrote: The imaging and search of the entire contents of Kims laptop, aided by specialized forensic software, for a period of unlimited duration and an examination of unlimited scope, for the purpose of gathering evidence in a pre-existing investigation, was supported by so little suspicion of ongoing or imminent criminal activity, and was so invasive of Kims privacy and so disconnected from not only the considerations underlying the breadth of the governments authority to search at the border, but also the border itself, that it was unreasonable.  Jackson tossed out incriminating evidence investigators discovered stored in the laptop, which prosecutors used to charge Kim with violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.    Kims lawyer, David Deitch of Ifrah Law in Washington, said Jacksons ruling made clear that the government will still have all its rights to protect the border if it is doing searches that are designed to thwart crimes that are afoot at the border crossing.  This is a really interesting and unresolved area of the law right now because, as often happens, were taking 17th century concepts of privacy rights and trying to apply them to 21st century technology, Deitch said.  A spokesman for the U.S. attorneys office in Washington said they were reviewing the ruling.  Jacksons decision was the second in the past year in the D.C. federal trial court to address warrantless searches of laptops at airports. In December, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras rejected a motion to suppress evidence filed by another defendant charged with sanctions violations, Shantia Hassanshahi. Hassanshahi claimed the government lacked reasonable suspicion to seize and search his computer. He also argued the search was unlawful because investigators discovered his phone number using a secret law enforcement database.  Contreras found there was reasonable suspicion to search Hassanshahis computer. Law enforcement had reason to believe Hassanshahi was doing business in Iran, the judge said, including an earlier federal investigation into his activities involving Iran, his past travels there and the fact that he was carrying multiple electronic devices that appeared to be inconsistent with just personal use while traveling.  Jackson said that Kims case was different from Hassanshahis because there was nothing about Kims particular travel plans that would arouse suspicion; he was returning to his home in Korea and he was known to have business operations within the United States.  The next hearing in Kims case is scheduled for May 18."    Part of me wants to go all conspiro   believe that this is just a cover for a strategic take over of the territory, because no way can those running our governments be this fucking stupid!   thanks for thr giggle:)   "REUTERS - Israel has reported an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu virus in the north of the country, two months after declaring a series of similar outbreaks earlier this year had been resolved, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.  High pathogenic H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths.  The strain is different to the H5N2 strain that has been spreading in the United States, leading to the death or culling of nearly 30 million birds so far."         http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-plants-think-daniel-chamovitz/         Looks like we got lucky this time:)   this is seriously wrong on so many levels.   yea this isn't the one they are talking about, thank goodness.

"We looked down and were not expecting to see the drop off, because normally the sand over here is just about even with the rocks, Moore said, pointing to the sand along the coastline. Now it's probably dropped off 8-10 feet especially up under the pier so it was really a shock. Then we walked down the beach (towards the north end) and to see how much of the beach was gone was really surprising."  "However, Town Manager Michael Cramer said in the grand scheme of things those damages are minimal.   "Really our storm damage reduction program is having the benefit that we want it to have and that is stopping any of the wave action from damaging business, damaging personal property, or our infrastructure, Cramer explained. So the fact that we have the dunes, that's working, and this is just a normal process of maintaining and keeping those dunes up so we don't have major damage when we have storms like this."  Kramer said the damage that was done is easily fixable. Officials are looking to add a few steps to some accesses that were hit the hardest by the erosion to make it easier for people to get down to the beach.   Also, the town has contacted a contractor to re-stack the rocks along the 1500 block of Carolina Beach Road North, past the Carolina Beach Pier. Some of those rocks have been disheveled due to Ana's impact."

'The volcanic eruption warning on Mount Hakoneyama was raised to Level 2 on May 6, meaning that people should stay clear of the crater on the mountain that straddles Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures.  The Japan Meteorological Agency had maintained a Level 1 alert although earthquakes around the mountain intensified in frequency and strength over the past 10 days. This is the first Level 2 alert for the mountain since the system was introduced in March 2009....'  From RSOE "An eruption warning has been declared for the volcano, as increased seismic activity under the wakudani hydrothermal field were registered during the past days and could herald sudden phreatic explosions. The Owakudani valley lies north of the central lava domes inside the Hakone caldera. Seismicity started to increase in late April, consisting mostly of swarms of shallow quakes at 2 and 5 km depth. More intense swarms have occurred during the past days, triggering the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to raise the alert level of the volcano to 2. Simultaneously, slight deformation of the ground was detected and it appears that fumarolic activity has increased in the past days. Japanese authorities have closed access to the area, which is a popular tourist destination. After the deadly, sudden phreatic eruption of Ontake-san volcano last year, the risk of such eruptions has been taken very seriously. Whether or not an eruption will occur at Hakone in the near future is impossible to say. Similar seismic crises have occurred in the past with no eruption following. The last known eruption at Hakone occurred in 950 AD."

MANILA, Philippines (AP)  A Philippine volcano has spewed ash for the second time in less than a week but there were no signs of any imminent violent eruption, the country's chief volcano expert said Thursday.  Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon province southeast of Manila ejected ash 250 meters (825 feet) above the 1,565-meter (5,165-foot) volcano late Wednesday, said Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.  The agency asked local officials to keep people away from a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) hazardous zone around the crater, he said. He said aircraft should not fly close to the mountain to avoid any sudden explosions and ash clouds.  Solidum said the explosion was due to ground water coming into contact with hot rocks and not rising magma. He says such "phreatic" explosions are typical of Bulusan. The ash explosion lasted about 3-1/2 minutes, shorter than the 5-minute explosion recorded May 1.  A large explosion in February 2011 that shot an ash plume about 2 kilometers (more than a mile) into the sky prompted about 1,200 villagers to flee to shelters.  Bulusan is one 23 volcanoes considered active by the volcanology agency, but it has not had a violent eruption since in 1918.  The country is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire," where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest eruptions in the 20th century.      GLENDALE, Ore. -- Fire crews worked through the night after a large fire broke out north of Glendale Tuesday night at Peavine Creek.  Firefighters are currently trying to contain the fire, working since 5 p.m. Tuesday after fire detection cameras spotted the blaze.  Douglas Forest Protective Association says its estimated that 123 acres have already been burned.  According to DFPA there is a fire trail around half of the blaze.  "As we're going along with the fire trail, we're pummeling it with water too so we can work on those hotspots, said DFPAs Kyle Reed. There's going to be a lot of work to go before this fire's contained but there's a lot of good work that's being done out here too."       Reed says there will be a 100 percent mop-up before they are done with this fire.  "With it being so early in the fire season, we have to make sure this fire's going to be good not only for a couple days from now or a couple weeks from now, but 2-to-3 months from now when we're in the peak of fire season."  Douglas County is in its third year of drought conditions. Reed says it's important to be careful when burning your debris or even mowing your lawn.  "Stuff that doesn't typically cause fires this time of the year -- we're going to see an increase in stuff like that, so people just need to be cautious when theyre working or recreating in wildlife areas."  The cause of the Peavine Creek fire is still under investigation.

GAITHERSBURG, Md. (WJLA) -- A 28-year-old Missouri woman has been charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old Gaithersburg boy.  Police say Garen Smith met the alleged victim while playing Xbox online. Investigators say she drove all the way from Missouri to connect with the boy.  According to charging documents, the boys mother invited the woman to move into the family's Gaithersburg home.  Smith and the boy shared a room and would push their mattresses together at night, according to records.  On her Facebook page, Smith says she is working on an R.N. degree, but she loves her video games.  Investigators say the alleged victim told them he and Smith had numerous sexual encounters. He said that she frequently said she was afraid of going to jail if anyone found out about what they were doing.  Apparently the mother became suspicious and communicated with police.   (you did see the part that said "the boys mother invited the woman to move into the family's Gaithersburg home.", right?)

The plant was taken out of service after a problem developed with an electrical component that operates one of the control rods in the reactor.  The control rods control the nuclear reaction in the reactor. The issue with the control rod presented no danger or issue with controlling the reactor, said Exelon spokesman Ralph DeSantis. He said the release of steam when the plant was being taken off-line was audible to nearby residents. Any radioactivity in the steam was too low to detect so there was no threat to the public or the environment, DeSantis said.

I'm jumping in here to remind you all of the pre-inca system of water management you may have read here at some point.

I can not agree with you on that. We all need water. Let those with little funds die of thirst?    So many people struggle just to make ends meet, to maintain a roof   a bit of food on the table. Would you have us collect rainwater in every available bucket, resulting in the alarming rise of mosquito borne illness which we are currently seeing running amok in places like Columbia?   http://outbreaknewstoday.com/dengue-cases-top-40000-in-malaysia-colombia-sees-10000-additional-chikungunya-cases-14946/  No. This is not the future I wish for my or anyone else's children.  Privatization of water must not be allowed to happen. Water belongs as a public sector element, and we need those government agencies that manage our current environmental troubles to step up and start doing the jobs they were elected to   for which they are paid.  Selling off water rights to private industry will result in nothing less than a disaster; the type that will make our citizenry rise up in a manner no one wants to ever have to see on a large scale.

Figure out which issues are important to you personally. Business   economy? Civil   human rights? Health   welfare? Environment? Military   defense? Science   technology?

Educate yourself as best able on things that are important to you, make sure you register to vote, and use that privilege to get those that most agree with your viewpoints elected.

The word SOME is no where to be found on the governments website. Were you on a 4 lane back road?    The left lane on multi-lane highways are "For Passing Only". How is that so hard for you to understand?  Edit: The governments website says nothing of whether its rural. It says "on Texas multi-lane highways." It does not say "rural Texas multi-lane highways."    Watch for signs on Texas multi-lane highways that read "Left Lane For Passing Only." These signs let you know that the left lane on a divided highway is not a "fast" lane; it is a passing lane.   After you pass someone, move into the right lane once you've safely cleared the vehicle. Impeding the flow of traffic by continuing to drive in the left lane is punishable by a fine of up to $200.  Source: [www.txdot.gov](http://www.txdot.gov/driver/share-road/highway-driving.html)    Blocking the left lane isnt only illegal  every state has some type of law restricting use of the left lane on multi-lane roads and highways  but keeping it open for passing causes fewer accidents than speeding because traffic flows more smoothly and theres less tailgating and less weaving in and out of traffic. Other benefits of not being a left lane hog include reduced road rage, better gas mileage and getting to your destination faster.   Any time you get a disruption in the normal flow of traffic, you are apt to increase the chance of an accident to occur, says Lt. Gary Megge of the Michigan State Police.  Source: [Auto Insurance Center](http://www.autoinsurancecenter.com/driving-slow-in-the-left-lane-is-dumb-and-illegal.htm)   I fail to see how that keeps you from getting out of the way. The left lane is for passing. If you are not passing get out of the way.   Sounds like you need to get the fuck out of the way then.   I sometimes go around the person that is driving slow in the left lane and pull in front of them. I then just let off the gas until they get over. They normally throw their hands up at me and give me the bird. After they get over in the middle lane I get back to my previous speed. If they get back over in the left lane after I speed up I let off the gas again.    Well, to be fair, I have a choice of whether a company has my info.

"In fact, since 1995  this book was a book about cultural indicators [and] the country has moved in the wrong direction. We have a 40-plus percent out-of-wedlock birth rate."  I agree with him.

Benet Embry, a 43-year-old black resident, saw things differently.   Embry has lived at Craig Ranch, a planned community in McKinney, for eight years. He said it's a nice place. Racially diverse. People get along there.   He said when he was at the community pool Friday, a crowd of teenagers showed up, even though Craig Ranch's strict homeowners' association rules prohibit bringing more than two guests to the pool.   The teens huddled by the gate and shouted to let them in. Some jumped over the fence, Embry said. A security guard tried to get them to leave but was outnumbered, so the guard called police.   "Let me reiterate, the neighbors or the neighborhood did not call the police because this was an African-American party or whatever the situation is," he said. "This was not a racially motivated event -- at all. This whole thing is being blown completely out of proportion."   Embry did say he was disturbed to see the officer kneel on top of the bikini-clad girl and wave his gun at other teens.   "I may or may not agree with everything that the police officer did, but I do believe he was trying to establish order," he said.   Surprised its only fifty.      [That..](http://i.imgur.com/a4Og40t.jpg)   MAAATT DAAAMON    PLEASE HELP! That (now viral) video of the officer in McKinney subduing a girl in a bathing suit was in OUR neighborhood. The situation was NOT what is being reported    A DJ setup in a public space next to the private pool in our neighborhood on Friday and played loud explicit (F-bomb) music for multiple hours (it is unclear if he was invited by a resident as no one has claimed responsibility). The teenagers (both black and white) were being brought into our neighborhood by the carload because the DJ was tweeting out invites to a pool party for $15 (obviously unauthorized by our neighborhood). The teens began fighting with each other and pushing their way into our private pool. Some were jumping our fence. The security guard was accosted when he tried to stop the beginnings of this mob scene. Some residents who live around the park/pool area tried to come out and settle things down. The teens started yelling racial slurs at our neighbors and started assaulting people and property (throwing bottles at cars and attacking a mother at the pool with 3 young children). The first officer on the scene was by himself. At that time, the party had grown to a large, aggressive crowd. As the officer arrived, many teens started running through our neighborhood. Many of the teens were being very aggressive and yelling at the officers as more arrived.   This was a very dangerous situation for the officers AND the teens/residents not involved. The news media has refused to hear the neighborhoods side of this story. The video being distributed is only a very small segment of what happened. This information being distributed by the media and others is extremely distorted and in some cases outright lies.   PLEASE HELP US STOP THE BROADCASTING OF THIS IGNORANCE.

 How about hunching over a desk on the beach with the margarita next to the laptop?          The fact that film is so expensive also limits craft, since it becomes more of a corporate investment with dozens of fingers in the pot instead of unimpeded artistic visions most of the time   But user is correct there is no fx budget restraint to prose, you can include anything   One of the great novels, but I think Nabokov's Pale Fire is even better.    agreed, isn't this pretty par for the course?    It's a pretty darn hard gig, but obviously not futile since those careers still exist. Still, what do you mean by "career"? If you mean get millions, pretty futile. If you mean make some side income and maybe work in a related field (journalism? teaching?) it's not futile at all if you have talent.    gotcha   okay! Didn't mean it to be overtly political, since it was an neutral LA Times article. But no worries if you think it doesn't fit.          were these genres created by literary pretense, or just by suits with marketing concerns?                                                       Or at least I thought, from an author named Alexander Chee: http://the-toast.net/2015/07/14/an-interview-with-alexander-chee/view-all/   Can you share some of your views on the current state of publishing, and also how Amazon might be changing the game?  Well, we know publishing profits have improved while writer pay has declined. So that is terrible. Im greatly encouraged by some recent developments in publishing in terms of what is getting published and reviewed.  What worries me most is that we are still in a weird place where, 20 years in, were being told we still dont know how the Internet affects book sales or readership, and so writers cant be paid as much for writing written online  even as every major media outlet is now online and increasingly abandons print editions. Yet so far, you still get paid more for print even though it is often read less  and you get paid less for digital, and yet everyone reads that. That has to change. Because its a scam.  Its time to admit the Internet is here.  I was going through old files and found pay stubs from digital writing I did in 1999 that are roughly what is still getting paid for something that you also have to fact check yourself and in some cases copyedit  but that is also given a title you dont choose. And because of content grabs in contracts, it may not even belong to you.  And so I dont have any comment about Amazon except to say that over time I am less and less interested on any seasonal focus on Amazons most recent moves, whatever they are  like many American companies they are a mix of good and bad, what I agree and disagree with  and Im more and more interested in the larger context for this, the Internet and America, income inequality and the destruction of the creative class. Were in this horrible world where everyone wants everything for free now or almost free because to pay for it reminds them of how little they are paid and that reminds them of their powerlessness in the face of that. Or at least how powerless they feel. And theres so much blocked anger there.  Historically, despots kill the artists, writers, journalists and professors when they seize power, as what they teach is critical thinking, and what comes with that is the ability to resist tyrannies of various kinds. What America is doing, purposefully or not, is historically distinct: delegitimizing the work of that class, and acting as if an education is the tyranny, all while insisting writers and professors make work on starvation wages, while also paying exorbitant fees for everything from healthcare to housing to taxes even on what grants remain. In order for an artist to have any respect they have to have amazing sales  or be dead after a life of poverty. So Id prefer a bigger conversation about all of that instead.  All of which is to say, Amazon isnt changing publishing  everyone involved in publishing is, from the writers to the editors to the readers. If we want to improve publishing we have to talk about the whole thing related to how writers are valued and compensated, and what we want our literature to contain.         Agents are so crazy opaque in general. Like such little info on their websites, and many have no social media presence. I guess it's because they get hounded by writers otherwise?    fantastic book, invented a whole genre          No, and publishers do give different terms to different authors, especially big name ones who have leverage.   But industries tend to settle around rates I think, whether we are talking publishers, record labels, TV syndication, Netflix, whatever. Can be hard to shake that stuff up.    there are some yeah, but none with the marketshare. Basically the same reason that the big publishers don't offer better terms, the competition is out there but just not big enough   I agree that the fact that other newspapers didn't remove for bulk sales is the interesting fact here. Don't really care what Amazon says, sounds like their spokesperson was just asked if Amazon itself has seen unusual bulk sales, not that they are commenting on the book's sales as a whole.    yeah uh.... Amazon has it's own sales ranking of what people buy through amazon, that doesn't tell him what bulk orders have been made direct form the publisher, from Barnes and Noble, or from book stores   Also, big name authors get SOOO many blurb requests that when they do decide to blurb something it's normally because they truly really liked it. Sure there is some neapotisim involved sometimes (student asking former teacher, publisher asking big name author to do debut author) but even in those cases there are so many former students and so many names being passed along that a big name author is making a choice to blurb.    Have I bought a book solely on the blurb? No.   But if I liked other parts about the book AND it had blurbs form authors I'd trust, that would make me more likely to buy.   It's less about trusting the authors to be honest than it is about getting a sense of what kind of book it is. For example, is it a "speculative fiction" book in the vein of George Saunders, Jeff VanderMeer, and Kelly Link? Or is it more like a George RR Martin/Joe Abercrombie kind of thing?   Blurbs give you an idea.    Distributors take a big cut, but the biggest cut in the middlemen chain are the retailers (bookstores, Amazon, Barnes and Noble) who take like a 50% cut.    This sounds good to me. They also should demand 90% from self-publishing platforms. There is no way that Amazon should be getting 30-70% of the cut without providing any editing/art/marketing and having essentially no cost of production.        Why doesn't the NYT simply publish Amazon's sales rankings?   In addition to the fact that Amazon's rankings are manipulated too:   1) While Amazon has a big influence on the market, they aren't even close to 100% of the market, and their sales are skewed (as any single entity would be) by their user base.   2) There is no way to really "objectively" rank print and digital sales. Is a 25 dollar hardcover sale, a 15 dollar paperback sale, and a $1 dollar ebook sale all the same thing?    Yes, Amazon's rankings are easily manipulated too.    The right wing has LONG used bulk sales to try and manipulate the NYT best seller list. I think it's perfectly fine for the NYT to not count books that didn't really sell to actual humans, but were just bought in bulk by church groups, SuperPacs, and right wing orgs. I don't know if that happened with Cruz or not, but Amazon wouldn't be in any special position to judge that.   What on earth are the more "objective" sales rankings?                    I would think it should be the big five, who in one year have amazingly all just happened to sign similar agreements with Amazon changing how ebooks are sold.   Come on now, this is pretty standard. Netflix signs similar deals with the big film companies, Apple signs similar deals with record labels, etc. Basically, the producers can't really negotiate better rates unless they have some irregular leverage so they all sign similar deals.             Authors can and do make real changes to proofs. In fact, there was a mini scandal just last month where someone tweeted a portion of Jon Ronson's proof mocking it and it was a sentence that he had deleted for the final copy.    Well it's illegal and unethical to sell uncorrected proofs, so whoever did is a jerk.   Most ARCs only change a little bit, but it's not unheard of to have some serious edits especially in non-fiction.                                     I can't tell if this is good or bad. Amazon is flooded with paid-for reviews or reviews by friends and family, but why block reviews if someone just follows an author on Twitter? Don't book lovers tweet at lots of authors they love? Doesn't mean they know them.       Mainly it's just weird to block people for social media interactions. Book fans who use twitter probably follow TONS of authors they don't know.   But I get trying to block family members leaving cheap 5 star reviews            Word, but I'd stress again you can achieve the same thing publishing book reviews, or essays, or something else if short fiction isn't your thing         Man vs. god is another, although I guess since all modern religions treat god as basically absent it's a version of "man vs. self." A crisis of faith is an inner crisis.    man vs. man and man vs. society can be seen as different. A conflict between individuals vs. a conflict between protagonist and their human surroundings/society/culture    These reductive things are always pretty silly, as everyone else here is saying.   I enjoy this one better though:   All stories are either a man goes on a journey, or a stranger comes to town (and that both are different POVs of the same story.) That is to say, most stories have a routine that is interrupted... either by the protagonist going somewhere or doing something new, or by an outsider character shaking up the routine.    Yes, that can work. I mean it certainly happens, but it might be best for your career to focus on building some kind of recognition whether though publishing short fiction, blogging, editing a lit mag, or something else.   Another option might be submitting to first book contests that small presses host.          check this list, it's the best place to start (for "literary" work at least) http://cliffordgarstang.com/?p=4777   Hmm, well I dunno. I know people who basically were unpublished who got agents but most of them either   A) Came through a big MFA program (or genre problem like Clarion)   B) Published in another genre (ie, published essays or journalism but wrote fiction on the side)  or   C) Had some kind of platform to build off of. Big social media presence or the like.   The problem I think is that there are SO many wannabe writers and SO many people sending work to agents that agents simply can't read it all. They have to filter through it some way. So having connections, or publications, or a platform all give the agent a reason to read the manuscript. Doesn't mean they'll like it, but you will at least get read.   ETA: Now this might seem unfair, but think about it: even if you self-publish, you are going to probably have a much harder time unless you have some reason (publications, platform, etc.) for people to buy your work over the bazillion others out there.    Have you read the new book? Seems premature to say he couldn't possible turn into this without even reading it   In high school? I could see The Road and Oscar Wao. I think those are good calls on your part.   Infinite Jest is too long and dense, but it will probably be taught in college courses for a long time.   Maybe Harry Potter will be middle school reading? Although the series is so long probably not.                                     I'm really glad both LONG HIDDEN and MONSTROUS AFFECTIONS made the list for anthologies. I thought both were great            The benefits are, well, if you don't have an agent--which can take a long time to find--you can get picked up.  The downside is that your agent will almost always get you more money or a better deal, and you are more likely to be picked up if you have an agent. Agents can also hassle publishers to respond in a timely manner in a way that authors can't.                                  I agree, though, that the dialogue could be more interesting than just "fuck!" Jesus!" It's possible to have characters say interesting things to reveal themselves in a fight   Here is one link: http://lovecraftzine.com/2014/08/04/did-the-writer-of-true-detective-plagiarize-thomas-ligotti-and-others/   Yeah I don't think it means the first season was bad. Also, weren't there a lot of rumors that the writer basically plagiarized several horror authors in season 1? Maybe that's why it was better      Sorry, I meant to reply to the user you were replying to!   I can't even believe how lazy the writing is this season. It's like the guy wrote the entire 8 scripts in one coke-fueled night and never edited.    Did you read the review? The reviewer says basically the same thing: that RPO had lots of problems but was still fun, but then says this book isn't fun at all and has even more problems.     I felt like Luke Skywalker surveying a hangar full of A-, Y- and X-Wing Fighters just before the Battle of Yavin. Or Captain Apollo, climbing into the cockpit of his Viper on the Galacticas flight deck. Ender Wiggin arriving at Battle School. Or Alex Rogan, clutching his Star League uniform, staring wide-eyed at a hangar full of Gunstars.  Wow this is insufferable writing. Makes me glad I never read Ready Player One if this is how he writes. Why do so many "nerd" types think that simply referencing things counts as being clever?       Loved HAINTS STAY!   Would recommend THE SISTERS BROTHERS by Patrick DeWitt and GHOST TOWN by Robert Coover, if you want more                        Social media isn't pointless per say, some people do really well with it. But just having a page without working to grow it IS pointless. But, as someone else said, if you are getting paid by the press might as well make one quickly.   Actually, maybe it isn't even pointless since people googling you will have a page to land on at least.                                                       It's hard to explain how influential this book was. It was fresh at the time, now is been ripped off so much it feels less original         Agree with everyone here that no one will really care and also... would it really be that hard to do a search and replace and change his hair to a different color? Is red hair really that central to the plot, if you do indeed feel it overlaps with the name of the wind too much?     Also, having things online doesn't stop them being published. Of course, you'll have to take them down. But no one would forgo a piece of writing because it was on the internet. I've seen a lot of people have that concern, and a lot of people have replied, stating their fears are unfounded. Don't worry :)  Strong disagree with this. Every editor I know would turn down a piece that was already published for the public online (unless it was a reprint anthology or something.) Yes, you can get away with this since most editors won't google you, but if you do get caught the editor will reject the story and if they think you are acting shady won't ever work with you again.             As someone who works in the industry, I really think you are overrating how likely looks are to matter. I wouldn't say it doesn't matter at all, but I really don't think it's much of a factor. Sure, you can google anyone, but plenty of editors probably don't even know what an author looks like when they sign them.   Youth, OTOH, probably factors in. Editors want to grab the hot (as in buzzed about) young authors on the rise and will pick up those books over works by middle age authors with middling sales.          Dunno, I doubt it gets to that very often. For one thing, most readers have no idea at all what the authors they read look like... outside of the big famous ones like Rowling or King. I don't think looks sell books in 2015 when authors don't go on talk shows or appear on camera much at all, unless they are super famous                  Yeah, it's certainly something that MFA programs can provide for authors... if your teachers like your work at least.    I think it's kind of shitty BUT I can tell you it isn't uncommon. As long as you are sure they are a legit agent, and they will give you a quick read (say within a month) it seems okay.   Don't let them sit on it forever though               Hey, every year The Millions literary sites posts a huge list of all the awesome books coming out for the second half of the year. Here's the one for this fall: http://www.themillions.com/2015/07/most-anticipated-the-great-second-half-2015-book-preview.html  I know it's a list, but I think it's comprehensive enough to warrant discussion here. What books are you guys excited for that are on this? Or that are missing?   I'm really excited for   * UNDERDOMOMAJORMINOR by Patrick DeWitt. His THE SISTERS BROTHERS was one of my favorite books of last decade.   * THE STORY OF MY TEETH by Valeria Luisilli. She's a really great young Mexican-American writer and Coffee House has been publishing amazing work recently.   * Clarice Lispector's complete stories. She was amazing.   Lot of other good stuff coming out too. Good year for books!      It's better to focus on what is the best ending for the book you are writing than what would "gain the largest audience."    That's half the battle, but plenty of connected and rich authors flop too   Marketing budget, good reviews (ie good book), buzz   Sure, but these are picks from non-Americans. Not sure writers in Japan or Brazil read Uncle Tom's Cabin. Might not be known outside of USA   Not sure why this is being downvoted. I agree, really fun book!   I thought this list was interesting and worth discussing in advance of the Fourth of July: http://lithub.com/quintessential-american-fiction-according-to-the-rest-of-the-world/  A survey of writers around the world about what they think of as "American" literature.    Individual titles named: 96    Books by women: 19    Most popular decade: The 2000s    Least popular decade: The 1940s    Oldest book: The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Franklin (1791)    Newest book: Tenth of December, George Saunders (2013)    Most cited writers: William Faulkner (8), Herman Melville (5), F. Scott Fitzgerald (4), J.D. Salinger (4), Mark Twain (4)  What do you feel was unfairly left out?    Well, I will say that I agree that the future--for better or worse--will probably involve writers selling ancillary stuff. Dinners with them, workshops, scented candles? Who knows. But music has survived on merch for a long time, and writers might have to do the same thing soon.    But I don't think that stuff solves this at all, because it would only work for mega famous authors and those are the ones who can still survive today.   Would you pay to sit and brainstorm with a debut novelist you've never heard of? Would you pay to get dinner with a career midlister? And if so, would you actually pay enough money to make that worthwhile for them?    Most artists on labels are in debt and ost artists who are relying on Spotify and self-publishing are in debt or making no money.   I'm interested in the best way for artists to make money. I don't care if the corporate labels or corporate tech companies go under. All leeches in my book!  But yes, the big labels have been particularly bad (compared to say the big publishers, which are pretty good for writers)     Very few artist on any label except for those "the big stars" come close to being rich, it's a complete myth.  I... didnt' say most artists on labels are rich and certainly don't think that! I said that most rich musicians are on labels. That's a different thing!            Yeah, with music "free" music can get you concert tickets and merch sales. That doesn't happen with books. People don't pay for live readings and don't seem interested in buying merch from authors.       Or maybe US laws just need to be enforced me. It sounds nice to just say vague comments about "new models" and blah blah, but honestly the raid on Megadownload might be one of the biggest things that caused a decrease in piracy in recent history.    I absolutely think that the cultural conversation is important and can (and has!) shifted public opinion.   Yes, people still want free work and piracy is still rampant, but more people I know have started to buy more work and realize that artists should be paid in the last few years thanks both to the things you mention and to culture norms shifting.    That's a huge question to get into but a few quick points:   - The artists on labels are still the rich ones today. You can say "labels demand outrageous cuts!" but basically the only people making a living off of music are on labels, and certainly the only big stars are ones on labels.   - Look, I hate how exploitative the major record labels were and probably still are. So I'm not defending them. But it is dishonest to compare the profit share numbers without comparing the up front costs. By which I mean, record labels pay for studio time, pay for marketing, maybe evne pay for touring expenses. The "unsigned" artist has to recoup their recording and other costs before they actual make any money.    The benefits of "free" marketing seem to be highly overrated the more I read about it. For example, do you ever look in the /r/selfpublish forum? I do and writers there constantly bemoan the fact that they can give away a book for free and get thousands or tens of thousands of downloads, but then those translate into like 2 sales.   In the age of everything being free, well, everything is free, so you are drowning in a sea of free content. Being free doesn't make you stand out. Your work can be downloaded by a million people who don't ever actual listen/read/watch it... much less go buy a ticket to a show or a copy of a physical book.     I don't care at all what rich corporations make money! I only care if artists make money. The fact that Spotify CEO or Apple stock holders makes bank instead of some big record company CEO is not a "step in the right direction" if the actual musicians aren't making more.     I don't really get what you are arguing. No one in 2015 thinks technology should be stopped or whatever. No one thinks ebooks and digital music should die. The legal means of getting ebooks and digital music are just as much "technology" as thepiratebay.com and utorrent. Piracy doesn't have some monopoly on new technology.     With almost no cost to produce or distribute content, the need for media elites as tastemakers is diminishing.   Traditionally we had media elites that acted as tastemakers. When media is scarce we need elites to know which media to consume.  Man I think you have this completely wrong.   The problem with society has never been "elites" being tastemakers. It is really bizarre how this right wing hatred of "liberal ivory tower gatekeepers!" has been picked up by supposedly libertarian or liberal people.    The problem has been corporate money controlling the media landscape. Controlling what is played on radio, controlling what books get placed prominently in stores, controlling what movies get wide releases, and so on. The "tastemakers" have mostly had pretty fine tastes, but their tastes are normally overruled by the overwhelming power of corporate money and the control of distrobution.   Has that changed? Not really!   Yes, theoretically we can all be stars on youtube or Kindle Unlimited, but in reality the rich people with corporate money backing them still completely dominate the media landscape: Marvel films, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, Jurassic World, etc.   Those people make bank while middle class artists are disappearing. We are left with a world where you are either making nothing but praying and hoping you'll go viral, or else you are a huge star with corporate backing who can leverage your work for payouts (like getting your song in a car commercial)  By eliminating all money that sustains smaller culture pools, the big corporate culture control is maybe greater than ever today.    Book has pictures of books that other redditors are currently reading and there are posts on the tv subreddit asking others what they should watch. Instead of looking to some elite tastemaker we are looking to ourselves. This is not just reddit, but all social media.   Social media is utterly dominated by the same handful of topics. in art, that means it is the same handful of films, TV shows, or books that can be talked about at one time.   When the currency is "likes" "reblogs" and "shares," the only way to get it is to talk about what everyone else is talking about. You mention subreddits like /r/books, but what actually makes the top page? The same authors over and over: Neil Gaiman, JK Rowling, Stephen King, and a handful of others. Yes, anyone CAN be talked about, but only a few bi name people are talked about enough to get upvotes and get to the top of the page.   Same with twitter or anything else.    Yeah, that line is really hard to swallow in a world ruled by Kim Khardashian, reality TV, flavorless action blockbusters, and McDonald's burgers.    Is Spotify a "move in the right direction" or just another way for rich corporations to make bank while artists make nothing? Spotify's CEO is rich as hell, but the actual artists get paid almost nothing: http://s3.amazonaws.com/infobeautiful2/selling_out_550.png   I think that's part of it, but mostly I think it's any what is easy to steal. I know plenty of people who pirate music and video games and what not, yet spend time of disposable income on coffee shops, restaurants, bars, high priced electronics, etc. Piracy is by no means limited to people in poverty  	200

It's important to realize that these "people" are just the same as us. They're not any different from us; they have the same fears, worries, etc. The distinction lies in the societal framework which differentiates the "haves" with the "have nots". Their destructive acts are just means to align themselves with society's rules, not sincere malice. Society's rules for them dictate that they "should" be offensive, where in actual fact they're really just hiding who they really are inside. Hence two people who are alike in almost every way can be divided into two camps which society determines. The enemy isn't "those people", it's the framework of society itself. When you find friends who don't rely on this framework as their identity and can stand on their own, you'll find that there's very little difference between the introverts and extroverts.    That's true.      Not if I don't buy it    If it helps, I used to be the awkward quiet skinny guy in school as well. Now I get girls checking me out in public, even though I look exactly the same.

All those popular handsome people who are treating you like shit? They're doing that because they're just as insecure as you are.

As a devout Christian, I think people need to realize something. The people who can't handle hard questioning, or end up getting frustrated, are really doing it for themselves. I'm not saying their intentions are insincere, just that they identify with it as an extension of their person, rather than actually enjoying God.   It's the same in any other setting, e.g. science - the ones who make the most noise do so because they are trying to reinforce something which "belongs" to them, be it a belief, a position or status, etc; not because they actually understand that the calculations for the origins of the big bang rely on two primary axioms (that the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference and that there is nothing faster than the speed of light). Whereas the real scientists or missionaries just keep quiet and are okay with acknowledging things they sincerely don't fully understand. They maintain their position, but they keep quiet.   The loud ones are the ones who can't handle the current circumstances and desperately seek to affect a change to "restore" the environment to how they feel it should be, because they see the circumstances as an extension of themselves. If you truly were seeking the truth (be it in science or God) and not care for the self, you wouldn't bother with the social cost that comes with making enemies for little tangible benefit. It's not like you're actually going to effect any real change, i.e. change someone's mind.    Thank you! Yes, I absolutely love the heck out of this metric as well. I'm reading Greg Speicher's use of "return on average tangible net worth": http://gregspeicher.com/?p=1708 What are your thoughts on it?   Wow, that's sincerely amazing.            Awesome! How'd you get the chance to interview him?   yes, I believe this is what he meant! The 59% should have been referring to a forecasted compounded return for a few years per 1 dollar invested today; not a single year's return. Thanks for providing much clarity!    yeah but none of the actual ratios are anywhere close to 59%.   thanks for the insight. however, I don't think that's correct, as KO famously had an extremely high P/E when Buffett first looked at it. This article says it was a P/E of around 25-30: https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-P-E-Buffett-paid-for-Coca-Cola. So I don't know where he got the 59/100 figure from, which implies a P/E of less than 2.         Can someone shed some light on this quote I found here?  http://studentofvalue.com/deliberate-practice-2-coca-cola-1988/  In 1989 there was strong evidence (in the 10-k) of increasing returns on investment AND growth AND the share price was at the equivalent of $10. **The annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents**, far above its ROIC of 22%. Those circumstances represent obvious value. Obvious to anyone who cared to look and cared to think even a little about it.  In 2012, theres 9% return on every dollar of new investment, far below the ROIC of 72.8%. It can grow all it likes at 9% returns and it wont create a dime of value Besides, the shares are now not at $10 but at $79 .  What does "annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents" mean? It's not P/E, nor is it ROA, as calculated in this other article: http://www.gurufocus.com/news/205476/revisiting-buffett--cocacola-in-1988  *I suppose he's referring to earnings per dollar of retained earnings, but even that's not right*. Anybody can shed some light on what the 59 cents he's referring to is?

 I'm in enthusiastic agreement with you   OP, THANK YOU for clearly and explicitly crediting the artist in the title of your post and linking to their site. Artists everywhere rejoiced.   At Wake Forest University, if you're interested!   [J.K. Rowling has written new material about the Time Turner on Pottermore](http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner) and specifically states that "the longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around **five hours.**"   You can even get a lot of books through the library as long as you're proactive about renewing and don't care to keep it at the end of the course. Check your university's library's consortium or get it through Inter Library Loan (ILL) if yours doesn't have it available.   I was really hoping that your story was going to end with that royal jackass getting fired for sexual harassment, or something...but now I'm just sad.  :(   "my fiancee" /Mississippiaccent  I was a little sad to actually get married because I really enjoyed calling my now husband that.    It does put me in a awkward position vis a vis my progeny!   This is a tip for ways of acting **before** you even get to the wedding.   Do. Not. Ask. To. Be. Invited.  Just, don't. Making a guest list is one of the most gut-wrenching and difficult processes in planning a wedding. Weddings are expensive as balls and *most* couples simply cannot afford to have everyone there that they would like. It gets even more complex when there are family pressures - which can be more difficult the larger the family or if you're dealing with divorced parents. (Not always, just sometimes :)) So, don't assume anything, and don't ask the couple. If you receive an invitation you should feel pleasantly surprised and honored to be invited.   When I was getting married people asked me if they were getting invited after having met them that day. Or old friends of my brothers. Most of these people I genuinely liked, but when you account for the fact that we had to accommodate our two large families and our best/closest/oldest friends...we just didn't have the money or space.   Yeah, I remember seeing this on /r/funny a while back and it just made me sad. At a wedding the golden rule is: "It's not about you, asshole." And this is a great example of this.   Also, most brides pay extra to have a tossing bouquet as they keep the one they used in the wedding (e.g. drying the flowers, etc.). So congrats dude, you should give them $40 bucks.    THIS. My husband has a very large family and it was important to both of us to have all of our families there. Because of the size, however, we only extended a "guest" invitation if the couple was engaged, no boyfriend/girlfriends unless the other would already been invited regardless.   One cousin called to try and convince us otherwise. We explained the situation and offered to take him and his girlfriend out to dinner when we got back to town since we live in the same city. He called another two times in an effort to change our minds. He ended up just bringing her anyway.   I honestly have no idea where they sat her or how it got paid for, but the real problem was that now all other 40+ cousins who had politely respected the invitation were now wondering why this jackhat got to bring his gf.   For the record, they split up two weeks later. And that cousin had barely spoken to either of us before or since.    This reminds me of when we read Athol Fugard's play "Master Harold...and the boys" in high school. To summarise, it is about race and class relations in apartheid era South Africa. My teacher lost his shit because everyone kept calling them African-Americans. An abiding memory is him nearly yelling, "they are ALL just AFRICAN."   Thank you for sharing your experience, I'm sorry for your loss. I suppose this is all the evidence to see that it takes all types. I had a very different reaction to when others responded with their own stories.    This can be good, but sometimes it still serves as a 'one-upping' experience. It's best when you actually reference or relate to the original story. Even if it's a similar experience, unless you engage the stories, it can feel very much like you're ignoring the person. Even just acknowledging the story can work wonders, too often people are just too eager to throw in their own story that they won't even let you finish!  Also, when it comes to tragedy, DO NOT RESPOND WITH YOUR OWN GODDAMN STORY. Unless it has happened concurrently, this isn't about you. By doing so, it immediately makes the conversation about you, and makes the person's grief feel trivial. Just don't.   When my brother was very young he said he wanted to be a dog. When informed that wasn't possible he change his answer to cat. Explaining in more detail that he couldn't change his species, he then went with "bad guy."   Ask her best friend to find out. She could ask in moderately normal conversation or hey could go shopping and just try rings on for fun; even some place with costume jewellery. Just have her take note of the size, even if it's a relative size to her. For example friend knows she wears X size ring, future fiance is close but a little bigger.  But when in doubt, go larger, it's usually easier to size down and a lot less costly since you're not adding more metal. And you won't have pictures like this, that asshats on the internet feel the need to laugh at.    Aaaand probably in '94....maybe even '70...

When he passed away in 2011 me and a few friend had a Redwall Feast where we made food described in the books (e.g. Hotroot Soup) and drank a whole lot of lambics. I think it was a fitting memorial and one that I think he would have appreciated.    I see myself drafting an Astral Slide early and then picking a whole bunch of other cycling cards and going 0-3. I also see myself splashing a Vampiric Tutor to try and make it better. Slide forever!   You can also draw the game if there are no other valid targets for the Animate Dead. The loop must continue. I have no idea why you'd do this in VMA sealed. It used to be a potent trick back in Extended. You could cast Dark Ritual, Entomb, Animate Dead and loop the game to draw it. In vintage, I have entered the mythical land of Game Four a few times. A friend of mine who judged in the Extended Entomb era said that the most draws he ever saw were on a matchslip with the following record: 2-0-21.    Is cute supposed to be bad?  It's more about nostalgia than broooooken draft combos you can easily assemble. But for the record, thirteen of the combinations involve only one rare or mythic (setting aside Stroke in the first example.) If someone didn't play fifteen years ago, they might not know that High Tide + Turnabout makes mana. There's even other, smaller historical ones like Frantic Search + Thawing Glaciers, which old Time Spiral decks played. For that matter, they might not know that Gush with Psychatog turns 1.5 damage into 6.5 damage.  Which reminds me that if you played at one point, you know the significance of this algebra equation: 1.5x + 0.5y + 1 :)     It's won me many a game : )      There's a 111% guarantee, so if you sign up and don't like it, QS will pay you back more than you paid for the 1-month sub.

So if you were checking immediately after playing, they aren't showing your current session's stats   I had one of these before and about half way through it stopped advancing product into the sponge. They used to have translucent tubes where you could actually see the product. I ended up throwing it away because I didn't really love the product...but I thought this was going to give me an answer! WHOMP WHOMP.    Geeze, it sounds like you've tried almost everything - I don't envy you. You've probably already tried it, but my last suggestion would be to make sure you apply the concealer very thinly and gradually and build it up in thin layers. Then I would apply a quality powder on top with a beauty blender (or dupe - I use the [Cheeky blender](http://www.amazon.com/Flawless-Foundation-Sponges-Blenders-Cheeky%C2%AE/dp/B00BMLOJK8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8 qid=1393001753 sr=8-6 keywords=beauty+blender+4+pack) and it works beautifully). By doing the bouncy application with the blender, you get a very smooth finish but a very light application. Godspeed sister.   That's rough. :( Have you ever used a peel? I use the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Hydroxy Peel Pads - my husband and I call them "Black Magic Face Pads" though. They completely revolutionized my skin when I started using them. It's kind of the nuclear option in terms of peels, but if you really have issues with texture, etc. it can be worth it. I used them daily for a full cycle and they have broken my skin out of its dehydrated/dry state to where I can now get away with using them less frequently. They are expensive, but I was able to get some samples at Nordstrom and Sephora before pulling the trigger. You could also try with other peels too. Lactic acid will be gentler, and there are a lot of other options.  I would really recommend checking something out as I find the peel can really transform your skin's texture and quality which moisturizers and oils can help further improve and maintain.    Before makeup I use a personal blend of oils designed to moisturize and calm my skin's redness (apricot kernel, sweet almond, meadowfoam, borage, and sunflower seed). I follow that with CeraVe moisturizing cream (the one in the tub). Its fairly rich but absorbs nicely and plays well with makeup. For both of these I give them a few minutes to sink in. I don't actually use a primer at all. I've done A-B testing on a bunch and not seen a big difference for my makeup is staying power.  At night I use a real basic cleanser with Clairsonic, remove my eye makeup with up   up remover, and then every other day or every third day I use Dr. Dennis Gross alpha beta hydroxy peel pads (60 day). Then I follow with the oil and CeraVe.  This is probably way more info than you bargained for, but I'm pretty passionate about skincare. I have naturally very dry skin and it has taken me quite awhile to get my skin to where it is (I'm 28, fyi). I hope this helps, pm me if you want to chat more about it!  	31
 I'll drink to that!   Just thought I'd add my experience from the day. I had to get a 6am train and when I was waiting for the train 200 miles away I checked Twitter and there were already people queueing outside. After he finished it was like something out of an apocalypse, everyone flooding out of that stadium!    It was **epic** I had goose bumps throughout. They were just wearing off then Dre came and I nearly fell over with excitement.   Yeah that is a shame. I was pretty close to the front but it would be cool to see all the angles.          I only watched the video because I was hoping for a big thunderous fart.       Passion Of The Christ        	10
 When you have people drunk driving 2, 3, 4, and 5 times - then obviously the answer is, in fact, harsher and more effective laws, rather than the current catch-and-release system where they pay a piddling fine and then just drive without a license for a year.   When someone knows their staring down never having a license again, or a double-digit stay in prison, they reconsider their actions. If they can't reconsider their actions, they should be removed from where they can hurt others and themselves.   "became aggressive with the deputies, who used their stun guns to try to subdue him. The stun guns didn't work, and Dennis said Dinkins attempted to take one of the deputies' weapons."  If that's accurate, that's pretty impressive of the guy to not only endure the tazers but then also have the wherewithal to go for a gun *and* survive being shot.       I would say that's down to them being easily relatable, well-known characters. Everyone "knows" batman and superman and captain america, so you can spend more time telling story and less time doing (relatively) pointless exposition as to motive and origin.    culturally catastrophic to have the ephemera of a previous century squatting possessively on the cultural stage and refusing to allow this surely unprecedented era to develop a culture of its own, relevant and sufficient to its times.  I think this shows a supreme misunderstanding of what 21st century culture is: it's less a "let's invent new art!" and more a "let's remix and reimagine previous art in ways that were not conceived of when it was made."   I guarantee you if you showed early comics creators something like Flashpoint Paradox or Gods and Monsters, they'd be totally aghast and state that they have nothing to do with such a vile thing.   That said, Moore has always been a bit of a curmudgeon (to put it mildly!) and his work controversial. It's kind of his thing to be controversial.   [Another link with some more info](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2015/07/17/detroit-police-search-groups-sex-assaults/30316945/ )  Extremely aggressive, sadistic crimes.    Yeah i'm ready for 2017 already. The hype during 2016 is gonna be absolutely fuck-off insane, and i'm just dreading it.   You lock them up? You take away their license - *forever* - and lock them up if they repeat offend.   I do not see why solving drunk driving is any more difficult than solving armed robbery or assault. You catch someone breaking the law, you punish them, if they show the least proclivity to re-offend you throw them back in until they get sense or their to old to be a threat.       Yep. [Sweden's roads are incredibly safe](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-16) - 3 per 100K vs. 11.4 per 100K for the US. Good design, good laws, a focus on safety - all things the US sorely lacks.   Would only need to be about a week. Could do it in PE or health class instead of covering stupid shit.   I can't ever understand why someone would kill three kids. I mean it's not like that happens by accident or that they didn't have time to think about it. Just unthinkable to me.   if a person's shown they can't be trusted to be around vehicles, then they need to be removed from society for everyone's protection. They want to avoid that? Great, don't break the fucking law. No one *needs* do drink and drive. No one *needs* to drive without a license.   I don't give a fuck what someone's inner world is like or if they redeem themselves in the eyes of everyone they let down. I care if they engage in behavior that endangers others for *literally no good reason*.    We could start treating driving as a privilege (which it is) instead of as a right (Which it is not), and tell people that there's now zero tolerance for DUI. You drive drunk, no license for you, ever, with absolutely zero tolerance. Get caught driving without a license, 20 years in lockup, no parole.   in 2013, *10 thousand fucking people* died in america due to drink driving. More than three 9/11's. Hitting some drunk with a thousand dollar fine and a slap on the wrist isn't cutting it. We need to treat drunk driving as the serious public health risk it is.  And before any drunk-splainers show up to say how it'd "ruin some poor guy's life" to not be able to drive around, tough shit. The thousands of dead people's lives are gone, not ruined, and them and their loved ones the people you should be concerned for, not drunks.      legit: i went to buy some fucking thin mints off some girl scouts and they were like "we're out" and i said "That's fucking great" under my breath, and told them i was good then, thanks.  I was anything but good.   My brother and i were unloading a motorcycle engine for his harley from a pickup truck.   I tell him "we don't have a crane or anything, we'll have to make some kind of makeshift lift to get it out of the truck and then into the garage"  he says "i'll carry it." Picks up the fucking engine, grunts, and *walks it into the garage* about thirty feet away and then sets it down. I was both impressed and mildly horrified.  He also does metal casting, and sometimes pours enormous (gallon+) containers of boiling metal by himself, with the only safety precaution being someone else there in case he pours molten metal all over his legs by accident. So far, so good on accidents, though.   Until we get serious about drunk driving, these types of incidents will continue to happen with alarming frequency   Could be someone ex-military, certainly. Whoever it is their pretty good with a gun and good at concealing themselves to fire, which takes training, practice, and forethought, all things i'd associate with someone in the military.   Beautifully drawn, good detail.      I was a little surprised, as well, honestly.   there's a few options, here, that would make sense:  1. His parents had some kind of magic worked on him before he was born, that made him as he is in terms of being able to do magic. If this is intentional or not is up to you.  2. He was kidnapped by a (evil? merely insane?) wizard and experimented on, leaving him changed in a fundamental way. His parents were able to have him rescued (or, he rescued himself, or they paid a ransom, or what have you)  3. A god/demon blessed/cursed him for some sacrilege or heresy or offering. This should be a huge deal, something that totally changed his entire life and existence. It'd be something the character would have a borderline obsession with.  4. Alternatively, if he's rich enough, he might have just bought or had made an elixir by some alchemist.  5. A mysterious artifact of questionable origin makes him able to do magery, and without it he is powerless. The unusual background would be how he got that artifact, discovered it's powers, etc.  The key would be to add some flavor to it through quirks or actual disadvantages to offset it, though these need not be very game-changing.   Indeed.    less so beltway, more so a thrill killer or something. He probably gets off on the god-like position he places himself in: deciding who lives and dies, who gets shot and who doesn't.  I suspect this is a cooling off period, and he'll either come back or change methods to something more risky for himself.    According to an [FBI Symposium on it](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder/serial-murder-1#two):   Serial Murder: The unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events.  But they acknowledge that it's a shaky definition and that people disagree about it all the time.   Yeah that's what i'd say, too, if i was quitting out of fear. "Lol, we're not afraid, we're just wanting to do other things. Things that won't get us shot at, preferably!"    That's kind of how i view it. Plus, the price is occasionally insane, they sometimes get *really good* games in their bundles, and there's always lots of games per bundle. Absolutely perfect for gift-giving   One of the great tragedies of dogs is that though they'd love us and help us all our lives, they live only a fraction as long as we do. I hope his time post-service was spent happy and content.   Trump is disgusting and the sooner he disappears from the public eye the happier i'll be. His only value is as a punchline to jokes, and that seems to be something he's forgotten.   As well it should, that's appalling.    Not necessarily a bad thing. Having one really well-designed piece of software is better than having a dozen poorly designed pieces of software.   I think D D would better capture the "feel" of dota, because the characters tend to be less fragile and damage tends to be less.    Certainly that's how i feel about it. To abuse anyone is deplorable, but to use a position of authority to facilitate that abuse is repulsive.   That's kind of how i feel, too. Looking at the logistics of it, the sub would be absolutely flooded with quizzes. So i'll probably just do one big one.    If that were true, someone would have repealed the gas taxes we have, or the cigarette taxes (believe you me, people *piss and moan* about cigarette taxes). Change is possible, we're just 100% unwilling to even try to achieve it.    I dunno about that. Whatever's wrong with her, doing meth for years certainly did not help.   Every time someone suggests shooting a drone down, it's a red flag they've never shot a flying, moving target before, and that they do not understand the inherent difficulties and risks of trying to do so. It's like all the people saying cops should "shoot to wound" like that's a totally sensible thing to do.   That's how i feel about it. A new mouse cursor might not make or break a game - but a *bad* mouse cursor certainly is something i notice.   When this story first broke I assumed she was merely mentally ill. Knowing that she was a tweaker who didn't give a shit makes it worse, somehow.   No clue, but a fair question   Greetings, users of my favorite subreddit. Today we have a question of a different sort!   Would you all like me to do a quiz for every episode that airs (which would be a LOT of quizzes in a very short time!) or would you like me to do a big final quiz for the entirety of 14B?   Bear in mind, if TeenNick/MTV Canada doesn't put the episodes online right away, this entire question is moot, of course. I only watch the show online.   Anyway, I hope everyone's having a great summer and is looking forward to 14B. I know I am.    i'd say the difficulty isn't in setting up the heroes (though some of them have pretty bizarre abilities if i remember right) but rather in capturing the "feel" of the game itself.  probably one of the few gurps scenarios that would need some amount of house ruling to deal with properly. Key elements would include summoning in "trash" monsters to kill, and the idea of the turrets. I'd expect the overall fight to be pretty short one way or the other unless you came up with some kind of rules-based respawn system.  That said i don't see any reason this couldn't work, though the trash mobs might present quite a bit of book-keeping and a bit of a balance issue (you need them to be tough enough to be a challenge, but not so tough as to be to hard to kill). A similar set of problems exist for the turrets - it'd be very easy for them to be incredibly lethal.          or you could just start taxing the living shit out of beef like we do cigarettes, and - surprise! - you instantly fix the problem of beef consumption. If a pound of beef costs twice as much as a pound of lobster, people won't be cooking hamburgers 3 nights a week.  of course any solution to any environmental problem that requires the *least iota* of cost, inconvenience or change to consumer behavior is considered so impossible as to be a non-starter. I say fuckit, let the world burn.          ironically i posted that bit entirely to point out the incredible danger he posed: someone who's mentally ill, armed, and refusing to comply is the definition of someone who's a serious threat to the life of everyone around them.             Would be great for palliative care for things like terminal cancer patients or certain diseases, but probably not used much by the general public.   There are people who can't feel pain, and they do not have good lives because of that particular curse.   If these rules were followed religiously everywhere i gotta think we'd have a very different set of software at our disposal, and a very different set of values about software.    Just to think, i remember when the hysteria was over eating disorders in teenagers instead of them being overweight.  oh well, whatever gets funding for more research, right?   I hate frats, in truth.    Sounds like a deeply traumatized person. I hope she can move past this and have a sense of safety again.   It'd not surprise me. That or justice porn   I think as a society we generally lack structure and purpose for people. I suspect many of our problems as a society stem from that issue of people just feeling lost and without real purpose or meaningful goals.   Until we find a way to give (more) people goals and purpose in life, i suspect things won't much improve, no matter how hard we try to change our prison system or law enforcement techniques. The things that drive people to a *life* of crime are pretty well intractable.   Or, alternatively, prison just *isn't that bad* for the repeat offenders. They know people inside, it's a reasonably safe environment (from the perspective of murder, at any rate) and they know how to work within the confines of the system. If someone's spent most of his life in jail, going back probably doesn't seem so bad.   Either way, even if tomorrow we instituted drastic changes in the system, there'd still be an enormous population of people damaged by the previous system, who would have to be dealt with in some way.    [The recidivism rate is eye-opening.](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp tid=17)  Certainly i don't feel that our current justice system does much to prevent repeat offenders from, well, re-offending.   Every time i get a car on my bumper, i slow down. Whatever bullshit they have going on isn't an excuse to jeopardize my safety. Tailgaters deserve what they get.   Either the kids a super-criminal, or his parents just did not give a shit. My guess is? They just didn't give a shit, not before he got shot, and not after.    he'll probably get a diploma while in prison; if he's in that long he'll have lots of times to work the various programs etc (in pursuit of the goal of being a "good behavior" sort of prisoner).   That said, this kid's situation is 100% his fault. He made the choices that lead to him being in the situation he's in.    I don't know that i can be happy that a person was maimed, that their life's been ruined, that they've thrown away their potential.  But i am content with this outcome, and i do feel that justice has been served.   As well he should be. The man is guilty as sin. The more interesting question is if he'll get the needle or not, and if so how long it'll take to be visited upon him.      I like how any opinion that is not in absolute lock-step with reddit is either trolling, "edgy" or the poster being an asshole. I just have a different way of looking at things than (apparently) the majority of people here do.    Kid probably thought he was hot shit, until one of the people he was used to victimizing decided to fight back for a change.       you call them "kids" like they were 8 years old or something. They were teenagers, out driving to fast. The only positive thing that could be said about them is they didn't hurt anyone but themselves with their reckless behavior.    that's pretty neat. I wish they had records so we could ask them what they were trying to say with the piece - it's clear there's some kind of symbolic thinking going on there.    Which do i trust:  1. My interpretation of a law written in some positively dense legalese  2. That some lawyer  - who's *entire  career* is spent fucking people over for money - will have some way of exploiting a loophole in that law to profit from my actions  I'm going with #2. You wanna risk it, feel free, by all means.    I live in ohio. Trust me, we got assholes who'll sue you for anything here just like anywhere else.   I'm pretty curious to see what they do with it. The rivers were my consistent least-favorite feature in A11.    They are, in fact, idiots. They were speeding, hit rail road tracks, and wrecked because of that. People who speed excessively enough to cause that kind of accident are, by definition, idiots.   As to how i'd feel - well, i wouldn't be surprised if no one leapt to my aid. I pretty much expect that no one'll help me out if something goes amiss.   The guy did nothing to worsen their condition, he's morally in the clear so far as i'm concerned.    Yeah i don't expect anyone to help me if something bad were to happen to me. if they do, great, but it's not something i expect out of them.    Yeah and then their shitbag parents sue me for everything i own because the doctor says "well, when they were pulled out it DID worsen the ligament damage..."  In the society i live in, helping other people is a tremendous risk, and one i am unwilling to take.   Other people were there helping them out. They don't need me clotting up the 911 line with yet another report of a vehicle fire.   To me this is one of those artifacts that's really open to interpretation. Is it a dog with a turtle shell? is it a turtle with a dog's head? is it representative of something from their faith, or is it something representative of something from life?   Definitely strange and a little baffling. At least it looks happy.   He ain't an asshole. I mean he's not a saint, obviously, but it's not like he did anything to worsen the harm done to them or to prevent them getting aid. If the man has committed a sin, it's that he spoke the truth and it offends people.   Hell, i was always taught that if someone was in a car crash, the last thing you did was move or touch them if you weren't trained to do so, because of the risk of worsening injuries.   Also i'd note this guy's more involved than me - i would have just left. I don't need the hassle.   Just because the guy reacted differently than you doesn't make him an asshole.    Sounds like something a business owner would say to make his poorly-paid wage-slaves work a little harder to make him rich.   I was there when my grandmother died of cancer at the age of 86, and she didn't spend any time lamenting how she didn't work hard enough in life or didn't spend enough time on making money. She mostly was sad she was gonna die and wished she had more time with her family.   I spend every minute i can with the people i love doing things i enjoy, because i don't want to die full of regrets that i didn't. Let the workaholics work themselves into an early grave full of sadness and misery; it ain't my scene.    That's correct. Apparently the murderer shot the victim then themselves when they were confronted, before the police were able to do anything about it. I gotta wonder what the deeper story is, here - seems like an atypical crime.   As the 41-year-old played videographer, neighbors worked to pull Goodin out of the burning vehicle.  So it's a total non-story, then. There were other people attempting to render aid, this guy just video'd.  Media's probably pissed that he wanted to sell them the footage instead of just giving it to them for whatever pennies they want to throw at him.      What a fucking shitshow.   TLC needs to just stop doing the freakshows and go back to educational programming.    I don't think it was cunning what let her get away with it, rather just raw luck.    Found the arm in a plastic bag, so it's apt that they were put there by a person, rather than accident.   It'd be absolutely brutal to maintain such a project for that length of time. Even worse, if there's any instability (bandit attacks, wars, etc) - that could disrupt the entire process!    definitely not your usual abuse case. I have to wonder how these two degenerates got hooked up in the first place, and how they hatched this scheme.      Congrats! Keep up the great work and i hope it brings you great success!   One of the two cases that got me into true crime (and serial killers in general). Truly one of the more disturbing pair of criminals out there.   Looks like someone chopped up a murder victim and distributed them along the tracks. Only question is why they'd choose that location to dump the body - and, of course, who they both are.      Was at goodwill the other day, and saw an aluminum kid's bat, and told my g/f that it would be the perfect home-defense weapon in a lot of ways: plausibly deniable as a weapon, lethal, blunt so it's less likely to make a mess. Plus it was pretty handy due to it's shorter length, and had really good balance.  Sadly she did not approve getting it to stick by the door.        I think about violence a lot.   I hope no one direly needed the air support that day.    I'd note that the *cost of living* for the mages would be non-trivial. 4.5 years of food, drink, medical care, clothing, shelter, etc would not be cheap by any stretch.  And that's *before* the materials that went into the amulet itself.   Which leads me to my wonderment that it's not more common for stuff to just fall off of military aircraft. You almost never hear about it happening.    The world breathes an enormous sigh of relief and everyone feels a whole lot better about the north korean situation.   Something i've always wondered about is the tribes (or towns, or groups) who just got wiped out before anyone but the other locals even knew they existed. Without writing, there'd be no record they'd even lived and died. But they had traditions and customs and maybe even their own words or languages, and that's all gone forever now.  Kind of depressing to think about.   The drama would *explode*.    Light a candle for the sinners, get your favorite beverage, and see what shakes loose once the juice hits.   No sweat! I'm an ardent gun rights supporter, and gun owner. I feel the best way to further those two things is to educate everyone i can about firearms and whatnot, so i always try to do just that.   I like it.    Oh there's a bunch - notably some guns are made in limited editions, or that very few have been made; certainly some are exotic in their own right, or have notable quality. Desert Eagles come to mind - people love the things and their collectible just because of that, even though their modern firearms and not otherwise remarkable.   Of course, some (or many) of his guns could have been relics or antiques or such; it's hard to say without more info.    When i was a kid, we were so poor that sometimes the boxes of macaroni and cheese we'd eat (and man, we ate a lot!) would have bugs in them. My mother'd always say "There's no bugs left in the macaroni - see, they all floated to the top."   Considering that (most of the time) boiled insects are perfectly safe to eat, i'd not worry about it overly much.    I've long ran a plasma tank that has 2 legs (one front, one rear) and the rest tracks. The legs give me superb mobility while the tracks are very durable and survivable.    With the one kid still being alive we might well find out, unlike in a lot of these cases.   Typically if you see someone own that many guns, their a collector of some kind - either for financial reasons (guns tend to be pretty valuable, some especially so) or for reasons of just collecting them. I'd be very surprised if he even shot most of them on a regular basis.   At one point i owned like 15 guns, only ever shot like 3 of them; the rest were for collector's value and what not.         How's those gun control laws working out for them, i wonder. Not like someone can't just beat a cop and take their gun or something.      I spend most of my time projecting as intimidating and dissuading a persona and image as i can in public. Not only do i try to look crazy and violent, but i try very hard to look poor, too.   I generally have zero hassles and zero bullshit in public because of that; people know i have nothing of value, and i look deranged enough that bothering me seems like more work than it's worth.  That said, i never make eye contact with anyone, i always act very evasive about it. I find it puts people on edge if you never look them in the eye. I also talk to quiet, so they have to strain to hear me and lean in, which also makes them uncomfortable.   Concerning one's self with the comfort of others is the first step to making yourself vulnerable to the depredations of others.    You surely mean "freak show". Trump belongs in a tent next to Lobster Boy, biting the heads off chickens for his keep.   keep dreaming. People are gonna keep breeding until they literally cannot anymore, and no biofuel or whatever is going to slow that down in the slightest.   That's not really surprising: you have to *truly* fuck up to build up a lot of credit card debt, and you have to fuck up worse to be deep under water on a car.   as to the platooning, me and a friend tried for *20 minutes* to get into a T-10 match platooned and couldn't do it; we had to play classic over and over instead of the proper game (which we very much wanted to play, for the team work!)   it was very frustrating.    Is it any surprise? You don't get a site like this if the company is ran by saints.    It's definitely pretty fucked up.   Fair point   The main thing that's changed for me is that i now view women as being much tougher than i did when i was younger. They tend to be akin to dogs and simply hide that they have an injury, rather than acknowledge the injury and treat it. Once i understood that, i saw they were much more durable than i'd given them credit for.   i'm 99% sure this is actually intended to be used scraping out pot bowls. The blades look about the right size, and dope heads love hidden shit like this. Thinks it makes them clever.   never read the comments on youtube. never.   that's like /r/instantregret - you KNOW their gonna regret it, but it's all about how they get there.   That would go a little off-script for me, i have to think. People would be waiting for the punchline.    That's pretty metal. Wonder what they thought when they finally cracked the casket open.   Algea just re-releases it's carbon after it dies. You need to put it somewhere it won't decay into the atmosphere. If such a place even exists, i could not venture a guess where it is or how difficult it would be to transport the required amount there.   shhh, don't ruin their "we can save the world with a bullshit startup money grab!" circle-jerk. If they realized the actual scope of the problem they'd just despair of any fix, like i do.   That's the bitch about bein' dead. You stop being able to speak for yourself.   That's how i feel about it; this is where i go to watch the shitshow that is the parts of reddit i don't go to.   i'd legit be afraid to boot conspiracy - some of those people are fucking deranged, and i'd worry they'd do something regrettable.  if they get rid of cute female corpses, where will i send unsuspecting people on instant messengers for shock value?    Indeed. This shit's going to taint his name forever, and it is incredibly depressing.   The man's skill and tenacity can't be denied. If i was under fire, i'd hope to be 1/3rd as competent as he was.   Would get slightly more karma to paint it as "cop ambushed", but certainly that angle would work as well. Probably a good headline (for attention grabbing) would be like "Cop opens fire on car of black teenagers in Saint Louis" which would hit all the buttons.    That's Tennessee for you.    Posted because this is 100% the kind of bullshit i hate in the media:  The Rachel Dolezal story was huge, this guy's name gets dragged through the mud, and there's one shitty, short article that doesn't even MENTION IN THE ORIGINAL TITLE that he's her brother talking about how the charges have been dismissed.  Crock of shit, yo.      I ask this with all sincerity: was there anyone who genuinely believed Jeb was electable? I mean, the dude's the worst parts of Mitt Romney and the worst parts of George Bush.             The only rehabilitation a man who violently rapes an 82 year old needs is a nice injection of whatever shit their using for lethal injections these days.    I suspect this data's totally bullshit, for a few reasons:  1. There's many, many, many more "normal people" than there are politicians, criminals, etc. It's like saying "most of the requests are from people who make  1,000,000  a year in income" - well, yeah, of course.  2. There's really no reason to know why or for what cause someone put in the request, or even *who* really put in the request. For all we know this could be due to some privacy activism group going through the phonebook or sending in all their friends and family's names.    An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.      And it already lists ellen pao as an example. Good to see the martyrdom is well underway.  	150
 Apocalypse Now (1979) and Fitzcarraldo (1982) are two movies that had quite troubled productions, but they turned out great in the end.   Check out the posters at https://www.polishposter.com and see if you can find any cool ones, maybe from some movies you yourself like. A lot of great stuff there.   From Wikipedia:      *"On September 5, 2014, Paramount announced that Terminator Genisys would be the first film in a new stand-alone trilogy, with two sequels scheduled for release on May 19, 2017 and June 29, 2018. On February 24, 2015, Schwarzenegger confirmed that he will return for the first sequel."*      If you use Google, you'll find some more information.   Some of my top favourites:      * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lhxlvYF4        * Dead Man (1995): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx3ajYfbzcw                      * Once Upon a Time in the West (1968): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6BQKFs3-VM              * Silence Has No Wings (1966): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBB1vlExQFo             * The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yIkWGmZ1g            A very diverse list. Nice to see many of my favourites from the 90s, especially the movies from Ming-liang, Rivette, Herzog, Tarr, Kiarostami, Makhmalbaf, Panahi, and some others.   Under 90 minutes:      1. Winter Light (1963)    2. Pickpocket (1959)   3. Persona (1966)    4. A Woman Is a Woman (1961)     5. Mouchette (1967)          Over 200 minutes:     1. Andrei Rublev (1966)      2. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    3. Shoah (1985)    4. Seven Samurai (1954)     5. World on a Wire (1983)      I think the majority of people hanging out in this subreddit have already seen it.   Here you go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_screen   This is embarrassing. I don't know if I should feel sorry for the one who wrote that, but someone needs to do their homework.   Have you seen The Sword of Doom (1966) and Three Outlaw Samurai (1964)? Two other great Japanese samurai films.   TSPDT is the definitive answer: http://www.theyshootpictures.com/   Well, you are kind of asking about two different things here. For me, I think it was L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni that made me appreciate cinema on a deeper level. But it's hard to give a specific answer, because we don't know anything about her taste or background. Has she seen movies by directors like Tarkovsky, Ozu, Mizoguchi, Antonioni, Bergman, Kiarostami, Haneke, Lynch, Kubrick, Truffaut or any other big, great, interesting or important director? What has she seen? Does she need something a little bit like movies by Hitchcock, Coppola or Scorsese that's perhaps more accessible than for example Tarkovsky or Antonioni? Where does she stand? Has she seen many classics?    Force Majeure(Swiss)  Not a Swiss movie, it's Swedish.   If you want some great and puzzling movies that aren't concerned with overexplaining everything to the viewer, I would suggest these:     * Eden and After (1970)     * Last Year at Marienbad (1961)    * The Limits of Control (2009)           I can't answer your first question, but I can really recommend the Bergman box set, three really great films, two of his absolutely best ones as well. About the Dreyer set, there's a Blu-ray collection BFI released recently that has all of the films that are in the Criterion box, also the same documentary. It's not that pricy right now, could be worth looking into.      No, it won't. It's a documentary. That top list only includes feature films.   Le rvlateur (1968) by Philippe Garrel is superb.   If you like Barry Lyndon (1975) and Mr. Turner (2014), I would suggest checking out The Go-Between (1971), The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and Nightwatching (2007).   1. Norte, the End of History (2013)    2. The Turin Horse (2011)    3. The Day He Arrives (2011)    4. Amour (2012)    5. The Act of Killing (2012)     You should check out The Straight Story (1999) by David Lynch, it's quite similar to Nebraska (2013).   Well, it depends. If you are into Resnais and Robbe-Grillet (who wrote the script) and have studied their films a bit, then maybe not. I know that many viewers find the film quite incomprehensible though. With that said, it's not a film that's in any way "easy".   Well, rarely have I seen a movie that explores the problems of our existence (mostly communication) and the impossibility to know another person as good as Hiroshima mon amour (1959), because it really does it in such interesting ways. It has much to do with memories, time, space, and subjectivity, and the premise with two lovers from different countries together with the war perspective gives it a rich and nuanced look at all those things. I really like how the film is about opposites and contradictions, which you can get to know directly as it starts as well as the differences between the lovers and many other things. Also, it discusses those things very well. It's a bit hard talking about it without spoiling everything to you, but I assure you it's a special movie! The cinematography is beautiful as well as the music, and the whole story is cleverly told with memories, flashbacks, the past, voice-overs, and the present.        It's hard to compare it to other films, because I think it's really unique. It's mostly similar to Last Year at Marienbad (1961), that was also directed by Resnais. Other than that, I can think of Silence Has No Wings (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki, Farewell to the Summer Light (1968) by Yoshishige Yoshida, and maybe The Mirror (1975) by Andrei Tarkovsky.   Quentin Tarantino borrows quite heavily (and even copies) from other directors and films. Whether it be from Jean-Luc Godard, Japanese samurai movies, Hong-Kong action, exploitation movies, martial arts films, or spaghetti-westerns. So a lot of what you see in his films are homages to films he himself admires. He gets a lot of credit of being original, which I think he really doesn't deserve. A big majority of his fans have never even heard about the films he borrows from.      But yeah, there's some other examples worth mentioning. I'd like to take three of my favourites for the moment:        * Yasujir Ozu     A quite unique director. He mostly positioned his camera very low, often only one foot above the ground or a little higher. This was called the "tatami shot", something he is credited for inventing. Also, he rarely moved the camera, almost nothing at all if you go further into his career. One other thing he was known for was breaking the 180-degree rule, so when he filmed conversations, the camera would look directly into the characters, placing the viewer in the middle of the scene. These are just some of the small things that set him apart from many other filmmakers.    * Robert Bresson    Instead of having myself repeat everything I've said about this man, I'll link to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/3amtws/how_can_i_get_robert_bresson/cse44vs) answer that I gave in another subreddit concerning a discussion about him. There's some stuff written down in the English Wikipedia article what sets him apart from others as well. There's literally no one like Bresson, because he invented his own "rules" and idea of filmmaking.      * Yoshishige Yoshida    A director that really deserves more attention. I you look at films like Farewell to the Summer Light (1968), Eros Plus Massacre (1969), Heroic Purgatory (1970), or Confessions Among Actresses (1971), you can see Yoshida has a very distinct style, at least he had it pretty much in the sixties. He often emphasized corners, placing the camera in a lot of different positions where others rarely did. His mise en scne is quite special in how he placed characters, where the placed the camera and how he edited everything. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOnETIFQCY) is a great example from the opening sequence in Heroic Purgatory (1970).     There's plenty others to mention too, like Wong Kar-wai, Andrei Tarkovsky, Theo Angelopoulos, Jean-Pierre Melville, Peter Greenaway, Kenji Mizoguchi, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Jacques Tati, Jean-Luc Godard, Tsai Ming-liang, Shji Terayama, Stan Brakhage, Bla Tarr, Aki Kaurismki, Sharunas Bartas, Roy Andersson, Sergio Leone, Dario Argento etc. And you have of course the more classic filmmakers that had unique styles as well, like Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick, to name two.      Diabolique (1955).   Yeah, I've seen it. It's a nice little road movie with interesting characters and a warm feeling overall. It's interesting that the movie was released by Walt Disney Pictures, heh. I wouldn't call it one of the best pictures from David Lynch though, but as I said, it's of course not bad at all.      I would suggest watching the the even longer version that runs at 251 minutes. There's big differences. The US version that clocks in at 139 minutes is totally rearranged so that the narrative is in chronological order, which just butchers the non-chronological story the film has from the beginning. Maybe I shouldn't spoil everything they cut, but it's a lot, and this just makes the film lose a lot of what's actually good in it. And if you ask me, you absolutely don't have the epic feeling in the shorter versions, which is kind of essential for the film from the start.   Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970) by Elio Petri. Cool soundtrack by Morricone and an amazing performance by Gian Maria Volont. Great use of flashback scenes mixed with the viewpoint from the protagonist. Even funny at times, especially because of how absurd the situation is. A lovely dark satire about police investigations, corruption and standing above the law. Also a commentary about the Italian government in the late 1960s and early 70s. This one really sticks with you!   http://www.blu-ray.com/ is good.   Yeah, Black Narcissus (1947) is absolutely another one of their best looking films. Don't forget to check out The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) as well, also in Technicolor.   Not my favourite movie by Powell   Pressburger, but it's certainly not bad at all! The dance scenes are really cool and it's interesting how they are integrated in the whole movie. And yeah, the colors are just gorgeous.     Here's two essays about it that could interest you:       http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1518-the-red-shoes-dancing-for-your-life      http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/51-the-red-shoes   The Intouchables (2011).   I would suggest Late Ozu. If you ask me, it's the best one of those. You get five fine Ozu films, what's not to like about that?   Judging by the posters, this could very much end up being the best movie of all time. Just kidding.   Have you seen The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)? Also directed by Woody Allen, so it's a quite similar when it comes to those fantasy elements.   Out of those on your list, I would recommend Odd Man Out (1947) and Three Outlaw Samurai (1964). You get in my opinion of the best British film noirs and one of the best samurai movies.   Yeah, of course. Two of my absolute favourite biopics are Andrei Rublev (1966) and Eros Plus Massacre (1969), both masterpieces in my opinion. I feel that Eros Plus Massacre (1969) is a bit overlooked too, so it could as well fit in into a list like that.   Edvard Munch (1974) by Peter Watkins is really, really good. Great to see it mentioned. A biopic I would rank very high. I love Watkin's documentary form and how he uses it to explore ideas that didn't only put Munch in the focus, but rather the time period and the people that lived in it.   * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lhxlvYF4      * Dead Man (1995): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx3ajYfbzcw     * Once Upon a Time in the West (1968): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6BQKFs3-VM     * Silence Has No Wings (1966): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBB1vlExQFo      * The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yIkWGmZ1g      That movie is so good. Very existential. Would love a Blu-ray release of it, it really deserves it.   Really? Then you have missed something! It's set in the Philipines in 1945, at the end of WWII. Abandoned by their command and facing starvation, the Japanese Imperial Army are being reduced to small groups hiding in the jungles. In the midst of this, the situation just gets worse when some of the men go insane and resort to murder and cannibalism. We get to follow Tamura, a soldier who tries to survive without giving up his own principles. It's a must see.   Fires on the Plain (1959) by Kon Ichikawa. A really devastating, nightmarish, dirty, chaotic and absurd depiction of war and what it does to people.   Tokyo Story (1953) is one of Ozu's best films and just has to be seen. It's a mellow, beautiful, tragic and very important post-war film, as it explores family matters in a very nuanced and rich way, setting the old against the new, something which Ozu often did and gave us at the same time a glimpse into Japanese culture and the everyday lives of people. It's also shot in an uncompromising matter with many excellent and static shots. Nothing is rushed. And yeah, two of my favourite actors, Chish Ry and Setsuko Hara are in it as well and both are doing some of their best performances. They have those faces that look so friendly that you just can't hate them. Pick it up!   Clo from 5 to 7 (1962) by Agns Varda is great. For those who haven't seen it, it's about a French singer, who is afraid of getting the result of a test from her doctor. She thinks she has cancer and that she'll die. The whole movie takes place in Paris where we follow her for two hours while she is wandering through the streets and meeting people.   To be honest, I can't think of any I actually would like to see. There's enough already and there's new reboots coming almost all the time. I'd rather see movies not connected with past franchises coming. These big franchises that are getting revived on and on nowadays are mostly unoriginal and contain very generic forms of repetition, whether it's in ideas, narratives, stories, characters or form, it's rarely that you actually see something that actually stands out in terms of how they are made. Of course, this can apply to movies that aren't based on these franchises as well, but then you have at least something free from the start, and not something that's following certain formulas.   The Seventh Continent (1989) by Michael Haneke.               Here's what I wrote about it in another subreddit too, if someone is wondering why:         For those who haven't seen it, it's about a middle-class couple that's living together with their daughter. They dream of escaping to Australia to start a new life. Their current life is monotonous and full of routines, but they decide to do something about it one day. First of all, I love the form and how uncompromising it is. There is no soundtrack, so the little music that exists in the film is diegetic. The color palette is very dry and bleak, just like the overall atmosphere. Haneke takes his time by telling the story with long and static takes instead of moving the camera, which I'm a big fan of, I think that just adds to the form and connects well with the monotonous life of the family. There's no clear answers, which I also admire Haneke for, he is great when it comes to asking important questions and making his audience think and feel.            There's no other movie that made me feel as much as this one. It's just crushing. It's like a punch in the gut. The Seventh Continent (1989) also gives some interesting discussions about alienation, existentialism, society and materialism. One of my favourite scenes is the one with the family sitting and just staring while their TV is on with the song "The Power of Love" playing, a wonderful juxtaposition considering the nihilistic tone and depressing atmosphere the movie actually has. I can go on talking about it a bit more, but I'm not going to spoil out everything here, so this will do as for now. In my opinion, this movie is simply amazing and a true masterpiece.      You're averaging 3 or more movies a day?!     Something like that, maybe. I don't know the exact average number.          This is part of your day job, right?      No, it isn't.   No. I use Filmtipset and ICheckMovies to rate and keep track of what I've seen.   The Story of Film: An Odyssey (2011).   535, but then I'm not counting rewatched movies.   I don't think he cares, he's still making a shitload of money. As long as people pay for his movies, critics are probably his least concern.   * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)       * Dead Man (1995)      * Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)      * Silence Has No Wings (1966)       * The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)         Thumbs up. Great trilogy. Love me some Fassbinder.   * Naked (1993)     * Rififi (1955)    * Wings of Desire (1987)  * World on a Wire (1973)     I would narrow it down to those. All of them are great, especially Naked (1993) and Wings of Desire (1987). I remember that it didn't take long until I rewatched Naked (1993) after the first time I saw it. It's really dark with bits of comedy as black as the rest of the film. Johnny is one of the most interesting protagonists I've ever seen. He's just so broken, quite like the rest of the people he is meeting. The whole film is filled with sharp dialogue and never gets boring. David Thewlis did an amazing performance. It really sticks with you. There's really something special about it!      And Wings of Desire (1987) is a very nice pick as well. One of Wim Winder's best ones. Philosophical, a bit romantic and beautiful cinematography to enjoy. Charming, cool, thoughtful and full of emotion.   A movie that's underrated isn't the same thing as a movie that most people haven't heard of. You could say that a movie most people haven't heard of is unknown, but underrated is a whole different thing. Underrated is something you can apply to a movie that the majority of people don't like, or to a movie that you feel isn't rated high enough, it doesn't have to do with how known or unknown it is.      It ends.   It actually takes place during the Middle Ages as well, but it's mostly a bit uncertain when it actually took place, but in contrast with Andrei Rublev (1966) that has a timeline and is based around a real person, Marketa Lazarov (1967) is based on a legend. The movie has a strong vibe of religion too, as it's set against the backdrop of Christianity replacing Paganism. There's also a feud between two rival medieval clans, somewhat like in Andrei Rublev (1966) where you have the rivalry between the princes and Tatars. So there's even some similar content on the story side.   I'm glad to hear that! Feel free to let me know what you thought about it afterwards if you are going to watch it!   Strange, it works for me. I updated the link, try now?   I wouldn't say that either of them actually did amazing films from the beginning. It seems like a stretch to say that, but that's on the other hand my opinion. Anyways, I guess you could make a comparison like that if you want. Some people would probably agree with you. There's probably other directors that could fit in as well. In the end, it's mostly about taste.   This upcoming Yoshida box set that will be a limited edition is a must:    http://www.arrowfilms.co.uk/shop/index.php?route=product/product keyword=kiju product_id=571%22   Really? I'm glad to hear that! It's truly unique and amazing. If you liked it that much, I really recommend checking out Woman in the Dunes (1964) by Teshigahara (the same director) as well. It's not a science fiction film, but it's just as brilliant as The Face of Another (1966) and also based on a book by Kb Abe.      And about the titles, I think I'll just try it.   Not really.   You should watch Wild Strawberries (1957) by Ingmar Bergman.      Ant-Man (2015).   Because one likes statistics? I like to have everything I've seen written down and rated. I also have some other statistics, movies I've seen by decades, how many movies I've seen by every director, how many movies I've seen from different countries etc. It can be helpful in many ways. I myself have all my stats on a specific website, and that has certainly helped me to discover hundreds of new films and directors. So, that's some of the benefits. Depending on how you do it, it can help you discover a lot of new stuff. I also like to see how my taste develops with time.   Yes, indeed. I keep track of the movies I've watched and rate them as well. I have rated 3771 films so far. I rate them from 1 to 5, so I only have five different grades.   Oh. Yeah, man. Interstellar (2014) was so overly clear that it really twisted my brain when the movie on an on kept explaining everything to the audience. And yeah, Sucker Punch (2011) was so horrible that my brain literally exploded. What a twist!   Great! Yeah, that's some good stuff. Tarkovsky is my favourite director, what a man. A fun little trivia is that Konstantin Lopushanskiy was an assistant director to Stalker (1979). And his own movies are a bit similar to Tarkovsky's work, especially Tarkovsky's science fiction movies.   It's been like that a while. But luckily, there's movies made outside of Hollywood too.   Here's ten great foreign science fiction movies:     * Fantastic Planet (1973) *(Ren Laloux)*    * La jete (1962) *(Chris Marker)*   * Letters from a Dead Man (1986) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*    * Metropolis (1927) *(Fritz Lang)*     * Solaris (1972) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*       * Stalker (1979) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*       * The Face of Another (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*   * Visitor of a Museum (1989) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*     * Woman in the Moon (1929) *(Fritz Lang)*    * World on a Wire (1973) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*     I especially recommend The Face of Another (1966), Solaris (1972) and Stalker (1979), because all those three are what I would consider some of the best movies of all time.   Marketa Lazarov (1967) is beautiful, a bit similar to Andrei Rublev (1966).   Right now it's mostly these five:     * Cemetery of Splendor (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*      * Our Little Sister (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*    * Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*       * Sweet Red Bean Paste (2015) *(Naomi Kawase)*       * Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*        The Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray:      * Pather Panchali (1955)    * Aparajito (1957)     * The World of Apu (1959)      A great series that has three films with very connected plots. I have no idea if you are familiar with the films or if you have seen them, but it's some good stuff. There's been a lot of talk about the trilogy lately, mostly because of new restorations that have been screen recently. Also, Criterion Collection are releasing the trilogy on Blu-ray sooner or later. The first one was Satyajit Ray's first feature film, which is impressing if you look at the quality of the work.     The three films form a very beautiful narrative, a bit of a coming of age-feeling about the the childhood, education and early maturity of a young Bengali boy named Apu in the early part of the 20th century where we start watching him growing up in poverty with his family.   The Seventh Continent (1989) is my favourite, I don't change it just because I'm drunk or whatever.    Why haven't they made a Mega Man live action film yet?     Who? People? Eddie Lebron directed a live action movie called Megaman (2010).   I think people who are confused by his films mostly are those that don't have any deeper interest in films and cinema overall, the ones who don't watch movies so often. While I'm not a fan of Nolan, I find his films rather the opposite of confusing, I feel that they are too clear and that he explains too much with exposition in dialogue, voice-over etc.   Stalker (1979) and Letters from a Dead Man (1986).   Ten of my favourites:      * Apocalypse Now (1979) *(Francis Ford Coppola)*     * Army of Shadows (1969) *(Jean-Pierre Melville)*     * Ashes and Diamonds (1958) *(Andrzej Wajda)*     * Come and See (1985) *(Elem Klimov)*     * Fires on the Plain (1959) *(Kon Ichikawa)*     * Ivan's Childhood (1962) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*         * La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000) *(Peter Watkins)*     * The Ascent (1977) *(Larisa Shepitko)*     * The Battle of Algiers (1966) *(Gillo Pontecorvo)*     * The Red and the White (1967) *(Mikls Jancs)*       Do tell afterwards!      Hard to take that list seriously with that name when Moon (2009) is the first one.   I read about them, but don't really put the focus on ratings. If something sounds interesting or if I want to watch it for some reason, I usually end up watching it. I see a lot of stuff that doesn't even have reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, so there's not so much to do about that anyways. I also have several different watchlists to help me as well.   I'm glad that you appreciate how much I love that damn movie!   I've never "trusted" those sites in the first place. I think it's too bad that people seem to see some objectivity in them, as if movies with high scores/ratings automatically must be good, same with IMDb. If you are interested in watching a movie, watch it. Don't let others be the judge of what you'll watch or not. It's okay to be dissappointed by a movie, it's not the whole world.   Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975).   Yeah, I know. The fact that they are releasing one of his films in September makes me have some hope! Anyways, even if Criterion won't release it on Blu-ray, somebody must do it!      Great! A must watch. I'm curious to see how it looks now! Let's hope that this will air in other countries as well. And let's also hope for a Blu-ray release, maybe Criterion can do that.      For the moment:     * A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day *(Alexander Jacob)*     * Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema *(David Desser)*    * Notes on the Cinematographer *(Robert Bresson)*      You can find them here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/trivia?tab=mc       Finding Mr. Destiny (Japanese flim, but worth it)  Why the "but"? Are you making some sort of implication with it? I don't get it. Anyways, you are quite on the wrong side if you are referring to the one directed by Jang Yu-jung (which I'm guessing you are), it's not a Japanese movie at all, it's South Korean.    What movies do you think will be remembered, let's say, 15 years from now when people think of the 00-decade?      Mulholland Dr. (2001).   I really like Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975).   Isn't it obvious that it depends on the actors, the directors and the movies? There's so many other things that would matter, so it's impossible to say anything definitive in the way that you are asking the question. But for example, I liked that Fassbinder had a special team of actors that he frequently used in his films. Same with Ozu. Chish Ry acted in 32 of Ozu's 54 films, a fun and interesting fact.    In those cases, it mostly worked splendid, but then there are other cases with other directors and actors that weren't too well off. Surely, if a combination works great, I have nothing against it if I see it again. On the other hand, change can be good as well. But as I said, it depends on so many factors.       I remember when Robert Bresson was asked if he would use Claude Laydu in his films again, he replied with this:     *"I robbed him of what I needed to make the film. How could I rob him twice?*      It's very interesting that he said it like that, but then again, you probably have to know about the way he worked and his own "rules" had to fully understand what he meant, heh.   Jonathan Rosenbaum.   https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/?page=1 sort=officialtoplists      Go there, check out the movies that are in the most lists, and go from there. Of course, you shouldn't really care how many lists certain movies are in, but in this  particular scenario, the first pages manages to get you acquainted with some of the most important, influental, widely referenced, and critically acclaimed movies of all time. If you go and look through the first pages, you'll find a great overview for some movies that are mandatory to have seen if you are trying to build up some sort of interest in cinema.        Also, this list is great for this too, even if it's a bit more than 25:    http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/      Anyways, you'll get a good start if you look into my suggestions. And if you want my personal top 25 favourites, just ask for it.      Bolshoe kosmicheskoe puteshestvie (1975) by Valentin Selivanov:     http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321492/      One of my favourites, I love this movie. Actually rewatched it weeks ago. It looks stunning on Blu-ray.   If I must choose, I would take The Night of the Hunter (1955).   Hexen bis aufs Blut geqult (1970). The English title is Mark of the Devil. A dirty exploitation horror flick about witchcraft, witchfinders and love. It has an amazing soundtrack that really sticks with you.   I understand why! That movie is truly beautiful.   I can suggest reading Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson. It's a great book to start with if you are getting interested in movies. It's kind of a basic introduction to the analysis of cinema and helps you with the understanding of films in many different ways.   Have you seen Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida? If not, it's a must see.   Of course it matters. And of course there's a point complaining about it, but only if you want to, feel the need to and want to be honest. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don't think your specific one automatically loses its importance just because a big majority of people loved it.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989):        A couple and their daughter are living a monotonous life filled with daily routines, but decide to something about it one day.   Great choice! Probably the best movie by Greenaway. Pure eye candy and also a smart and very interesting film. I love the symmetric mise-en-scne and the wonderful soundtrack by Michael Nyman.   **[Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064296)** by Yoshishige Yoshida. One of the best films ever made that should have some more attention here. Besides being a biography about the anarchist Sakae sugi, it also explores his relationships with three different women in the 1920s. And parallel to that story, we also get to follow two students in the 1960s that are exploring sugi's ideas and theories.       First off, Yoshida's cinematography is in my opinion aesthetic perfection, especially the framing where he uses spaces, corners, well picked and inventive camera positions to form his special mise-en-scne, putting the characters in context with the surroundings. And if we sway away a bit from the visual part, it's a very nuanced, rich, and complex depiction of sex, love, politics and history where past and present both interweave into each other and comment themselves. A true masterpiece.   L'eclisse (1962) and Pickpocket (1959)! You gotta have some Antonioni and Bresson!   I'll be getting Hiroshima mon amour (1959) for sure. Other than that one, I have these high up on my list as well:     * 8 (1963)    * Il sorpasso (1962)     * Marketa Lazarov (1967)    * Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)     * Smultronstllet (1957)      * Tky monogatari (1953)     * Welt am Draht (1973)       It's hard to pick out almost anything without ruining your wallet!         I think it's best starting with the original trilogy, the order in which they were released. Those are as well the more important ones in the Star Wars saga, at least if we talk about cultural significance, critical acclaim and pop culture references.  	121
                      The article says that it is effective, not a cure, although imo cancer is still one of the most profitable businesses so let's just hope that one day there will be an universal cure and not just something like monthly TV subscription eg. having someone on a hook just so pharma companies can squeeze as much as they can from one patient till he dies.      I wonder when we'll have ads appear on contact lenses else you won't be able to see or implanted in brains for crist sake ...

    [The Taming of The Shrew (1967)] (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_(1967_film))  was a great movie and way under appreciated in my opinion.   	2
 Hey! Crazy, I just saw this on my facebook feed this morning. It happened in a super small town in Georgia. That's awesome though, don't mess with off duty redneck fireman, you'll get rekt.   Very. She had diabeetus.   Oh god. Maybe. That is too accurate   Okay. I live in the South, and once knew this girl who was a totally weeaboo(spelling?) and also a gigantic redneck. This is basically what she would draw and have as her phone background. *cringe* Her playlist would go from anime theme songs to "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"   	4
 so i guess not completely original lol.  I knew they used bolts and other building materials that were slightly different, I did not realize they put engines in as well.   Is that engine water coming out of that hole on the side?   But what if i can not remember my password or username.  The thing kind of locked me out until I remembered it.   I am not saying he would win, but he is the only realistic competition at the moment everyone else is polling at 1 and 2 %   Destin's facebook comment   This article by Slate that explores the Facebook Freebooting problem. They asked me for quotes. I tried to be fair. They quoted me a bit strong, which makes me feel a tad strange.... Like Wyatt Earp trying to clean up the bad guys or something. I'm not Wyatt Earp. I'm just a dude learning stuff on the Internet. Also, it's kind of funny that I'm sharing this via Facebook.      You have to remember that there are more candidates in the republican field though so you would expect them to all have a smaller slice of the pie than Hillary who's only real competition at the moment is Bernie.   I don't really understand what your comment says.   Thats really cool, I have heard that it will take a while to get all the pictures back, there is going to be so much data to download.   Thats what I was going to say there is quite the monetary incentive to get married.   This sounds like about the same amount of extreme conservatives so I would not call it that significant.  Texas is constantly talking about succeeding yet they still have not done it.    This statistic would be much more significant if all these people were in a just a few states.  This would mean that those states would have more than half of the population supporting succession.   They got back together again in may after having been married and divorced twice.   I just read the Wikipedia it looks like every time they divorce she gets a few million dollars, and then they get back together again lol.  Not a bad deal.    I can't believe they are back together again after getting married and then divorced twice.   Can you repost this to /r/New_Horizons?  This is really cool.   Wow can you repost this to /r/New_Horizons?  This is really cool   Wow that is crazy.  I personally believe that Commercialism can only last so long in a world like this, eventually, a new structure will have to come about.  People will not put up with it otherwise.   I somehow did a hard reset on my nook a few weeks ago, It was not a big deal as with most of my books I have the .epub's on my computer. But when i turned it on it would not work unless I typed in my B N login.  How do I keep this from happening in the future?  Is there open source software for the Nook that I could install?  I don't want to get trapped in this situation again. This time i was able to recover my password from B N.com, but in the future i have a feeling B N might not be there.

That might work, if the GOP was more against what he was saying,  but so far the base is loving him, and the candidates are not calling him out at all.  In fact Ted Cruz even voiced support for his comment about Mexican rapists.  So far it looks like this is going more the way of Tod Akin and the "Women have a way to shut that down".  People are seeing Trump as emblematic of Republicans, not the crazy outlier.   Except they were on the airplane by that point.   What a difference 4 days makes.  So glad we are getting more pictures.

So many awesome explosions.   yea but you could say the same thing about forced landing on land.  I doubt the motor would survive that either.   No they run a very efficient propaganda campaign online where they basically convince young people that they can come make a difference in the world by joining ISIS. That they can make the world a better place where the ideals of islam are followed crap like that.  They sell themselves as the the oppressed that are defending the true ideals of Islam.    This is why you hear about so many of these kids that go to Syria and join ISIS and then a couple months later they want to come home.  Basically they were brainwashed by ISIS into thinking that ISIS was a good cause, and when they get there they start to see that the stuff they are doing is pretty horrible.  PS: Sorry if you were being sarcastic.   I would argue it is more important to cut off their supply of new recruits.  There needs to be a information war to counter the propaganda ISIS puts out convincing young people to come join.      Is there any legitimate reason for this?   Is there any legitimate reason to restrict flight over water?   That would be spectacular      What is the reference?   New pictures are starting to come in, but so far they are still all from July 3rd.  I'll post the new ones as soon as I see them.

I think that article perfectly illustrates how outside the Fox bubble Trump looks like a nut with no possible way to win a general election, But inside the Fox News bubble he seems like a Bernie Sanders for Republicans the next Reagan.    I also found it funny how the author compared trump to White supremacist governors and such saying how much more effective he is than they were.  Why would you want to make that comparison for a candidate you support?   Yea many people expect women to have to go sit on a toilet while they feeding their baby.  And if you are in a park or something and there isn't one, too bad I guess the baby needs to go hungry because seeing a boob is too traumatic.   All the people that think that women should not be able to breastfeed in public.  Women get heckled for simply feeding there baby in a public location.   I sure hope so.   Yea but you have to look at why people are breaking the law.  By coming to the US they can make 10 times as much doing the exact same job.    You also have to question why we are so resistant to immigration from Latin America.  We seem to have no problem with people coming from Europe, but when they come from Mexico suddenly they are a danger to our country and leaching off our taxes and welfare.    In reality immigrants like those from Latin America pay an enormous amount of taxes even if they are illegal, because they spend almost 100% of what they earn.   When looking at this issue you should consider that Illegal immigrants would not be coming to the US if there were not job opportunities here.  The companies are breaking the law by hiring illegal immigrants.  If people wanted to truly stop illiegal immigration they would target these companies not the people that are just taking advantage of the opportunities available to them.      That would be great.  Or puts some wheels on it and fly it places just to see peoples faces.   That is what the OP was talking about she cut up her foot pretty bad during the walk in kings landing it is probably going to get infected.   I don't understand   Did they find the Go Pro?

This is almost a swicharoo. but not quite.   This could maybe go und TIFU   They should have used Hydrogen that would have fixed everything.      And how likely is it that most people have "chemicals used in the manufacture of illegal drugs" in their houses?   Can anyone figure out which year you need to go to for all the planets to cross the line at the same time like they did when they started?  Edit: I did some math and got 59289804 mercury years, am i even close?   I lol'd so much   Thats great looking forward to Pluto   Yea leaving aside the fact that Magneto seems to be able to control larger objects at greater distances, Toph also needs to do motions to make her bending work Magneto can use his Kenisis without motions.   IDK Why but i hated that episode.  I have since rewatched it and it was not as bad but it still just felt embarrassing.   Out of the 8 planes i have been checked out on, only one had an autopilot.  It was a heading hold autopilot.  It did not work very well basically it would fight you to try and maintain the heading on the heading bug.  So if you were to accidentally bump the button, it would put you in a sudden turn and when you tried to correct you it would feel like somebody was in the other seat working against you.  My instructor showed me where it was just in case and suggested i not use it.    The point is there are not as many autopilot planes as you think, and even if you are i one and know how to use it.  That does not fix the spacial disorientation problem.  When you enter IMC and program in the turn, it is likely it will feel like the autopilot is doing the wrong thing the feeling is likely to be so compelling that you may switch off the autopilot thinking that it is broken.   Yea I wonder what his problem was.   I believe that is an optional add on.   This thread cracks me up the   Whats Reddit gold?  was the cherry on top.   How come none of this had to be done for Falcon 1?   Favorite Part  Settle down captain happy      Ground school can be good if thats the way you learn.  I would suggest waiting on ground school though, you don't need ground school to start flight lessons.  I would suggest buying a textbook and reading it.  It will teach you a lot of the stuff that you need to know about flying.  After that decide if you still feel like you need ground school.   For a good textbook I would suggest the "[Jeppesen Private Pilot Manual](http://www.mypilotstore.com/MyPilotStore/sep/1941?gclid=CjwKEAjwq-OsBRDd95aryprR9wQSJACQnU3G0_g1hIS09r0XCLhoNmeKJErvy2EXaHVnNM0Qcpui-RoCzfbw_wcB)".  That is the one I used and I really liked it. There were lots of diagrams and pictures, and it was easy to understand.  As for the Wings of Carolina Flying Club, I have not found rates any better anywhere else I have looked.  I probably would have joined by now, but I don't fly enough for the $65 monthly membership rate to be cost effective.  But it is totally worth it to take lessons there.  Their instructor rates are half of anywhere else I have seen, and because you tend to fly more while taking lessons it would come out cheaper.

I did flyover Fayetteville and Fort Bragg one time but i am not very familiar with flying opportunities down there.  The closest club I know about is [Wings of Carolina Flying Club](http://wingsofcarolina.org/) They have [really good rates](http://wingsofcarolina.org/aircraft) on their airplanes and their instructors, but that is pretty far north for you.  You need to do the math and see if it is worth it to make the trip.  Just form some simple googling I was able to find a couple flight schools in Fayetteville.   * http://www.dillonsaviation.com/ * http://aaavn.com/pricing/  Those are just a couple, there are a ton more.    Just google, and also look for local airports around you almost every airport including the tiny ones have a flying school.  A lot of times it is good just to go to the airport FBO and ask about flying schools.  Shop around if you feel like you are getting a bad deal, go to a different place, it is also important that you feel comfortable with your instructor.   Also as for flying as a hobby, that is fine, but it is a very expensive hobby.  You just need to make sure you can keep up with the costs.  If you want to go flying once a month for 2 hours you could easily be spending $200 or more.     Expect to spend 8000 or more on training to get your Private.  If you can afford it, training faster(2,3 or more lessons a week) is cheaper in the long run because you waste less time reviewing.  Once you have your Private things get a little cheaper as well, because you don't need to pay for an instructor and so on.  I hope this all helped.  My best suggestion is to shop around take lots of notes on prices and figure out what is best for you.    Cool   You should go to a flight school and talk to a flight instructor.  A lot of these questions are super simple to answer.  As for your questions   1.  You are charged for when the engine is running not how much time the plane is in your possession.  So if you fly for 2 hours spend the night and fly 2 hours back you will pay for a total of 4 hours.  Depending on where you rent from, it is common to have minimum daily hours if you are going to have the plane for more than a day.  So the minimum daily hours might be 4 hours meaning for every day you have the plane you get charged for 4 hours whether you flew 4 hours or not.    2. This is basic stuff you learn in your first few lessons.  basically when flying into most uncontrolled airports there is nothing you need to do ahead of time.  Most airports are uncontrolled meaning there is no control tower telling you which way to go.  you report over the radio where you are in relation to the airport and talk to other planes in the pattern in order to maintain safe spacing and so on.  3. A typical renting situation is renting an airplane for a wet hourly rate meaning fuel is included.  For a 4 seater Cessna 172. this can range for anything from $110 an hour to $165 an hour.  This is why it is important to shop around and find the best prices.  This will be your main cost.  If you plan to spend the night at a different airport then it is typical to pay small tie down fee(Most people don't put their plane in a hangar for an overnight stay), all though it is common for this to be waived if you buy fuel (which is paid for by your hourly rate anyway).  The only place you really see landing fees are at big airports like Charlotte or Raleigh most private pilots don't usually go into these airports though unless they are based there.  I also fly in NC if you want, you can PM me or comment a more specific location and I might be able to suggest some flight schools.         No still working my way back.   Cool I didn't think to do this i have been bookmarking mine and coming back to it.   ???   you got me?  Looks like it might just be one guy who down voted it.   Si porque no?      cool   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkcLzhvBy4k   they are mostly protesting the clack of communication that the Admins are giving them.  The mods of the big subreddits are basically donating their time and they have been feeling especially lately that the admins have been treating them like crap.   Wait Echo you run SpaceXStats?   I don't understand, what is the big deal about this?   Yea maybe, unless the content gets significantly worse though, I am kind of invested in reddit and would like to try and stick it out.  Pao wont be around forever.  It is quite possible the new CEO will be better at communicating.   where did you get that quote from?  and what kind of comercial stuff?   Everyone calm down there is no way that reddit is on par with digg.   Possibly, but it would take time and as many have pointed out, without a viable alternative atm most people will just stick around in the short term.   I don't think this is the end Reddit has drama thats what the Users like.  The mods are putting their foot down about this, and my guess is it will be resolved, either the way everyone hopes, by bringing Victoria back, or the Reddit mods de-modding the mods of the defaults and forcefully making them public again.      Wow I just went and looked at that it looks like a complete knockoff of Reddit.  everything looks almost exactly the same but is slightly different.   Another interesting article published today from SpaceNews  http://spacenews.com/nasa-and-spacex-delay-dragon-in-flight-abort-test/   Wow what is going on      Thanks for that interesting to know.   Can you post this over at /r/New_horizons?  It is really cool   The funny thing is Latinos tend to be very socially conservative, but the Republicans just keep shooting themselves in the foot with things like self deportation, and now Donald Trump.     Notice that more than one Republican frontrunner is there to court Latinos.  Jeb Bush's wife is Mexican, and he speaks Spanish fluently.  Marco Rubio is latino and also speaks Spanish.   Notice that the republicans have also been trying to mov away from their previous stance on immigration.  They are trying to court the Latino voting block without loosing their base.  I feel like that is why they like Jeb so much.  With him they can have it both ways.  He is a standard white conservative that the Republican base will vote for, but he also is very appealing to the Latino population because he is so in tune with them and their culture.   I think worrying is good, it keeps you from getting overconfident.   Exactly, that is why it is so ridiculous.   I think people usually get mad when it is just ridiculous.  like this story http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3026549/Indicted-cop-recall-shooting-suspects-hood-car.html   Link to information page  http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/Pluto-Encounter/view_obs.php?image=data/pluto/level2/lor/jpeg/029803/lor_0298030209_0x630_sci_1.jpg utc_time=2015-07-01%3Cbr%3E04:18:10%20UTC description=OpNav+Campaign+4%2C+LORRI+1X1 target=HYDRA range=15.9M%20km exposure=150%20msec         There are multiple reasons why this wouldn't work, that have been addressed in other threads.  1. The first is the legs, they are not strong enough to support the whole rocket.  Just having an empty second stage, and Dragon on top would add a significant amount of weight to the craft.    2. You would not be able to get fuel out of stage 2 further exacerbating problem 1 as well as problem 3 and 4.  3. Now we get into control problems.  When flying through the atmosphere on a rocket, you want the heavy end going first, followed by the light end for stability purposes (this is not that un-similar from a dart or arrow.).  When the rocket launches the top is the heavy end.  When the first stage is flying in for landing the bottom where the engines are is the heavy end.  By keeping the top on the rocket you mess all this up, now the top is heavy, but you are flying engines first.  This setup is unstable, and most likely will lead to the aerodynamic forces flipping the rocket around.   4.  Similar to the first problem the grid-fins, which are normally located all the way at the top of the first stage would now be a third of the way down the rocket rendering them ineffective.  What makes the grid-fins so effective, is the long arm to the center of gravity(basically they are about as far away from the center of gravity as possible, like the tail on an arrow.).  Having the top on the rocket puts the grid-fins very close to the Center of mass rendering them useless.  This would make targeting anything as small as a landing platform impossible.   In perfect conditions, and with some retrofitting, like strengthening the legs, moving the grid-fins to the dragon trunk and adding a way to vent/transfer fuel to stage 1 from stage 2, you might be able to do it.  but now what you have done is designed a new rocket that is capable of this RTLS abort.  This seems like it may be reasonable until you think about how many circumstances this may actually be used. There are virtually none, because if Falcon is functioning well enough to do this maneuver, it is probably capable of getting to orbit.  This maneuver is much harder than just getting to orbit.    So if things were going south and you want to cut your losses, aborting the Dragon capsule, bringing the 1st stage in for landing, and just accepting the loss of the second stage, seems much more reasonable and has a much better chance of working than attempting a full stack landing.   It does look similar, in Interstellar he even had [orange lines and stuff](http://aroundmovies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Interstellar_2014_0511.jpg) on his suit.   You should totally watch Gravity and Interstellar, and read "The Martian"  They are great.   It is completely unrelated.  The movie is an adaptation of the book ["The Martian"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_\(Weir_novel\)) by Andy Weir.  You should read the book it is awesome.    Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian are completely different stories in different universes.  Hollywood is on a bit of a space theme lately though which I love.   Yea most people don't feel like doing anything when they are down much less writing a log about nothing.   Really?  I was completely oblivious until he attacked Matthew Mcconaughey, I don't know why I did not see it coming.  My belief was totally suspended.   I refused to watch the trailer for interstellar before seeing the movie because I did not want to ruin it.  I am approaching a lot of movies that way these days.  But a lot of times it is a real test of will.   That actually was likely the beginnings of the heart attack.  When women get heart attacks it is common for them to get upper back and shoulder pain, not just the typical "chest pain".   Did anyone else notice the little guy on her hip?   I think people are excited about SpaceX and because of that they are reluctant to be critical.  I am really happy so much is favorable as well.   You might want to try lemon RX if you need a cheap receiver i have been using them, and haven't had any troubles yet.   Basically anything where the rocket is still flying but has left its planned course.  Great examples of times when self destruct would probably be employed is the   * [Proton mishap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjNNX2sLIro) * [Early launches of China's Long March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBJ9ue6GKek) - This one actually killed hundreds of people in a nearby town.   In both of these self destruct was not employed, and you can see how much damage and how dangerous the rocket is capable of.    Are they harnessed in?   http://i.imgur.com/BZmpcJn.gif   Where's the top?   I have begun to post new pictures when they come out, because being so close to the encounter means detail is now starting to become apparent.  In a few more days there should be a noticeable difference between the todays picture and the day before.    Even if you compare this picture to the one just a couple days ago you will notice that pluto has gotten noticeably bigger in size.   thats good, but if it is going to be practical for flight training (landings and takeoffs and maneuvers practice) it really needs to be 2 or more hours.   MEXICO still the best.  Edit: I hold true to my values even when it brings negative Karma.  Bring on the down votes I will never forsake Mexico.   Yes like if it survives the fireball and explosions then it could in theory just deploy its parachutes when it gets to the correct altitude.    What kind of rumors?  Why would they cancel?   Why did they zoom out so suddenly instead of following the debris?  Especially in the NASA live feed.    https://youtu.be/2K030HRTutU?t=2m28s   http://imgur.com/gallery/587RWsq   No problem   Link to information page  http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/Pluto-Encounter/view_obs.php?image=data/pluto/level2/lor/jpeg/029786/lor_0297860108_0x630_sci_1.jpg utc_time=2015-06-29%3Cbr%3E05:03:10%20UTC description=OpNav+Campaign+4%2C+LORRI+1X1 target=HYDRA range=18.2M%20km exposure=150%20msec      It has been confirmed that the range safety officer did hit the FTS but not till 70 seconds after breakup.  http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3bjq76/telemetry_continued_to_be_sent_back_from_dragon/   It has been confirmed that the range safety officer did hit the FTS but not till 70 seconds after breakup.  http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3bjq76/telemetry_continued_to_be_sent_back_from_dragon/   Whats the battery life like?   If you watch the video It seems like the sentiment is it is amazing that SpaceX has had such a good run.  They don't seem to blaming SpaceX for this failure they seems to be saying that SpaceX has been doing an excellent job, and this was bound to happen eventually.     	138

 I rarely drop a book but I recently did that with Roth's American Pastoral. I've read his stuff before but Pastoral was just too.... much.   There's a lot of books I feel that way about too. I think this is especially true of most classics.  Yeah, don't worry about being a little off my question. I'm not one of those hardcore redditors who scream when someone strays from the question or topic's content.   To say nothing of the fact that Oklahoma wasn't in the Confederacy. So they can't claim the lame "heritage" stance.   Just finished reading The Goldfinch. I couldn't stand it when it started out (this line sent me over the edge, "someone could have mistaken her for being Icelandic").  However as I got into it, it turned out to be a really good book.  What was your favorite turnaround?     	5
 I just started working for a multi-billion dollar company in beauty and cosmetics. The company is 85% women, I am 100% man.  Today, in a monthly update the VP meeting, I joked, "it's strange to me that a multi-billion dollar beauty and cosmetics company provides employees with single-ply toilet paper."  I think it's fair to say my days are numbered.        Oh yeah! Lot's of Hollywood contracts have that. When TV is on the moon, yo.   I'm American and was working in Germany recently. I had a contract that said I couldn't be a Scientologist.                  The original starred Rowdy Roddy Piper.

 John Rocker works as a gym teacher in his hometown high school   Tammy Faye Baker   Vibrating the glass was brilliant.   Raiders of the Lost Ark   I Love You Man.  I think they marketed all wrong, they made it seem like a gross out buddy comedy.   Men at Work.  Every line said by Keith David was pure gold.  "Aww, lookie here. Looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy!"  	6
 I like the rectangular glasses, but not the "nerdy" ones, I like the tattoo on your arm!...and btw, where is the right side of your face?   You're very pretty...try sticking to the eye brows in the last picture!   Close enough   My anatomy teacher told our class that a marathon runner has miles and miles more blood vessels in their lungs than an average person does.  I'm sure lots of other things happen too, but other than that, I don't know.   "Are you a boy or a girl?"  I'm actually a girl...but I told them I was a boy to try and add some humor to a bad situation.  	5

If I were one to take things I'd either have a fully stocked ebay account, a very successful antique store, a cool as hell basement or a nice bank account balance.  But it's not my thing to take things from these places - as tempting as it can be at times!!!!  I have been to a place months or years after a first visit to find a great deal of the items gone.  So the treasure hunters are out there, and as long as I can help it, they won't be getting any addresses from this guy!!!      lol   lol me too!!!    I will when I am able to get back   I'm gonna try and get back this weekend - I am a jackass and didn't shoot the actual cards!!!!

Wow - Thanks everyone for all the great comments and feedback!  I will see about getting my shots up of the cards, minus any personal information that they contain.  Thanks again.

 That's why the SEC won't travel to altitude or north    Well maybe you should stop running into workers    Especially Friday nights on ESPN on the road....   Nichols St. Some how Colorado could blow it    United Cannabis Corp    I actually saw something on TLC or discovery about a girl who had it done to make the height requirement for here dream job, a flight attendant. The minimum is 4'11". The max is 6'3" so I guess that's one career choice I cam cross off    No, realistically most voters don't know enough about candidates    ;)   Take it from a CU fan, the past doesn't matter   I didn't say trend. Yous said sec is the best, but they weren't best last season. So there were the best, but last season pac was    I'm thinking about coming out to salt lake, how's the skiing that time of year?    Well the SEC didn't have a team in the championship game, pac did.  The Pac-12 also cleaned up on the college football postseason awards, winning 12 of the 20 major individual awards, compared to just two for the SEC.       But basketball ended [with a bang] (http://cdn2.sbnation.com/assets/3688285/colorado.gif)   If you get bored.

One school required I take a plane with maybe a dozen rows and a 6ft ceiling. It wasn't a deciding factor, but it was on the cons list    Reddit is not your friend on this. Head to /r/conservative /r/politicaldiscussion and /r/neutralpolitics if you want any peace    Pay off that school debt somehow    I know this is not directly college football but with the recent ruling and discussion about ncaa football games coming back I thought this was interesting. Is it a loophole that ea sports could use or 2k could  make a game? I could see this effecting ncaa series       I really should have seen this coming    I used to fly Frontier a dozen times a year and ask the gate attendant if I could be upgraded to stretch seating. It worked about half the time. Depends who you get. I sometimes took a gamble and boarded last and just took a stretch seat and they never cared to say anything       No its not, the sub can also say "Fuck Walker"   Well that explains Obama          Walker literally just said Trump needs to apologize for the comments made about McCain  "He needs to apologize to Senator McCain and all the other men and women who have worn the uniform,"   Actually eating home cooked meals is cheaper than eating out. Being healthy is a matter of discipline. You could eat like shit but not become obese if you exercise    I don't know what my percentage is right now but I did gain a good amount of fat.  Don't have a gut or anything but I would like to get more definition    Does anyone know if the rooftop will be open to the public other than game times? I have bought game tickets yet so didn't buy a terrace ticket and they sold out. I'd really like to check it out and I know the have the tour at the end of the month you pay $40 for.  Ideally they have it function as a bar/grill on weekends but I haven't seen anything about it    99 rose bowl, Wisconsin beat UCLA. I have never seen Colorado play in a bowl since I didn't become a fan until I became interested in attending back in 2010   Are you serious? There's no medical issue that causes obesity. You won't gain more than 10lbs from an underactive thyroid. Mental illness can cause over eating but thats about it. 90% of Diabetes cases are caused by poor diet    Were really good at making them   Veal and corn    The difference is FSU had a star player just get drafted after years of not being able to keep him disciplined. I'm suspended? Fuck it I'll just go on the sideline in my gear and no one will notice, right? He's gone and other players are filling the void of drama from stupid decisions       Great feeling when you get those plates. Feels even better when you add two plates    I'm guessing by the buff walk on the east side of the stadium    190 was my original goal but now I'm thinking 200. I'll probably do my first cut at 190   MSU    They just want people to see the work being put into our roads! /s   Stressor for teachers is the shitty kids and shitty parents that come along    This I can agree with   Um teachers only teach until college. College professors have at least a masters, mostly PhD, not some education degree they got over 5 drunken years of undergrad. Once in med school, it's doctors teaching doctors. Plus shitty teachers get to keep their jobs if they've been around long enough thanks to tenure    We know why we pay more? We're sicker. We're [sicker because of obesity] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/04/30/obesity-now-costs-americans-more-in-healthcare-costs-than-smoking/)   *taxes not included  Plus you don't have to deal with the 99% preventable obesity and illnesses with higher rates due to obesity- cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, stoke, etc   Where's the reverse gif?    Did you not read the first line?   Stupid. Why? Doctors go to school 2-3 times as long and have 2-4 times the debt when they establish a career.  Edit- plus doctors work 1/4 more    Act above a 30? You're in   The new lanes wouldn't make a difference in the accident you were in, glad you're OK though.    Gluck Gluck Gluck    You might be thinking of ARWU    I've been weighing myself before bed and if the weight is higher each day (yes I know food/water weight) then I'm on the right track    Well that's the point of insurance    You forget taxes    It'll extend north I believe. The bike lane is maybe a foot wider than it used to be and they added a 3 foot buffer zone.    Or having a heart attack from eating like shit and not exercising    Yeah I was keeping it simple. You could go as far as the manufacturer of surgical equipment and anesthesia    Because the hospital knows they get paid way less than they bill, that's why they bill so much   Hospitals bill that much because insurance pays 10% of what they bill. If insurance paid what was billed, the hospital would bill 10% of what they currently do. It's the insurance companies that screw everything up, not the hospitals   You can sue if they fire you for that    "Free".   Through my employer yes. If I don't need healthcare I don't pay a down payment    $1000 for having your skull opened, then someone with 10-16 years of education and training poking your brain isn't bad  Edit- grammar    You can walk out of the ER without paying or giving them person info. If it's an emergency, they have to treat you.    Kind of. A lot of money that goes towards research and expansion would be lost. Taxes would increase so much even if I didn't need healthcare, I would be paying for it.    Guessing anti venom isn't cheap    There was no construction going on. The road was clear, lines painted, no construction staff around. The divider needs to be put up still but everything else was done    I wish I had gold to give you. The reddit circle jerk is ridiculous when it comes to US healthcare. The way to fix the system is to end the games. My ambulance service only gets payment from 30% of people transported, and most of that 30% doesn't pay the full cost    No that's the bill. What you pay is completely different    Don't worry about the fat unless you become skinny fat. You can cut later    The painting is nearly done and Folsom is now one lane for the new bike lane expansion. Discuss your thoughts and experiences. When I was on the road it was backed up from Canyon to the pearl pedestrian crossing. During 2-3 stop light cycles I saw one bike go by. I'm sure some of the congestion is due to people learning the new layout but it's a poor start.    My starting bench was high since I lifted in high school for football and lifted on and off the last few years.    If republican don't teach correct scientific fact, they can be fired or not hired. That argument doesn't hold much ground. Balancing is more important in areas like sociology, political science, and psychology. Only seeing the liberal side (or only seeing the republican side) doesn't encourage students to view things from both sides which is important in education.    First progress post. I lifted all of high school, on and off in college before getting religious about gaining in March   [starting at 155] (http://imgur.com/Q1qxla9) and [Current at 180] (http://imgur.com/rUE6NZo) 6'4'' male, 22yo.   Diet- eating anything I can, I haven't been counting calories. I stopped using protein shakes as I noticed I wouldn't eat much for a few hours after and started drinking 3 glasses of chocolate milk a day. For meat I have been doing chicken and pork, both are fairly cheap and I work them into various dishes. I'm aware I've probably gained a good amount of fat but I'm not worried about that yet since I was so underweight and don't have a gut yet.   Lifting- squat and bench on 3x5, 3x3, 5-3-1 with warm up sets at bar and one plate each side. Curls, pull downs, single leg deadlift, calf raises, tricep extension, shrugs, lunges, all at 3x10.  main lifting improvements  bench- 180 max to 240 max  squat- 200 max to 250 max                  It won't be Obama level security.    Like it or not, money is one of the most important things in life.   So is every weekend when people come visit or drive through to estes....   Just like every politician    There's reason behind this. There were issues with administration and faculty being too liberal, and they wanted to balance it out since teachers have a big impact on students views. [Only 6% of teachers were Republican in a survey] (http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26042796/cu-survey-9-faculty-members-identify-republicans).     I thought you said throw spit, since that's something UGA fans do    2-1 against ranked,  Nebraska went 3-0-1, how do you figure Texas did better?    Because they're THE Ohio State University    I'm amazed that tech fans are way more upset about it than CU fans about GT claiming, especially when it's our only championship    Versus a 10-0-1 team or a 10-0 team?    Texas went 2-1 against ranked, Nebraska went 3-0-1   Says a lot coming from an Oregon fan    Michigan. Harbaugh can't save you!    Nebraska. Undefeated unlike the others. Why is 9-1 Ohio state even claiming it?    Georgia Tech. Bring both 1990 trophies to the game, winner gets both until the next meeting    The one that lot everything and has been trying to get back on their feet    I wasn't talking about just intelligence, I was talking about the lengthy planning    It's not smart, it was the time line. More said he was sane    He's not mentally ill. I followed the trial closely and he put way too much genius planning into the shooting. He had a cd player that played an hour of silence followed by loud music rigged to blow up when someone turned it off. The amount of detail and long term planning is enough to show it wasn't some insane act    [Here's all the info you would ever want about the trial, the shooting, and events leading up to] (http://www.denverpost.com/theater-shooting-trial)   [heres a tracker of counts] (http://www.denverpost.com/theater-shooting-trial/ci_28485365/verdict-aurora-theater-shooting)   I've been following the case since trial started. His act was very well planned and there is no way they will find him insane.             His planning was too well done for insane    My weights (body and lifting) haven't increased in a few weeks, how do I get over the plateau? Obvious answer eat more and lift more?    "Win a pac game"          I CAN'T HEAR YOU    YOU WILL REMEMBER THEM! IN MIZZOURY    SEE WHAT HAPPENS CSU??? DON'T LISTEN TO BIG BROTHER AND YOU GETTING REPLACED BY OUR ADOPTED LITTLE BROTHER!!!!   Your welcome to see this yourself in the pac opener at Folsom. Although the Oregon section is probably closed to sold out    Restaurant will have 50. That's still 60ish people with jobs that could really use it in the area.          I know the overwhelming majority of CU and Boulder is liberal but I encourage people to go as long as they do so without interrupting. It's great CU was picked as a site with increasing political visit including Obama twice. This wasn't something that occurred in Boulder for a long time until his first visit.

I read somewhere that the first full trailer for ep VII would be playing in front of Age of Ultron, so I'm wondering why I haven't seen any hullabaloo online. Was I mistaken?      under the word 'gettin' it says "chai" (pronounced like you're  hocking up phlegm). chai translates as 'life' in Hebrew   where can i buy the blue shirt?

 Thank you! :D   I like Squishy!   Heheheh...   Almonds. I eat almonds everyday.      The first person that walked into my room, was not my husband.   If you block it properly after you finish, then you can get rid of that 'scrunchieness'. It looks great! I love making headbands with horseshoe.   Now, fill it up with a glorious yarn stash! Horde ALL THE FIBERS!!!   You shouldn't beat yourself up for that. True, she is your friend, but it sounds like she needed more help that you could've possibly given. It may have saved her life, almost dying. Many people attempt suicide realize how much they have to live for. You are a good friend, and I hope you guys are still friends, and that she got better.    His face looks like an owl.   I used to spew fatlogic a few years ago. I reasoned that I only eat three times a day, normally skipping breakfast and eating only one snack for the day. Oh and liquids can't have that many calories because I just have to pee it all out in a few minutes, right? Especially alcohol! It wasn't until I downloaded the My Fitness Pal app that I realized just how many calories I had been consuming. Now I eat what my body needs and run almost everyday. Good bye JennIsFat, and hello train_subject2843! [fat to fit!](http://imgur.com/GJc7d2s)   Plus side is that the pain means the tissue is not completely dead, and his foot can be saved!      Aw! I remember when you posted his puppy pictures! He's gotten so big! I love his markings.   Something that frightened you, or disturbed you? Something you can't explain, or was traumatizing?   Knitting. It's so much easier than it looks.   First off, good for you! I think that doing something for yourself that makes you feel good, or less uncomfortable is something to be positive about. I've personally had an issue with a certain body part, and your post has help assure me that if I want to get it fixed (for comfort reasons) I shouldn't feel ashamed by it. You are amazing. I'm so proud of you. :)   First off, f/26/125lbs/5'6.5". Looking to change my macros from a ketogenic scale to something new. I've lost all the weight I wanted to and I'm ready to become more lean and eat more carbs. I will continue to eat clean but I need help with the division of my macronutrients. I run daily (3-5 miles)and I'm starting a lifting routine with bag work. Any suggestions?   Thank you! :D I'm already in love with them and I'm on my second project already!   I've always loved your cosplays. Your boyfriend's are really cool too! I really want to get into cosplaying now.  	20
 Man, if this wasn't a under the table PR move by the Admins, I don't know what is. Listen to the rhetoric. Now she's the martyred savior and Pao has apologized, so she tells us to feel good about having our voices heard. They had all weekend think up this idea. Convincing the person you axed to make one more positive platitudinous statement that doesn't sully you name seems like the obvious way to go to appease the masses.   The difference is between the Admins and the users? The Admins know how PR and the media cycle works. The users fucked it up when they tried make noise over a holiday weekend.           	4

 Yea but in terms of "the holy bible" (the book that used to say it's okay to sell your daughter for sex, and to own slaves, and that you cannot be homosexual) also says you're not allowed to eat shrimp, but we've all kind of forgot about all them bits... why? Why are we adapting the bible when it is said to be the divine perfect book of good and bad? Surely it shouldn't need changing? I'm not saying it's a bad thing that we're adapting something that's out of date and is no use to the advancement of humanity in the slightest, but why is it being changed when been written by man through the voice of god?   Well um sorry to break it to you, but the UK is nationally a christian country. (I'm not saying the UK should be only christians. It's open to everyone. The UK is technically speaking, nationally a christian country. Hence all our churches.)   It seems to me that the bible is constantly changing once proven wrong :\   Kind of contradictory is it not?   I'd be very worried if they did.  Getting back to their instructor like: "Yeah... Drove into an oncoming tank."   Changing it by force will not change the quality, the quality will remain the exact same.  The image has it's own set of pixels, this is called the resolution. Making the image bigger will only simply make the pixels bigger, thus, not giving it any additional quality. A bigger image will require more pixels(Resolution) if you want to capture the detail.  The only way to get the image quality to stay the same while at a bigger size, is to make the image that size in the first place (with a high resolution)  Or if you're a tech savvy like me, can go into photoshop and just add more space to the work area, keeping the image the same, just adding more black space around it, and possibly using the clone tool to make it look part of the image for things that get cut off.  [In fact, I've done it for you. 1920x1080 just like you wanted.](https://i.imgur.com/bpjFxaz.png)  Edit: You fixed it while I was doing this. XD I'd still recommend using mine though, as it won't stretch the image due to the original being 1918x1080, and 'mine' being 1920x1080  Edit edit: I'm an idiot. Used the lower quality image and sized it 1920 for you. Send me the original image?   Great job!   I had Windows 8 once...  I upgraded to Windows 7.  Personally recommend sticking with 7. Using your Windows 8 key to upgrade your other system won't work, as they're one time use only. Nothing a pirate can't fix though. :)  	8
 FUCK BRITT   Bought a pair of [these boots](http://www.jcpenney.com/shoes/extended-sizes/large-sizes-13-over/stafford-deacon-mens-wingtip-leather-boots/prod.jump?ppId=pp5004560043 catId=cat100250175 topDim=Brand topDimvalue=stafford dimCombo=Brand%7C dimComboVal=stafford%7C currentDim=Brand currentDimVal=stafford _dyncharset=UTF-8 colorizedImg=DP0902201417014697M.tif urlState=/shoes/shop-men-s-shoes/dress-shoes/stafford/_/N-1nopj3Z7i/cat.jump) a few months ago after seeing them on this subreddit. My question is could I pair them with a grey suit? Or are they too casual?    Like seriously Jade is the only one who realistically would move to Iowa. Whitney would never leave her job, Kaitlyn seems like she isn't ready to get married and have children, and lets be real Becca is so flat and one-dimensional, if she doesn't go home next episode I'm breaking my tv.  	3

 Man, I want to use these space stations but I can't handle 850 parts. Normally I'd weld these to something like three parts, however there are too many modules on this.    Was taking a look at that picture again, I'm pretty sure you're right. There is a small chance it could be Daario Naharis though.   [Interesting shot](http://i.imgur.com/D5BL3sf.jpg) shows Jorah in the fighting pit/arena [where Dany is later on.](http://i.imgur.com/bnmuiox.jpg) Take note of the Targaryen flag in the background in both photos.  	3
    Just looking around my house I've found some lemon scented cleaning wipes and orange scented dish soap.   [Here's another video showing that technique] (  https://youtu.be/vBsHF4F08t8)   I am a very good to hear from you soon as I have a great time to time and money to pay for the first time in the morning.    Woah, I never realized that all the locations in the trailer are actually in the game!   Wow, that's odd   This was just a test, thanks      I'll add a few lesser known songs, just for fun:   *Morse Moose And The Grey Goose*  *San Ferry Anne*  *Mama's Little Girl*  *I'm Carrying*  *Warm And Beautiful* (Also try the instrumental demo version)   This guy's got it figured out      Ah cool cool, my mistake   http://i.imgur.com/A47Z7EJ.jpg   I work I'm a supermarket that's located in a tourist town. The amount of "damaged" items that pile up everyday is simply astonishing to me. If a box of cereal has a small tear in it - the box, not the sealed bag inside - into the damage pile it goes.  The company I work for does give some edible food to the local food banks and donate non-edible food to pig farms, but I feel like there's more that could be done. Does anyone know of a way I can lobby to have them do more?   My cousin once traveled from New England to Los Angeles with a canister of mace in her bag.   I guess the TSA wasn't *pepper-ed* for that situation.   Gosh dangit   [This should shed some light on that. It's called a bottle episode.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/52106/10-best-bottle-episodes-your-favorite-tv-shows)   I'm pretty sure it's about Harry Houdini's son.   The one scene I remember is where the kid picks the lock of a mailbox and crawls inside to hide from a guy chasing him with a knife. The knife guy finds the kid in the mailbox but can't get him to come out so he drops the knife in the mail slot.  Thanks for any help!   I like you too pal   Discrepancy detected   Both of my hands say 10   At least it's not something about relationships.  	22

 Leopold "Butters" Stotch is the best person to explain Game of Thrones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2DNYa-lbQ   I think this should serve as a warning to anyone entertaining the idea of having "just one" cause there's no such thing, you are reawakening your addiction.   #QuitNow! Since Aug 8, 2013:  617 days smoke free, 24705 down, $6,176.25 and 102d, 22:35 saved!   Ha ha! Yeah come to think of it was usually the same people always doing the interpretations at that church too.   Back when I was a Christian, I attended a Pentecostal Church, and even then I was suspicious of speaking in tongues.  But at that church the pastor had said there should always be a translation of the person speaking in tongues.  So there was designated time during each service where people were suppose to be "led by the Holy Spirit" to speak in tongues.  Someone would stand up stand up and speak gibberish: Assata ma ta ta ta la bella.  Then another person would stand up and speak the "translation": "Go forth my people, leave Gilgal..."  It was always conveniently on topic with whatever the church was talking about at those particular weeks.   Wow, that's awesome!   I want your job.  	7

    Beautiful ridgeback! Ever since I got my lil dude (German shepherd/ridgeback mix) I see them all on here. He also is not a fan of getting a bath. She looks sweet!    Hopefully wind picks back up and blows this over so they can get to work    J Spieth   yes it gets old, i mean it completely as a joke. I also only think it makes sense since she insults the worker for not having all her teeth and in all honesty Britt does have a perrrty mouth, don't she?   I wonder how many dicks she sucked to get where she is...   if he is let go, he can finally go on and star in Garfield 3: like Kd   http://replygif.net/i/1049.gif    Mavs in 5. Parsons series MVP.   I did nazi that coming    Ayyy.   he or she looks incredibly awesome!               If we don't sign any free agent Rb, I think we should wait in the draft and pick Desmond Roland then get rid of Joseph Randle. Even though Randle is great on the field, can't risk all his off the field shenanigans.   Signing Hardy would be huge. hotty toddy.         it's just a retro bottle haha   	21
 We just went on lunch break. When we walked past each other in the hall she said, "geev me a hug Yianni mou." We are very cool with each other. We just bicker a lot. We were more laughing at my stupidity.    I'm not going to deny that I'm a jackass as well as my manager but I just showed the post and your comment to Seva and she cracked up and asked me what was up your ass. We're like family where I work. Don't be such a sandy vag.    So this lady I work with named Seva is hella Greek. She speaks English with a heavy accent and a lot of the time if I say a word with more than two syllables she will look at me like I'm crazy and say "Whass dees means?" Friday she was looking at her pay stub and kept asking me what does PTO mean. I thought she meant to say POT (paid overtime) but she kept insisting it said PTO. Even got a bit aggressive but we argue all the time so  used to her flying off the handle.  My manager, who is also Greek but has an American accent, walks in and asks what all the commotion is about. I looked at him and said, "Nothing. Seva is just dyslexic as fuck." I expected her to not know what it meant and just give me a crazy look but instead she just went ape shit. She started by yelling "I'm not dyslexic!" Then went off in Greek for about 30 seconds just throwing insult after insult. I couldn't understand most of it because she was talking so fast but I did hear her call me a jerk off, tell me to go to hell and go fuck myself, then finished off by calling me a stupid American.  Turns out dyslexia is a Greek word lol. And that pretty much how I found out that narcissist is a Greek word as well.  My manager and I got a kick out of it. It's always funny when she gets worked up and loses her shit.  TL;DR called a Greek dyslexic thinking she wouldn't understand. Turns out it's a Greek word.  Seva and I are very close and she was not offended by what I said. We go back and forth like that at least twice a day but it's all love.    Loose ends were all tied. It was more of a cop out it seems. He said there was no Emily. Ties it up but definitely blows when she was pretty much the whole effing story.    Where da white women at?!  	5

 Who is running the show here? Freaking horrible. Do over.    Turn off your brain whenever it tries to analyze or reflect. Practice throwing these thoughts out.   Don't try. Do.    Youll get more than enough in a few years.    Idealism, dislike for the world.    "Esteemed by the establishment"? Wooohooooooo!!!!!!               That Ginger Baker got #6 for Best Drummer disqualifies this whole thing.  And no mention of Clapton?  WTF.  Edit:  If you took a survey of the drummers on this list, *they* would vote Ginger first by a large margin.   Good point.      They're just trying to anoint him as the next reddit cult leader.   Law written by whom?  The TLC.   As opposed just supporting tyranny?   Ballmer should have had an open and cash-prize competition for the design. The uniforms would be the best in the league.       Gonna miss you Matt. You were the heart of the team. Good luck to you, man!!!!         That Sunday Times "reporter" looked like he was about in high school.   Makes you wonder what's going on at Google for such a POS to make it out the door.     As long as the escapees stay within the border of New York State, they'll never be found.         You mean the Sunday Times story?   Proving your point?  Try again.    It appears you have an aversion to anything factual.  He was on his way to South America via Moscow when the US revoked his passport.  The information is available to you on the internet if you care to look.   "Confirmation"?  Provide just one little piece of evidence for that.  [The author of the Sunday Times story, for one, would probably like to see it](http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/06/14/tom-harper-nsa-files-snowden-howell-intv-nr.cnn/video/playlists/intl-latest-world-videos/):  "All we know is that this is effectively the position of the British government....We just publish what we believe to be the position of the British government at the moment."   [Here is the background.](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/seymour_hersh_osama_bin_laden.php)            That's good info. Thanks.    ....and then after a few months, Kobe will complain, and he'll be gone.   We went into Iraq and Vietnam against the nation's interest, for only 2 examples. It would be reasonable to assume these aren't the only occurrences in history.   Further, there is a difference between the actual interest and the purported interest as stated by lying "leaders".     Is that long term best interest or short term?  Is that the best interest for the corrupt few in charge, or for the entire populace?   Exactly.  He's one of my favorite players.   That's interesting, because that is pretty much exactly my gut feeling about the Kaufmann issue.  I have found him to be excellent regarding Kierkegaard, and the other existentialists.  So why wouldn't the same hold true for his Nietzsche work?  The nay-sayers haven't provided any rationale or reason, which usually means there isn't a good one.   Nations always act in their best interest?  Wow.     Don't get your hopes up.      I don't understand the Le Carre thing either.  Tried his books, unreadable to me.  It's just a reddit echo-feedback phenomenon.   And/or are there any I should avoid?  Thanks.   Even better, put them in prison *and* make their jobs obsolete.   Yes, I like Kaufmann, but heard some slight negatives about his Nietzsche bio.  Don't know if these are substantial or just the internet echo-chamber.   Of Mice and Men.    You're thinking of Diego Garcia. Close though.    Uh oh. was thinking if getting into D, but this is not a good omen. Endless description is what kept me from finishing 'The Fountainhead' (2x) and 'Atlas Shrugged'.    Isn't true. Not nearly enough detail.    But you're actually winning from the start with Bitcoin. Like Charlie Sheen.    Maybe that's the pay they get when they are on "administrative leave" after they kill someone.   All public government, agencies, bureaucracy, services, unions, police, prisons, prosecutors....*everything* is so fucking corrupt and kleptocratic.  Throw them all in prison.     thank you!   I could use some good recommendations if anyone has them.  Don't want to just proceed blindly or by trial and error.  Thanks!   These are the two philosophers I would most like to know this about.  Would have been an endlessly intriguing exchange, with ramifications for all time.      Am I supposed to upvote this because it has "scientists" in the title?   I used to hang out with a lot of kids playing with toy guns.  Never killed a single one of them.   I could handle the antics if it weren't for all the horrible calls he makes.      We need a general manager.    Was it school, kindergarten, or daycare? Make up your mind.    Good video, but that guy is annoying as heck.    You may want to look into the Ni-Fi loop that the INTJ personality type can sometimes find themselves in.  In short, it is going back and forth between introverted intuition (Ni) and introverted feeling (Fi) without any extroverted thinking (Te).  The solution is thinking out loud with friends.   Pretty much all the existentialists were/are INTJs.   Also, learn about Taoism.    That's one if the few things I can do constantly.       Dont do it. Bad gut feeling.       Here we go again. Not all of us care what you have to say.    I don't like the choleric temperament (which ENTJs tend to be) because they generally have these traits:  Competitive, jealous, controlling, domineering, crude/brash, ends justify means, insecure, inconsiderate, unthoughtful, impersonal, no taste.  EDIT:  Oh yeah, they lose their temper.  As much as they like to control others, you'd think they could control themselves....    ENTJs are the envious type.  INTJs don't envy in the least.   That actually seems plausible.  And it would explain why he doesn't want to talk about it yet.  And I hope it's true because of what Draymond said about the Clippers.    no.  how about stop pretending that reporting things - with alarmist, unsubstantiated, demagoguery - is the same as telling the future?  the temperature in alaska could be record cold this summer, for all anyone - including the OP - knows.   what gets me is that your crowd claims to be on the side of *science*.   Can you read?   "There's no telling...."  Exactly.  Stop the sensationalist click bait.    That woman is a dissatisfied housewife who gets all turned on by goons in uniform.  She wants her knight in shining armor.   Sounds possibly fake.    http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/   As a Vick fan, I would love to see this happen.    Mike Conley   Tell us more about how everyone knows it.   Why did you put "normal" in quotes?   After the game, Kerr himself compared Curry to Jordan and Duncan, saying that he's seen those guys have games like that too.  To claim that the media just holds Lebron to a higher standard is a joke.    Generally, the media can't be expected to report fairly on any of this.  They are fans and biased and irrational like the rest of us.  Though, as such, they shouldn't pretend to be otherwise - like they do.    We're probably holding the media to too high a standard.   Not really.  He's probably missed more than anyone in league history *while* being praised by the media.  The media have *never* gotten on Kobe for any performance.          Im with you 100% on that, and have said the same thing here before.    The ONLY non-canonic book you need is "Tao: The Watercourse Way", by Alan Watts. It is probably the simplest, clearest, most thorough book on the subject. Watts is an excellent communicator. But get The "Tao Te Ching" and "The Book of Chuang Tzu" also, of course. I think the Penguin versions/translations are best.   For Zen, I would get Watts' "The Way of Zen", which has a very good chpater on Taoism.  And/or this book by DT Suzuki: http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Buddhism-Selected-Writings-Suzuki/dp/038548349X     Except that Taoism is not about theories or laws or words. It is expansive, not reductive. It coorelates with the Tao in everything.    Maybe Rand Paul can do something about that, being a Senator from Kentucky.    both   "....and lead a once-prosperous nation to ruin."   Riiiiight. You think that's all Clinton did?   Whatever he is, he doesn't talk about people like you do.   You don't really believe he's a racist. That's just what you've been told you need to dismiss him with. Try thinking for yourself, if you dare.      He did.  But they're both scumbags.      Exactly. As if she wasn't a Johnny-come-lately herself. It's the bravado and affectation one learns in her world.    As soon as the officers verify that the camera was on:    "I saw him reaching."    "Yeah, he was reaching."   FTP   They couldn't go any lower than $150?   ?      Be compassionate, and don't take yourself too seriously.    ISTP. Possibly ISTJ.   Read about the legalisticness of this type a while back.    Yeah, don't even think about style.  Style is what we see when we look at drawings, not when we draw them.  "Style" will impede your development, and prevent you from finding your own way.   Raw footage.   And don't forget *Neil DeGrasse Tyson*!!!   Though you can still vote and fight in war at age 18.   Or if your apartment size decreases.   What a load of crap. Try using that "rationale" in the real world and people will laugh in your face.    And how exactly does that mean *anything*?   Thanks!   No the going to the graduation part.    Maybe someone can point out the substance of SK's misreading of Hegel. A caricature is not a misreading, but could be a necessity. I would tend to think that Zizek is instead misreading SK.    It was just mostly put forward as a reason to keep dirty old coal plants from being replaced by renewables.    Reporting news *before* it happens!   No one says he's a moderate.   Actually, this doesn't count as "good cop" behavior, since he wasn't on the job.     Sure.  Which means all the guys in the top positions are bad cops, at least where this stuff happens, and the threat of  or actual retaliation is tolerated.  Usually this is a department by department thing.  If there is one bad cop in a department, usually there are many more, and those at the top are bad too.  See the LA Sheriff's Dept. as Example #1.   Are you serious?  "Tenacity in the face of authority" is telling bishops and cardinals not to gossip - and only *after* he gets appointed pope?  Freaking ridiculous.  You're making my point.  Why doesn't he just decree that anyone who gossips, or boasts, or plans too much, or wants more, or is indifferent, or glorifies his boss, will be excommunicated?   Then why don't these good cops ever stand up and denounce the bad cops and the officials and system that not only protects but rewards their corruption and abuse?  For example: You get paid time off for killing someone if you're a cop.  Do any of the supposed good cops have a problem with that?  No, they circle the wagons with all the rest.  EDIT: Downvote and run without a rebuttal if you can't handle the truth.      Yeah, but that is what I personally liked. Reminded me of people i know.    Exactly. That's decreased standard of living too.    If you're the Pope, how much "tenacity in the face of authority" can you possibly have?   Horseshit. The Fed has killed the middle class and standard of living. Is weaker unions also the reason for women working now?   Id like them to give me money too.    our type isnt conventional. we dont follow "rules" just because.    He is one of the dumbest mouths in the league. What he says has a nastiness about it. Said a bunch of similar things about the Clippers. Go Cav's.    Thats because this is a repost and OP made the title up him/herself.    File this under "infringed".    Watch Woody Allen movies and copy his method.    I bought mine from the official refurb site and loved it, til it was stolen a few months ago. it was like new, not a microscratch or a speck of dust.    I agree with that.    Maybe thats because most of them are *for* the Patriot Act.    We aren't supposed to agree with each other on everything. We are human.    The two senators from MT did, one a democrat named Tester.       In a way it was good he was re-elected, because now they won't be able to say, "Well, now we got a new guy in so it's all good.  Nothing to see here anymore."  Instead he has to continue under the scrutiny of the international public and media - and hopefully, law.     The NCAA has its own type of corruption going on.   Judging by the silly ceremony of the voting process yesterday, you're right:  Each delegate taking their turn at one of only two specially-designed voting booths, all set to music.  Then emptying the boxes of ballots on a table in the front, so all can enjoy the self-important spectacle of serious people counting the blue papers.  Just like any tin horn banana republic, but with more ill-gotten money.   why don't the swiss go in and arrest this goon?  their laws certainly don't protect this bribery and corruption, do they?      Thats true. But i mean the content of what he says, not how it actually  sounds. Im surehe has a lot of interesting things in his head, but whenever it comes out his mouth as anything other than a song it is just anticlimactic and boring. Seems like he has become a caricature if himself, and thinks he needs to put on this persona. Gets old.    yeah i see now. youre right.    I love the stones, but always find kieth difficult to listen to. doesnt seem to speak openly or fluidly or say anything.          I have questions about his handling of the Kelly Thomas (trial of the cops who killed him) case.    Yes, science is quite different than how it is portrayed popularly, especially here on reddit. One well-known INTJ, Nietzsche, was *very* wary of science. As was another INTJ, Kierkegaard. The scientist, Richard Feynman, sees it for what it is and explains it well.       He has to be a choleric temperament which are always extroverts.   Read Of Mice and Men. It is short and can read in a day.   OK but then how did it get the pronunciation?      I upvoted you. Saw this in the other subreddit too. Not that great of a video anyway.    I dont think he was INTJ.    Nietzsche and Kierkegaard.    Stories of guys driving around the country in the 50's loosely based in Neal Cassidy as the main character. A quick enjoyable read.    Huckleberry Finn   Might try Steinbeck. And Taoism.

 by not being a fucking pussy   I can hardly ever take anything seriously. I joke around all the time, and laugh at almost everything. When a girl broke up with me at a restaurant once, I just laughed hysterically for like a minute.    Either that or anything with Melissa McCarthy.  LMFAO!!!! upvote for you   indeed   /u/trollabot zach_wizzle   /u/trollabot TrollaBot   /u/trollabot NoblePilsner   haha that gave me a real laugh   Calm down, sugar daddy. You don't have to do this. We can work something out.   Doesn't make much sense as this is an all-multiplayer game. If there is exclusive access, there aren't going to be many people playing...   Also, does the Horizon spinoff series add to the story, or is it unrelated?   I actually do think it's a bad film, but I just didn't want to get downvoted to hell by fanboys in denial.   Just look at their asses. They won't see you looking. ;)   I think it is, "Suck a dick, dumbshits!"   I do not understand why some women like this one take steroids. Men are attracted to feminine characteristics, not masculine ones.   Like is it good enough to buy on blu-ray or should I just rent it?      Donnie Darko  well it's more of a psychological thriller, but it's creepy   I really liked Adam Sandler movies.    haha what a cheapskate. couldn't just shell out a little extra money to get adiPowers.   all natty brah      Say, "Hey, you're being pretty pendantic."  If they respond with this, they're pedantic: "No, I'm *pe*dantic, not *pen*dantic."   wait, when you say "Gyllenhaal," do you mean Jake or Maggie? Maggie is a great actress, but she is a girl, so I don't think that would work. wait... I just had a brilliant idea. Jake as the Joker, and Maggie as Harley Quinn. The actors are brother and sister, so they probably would have great chemistry! make it happen      The Dark Knight Rises. Sure, it wasn't a *bad* film, but it just wasn't nearly as good as The Dark Knight or Batman Begins.   no, I'm not saying that I did this (I don't even have a dog); I want to know if anyone has.  you know what, everyone reading this probably thinks that I actually did this, so fuck this, I'm deleting the thread.    No. The second I do that, my chance with her becomes zero.   This is probably very sadistic of me to force you to choose between these two great films, so sorry about that. I personally would choose The Place Beyond the Pines.   I just lost all self-respect.   What? No, I wouldn't do this; I was just wondering if anyone has done this. I don't even have a dog lol   rereading *The Brothers Karamazov*   This probably won't happen, but it would be awesome if Last Caress by Misfits was played at the credits of Suicide Squad right after the Joker does something really fucked up.   Blue Valentine    The Place Beyond the Pines   The Karate Kid   Spirited Away  Howl's Moving Castle  My Neighbor Totoro  Princess Mononoke  Ponyo   I really like the movie Gremlins for some reason   it is very weird. she has a very fat upper body, but has nice legs.    hey take that back   yeah he is   yep   no, I wasn't looking for that. I didn't know that was a valid reason to not like her   Ted 2   wow   wow   wow   Yeah I just started watching it today. It's really good.   I really liked him for his Emmy-worthy performance in Sons of Anarchy and of course his Oscar-worthy performance in Pacific Rim. What a great actor.   "Leo, *sit.* No, Leo. *Sit on my face.*"  [sigh] "At least she's not getting out the peanut butter. Oh, the things I do for yum yums."   1. The Place Beyond the Pines  2. Blue Valentine  3. Pulp Fiction  4. Nightcrawler  5. Spirited Away   yeah well that's true for every comedian. nobody can please everybody. it just seems that she gets a lot more hate than most comedians. I am simply wondering why this is.      yeah she definitely doesn't do many squats, if any   alright this might sound like a dumb question but are you using the term "wet" in the sexual context? sorry, but I am very, very confused   alright this might sound like a dumb question but what does "stormy" mean in this context?    idk you tell me   alright this might sound like a dumb question but what does "overcast" mean in this context?

I have to go over there and then run back here, so it might take like an hour.    Okay, well if you really can't wait until tomorrow, I guess I could run over to my uncle's house now.   Okay, I guess I kind of got into troll territory at the end there, but my uncle really does think I look like Ryan Gosling.   I forgot my phone at my uncle's house, so I can't post a pic right now. Maybe tomorrow. I might forget, so please remind me.    It is serious. If Ryan Reynolds is considered sexually attractive, Father Magoo can, as my Sons say, "reel in da pussy." Father Magoo has sworn sacred vows, but if he is a "pussy-magnet," (so sayeth the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit) He is willing to put a temporary hold on His... umm... vows.   No, I'm serious. He wasn't saying this in a sexual way, if that's what you're wondering. I probably should have said "someone" said I look like Ryan Reynolds. Basically what I want to know is whether women think Mister Reyonds is sexually attractive because that would mean Father Magoo is sexually attractive by proxy, so that I can seduce my cute little Daughters into sin.      Sometimes while watching a movie with me, my uncle sighs and says, "He's going for the pity fuck." Is "the pity fuck" a real thing?   Brno    well at least someone got it   I might be in the minority, but I like character depth in all stories.   No. I do *not* support rape. And I will *not* support it by watching a rape film.   Father Magoo to the rescue!   what are you talking about? I didn't delete anything   haha Star Wars is *not* science fiction, it's fantasy.   I wish I had $120 million to spare   You just *had* to start asking questions, didn't ya? Now you know too much.   Yes, Jax Teller has an alias that he uses for his acting career, which is "Charlie Hunnam."   He was great in Pacific Rim. Is he short on time because of The Club?  also no spoilers because I'm only at season 4  oh wait Jax Teller is going to be in Crimson Peak OMG he must be on good terms with del Toro... wait... is del Toro a member of The Club?   still a better love story than Twilight    huh, I never knew Britney Spears did Disney before.    Wow. Jesus. This was a joke, believe it or not. I just wanted to say, "I just saw Dallas Buyers Club and think that Jared Leto is a great actor and cannot wait to see him play the Joker" without coming off as a Jared Leto fanboy. It might be just me, but I'd prefer to read a silly joke rather than "OMG OMG OMG Jared is like *such* a great actor and i *totes* CANNOT wait to see him play the Joker OMG he's also like super cute no homo."   buffalo   or maybe OP *put that on his sleeping wife!*  [gasps] or maybe *she was never asleep*  maybe this is part of a conspiracy to *take over reddit and imgur*  *one.*  *step.*  *at.*  *a.*  *time.*   Action sci-fi is still action, and Pulp Fiction is a black comedy (it doesn't have to be obnoxious sex humor to be considered comedy).   oh remember the flashback where Bojack tells Herb to "get cancer"?   No, what I'm saying is that he did such an excellent job playing a transsexual junkie that now whenever I look at him I think of a transsexual junkie. Those examples are *not* analogous to what I am talking about.   Action - Aliens  Comedy - Pulp Fiction  Drama - The Place Beyond the Pines   Yeah, but Jared Leto owned the role of Rayon.    Have you seen the trailer? It looks fantastic. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie look perfect for their roles.      I just got back from Afghanistan. I was never able to get my favorite brand of muffins, so I would at least like to be entertained by Mister Arnett as I wallow in despair and morbid self-pity. For what is the meaning of our cruel, despondent existence, if we cannot even have our muffins?   Is that any good? Never heard of it.   Bojack has been my very first dive into The Will Arnett Pool of Fun and Happy Games. Please, give me more.   The Place Beyond the Pines   Yes, really. I really like it.   How am I supposed to know if you're a sociopath by just reading *one* paragraph about you? You sound pretty fucked up, but that doesn't answer your question. You've got to give me more information.    Yeah, I caught that too, but idk who she voiced.  huh... it doesn't mention it on her wikipedia  ok guys now I know  I just checked the bojack wiki page, and it looks like she voiced Irving Jannings (Kelsey's daughter)   You don't know me; I don't know you. Stop this charade.   Also, is Sextina Aquafina making fun of Katy Perry?   [walks slowly towards the door]   uhhhhhhhhhhhhh I never asked for this   No, it's A Ryan Seacrest Type. I just love the way he bulges his eyes at his guests.    far too large to use in the average woman.  I'm not an expert, but that sounds a little politically incorrect. Not that there's anything wrong with that.   Higher Love for comedy, Escape From L.A. for drama   Fuck, this episode was a complete laugh-fest. Almost as good as the muffins one.   Yeah, he's *such* a Zoe!   "Okay, thanks lunch lady."  "Yeah, bring one of your cats as a sidekick."   The Place Beyond the Pines      You are a wise Golden Labrador Retriever, but I don't understand that statement because it is not grammatically correct.   Anime Bojack directed by Hayao Miyazaki MAKE IT HAPPEN   mine is Mister Peanut Butter   lmfao   [The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete - The Smashing Pumpkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Bnp_Znp9M), to be directed by David Fincher    great show.   "Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins!"    no, it would be weird if you didn't lol      The Hateful Eight (Quentin Tarantalino is always great), Southpaw (my Jakey Bear is starring), The Revenant (same director as Birdman, so I am very interested), Crimson Peak (del Toro haunted house film), Jane Got a Gun (it's Natalie Portman starring in a western)   Hey! Jakey Bear is MINE! You don't really love him! Leave him alone!   The Phantom Menace.    Todd. I don't think that's a good thing.   eh not really   18   Ant-Man, yes. Trainwreck, no.   Nope, Gyllenhaal. And Handsome Luke is Ryan Gosling, duh.   I'm thinking Jakey G and Handsome Luke. My Jakey Bear plays a character called "Arthur," and Handsome Luke plays "Kevin." Arthur gets romantically involved with Natalie Portman (who plays herself), who happens to be Kevin's old flame. Hijinks ensue. Also the show is now a sitcom filmed in front of a live audience.

 Moon landing? Please, at this point in technology we can clearly see that the moon is a hologram and that is obviously an overlay to cover an ancient satellite set in place by the Reptoids before they went into slumber. If you were to call it anything it was a docking mission to explore and attempt to reactive the satellites defensive / offensive capabilities...  As for that explosion... Yes it was an explosion, but it was not directed at the members of Parliament. He knows this, he's part of the very Reptoid collaborating society that set the plan in motion, you can tell by his general demeanor that he and the rest are in no danger and that it's all going as planned.   The truth is that the explosive was planted in a large underground chamber located underneath Parliament in an obvious attempt to disturb / awaken the Reptoids from their slumber.   The end game is to find the Reptoids with the knowledge to reactivate the satellite, so far no nation has been able to do so and the Reptoids they have awoken are starting to acclimate themselves into the world which we created... They have since worked their way into all positions of power and have been the ones behind all the conflicts in recent times...   Now, my theory is that soon they will have no need for their worshipers like the politician in this video, soon they will be able to reactivate the satellite not for it's offensive or defensive capabilities like us mere humans want... They want it in order to send out a sub space transmission to recall their lost fleets in deep space.    According to OP you are a 432 month year old.

Anything less... $500 - $1500 Well, it'll work sure, but you'll encounter issues as you've mentioned, washed out colours, blurred or distorted image if the projector isn't perfectly aligned, Issues focusing the lens etc.  Keep in mind anything around the $3500 mark is still considered an entry level home theater projector. Not without their faults sure, but you'd be hard pressed to find any real issues other than black levels, which are always an issue with projectors but can be mitigated with the correct screen type and colour to suit your projector and room lighting conditions.  If you just want a big screen and dont care about quality, get a cheap $500 - $1500 projector, use a sheet for a screen and set it up where ever you can.  Or spend a bit more money, buy a better projector along with a proper screen and set up a dedicated room for a home theater.   But if you were just making a negative comment... Then eh, leave it at that.   Unsolicited door knocking can be illegal yes, really comes down to if you have a sign/sticker visible stating its not welcome.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game.  As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.  The episode then shows the Pokemon Battle Simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.  So my theory is that in the Pokemon Animated Universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games based on their research to help up and coming trainers and teach them about pokemon as well as threats in their world. (Team Rocket etc)  This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team. such as: "I'm the game designer!" "I wrote the story!" "I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!" "Me? I'm the programmer!".

 I'm fairly sure they don't expect to change *your* mind.   Petroleum products are not at issue; burning them is.   And other millions do care.   Canadians are the [world's third-worst polluters](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png), after Australians and Americans.   Electrical generation isn't Canada's primary pollution issue; transportation and farming are.   It's only the "fuel" in "fossil fuels" that we're worried about. That means cheaper feedstock for the plastics biz.   And so it would. The oil industry is highly automated, using infrastructure built long ago. Clean energy requires far more labor per unit of capital, mostly due to the need to build out systems.   [Relevant.](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png)      I agree, but wildly inflating statistics sure doesn't help the argument.      Well, that and the facts that governments can control the value of their own currencies, and that those values are always relative to other currencies.   That's not limited to the south. Drive just thirty minutes out of most U.S. cities and you start hearing the same.   This article exaggerates. The IPCC says that agriculture accounts for 12 percent of global carbon emissions; this article says "18 - 51 percent for livestock alone," citing a single, isolated study for the low end of that range and nothing credible for the high end.   Crazy talk.   The report is limited to easily quantifiable US impacts. Globally, most of the damage will be sustained by countries in warmer latitudes, and the forecasted costs are well into the many trillions.   High altitude jets are problematic no matter what, due to the radiative forcing of the contrails they produce, which generally doubles the harm of burning fossil fuels in flight. I see a future of lower, slower aircraft.   [Cumulative emissions](http://www.theenergycollective.com/sites/theenergycollective.com/files/imagepicker/141834/acumulado1960-2010.jpg) matter just as much, and we'll never come to effective global agreement on decarbonization without considering them.    Sulfide seeding would vastly accelerate the already-catastrophic acidifying of the oceans, and would destroy forests and crops with acid rain. Not a good idea.   That's politics talking, not data. Even the least impoverished, least corrupt US cities suffer far more violence than other rich world counterparts. At least one famous study comparing Seattle with Vancouver BC demonstrates exactly that.   Sure, poverty and inequality make it worse, but the U.S. Is a rich North American nation with a South American gun violence rate.   "Before the older laws"? Britain's tighter gun laws began in 1903 and were tightened much further throughout the 1920s and 1930s, then repeatedly again ever since. Handguns have been hard to get for many decades, which correlates with declining homicide rates. An interesting comparison is with Japan, where handguns were still in wide circulation after World War Two, and where homicide rates were nearly as high as in the US, and several times higher than in Britain--until the Japanese banned handguns and homicide rates plunged to near British levels.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Pistols_Act_1903               The CDC's mandate includes reducing injuries.   From its Wikipedia:  "The CDC's main goal is to protect public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability. The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention. It especially focuses its attention on infectious disease, food borne pathogens, environmental health, occupational safety and health, health promotion, injury prevention and educational activities designed to improve the health of United States citizens."    How to you protect yourself when only law enforcement (and criminals) are armed?  I dunno. Ask anyone from any other rich country.    The UK already had extremely tight gun laws *before* the ban, so the effect of tightening the laws just a little further was small. Even in loosely regulated countries, tightened gun laws generally take decades to reduce violence due to the simple durability of guns themselves.    Wait, 34,000 Americans die by gunshot each year, versus a handful in all other rich countries, yet our national health research center can't even *look* into reasons why? Good God.   Given that wealthy countries are responsible for most of the historical carbon emissions that have warmed the climate so far, yet most of the health impacts of those emissions are being felt in poor countries, how do you see the rich and poor worlds deciding who pays for these impacts?   This is where the climate issue will resolve: in the courts. We can look forward to massive punitive damages for the fossil fuels companies that have knowingly endangered the world, but we'll also get ham-handed, court-mandated "solutions" that will cost far more than they should and hurt more people than they need to.  If ever there were a good argument for heavy carbon taxation right now, this is it.   There are more than a few large black and Hispanic communities around the areas where he speaks, but he avoids them. Rather than speaking in South Chicago, he goes to Madison; rather than San Antonio or Salinas, he goes to Denver. This has to change.   Renewables are no myth, but they won't get us off carbon by themselves. Nuclear has to be part of the solution.    Soo...where are the rallies in largely black or Hispanic places?  I do like Bernie very much, but I'm just a little bothered that his enthusiasts seem to look so similar to one another when the modern Democratic Party is built on a multi-ethnic, multiracial coalition.   My impression is that workers who get laid off after age 50 have almost no chance of getting another decent job, and many such people were thrown out of work in recent years. A former mid-manager whose options have shrunk to minimum wage work is likely to throw in the towel.   A preview of coming attractions for Europe, North America and China in coming decades, and the rest of the world not long after.   All to the good, of course, but it sure raises questions about how societies will get past two generations of "demographic overhang", caring for their old while smaller generations of young stabilize population at lower levels.   FDR didn't have to unite whites, blacks and Hispanics to create his New Deal coalition. Bernie does. And, so far, Bernie's rallies are noticeably whiter than Hillary's.         Can't get much more passive house than that!   I was right on board until...  using less resources and more labour, fewer machines and more human intelligence     No AC, then?    I don't know why as a country we continue to fly the flag in any official capacity for a "country" of treasonous people  Treason or not, it was the flag of slavery.     That's basically what passive construction is: a thick roof and walls, with very little interior climate-control machinery.    However, the Confederate battle flag was largely forgotten in the South until its [resurgence as a symbol of white supremacy](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150626-confederate-flag-civil-rights-movement-war-history/) as the civil rights movement gained traction after World War Two. That's an entirely different kind of "Southern pride".   The savings in passive design come in HVAC, usually beginning with a sub foundation geothermal loop and heat exchanger. You'll also need a PHIUS certified builder and possibly a similarly certified architect.   If passive design is your analogy, nuclear is bargain! Passive building construction is now as cheap as code-built.   You can also include [southwestern Oregon](http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/l/Medford+OR+97501:4:US) on that list.   Sarcasm. I hope.   The key to making it work in newer cities is to start fees at a low level and raise them steadily over time, after first announcing that this will be a long-term policy. The idea is to notify everyone that building more transit, and living closer to work and stores, needs to become a priority.  Politically, that's a struggle in some places, especially conservative ones, but the twin needs to cut carbon pollution and rein in runaway freeway spending demand change.         Bingo. Older hot-climate cities were generally built to suit the need for walking, often with an emphasis on evening and morning activity.  Newer cities are built for driving from one air-conditioned pod to another.    Judging by the downvotes here, pro-slavery redditors are on task today.   Creditors are making an example of Greece to deter Spain and Portugal from following suit.   Shark bites man; man punches shark. Sounds logical.                                    Non-monetary compensation means health insurance, which accounts for two thirds of US employee benefits and is growing steadily more costly still, yet which provides no more value. It's simply a race to keep up with spiraling costs in a horrible system.  That's why Americans no longer have employer pensions as more workers in most other rich countries still do. Health insurance is the monster that ate American employee benefits.   "Scientists are scary. Pay me $425,000 to make them go away."   Except that deniers are unmoved by data.   A good deal of both, along with a depressingly durable dictatorship. But, after years of drought in Syria and rising grain prices thanks to the Russian heat wave, by most accounts climate played a major role, and not just in Syria. The whole series of Arab Spring revolts began with food riots.  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/science/earth/study-links-syria-conflict-to-drought-caused-by-climate-change.html         China is now making huge strides, leading the world in solar power, new dam building, new nuclear plants; they are implementing carbon taxes and pledging more than $6 trillion to decarbonize in the next twenty years. To put that last figure in context, China will spend almost as much on decarbonization as the US spends on its military. For a country that was desperately poor only a generation ago, which has built its economy entirely on massive coal power, that's stunning progress.   Now it's India that we have to worry most about.   Because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for 200 years, Americans are by far the [largest polluters to date](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Cumulative_energy-related_carbon_dioxide_emissions_between_1850-2005_for_different_countries.png).  In terms of emissions per person, Americans are still five times worse than Chinese (although not as bad as Aussies, Qataris and a few others).    Shades of the Netherlands! And more evidence that the climate wars will ultimately be won in the world's courts.   [Relevant.](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/images/science/GHGConc2000-large.jpg)   Great chart.

[No, it doesn't.](http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/U.S.-retail-gasoline-prices-EIA.gov_.jpg)      The Lloyd's report's scenario:  "A strong warm-phase of the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) develops in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. Flooding develops in the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, reducing production of maize in the US by 27%, soybean by 19% and wheat by 7%. Severe drought reminiscent of 2002 hits India, while parts of Nepal, Bangladesh, northeastern India and Pakistan are hit by torrential rainfall, flooding and landslides. Severe drought affects eastern and southeastern Australia and Southeast Asia. In India, wheat production is reduced by 11% and rice by 18%. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, rice is reduced by 6%, and rice production falls in Vietnam by 20%, and by 10% in Thailand and the Philippines. In Pakistan, wheat production is reduced by 10% due to flooding. Australian wheat is reduced by 50% by drought. Asian soybean rust expands throughout Argentina and Brazil, causing an epidemic. In Argentina, soybean production is reduced by 15%, with a 5% drop in Brazil. The Ug99 wheat stem rust pathogen is windblown throughout the Caucasus and further north; Turkey, Kazakhstan and Ukraine suffer 15% production losses in wheat, while Pakistan and India lose an additional 5% on top of existing flood and drought damage. Russian wheat production declines by 10%.  "Wheat, maize and soybean prices increase to quadruple the levels seen around 2000. Rice prices increase 500% as India starts to try to buy from smaller exporters following restrictions imposed by Thailand. Public agricultural commodity stocks increase 100% in share value, agricultural chemical stocks rise 500% and agriculture engineering supply chain stocks rise 150%. Food riots break out in urban areas across the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America. The euro weakens and the main European stock markets lose 10% of their value; US stock markets follow and lose 5% of their value.         Nuclear is a big part of it. So is hydro.   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/tally-of-attacks-in-us-challenges-perceptions-of-top-terror-threat.html   Sounds to me as if we have every reason to be alarmed. Did you read the linked Lloyd's report on which this is based? This is from one of the world's largest insurers, mind you.  The last food shocks spawned the Arab Spring revolts and the rise of ISIS. These coming shocks could do much worse, possibly leading to violent fascist states across much of the poor world, and likely dragging richer countries into the mess. If, that is, we fail to slash global carbon emissions soon--or maybe even if we do, given that much warming is already baked in.   The question is, can we get over our love of pickup trucks and our aversion to foreign aid in time? I'm not entirely sure that we can. Fasten your seat belt.   The most telling difference is the way Americans treat immigrants, and policies towards them, which are generally less nasty (in the case of Latinos) and sometimes adoring (towards Brits). No wars were fought here over the rights of immigrants, but a big one was fought over the ownership of blacks, and that was followed by more than a century of continued legal discrimination against them. The end of that era under two Democrat presidents helped blacks, but it was a huge slap in the faces of southern whites who had long measured their self worth by their supposed racial superiority, driving them into the Republican Party.   Race, more than anything else, has always defined nearly every aspect of American politics. Immigrant issues come and go, but not this gaping wound.   "This will make it very unlikely that the world will be able to limit average the rise in temperature to within 2 degrees Celsius, a threshold seen by scientists as necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change."   Despite occasional upticks in price, don't expect a real end to this slide until burning oil is outlawed by international agreement, as it will be within 85 years according to the G7 leaders--or as it should be in 27 years according to the world's national scientific academies.   By "acting now" I don't assume that all fossil fuel burning would end tomorrow. We have 27 years to accomplish thais at present rising emissions trends. We might push that out to 40-50 years if we start cutting emissions now. That is time enough to do this gracefully. Most credible economic forecasts show that this might shave around 0.2% off the global growth rate (3.3% annual growth rather than 3.5%, for example), so it wouldn't be free, but it really wouldn't cost much, either. More important, it would *prevent* much, much higher costs due to future warming.   Yes, this means acting *now*.  Actually, I think the markets would do just fine. They tend to move in inverse relationship to the fortunes of oil companies anyway. The key is that even as we dismantle the fossil fuel industry we would also build its replacement, and there are abundant business opportunities there.     That toughness leads to foci of deprivation that stand in contrast to the wealth of the rest of the society...Both the foci of deprivation and prison are racially disparate, for whatever reasons.  For whatever reasons? That is a rhetorical qualifier that few Americans would make. We know too well what reasons are at issue. Persistent racism, segregation, social dysfunction and mistrust all dramatically raise the costs of government services. We spend tons more on prisons and police than other nations do. We feel a greater need to arm ourselves against our fellow citizens than people in other countries do, which, in turn, leads to high costs for violence. We lack an efficient universal healthcare system because too many of us see it as a subsidy for poor blacks.   On the systemic side, by moving to (and remaining in) rural areas and states, which are accorded greater political power by law, racists also achieve disproportionate political influence, which incurs all kinds of direct and indirect costs (more support for road spending, which puts distance between "us" and "them"; more support for prisons, which are both racial weapons as well as rural jobs machines, etc.).   All of these problems reach a zenith in the former slave states, which is why many of them remain among the poorest states requiring the most Federal help.  Wars are expensive, and many (not all) American conservatives are dedicated to regarding blacks as a kind of internal military threat that must be contained, while some blacks respond in kind. It's a very costly, very old mess that completely skews comparisons with all other rich nations.     Never a bad idea if you have the land, but the study here suggests that shortages are unlikely in rich countries. We just risk being dragged down by increasing chaos and warfare in poor countries. Think ISIS, which was spawned by the 2005-2010 Syrian drought and the 2010 Russian heat wave and wheat crop failure.   You mean we richies will still have our bacon burgers while food riots spawn millions of ISIS-like fascists across Africa and Asia? Well then, there's nothing to be concerned about, is there?    I'm pretty sure they mean 3rd-world society  Yes, that is what the study concerns; emerging food shortages in emerging countries. 99.9% of redditors will remain fat and happy, arguing endlessly over why all the poor are so rudely killing one another.   Except that right now Americans hate one another's guts so much that we've had decades of domestic terrorist attacks like last week's horror in Charleston, the Tea Party's Las Vegas killings, the Oklahoma City bombing, etc.--most of which are expressly designed to spark Civil War Two.     What's happening is that white Americans care so much about black Americans receiving welfare, that their distaste for this overpowers whatever empathy they do feel for poor white Americans.  Pretty much. Along with the deep seated American myth that we all get what we deserve, which makes it easy to dismiss poor whites as lazy losers.   Except that coal-fired generators emit too much carbon to sequester at anything close to economic scale, suitable CCS geology is rare and far from most power demand, and all major R D attempts at developing feasible large-scale CCS, such as FutureGen, have repeatedly failed.  It's no coincidence that most of the money wasted on CCS research has been in the U.S., where most coal-dependent states happen to be political swing states fought over by both parties (KY, WV, TN, OH, PA, NC, CO, NM, MT...). Gotta tell those folks what they want to hear.         Not so fast. We already see this happening occasionally, such as after the 2010 Russian heat wave and wheat collapse, which sent wheat prices up 40 percent in the Arab world, which caused food riots, which sparked the Arab Spring revolutions, which continue today.  The study's point is that this may well become horrifically common. If one of these disasters produces an organization like ISIS, what would ten produce?   Done and done! And my Congressional rep as well!                  A 2001 paper?   Unfortunately, the findings are all too timeless: Within the United States, race is the single most important predictor of support for welfare. Americas troubled race relations are clearly a major reason for the absence of an American welfare state.    The difference is that power for your electric car can come from low-carbon energy sources like wind, solar, biomass and nuclear.            It's not all about salary. The 1980s were also a time of employer pensions, cheaper health insurance, affordable universities, lower priced homes and so on. Toss twice the income on top of all that and I'd take it in a heartbeat.   However, these are ranked companies, and Canada's reserves are split between many.   Good responses here. Also consider that the last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2, sea levels were 25 meters higher than today.   [It's not all about market share.](http://www.energypost.eu/historic-moment-saudi-arabia-sees-end-oil-age-coming-opens-valves-carbon-bubble/)    Note that five of the top six are national governments.    The fact that this happened to his amygdala is [not insignificant.](http://lakesideconnect.com/anger-and-violence/how-does-anger-happen-in-the-brain/)    To be fair, this is nothing close to the subsidies that fossil fuels receive: $550 billion annually, and that's for a very mature industry that is killing us versus a nascent industry that we desperately need.   That's the catch. This flag isn't just a celebration of treason; it is a threat to all black citizens, to remind them of who really owns the place.   They're everywhere in Idaho, sometimes flown over the U.S. Flag.   I've seen people draw guns in arguments, and one my neighbors--a great kid--was killed in just such a situation. Handguns just make it too easy.  Drawing a knife and attacking someone in a dispute is much more likely to get you killed.   Hey, Germany is doing it. Why can't we?   Wherever people commonly carry fighting knives there is much more knife violence. Your point is?   Roughly speaking, that is 1 gun murder per million Swiss; 1 per 11 million Japanese; 1 per 34,000 Americans.   Switzerland has a population of 8 million; Japan's is 127 million.    Not even close. Why?   I wish. However, I have family and friends who own real arsenals, and they do indeed add to them every time gun control comes up in major public debate. I know one couple who have guns stashed in every room, with battle plans drawn up to repel home invaders. Mind you, these folks live in the safest, most boring rural idyll you can imagine, but man are they *ready*.   The 97% consensus measurement wasn't really off. It merely showed that only 97% of publishing climate scientists publicly endorse the consensus, while, of the remainder, only a microscopic fraction actually oppose it. What the new study shows is that when we look at scientists' *research findings*, we see that nearly all the "undecideds" in the missing 3% actually echo the consensus, even though they are reluctant to say so.         After recent events in South Carolina, you may want to reconsider that statement.   Yeah, but this is the *state government* we're talking about. A state government that was the very first to commit treason against the United States in 1861, and which, under that flag, killed thousands of Americans while enslaving thousands more.   Don't just lower the flag; sell tickets for the right to shit on it, and hand the proceeds to the descendants of slaves.   Fuckface Flag. More alliterative.   "Kind of genius when you think about it, to not violate the flag code they decided to just make it a permanent t fixture rather than on a pulley system like every other flag.  A flame thrower should do the trick.    It would also lead to riots by those of us unwilling to be screwed for the sake of yet more tax cuts for the rich. And that would lead to dead people, which would lead to still more. If the long list of right-wing terrorist attacks in this country are any indication, Civil War Two is *exactly* what conservatives secretly crave.    Okay, here's a thought experiment: rather than outlawing murder and rape, shouldn't we just make them expensive?   No, because that would simply give license to the wealthy to commit whatever horrors they like, and murder and rape are absolutely intolerable. Same here. Carbon pollution must end altogether; in fifty or sixty years there will be no tolerance for it. We won't allow *anyone* to burn fossil fuels.   No doubt, carbon taxation is the best first step towards decarbonization, but it cannot be the last step.     This may strike some Americans as radical, but it is almost precisely what German President Angela Merkel just proposed at the recent G7 summit, and her country is on track to make good on this.   But the agreed scientific consensus is that we have just 27 years to quit fossil fuels under the present business-as-usual scenario. How does a $40/ton carbon tax even begin to accomplish that? It cannot.  At some point in the coming decades, we need an outright ban, with truly serious penalties for lawbreakers.                I'm a fan. However, some conditions:   An emissions tax must be high enough to change behavior *and* to account for the price of damages caused by carbon pollution. That would be at least $40/ton (the official US Gov figure for the social cost of carbon, and too low at that). No one is currently proposing a tax level this high.   A carbon tax must return its revenues to taxpayers in order to prevent a shift of tax burdens from rich to poor, and to prevent the economic drag that comes from tax hikes.   A carbon tax must eventually pair with a carbon cap. The great flaw in carbon taxation is that it doesn't actually outlaw burning carbon, which is what the world must do. However, it can delay that ban and reduce its pain.   It's about time.    "To say that people who would willingly kill multiple people, especially ones they don't even know, isn't mentally ill is... well.. wrong, unless you can think of a logical reason for murdering lots of people.   Sounds like a question for Tim McVeigh, Adolph Hitler, the Hutu militia or any number of other mass murderers.  The usual reason for killing lots of strangers is because you hate their kind. You might classify that as mental illness--and you might be right--but it's still the largest, most common problem that humanity faces and has always faced.    "If we are really concerned about gun violence, the overwhelming majority (by ridiculous magnitudes) comes from illegal gun ownership.  You do realize that this is because getting an illegal handgun is just so freaking easy in the U.S., where guns flood the streets and run down the gutters with each spring rain, right? Just try finding a handgun to buy on short notice in the U.K. or Japan, for example. Getting a connection will likely take days if not weeks, and then you'll pay a fortune, *and* you'll face serious charges if anyone finds out about your illegal pistol. Consequently, handguns don't get carried around all the time as in the U.S., so they don't just pop out and end arguments badly as they do here.   To be fair, *some* Catholics are indeed among the crazies in the Republican Party. Look up Opus Dei and its adherents like Santorum and Scalia. A third of Congress is Catholic, including some of its wackier members. We can guess that they aren't altogether happy with this pope.   Our responsibility for warming the planet was rather well settled fifty years ago, and very settled thirty years ago when high-powered computing made accurate forecasts possible. However, the basic concept of global warming from burning fossil fuels, and the first rough calculation of its future effects, came [120 years ago](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php).    No, carbon taxes would not ignore methane. The only significant human-caused gas it would ignore is NOx, which is very easily regulated by other means. Water vapor is another, but it is a biproduct of warming by CO2 and CH4. So, yes, a carbon tax could be quite effective--if it is steep enough.   I like the Citizen's Climate Lobby plan: a carbon fee-and-dividend that would return all revenues equally to each citizen, giving people some resources to adjust their living, boosting consumer spending at the same time to overcome the economic drain of an additional tax.   You do understand that a tax cut for the wealthy means that you'll have to pay more, right? It's a shift of burdens from them to you.   Paul thinks you'll prefer kissing the National Parks and National Forests goodbye, you won't miss Social Security or Medicare, you'll do fine without Federal law enforcement, you'll gladly say goodbye to clean air and water, you'll never need disaster aid from FEMA, and you won't mind tripping over the emaciated poor who can't get food assistance...yet you'll gladly spend still more billions to fund the world's largest military machine. It'll all be unicorns and rainbows.   The chart shows that the *effective* income tax rate now paid at various income levels is very progressive, with those making less than around $40K paying nothing, after deductions, while those in the middle pay around 9% and those making $1 million pay 21%.    Sounds like a preliminary draft.  From the article: "Powell, a member of the National Science Board under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, decided to share an exclusive draft of his research on Tuesday  just days before Pope Francis is set to deliver a major address on climate change  because he doesnt want his holiness to reference outdated numbers."   Paul's plan would cut revenues to the Federal government, dumping more burdens on the states to fund through their own tax systems, which tend to rely on regressive measures like sales taxes, permit fees, etc.. Bush did the same thing.   [This article](http://judithcurry.com/2014/07/07/understanding-adjustments-to-temperature-data/) may help explain.    Did you happen to notice the graph? After deductions, nearly all who make less than around $40K pay no income tax right now.   And how about the accompanying stats?   "The average effective tax rate for all Americans is about 10.4 percent. However, taxpayers earning over $1 million pay a 23 percent effective rate and taxpayers earning over $250,000 pay a 21 percent effective rate more than twice the national average.   http://taxfoundation.org/blog/even-after-deductions-and-credits-income-tax-system-progressive   http://taxfoundation.org/blog/even-after-deductions-and-credits-income-tax-system-progressive   https://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/climate/patterns/PDO.html   Look what happened [the last time](http://www.ctj.org/html/statefx.htm) we did this shit. The Bush tax cuts were a windfall to the wealthy but a disaster for the states. Furthermore, by their nature, state taxes and fees tend to be much more regressive than Federal, so this very effectively further shifts tax burdens from rich to poor.          No mention of climate change? The Arab Spring uprisings began with the 2010-2011 Russian heat wave and wheat collapse. The Syrian civil war began with the 2006-2010 extreme Syrian drought.  We've been warned to expect this, and this is just a taste of what's coming, people.     Low income families pay [almost no income tax](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/trythis3.png) now, so this wouldn't change much on the low end. However, on the high end, this would be huge: 49% of all income taxes are paid by those making more than $250K ([source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/24/high-income-americans-pay-most-income-taxes-but-enough-to-be-fair/)). Those of us in the middle would have to pay for massive tax cuts to the rich.   Meanwhile, even the poor get screwed as state and local governments raise regressive taxes on them to make up for the shortfall in Federal money for roads, transit, emergency services, healthcare, parks, law enforcement, care of public lands, etc.. For example, fishing at the local roadside now requires a much more costly license, plus an even pricier parking permit, so that even catching fish for dinner is out of the reach of many.  Aren't you getting a little tired of all this? I certainly am.   Clearly, not a Catholic.   When has economics *ever* been divorced from politics?    So he gives away crumbs to the poor, who pay very little income tax now, in return for handing a gigantic windfall to the rich? And the rest of us get screwed? No thanks.      Seems a perfectly accurate assessment to me. Limbaugh, Beck, O'Reilly and company may not directly encourage right-wing violence, but they certainly fan the indignation that leads to it.    Schoolmate says, I never heard him say anything, but just he had that kind of Southern pride, I guess some would say. Strong conservative beliefs.  So...yet another mass murder by a crazed white conservative trying to "take his country back".       The one shockwave on four justices' minds right now: shredding wildly popular Obamacare would guarantee a very leftish Supreme Court within four years.   So I guess we can just forget about that larger moral issue: the rising conflict between the oil industry and the need to preserve a livable, productive climate?         As in many bankruptcy cases, while it may be irrational for Greece to leave the EU and default, it is extremely rational for them to *threaten* to do so. With richer EU countries fearing a cascade of subsequent defaults and departures by Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy, the Greeks have real bargaining power. Why not use it?                        Not exactly the first time someone pulled a crazy [scam in Spokane](http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2011/09/22/the-merry-scamsters-of-spokane-strike-again/).         However, there's also this little aviation emissions detail called [radiative forcing](http://www.treehugger.com/aviation/what-the-heck-is-radiative-forcing-why-should-my-aviation-carbon-offset-include-it.html), that more than doubles the warming caused by burning *any* fuel at high altitude.   What, no mention of demographics? Am I the only one noticing that the "lack of wriggle room" in these various national economies correlates somewhat with the the aging of their populations? Japan and Italy suffer the most economic pressure; no surprise that they also have the most demographic overhang. Meanwhile, demographically younger countries like Australia are in better shape.  Energy resource deficits appear to be another factor in play. Norway, Australia and Canada are doing better; Japan and Italy, once again, are doing worse.            http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears/what-scientists-say/are-polar-bear-populations-booming              	200
 Cool, thanks for the advice!  Here's my situation. Sorry that it's pretty wordy:  Right now, in terms of electronics, I have a gopro, a dslr, a portable USB hard drive and an iPhone. What I've been doing up until this point is transferring the pictures and footage from the cameras to the phone via the cameras' built in "wifi hotspot" mode, then backing up to Google Drive over the hotel's wifi, but it's problematic.   The gopro takes hours to wirelessly transmit footage, the dslr only transmits lower resolution photos, and the Google Drive is entirely dependent on how good the hotel's wifi is, which can vary quite a bit. I've used internet shops to transfer the SD cards to my hard drive, which works out fine, but I'd rather do this boring junk from my hotel room so I can spend my daylight hours exploring.  I started looking for cheap tablets that can do this sorta stuff, and that might be the best option in the end, but when I came across the Filehub, it seemed like the perfect cheap solution. It lets you connect SD cards to portable hard drives and you copy the files over with a File Management app. It's tiny and cheap (I'm operating on a filthy backpacker scum budget), and it has some nice bonus features, like media streaming and, on the latest model ( http://www.ravpower.com/ravpower-rp-wd01-filehub-3000mah-power-bank.html ) you can hook it up to ethernet and make your own hotspot. Would have been helpful in a couple spots.   TL;dr: I should just suck it up and buy a tablet.    I'm traveling across SE Asia for 6 months and I saw this ( http://www.ravpower.com/ravpower-rp-wd01-filehub-3000mah-power-bank.html ) on a r/gadgets thread. Seems like it would be handy, seeing how dumping footage off of my gopro has been a hassle during the first two months through Vietnam.   In a few days I'll be in the HCMC area  for about two weeks and I was wondering how Amazon works over here, where I can ship it to (I don't have anywhere booked yet, kinda winging this whole trip), or if anyone's seen something similar to this.   Just a couple other miscellaneous questions to throw in:  Is there a Facebook group for HCMC Traveller's/expats? Hanoi Massive was super helpful while I was up north.   Anyone know where to get a decent waterproof backpack cover? I lost mine somewhere in Da Lat  Anyone wanna drink a couple dozen Ba hoys this week with an utterly lost Texan? I'll be the guy with the oil gushing out of the beat up Honda Win  Edit: Damnit! I just saw the other delivery thread that was just posted, my bad. Still, maybe somebody has some ideas about this thing, specifically.    I fly in today and I'm totally down. Nothing like a couple of drinks to chase away the jet lag!   Well, like Black Panther, but with a transparent suit...  	4
 How small do blades have to be?  Also, nice cat.    That's really awesome.   I hear you 100%. I feel like dwelling on the past has been my #1 problem in life. I've found it helpful to just keep myself super busy at present on things that will help me in the future. Working hard at work to get promoted, working out at the gym, taking some night classes. All these things keep me too busy to worry about regrets or past experiences and help build a solid foundation for me to be better off in the future.    I think a Sailor stationed at Gitmo just did an AMA yesterday. Might want to ask him:  [http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/314ujv/serious_iama_a_united_states_navy_sailor/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/314ujv/serious_iama_a_united_states_navy_sailor/)   Ha, it's so funny you mention that. I was searching on Google and Amazon all last week trying to find a decent Loons hat with no success.    Do you guys actually brush your teeth with the soap? How does it taste?    I can't order "pop" anywhere on the East Coast...however they do have something called "soda" which tastes pretty similar.    But what do you want with the detonators, Hans? I already used all the explosives... Or did I?   They've been using cats as [firebombs](http://news.discovery.com/history/rocket-cat-warfare-found-in-16th-century-manual-140306) since the 1500s.    So he doesn't get incepted.    Totally agree. Diet soda has help me shed a ton of calories from regular soda and beer that I would otherwise be drinking. But I still have friends saying "OMG you're going to eat tons more food because of it!" like it's some Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde potion that will force me to eat.

Today I had an entire Saturday, and used the whole day to do chores, house repairs, and a report for work...not a single game played :(   Guy looks like Junpei   Wow nice! Thanks for posting!    What a boss   My buddy had a PS1 and bought MGS right when it came out. So after school we'd go over to his house to watch him play and it looked awesome.    Congrats and welcome!    Looks like he forgot his suit, so he just grabbed a couch cushion and made a jacket out of it.    $1,700 bones...I guess I shouldn't be surprised...      Whelp that proves it. I'm sure the CCP will issue an apology for the confusion and quietly drop all claims. Nice work boys.    You should definitely look into "urban exploration" in Minnesota. Some guys explore abandon buildings and old tunnels, which would make for some pretty cool settings.   [Action Squard](http://www.actionsquad.org/)   I'd buy it. I also really want to see an Elena + Reno side-story :)    A...four button NES controller? *head explodes*   Pretty psyched about this. I love MLS and it will be great to finally have a home team to cheer for.    It's Yahoo, so they love to blow things way out of proportion. Like they had a story they other day on that Chinese girl who sat in the cockpit of a plane which talked about "International Outrage/Protest/Condemnation"!    That was a really great show.   Aww yeaaah   Wow that is a nice knife   Wow, that's a really interesting story. Thanks for posting!    Totally agree, I think surrounding peers have a huge influence, even outside of the military. I got married at 25 in a rural part of the country and all my friends asked "what took you so long?" Then I moved to a new job in a big city and I was the only one of my coworkers who was married, and all of them asked "wow, why did you get married so young?"    With Persona 5 coming out, this is my plan as well. Doesn't hurt that I can grab Uncharted, Journey, and Last of Us as well.    Jesus Christ that's awful...   Pretty all much grandparents and great-uncles were in WWII. The impression I got from them and other older folks was "it was just what you had to do". Like there was never really a question about them joining or serving (and they didn't discuss it much), but the country was in need so they did what they had to.    47 is too young :(    Ah Dreamcast...we barely knew thee.   Pilots too. I feel like half the people who have seen Top Gun think you can just stroll up to the recruiter and say "I want to be a pilot. Which way to the fighter jets?"

Doctor's offices, restaurants, the DMV...I seriously see these things everywhere.     It was the first one I learned and I only remembered it because I thought it looked like a "little helicopter" on top. I had bad luck using the "random point" method of ordering in restaurants, so this helped me to not starve during my first trip through China.

We were at the Madison farmer's market and were at a fruit stand, when a guy came running up to the owner and goes "Sorry, I bought some apples about an hour ago and gave you a $5 but you gave me back change for a $10, so here's the extra money"    Car dealerships are forced to close on Sunday too. That one just blows my mind...   Feel bad for the owners...the same thing happened to a shop near me in the Cities. A guy smashed a $1000+ window, jumped inside and stole 3 rolls of of quarters ($30) and a few bags of chips.    How do you like the Moto X? I need to upgrade and am deciding between the Moto X and the Razr Maxx.    Who won?   omg me too! I remember accidentally hitting Select and seeing the square and thinking"what the hell does that do?"   "Hmm...yes you seem to have a case of Tiny Leg Syndrome (TLS)...I'm going to prescribe you a regiment of Squats, 3 times per week"   That actually wouldn't be a terrible pizza cutter...   But the person in the comment I clicked on said they made $8,271 from home last week! Employers hate her!    Wow that's awesome looking...I'd love to visit someday   No unfortunately not :(  Lots of nights and weekends, especially at the beginning of the year, when clients have the money to do work. Like last week was around 70 hours and this week will be even more. So it's a pretty constant thing.  But it pays well and allows me to take care of my family, so I guess I can't complain.      I regularly do 60+ just at my job alone. I think the biggest thing for me is that once I'm in my office I do nothing but work until I leave. So maybe it's about picking a location and forcing yourself to go there. It doesn't have to be an office, but maybe go to a library or somewhere where you won't be distracted by "fun" things, and just make it a rule that you are going to spend X number of hours there everyday.   I think getting into a routine and sticking to it is the biggest thing that helped me.    you mean since Prince was on Apollonia?      I love stuff like this. I used to keep a folder of all the "real world" Final Fantasy locations I came across.

Yeah second this. I catch my bus at 5:20am so I feel like getting up any earlier would probably be counterproductive.    I have the exact opposite problem. I have a huge commute too so I'm out the door at 5am and back home at 7pm.   I have my treadmill and weights in the basement so it's fairly quiet. You could do a bodyweight routine in the morning which is pretty quiet.   "Do you engineers know what the F35 needs? More engines.

 This happened yesterday as we were on our way on a trip to Italy. As typical as it is our sixteen year old asses got drunk as fuck on the train.  It was three hours after peak, as we began talking. I kinda admitted that I'd had a crush on this girl for the past years.   Turns out, every guy in my class had one on her aswell...    We want to inform her about this hh...   Tl;dr got drunk on a train. Found out that everyone had the same crush    I love the idea!!         Aaah didn't know that, thanks.

 yeah I know but isn't making friends and networking a part of it?   I'm not actually in "the industry" yet! I'm just a student who's done a handful of industry and academic internships! I'm a major in Geomatics/Spatial engineering which is really IMHO a black horse field. Basically, I work with GIS related projects as well as remote sensing and also do programming work with SQL and Matlab related to the GIS stuff.

That's what people tell me but whenever I look at myself in the mirror, all I see are fats! Even when I touch my body, all I can feel are fats..   Currently I go to the gym 6 times a week but am still on the heavy side. I'm 19 and 181 cm tall and I weight 75 kilos and i'm planning on fasting from all food except for broccoli and water for the next one week. Will it help me lose fats fast? Or will it cause me to lose muscle mass?      Why is it not worth it? I don't get it. Would it cost that much to install a security guard for each plane?    Yeah but I read that with the low amounts of Marshals they have, no every flight has security for the US anyways. Not sure about other countries.    Just curious, Malaysian?

 most likely not, but just hearing news about that earthquake got me thinking about all that stuff.   Probably a small number of people, but still gotta try.   One step at a time, just remember that it's suppose to be fun, try to enjoy really coming up with your characters and story. Make them seem like they are real people in a world you have created for them   Just make sure you have most of the plot figured out before writing, it's an awful challenge trying to come up with dialogue and plot motions at the same time.  	4
 I'm back on the dating scene and had some what of a lack luster experience last night.  With as many stories as I have, I got to thinking.  I know I can't possible have the most interesting or or worse date experiences.  So let's hear it.   I had a feeling...  Throw a pot reference in the title = upvotes   Normally I think the 3D figures look a little weird, this one is spot on!   Thought 69....?  Edit:  I stand corrrected.  Learned something new today.      Yo Gina!  I heard you were dating some guy who looks like that bitch, Amy I went out with last winter!   Do it   I really don't think you need the springer seat, it's going to raise you up and you may feel less stable.  Plenty of old school bobber go straight rigid seats,  reference any indian larry bike   And this is why there is a  "No Mary Jane before a job" clause on the rule books   Just nod if you can hear me   I've been asked more than once, "why don't they have seat belts on motorcycles?"  Or, "They should put seat belts on motorcycles"  after a frustrated and let down sigh I always try to explain how that's the worst idea ever and why.  Now instead of explaining it, I'm just going to show them this picture.   Damn.  I seriously love the tank raises on the nightster.  Well done sir.   I thought maps were supposed to be green yellow and red?   I was just as worried about the heels on the vinyl seats   Wow, one of the first HD's I've seen in a little while that nails the bobber look to a T.  Congrats to your brother, very envious.

It was Saturday night and we had a little over 400 on the books and it was about as fine dinning as you get here in Dallas.  It was about 2/3 of the way through my shift.  I was on pastry and prep.  One of our Souxs yelled back to knock out ten plates of carpaccio on the meat slicer.  I bust them out, plate them up and take them to the hot line.  While cleaning I racked my middle finger right into the blade.  I split the tip of my middle finger open on one side down to the bone.  I yelled, and everybody knew what happen.  I yelled for our intern to grab duct tape, a trash can, some gloves and our chef.  I was in the hallway behind the restaurant when Chef Tre saw me wrapping up my finger in duct tape and told the GM not to send home since "Mike knows what he's doing"  I wrapped my finger in tape and two gloves taping them at the wrist and finished out my shift.  After I was done I went to the ER and got my 12 stitches.  When I came back to work a few days later Tre gave me a "dinner for 2" ticket to the restaurant for being a bad ass and sticking it out.  Tl;Dr: split my finger open on the meat slicer.  Taped and wrapped up. Finished my shift, got my stitches.  Stuck it out like a boss.

While there's a lot of buzz on this post about the pipes, there's buzz about reckless bikers and dangerous riding activity.  The post itself points it out by mentioning motorcyclists not wearing helmets.  Before people start bitch in about bikers who don't wear helmets, they need to notice that when a rider doesn't wear a helmet they only put their own well being at steak.  When someone drives distracted by choice by picking up their phone, they endanger themselves and everyone else.  It goes back to the old adage about not throwing stones in glass houses.   I can't even continue reading their comments.  Their ignorance and judgentalness is louder than most pipes.   So, I'm curious.  How many people on this thread complaining about "scumbag bikers" drive a car and talk/text/ or check ANYTHING on your cell phone while operating a vehicle of any kind.

Growing up k-5 we had a flag in every room and said the pledge every morning.  I remember most mornings we also sang the star spangled banner, Texas our Texas, or the school fight song.  Jr High we said the pledge and had flags, I don't remember singing though.  In highschool we had flags, but I don't remember saying the pledge much.  I participated in Army JROTC all 4 years and we said it there, but I don't remember saying it in any other class.  The attack on Sept. 11th 2001 was my Senior year of HS.  We started saying the pledge in some classes after that once a week on fridays, but that was it.  I never once remember saying it in college and do not specifically remember flags in classrooms..

Due to an ice/snow storm I got to go home 4 hours early from work.   I had a great nap.   There will be an Islamic caliphate centered in Istanbul, Turkey.  Erdogan and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi are making great progress in setting this up.   Turkey was home to the 4th and last Caliphate, abolished in 1924.  The last was Abdulmecid II of the Ottoman Dynasty. He was replaced by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, know as the Father of secular Turkey 1923. He sought to westerize the country which conflicted with conservative Muslm beliefs.  This lead to an identity crisis for the country: go back to our roots in a glorious caliphate that was admired, or become a secular western country.  The man elected as the 12th President, Recep Erdogan,  doesn't like the secular model and is trying to return the country to a caliphate, with himself as the caliph. He views ISIL, and similar groups, as his way to achieve that.    They didn't want to have to run after him.  Takes too much effort for that.  Just shoot his ass, that'll stop him.   An instant mind-reading device.   I don't necessarily think they are.  There have been some ugly babies in our gene pool.    Since Turkey is going to be the center of their eventual caliphate, I'd restrict them to Turkey, but they must allow for people to come and go as they please.  Not everyone supports sharia.   Not for years.  I must say, I do miss him cooking for me.   Treeninja.  It's a game I play with my niece.    I watch ufo "documentaries".  It's ridiculous, but I do it.     The Star Trek replicator.

UPDATE:  Apsara Authority declared that it had arrested two more foreigners for taking nude pictures at Preas Khan temple yesterday.  According to the declaration, Apsara Authority with the cooperation from Tourist Police Unit in Siem Reap and Heritage Protection Division in Siem Reap had prevented the act of taking nude pictures at Preas Khan temple around 10:00 am on 06/ Feb/ 2015. The foreigners are Lindsey Kate ADAMS, 22 years old and Leslie Jan ADAMS, 20 years old. Both of them are American.  Mr Koy Sao (Judge of Siem Reap Court) had declare on Saturday that the court decided to imprisoned them 6 months with 1,000,000 riel fine for each and banned them for re-entering Cambodia for 4 years, as they were charged of  trafficking pornography and exposing sexual organs  in Article 39, paragraph 3 of the law on human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Article 249 of the Penal Code.  However, the punishment was suspended in accordance with Article 107,109,111 of the Penal Code.  Mr Koy Sao added,  Both of them confessed that they had taken nude pictures at the temple.  Both of them will be expelled from Cambodia tonight by bus from Siem Reap to Bangkok, Thailand.  http://cambodiaexpatsonline.com/newsworthy/two-naked-american-sisters-arrested-siem-reap-cambodia-t3872.html   In a new development Friday night, the Washington State Patrol said the boyfriend  a 38-year-old man from Miami, Okla.  had been arrested by authorities in Oklahoma late Friday and was booked in jail to await extradition back to Washington.

The Bible has nearly 800 references to Jerusalem- called the City of our God (Ps. 48:1,8) Jerusalem is Gods city, the city of Zion, he has invested his name there (Daniel 9:19).  Jerusalem is called the city of the great King (Matt.5:35). YHWH is called the God of Israel, He is not called the God of any other nation in this manner, The God of Jerusalem is key to the Jewish people, to Jesus and to the end of the age.  Zion is called the city of God. Isa 60:14: and they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. It is where the Lord has and will dwell again. Joel 3:21: for the LORD dwells in Zion. When the temple permanently replaced the tabernacle and was built in Jerusalem it became the place of his dwelling, his presence was there, thus name Zion.  Ps. 132:13-14: For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling place: This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. Ps. 87:1-3: His foundation is in the holy mountains. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God!

Snap toch af en toe niet wat er in zulke mensen hun brein verkeerd gaat.   Is that the dog whisperer on the right?   Thank you for the kind words. Yeah it sucks big time, especially at such a relatively young age.  Thanks again!   Kick him in the nuts and move on. Not to literally but you know what I mean.   Het blijft idd nog een tijdje hangen, misschien is praten met een psycholoog een optie, zij weten vaak goede handvatten te geven. Je zit natuurlijk ook in een soort rouw proces, dit slijt er vaak uit in verloop der tijd. Is natuurlijk niet niks om een vriend te verliezen op zo een jonge leeftijd.   Bel maandag gewoon even de huisarts hij kan je sowieso verder helpen. Misschien is het ook een idee om er is met je vrienden over te praten wat er is gebeurd misschien ben je niet de enige in de vrienden groep die het hierdoor moeilijk heeft gekregen of is geschrokken.  Succes.   You aren't a failure, nobody is.   We are all proud of your graduating, don't let us down two!  As the top comment suggested get your self a good psychiatrist, things will get better with the appropriate help, it's gonna take time, but when you are better in the near future you are gonna be really glad you didn't do something stupid tonight.  I'm a your friend from now on, feel free to send me as much messages as you want I will truly answer all of them.   Just don't do it.   Thank you Doc! Much appreciated!   I'm sick for the last 2 to 3 years, it started with racing heart rate 195 bpm first conclusion by GP: "panic attack" I said i'm not scared nor am I in panic but they didn't listen because I was young (21 at the time) and young people can't be sick. I kept telling them my heart acts weird it goes to slow and to fast nah that's all anxiety (hmm slow heart rate with anxiety)? So for 1,5 years this went on and on every day I asked the GP for a referral to a Cardiologist in Holland this is the way it goes a GP needs to refer you to a Specialist. Instead she said no you need to see a psychiater and work on your anxiety I still said i'm not scared but well I was at the point to except every help in the world because I felt so sick. So i was put on Anti depressants surprise surprise they didn't work, they only made my slow heart rate much worse. Kept telling them my heart rate is getting to slow (38 bpm fully awake, dizzy almost passing out) nah it was still anxiety, you are making this up or you can't count, they told me I that i had a very severe case of anxiety so they putted me in the Psychiatric Hospital and they thought I was absolutely fucking crazy. My mom and dad shocked to death because I was always such a nice kid and very realistic. After 3 weeks I certainly knew I wasn't on the right place and asked my mom and dad to pick me up.  Later my mom kicked me out of the house because she couldn't handel it because my GP kept saying nah he is lazy and needs to go play sports it's all in his head, she asked my dad if I could stay at his place. We haven't spoken for 6 months but we are slowly working on it and we are meeting once a week now.  We are 1,5 year further now then first my first time racing heart experience, I changed GP and he referred me to a Cardiologist and Endocrinologist: turned out my Pituitary Gland was inflamed an my cortisol was way way way to low and I had Severe bradycardia and now last week I heard my echocardiogram(ultrasound of the heart) showed that my heart muscles is getting weaker and showed there is damage in the muscle something called Akinesis or something I need an MRI in 2 weeks to see how bad it is, but in general those things aren't really good when you are 23.   I have seriously NO CLUE how i'm still a life, sometimes i can't even think or remember where i was 5 minutes ago and walking a stairs absolutely get's me out of breath and I get massively light headed.   I want to get off my chest that I feel extremely sad and I lost complete confidence in my own body and mind because I didn't stood up for myself in the beginning.   O and fuck you to the so called friends that aren't there when you actually need them, lost a lot of friends.   So now i'm gonna be sad again and sit in a corner and cry a bit more thinking back of the horrible 2/3 years I had.      De verdediging is echt om te huilen. Stam! Warmlopen!   Verse cashewnoten?    Not entirely on topic, but I life in Delft and I HIGHLY recommend you to join a Studentenvereniging (Student association/students unionI have no clue what the right english translation is). I see a lot of Asian people or other foreigners how are missing a great deal of fun.   But back on topic: Klokhuis, Journaal, Jeugdjournaal and maybe some cartoons you have in Asia also where you know the story line from already, that would make it a bit easier.   touch   jaa was ook wel lachen aangezien bij de laatste dat ding onder de glijmiddel zit schoot behoorlijk door de klas die dildo.   Yes   If you come over we can melt it back in one piece.    Heb toch de indruk dat dit wat ruim uit ze verband word getrokken. Zo incapabel kan die niet zijn.   PS3 controller   Indeed it's brilliant the sarcastic references are hilarious, "nobody else can make the world a better" CEO of Hooli   Really fun movie!  	33

 I didn't take the video, a friend did, but it is most certainly the Brooklyn museum, not BAM.    Maybe could be a midi conflict? Protools thinks it's getting a signal from a control surface and it's interfering with what you're trying to do. Just a guess      haha I literally just did a film with the exact same perspective shift. Design aside, build the effects chain for your "deaf effect" and put it on an aux channel that returns to your main output. Then insert a send on any of your tracks that you want to morph into deafness, bussed to your new aux channel. Set it to "prefade" then you can fade down the main volume of the track, but fade up the aux send to reroute it through your effect.    I need to check but I suspect that indeed the master volume acts as a DCA for the output fader as stated. When outputting just 1 stereo output this seems redundant, but if you have multiple outputs (IE: 5.1 surround sound or more complicated output routing for monitoring) it affects all of of them which is potentially useful, although honestly I don't see why you would ever want your output at anything but unity assuming everything is setup properly.    I'm a pro sound designer. Use logic and protools. Actually prefer logic to protools for pure sound design work for its bundled plugins, quicker hand-drawn automation (curves) and since I can experiment and then bounce the track in place. Prefer protools for hardcore audio editing. Would never dream of using it for anything midi based.   If you're a true pro company you gotta stick with protools as your main DAW though if you expect to send sessions around to other places.    I like apple's Space Designer so much sometimes if I'm forced to use Protools, I make an effects return to logic or mainstage with soundflower and use that. Cheaper than altiverb. . .     r e c o r d  i t !    Thanks, def a useful step in the right direction   nope. Doesn't work, this adjusts the whole track OR if a selection is made adds too many nodes and a hard bump which is exactly what I'm looking to solve.    Hi folks,  Been using Logic for 10 years but also use protools professionally. Still catching up a bit and have a quick question. (not interested in a debate about which is better).   When fine tuning automation lanes by hand is there a way to:  Raise or lower (probably w/ trim tool) JUST the segment of automation that lies between two nodes. Currently it either scales the automation of the whole track or if I select that area it adds new nodes interfering with my preexisting fades. (In logic this would just be dragging a segment, stretching the fades before and after it to achieve a new level. )  When I select an area and the use the trim tool to adjust its level, 4 nodes are created (2 on each end) creating a hard jump to the new level. Is there a way to switch this so only two nodes are created essentially creating a fade from whatever nodes are already immediately lbefore/after the area?    +1   you can't run directly from your interface to the speakers. They're passive which means the need an amp in between. I don't know the specific specs of your speakers so can't recommend an amp. Once you have one though, you could then run 1/4"-Speakon cable from that to the speakers.   I think you could benefit from hiring a professional  though to fully address your needs. There are different kinds of 1/4" (TS vs. Balanced TRS) and different kinds of speakon (NL2 vs. NL4 for a bi-amped system)   Sure why not you just need an amp. All that said, these speakers aren't really going to give you a clear mix if you're doing serious audio work up close. They're more geared towards loud playback in a large entertainment venue, not precision.   Your signal chain would be:  Computer--firewire/usb--interface--very small mixing board*--2 channel amplifier--speakers  *like a Mackie 402VLZ4. Technically your interface could function also as your mixer but it's probably safer to have a mixer in there to gain stage everything correctly   wav absolutely supports surround sound. . .    Agree, but it's more complicated than that. Anyone with great ears who doesn't have a properly treated room won't actually have an accurate sense of what they're hearing. A fine engineer is going to charge more than $50/track because of the overhead involved with running a professional operation where those good ears can be put to use.   at $50 a track you're gonna have trouble. Even if they have decent ears, anyone working on that budget isn't going to have the expensive outboard compressors/limiters and room treatment that makes mastering a valuable step in the process. It's expensive.    I know we're past your deadline but I usually prepare 2 stems for theatrical gigs... a wet and a dry. Then when I get to the space I'll mix in the wet as needed.     I believe traditionally just tacks or nails/needles/pins on a hard surface have been used. But there are no rules. . .    I would use a combination of: An additional track of hiss/crackle sounds that's sidechained with a compressor  to your main auto to help "glue" them together A distortion plugin on your main audio a very very slow flanger. You can also use a tape delay with feedback set to zero and then modulate the delaytime to give it that warpy sound.    maybe compress everything to glue it together/blend and then fade certain clips up into the foreground strategically. There are no rules though.    I feel like all these movies portray the Roma in a fairly romanticized unrealistic way   	22

You should check out [**CORE OF CORRUPTION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhdReD6MAo)--the music is a little annoying but the totality of questions raised is astounding. the best 9/11 doc is [**THE NEW PEARL HARBOR**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMkyL_YJDUc) which is about 6 hours (if you don't want to commit 6 hours--just check out the last 2 chapters on the WTC complex which clocks in at 2 hours)      You might want to look into the Pentagon-Hollywood ties...apparently many Hollywood blockbusters work hand-in-hand with the Pentagon Propaganda Department (which demands rewrites of the scripts in exchange for access to military equipment or MONEY).   As for Ebert--I grew up in Chicago being exposed to his non-stop overrating of Hollywood 1-star Blockbusters.    Former NSA Insiders Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) wrote an open letter to POTUS in January, 2014...  ------------------  Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/  "The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...  ...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....  ...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.  Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...  ...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.  When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."  -------------   Former NSA Insiders Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) wrote an open letter to the President in January, 2014...  ------------------  Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/  "The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA.

You can read up on the CIA at r/TSBD--I highly recommend the 2007 Non-Fiction Book of the Year *LEGACY OF ASHES: THE HISTORY OF THE CIA* by Tim Weiner. It's very well-written with short 10-15 page chapters--lots of eye-popping quotes as well.  EDIT: hmmm...seems like there is something the gatekeepers don't want people to know      The CIA at this point has been proven to have:   + Tortured (some even died as a result)   + Obstructed investigations (the CIA destroyed about 90 videotapes while involved in a U.S. court case, the 9/11 Commission also wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* stating their investigation was obstructed by the White House and CIA) http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/  + Spied on U.S. citizens on U.S. soil--including U.S. senators (last year the CIA was caught lying about spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during their investigation into CIA torture) http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/07/31/234997/cia-staffers-accessed-senate.html  + Imported drugs to the U.S. (Iran-Contra)  + Money Laundering (BCCI)  -------------  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act  The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]  ---------------    most likely they haven't even gotten a formal apology...yet the Vietnamese are still considering allowing the U.S. to build military bases there...the Philippines are, too.   DIA=Defense Intelligence Agency  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency  John Judge said it has "10 times more man power and 100 times the budget of the CIA."         The Pentagon also has NO RESTRICTIONS on directing propaganda towards a U.S. audience now. Michael Hastings said the DoD has 27,000 people working on Public Relations under a $4.5 Billion yearly budget. Hastings also revealed the military has directed Psy Ops which targeted U.S. senators in order to effect the budget.  -----------   [**"Another Runaway General: Army Deploys Psy-Ops on U.S. Senators**"](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/another-runaway-general-army-deploys-psy-ops-on-u-s-senators-20110223#ixzz3dRYyXiyl)   The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in "psychological operations" to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned  and when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.  ------------      ----------  "It is the function of the CIA to keep the world unstable, and to propagandize and teach the American people to hate and fear, so we will let the Establishment spend any amount of money on arms.  --John Stockwell, former CIA Operations Officer  -------------               Took place 18 months ago...CPD still investigating--what the fuck is there to investigate?

Now the corporations are writing all the laws--they literally write them and give them over to senators/representatives. Chris Hedges says it has been a "slow motion corporate coup d'etat". This is a long interview he did on C-Span...worth the watch --he covers corporatocracy, the death of journalism, the inequality of the "common man"   http://www.c-span.org/video/?303072-1/depth-chris-hedges   Ike said he left his successor a Legacy of Ashes--then JFK (his successor) was assassinated 2 years later. RFK, Jr. recently said he thinks "rogue elements" of the CIA killed JFK.   JFK inherited The Bay of Pigs operations and CIA Director Allen Dulles when he entered office--Dulles would be fired by JFK after it fell apart.       AWESOME...Back in the days when a loft was a LOFT...and 12 year-old could buy a pack of smokes for 75 cents!!!   Can't believe no one watched this--apparently the Ugly known unknown is too dark a path for Americans to face. I was surprised when I heard Errol Morris was doing this doc; but then Rumsfeld is such a close clone of Robert McNamara its quite scary--so the film was basically a Part II to *Fog of War*.   I think Errol Morris is a talented film maker but is extremely misguided in allowing the two War Criminals such a soft, dreamy setting to say their Final Peace. McNamara liked to play with numbers, Rumsfeld tittillates himself with words--but they both enriched themselves by waging war against countries which never threatened U.S. mainland soil.   Errol Morris dedicating the film to Roger Ebert, who pushed Hollywood escapism (American propaganda) onto Americans for decades, was a fitting ending.   Ike certainly had some fine moments--but it wasn't all rosy in the White House...This is from one of my favorite books...  -----  Jan. 5, 1961: At the last, Dwight Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration. "The structure of our intelligence organization is faulty," he told Allen Dulles. It makes no sense, it has to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed since Pearl Harbor. "I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this," said the President of the United States. He said he would "leave a legacy of ashes" to his successor.  from *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner, page 194 (free pdf at r/TSBD)  -----------   Did he thump his bible before or after he said that?   ...or they could PROSECUTE some of these White Collar Criminals--obviously not every one of the corporations can be convicted in that manner...but out of 6,300 settlements there is a very, very low percentage of Criminal Prosecutions.  For example: If you or I committed mortgage fraud--we would be most likely be prosecuted in a criminal court and in a civil court...but if a corporation engages in systemic mortgage fraud--they just make a settlement and pay a fine 99% of the time.   If someone commits mortgage fraud--we would be PROSCUTED, pay a fine and most likely do some jail time...if a corporation and its employees engage in systemic mortgage fraud--they just pay a fine 99% of the time...  we are talking about RAMPANT CORPORATE CRIMINALITY by White Collar Criminals.   did you scroll down to AT T?   ...its a lot more than that--one settlement was for 956 million in 2011...and that's just in the USA      The corporations have no effective oversight--just because settlements are common does not make them ok. especially since these are flagrant violations of price-fixing, product misrepresentation, mortgage fraud, etc.  The U.S. is facing extreme turbulence from the rampant corporatism--this has spread to the to the Wars for Profit which we are now entrenched in. The corporate media will print anything the Pentagon or POTUS spits out (only rarely bothering to actually investigate...often the original story will be false, but the effect of the original false story will have achieved its objective).   That would be 6,300+ settlements with corporations which the USG has made--with NO PROSECUTION...no one goes to jail from FRAUD (etc.)...

At least that I could find, because the lack of any decent list is what made me start compiling this list in the first place.          What struck me was the sheer number of corporate violations of laws and regulationsthousands upon thousands, the vast majority of which occurred since corporate profits began their incredible ascent in the early 2000sand the list of those paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements, which reads like a whos who of Corporate America and Top 100 Global Corporations.

I have also begun to see the NYT, WaPo, cbs (etc.) as basically "State Sponsored" and recently mentioned on r/theInside that the MSM links should be immediately labeled as such (flair added). They liked the idea--but it hasn't gone into action yet (hopefully they will implement it soon--not sure).      pretty sure that the Germans said they received some gold back...   (from wiki)  The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]      This documentary asks [**The Secret World of Gold**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfVQ8WvkIiQ) asks an expert if he thinks all the gold is there...(appx. 37 minutes in)  The doc also alleges that the Bank of England "rented" some of their gold to Switzerland which then melted the gold down and SOLD IT to be used in jewelry. This opens the possibility that the US confiscated every citizen's gold in 1933--then turned around and "rented" the gold so the SERFS could buy their own gold back in the form of expensive jewelry.   WHY trust the U.S. military--which has LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED and LIED...???      I posted up one of Robert Parry's articles on Iran-Contra in r/politics one time--just as you said the user comments by claiming its a loony conspiracy, then the user bashed consortium.com (even though Robert Parry worked for the *AP*)...I'm just glad that we are finally seeing quite a few journalists walking from the MSM--but still, as Chossudovsky said: "WE NEED TO BE WAGING WAR AGAINST THE MSM"  Otherwise, the masses will just continue consuming--and the U.S. will continue with the Endless Wars for Profit.

Without the Main Stream Media and war propaganda this New World Order agenda doesn't have a leg to stand on. In other words, without these media lies the military agenda, the economic agenda would collapse like a deck of cards. And that is why it is absolutely fundamental that--within the realm of independent media and alternative media--**we wage a war against the main stream media**."  --[Michel Chossudovsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtLABW149Ss) (appx. 18min 20sec...emphasis mine)  ------------------   Makes me think of when I was young and ABC news decided to begin a late-night news program: *NIGHTLINE*. The purpose was to update Americans on the U.S. Hostage Situation in Iran. Every day the news media counted off how many days the situation had gone on: DAY 100...DAY 200...DAY 300...DAY 400...the number was on the Front Page of the newspaper and included in every newscast--the nation was at a fever pitch.  But NOT ONCE do I remember any newspaper or news program mentioning that the Hostage Situation was BLOWBACK for what the U.S. did in 1953 when the CIA helped to Overthrow Iran's government.  I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't used as a template for study within the Pentagon-CIA...How easy it is to get an entire nation to HATE.   We know the Pentagon-CIA work with Hollywood and the "news" media--what if CNN and Fox "news" were actually created *from the very beginning* with input from the CIA-Pentagon? If they do it with movies--why not extend the reach and do it with cable news?      RACKETEER: n.

They can have their opinions but must keep quiet. Once in a while they might let it slide, but not during the Finals...and not on the subject of 9/11 being an inside job.   There is no record of what was said--pretty sure the Commissioners were forbidden from taking notes (and there was definitely no transcipt taken). I don't think the public was even allowed to know how long the meeting was...Another question to ask: WHY was this video taken down by C-Span? (try going to the C-Span site and searching for the video...it is only still viewable because Jon Gold put it up on youtube)  At least the press conference had a Perfect Ending with the sound of sirens in the background: Police State USA.      The Pentagon spends BILLIONS per year on marketing...think this changes the coverage by the NYT, cnn, cbs, abc, nbc, fox?   I refuse to go on their site--if anyone finds anything interesting please copy + post   ------------  Bremer and 1,700 of the employees of Marsh   McLennan had offices in the World Trade Center. Bremer's office was in the North Tower. In an interview with CNN after the September 11 attacks, he stated that their office was located "above where the second aircraft hit".[5]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer  --------------- *note: linked to interview is NOT the cnn interview referred to in wiki.      Actually, the $40 million which the SSCI funded went entirely to CIA-approved attorneys--so they could splice, dice and redact the 6,400 page Torture Report down to 400 pages (which We, the Serfs could read).   On the other hand, the 9/11 Commission had offices in a CIA managed building with a staff of 84 people which included attorneys and basic office staff. The 9/11 Commission was also placed under a strict time frame of 16 months--while the Torture Report Re-Write Team was given 4 years to complete the editing of a report which was already finished. (note: the 9/11 Commission was eventually given another $10 million and paid no rent for the office space in the CIA-managed building...cough cough)  With last year's revelation of the SSCI being spied upon by the CIA--I wonder if the CIA also spied on the 9/11 Commission. We do know, from an editorial the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote to the *New York Times*, that they accused the CIA and the White House of [**OBSTRUCTING THE INVESTIGATION**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/)   NSFW photos of torture victims   If you re-watch the video you might pick up on a few things they say: "we're just a few hours into this"..."the president in his first remarks earlier today" etc...the video with "earlier" labeled...  No apparent "voice-overs" or apparent splices in the video that I've noticed. Unlike many youtube videos, this copy seems to be very high quality...you might be able to do a search for news transcripts   plug in the baltimore station, the date and L.

Paul Bremer had an office in one of the WTC towers--yet did NOT even mention that (or his co-workers) in this interview. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer   It's one of the best documentaries on 9/11...just saying if you don't feel like committing to a 6+ hour doc--start with the last 2 chapters.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ca1HsC6MH0   Try Chapters 6   7 of [*A NEW PEARL HARBOR*](http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle artid=167) on for size...

He had just finished meeting with the 9/11 Commission--but GWB wouldn't agree to do so IN PUBLIC or ON THE RECORD...Notice GWB stammers at the very beginning because he Can't say he "testified" (because he wasn't under oath)...  For years all us Americans heard from the White House was [**"9/11"..."9/11"..."9/11"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMkyL_YJDUc)...but GWB couldn't even answer more than 5 questions to the press after meeting up with the 9/11 Commission? GWB even had to bring along Dick Cheney (and a slew of attorneys) to the meeting to hold his hand...  appropriately enough, the press conference ends with the sounds of sirens in the background--Police State USA.

Paul Bremer on Baltimore's local nbc affiliate on 9/11...is this scripted?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2pW6WZhZrQ  Dick Cheney comments on Iraq 1994: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EstVJo6URdQ  Gen. Wesley Clark: Wars were Planned--7 countries in 5 years...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw         Some people will do *anything* for money.  Still nothing compared to CIA attorneys rationalizing TORTURE and DoD attorneys rationalizing the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam.   Most likely used kitty litter in place of a much more expensive product, thereby swindling more money out of the USG.   No one at NSA charged with any crime.   The End.  -----------  visit [cryptome.org](http://cryptome.org/) for list of Snowden releases.   AWESOME.     Yes, unfortunately, every President is now SANITIZED with gratuitous praise--then they enshrine themselves with these bullshit multi-million dollar *Presidential Libraries*. The politicians and the government agencies are being allowed to Cover-Up their tracks with Excessive Secrecy--the actual Reality of what happened no longer matters--it is the Myth that will live on.   LBJ was sometimes called "The Senator from the Pentagon" but the history books will erase that and paint LBJ as a President who stood-in and led the nation in our time of need. In the future, if the actual Truth ever does get printed--the masses won't be able to comprehend the divide between the Official Story from those which actually took place.    Often, the proof of U.S.-CIA Fuckery only comes out years later...there is a list of known, documented U.S. overthrows which author William Blum put together in an appendix of his book a few years ago...(you can see a pdf of one of his books at r/TSBD)  http://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list   Plenty of evidence of extreme heat:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IILdExWN9lw  PYROCLASTIC FLOW WTC 7:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO_Tz3FhkMo         Evidence of [PYROCLASTIC FLOWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmBXvq4fA_c).   L. Paul Bremer on NYC local nbc newscast on 9/11. (scripted?)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2pW6WZhZrQ   the comments would have been even worse if the nazi mods at imgur hadn't "pulled it" from the Current Events category. I couldn't believe one commenter "hoped I'd be added to a list"...how American: guy says something I don't like--let's have him spied on!   The towers didn't fucking Fall--they were blown to fucking smithereens. Dust.   Yes, r/worldnews readers--you are being conned. Besides the obvious outright censorship of websites and subject matter, the larger subs also partake in SWITCHING OFF THE COUNTER for articles which they don't like. Supposedly this is just a natural function of reddit to keep the articles circulating and not sit atop the front page too long.  A post I made yesterday ([an Italian article which interviewed Vladimir Putin](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3907i8/vladimir_putin_i_invite_you_to_publish_a_world/)) made me realize this was going on--once it got to the Top Spot, the counter was turned off--no more up votes calculated. The counter on my post went off at 4800 votes or so...odd, right now there are two posts on the worldnews front page with over 5600 votes...  Most people would never notice this--just thought I'd fill you in...   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Deceit  basically the author (a WWII Navy Veteran) came across records in the National Archives--wrote a book which showed the U.S. had foreknowledge of the Pearl harbor attack...then some of the records went missing from the National Archives (others were obtained thru the FOIA).  Interesting that NeoCon Philip Zelikow argues against Stinnett's research (included on the wiki page).  Here's a lecture by the author Robert Stinnett: http://www.c-span.org/video/?157339-1/book-discussion-day-deceit-truth-fdr-pearl-harbor      The amount of information--which Americans turn their noses up at--is startling:  + [James Steele](http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/mar/06/james-steele-america-iraq-video) training Iraqi death and torture squads in Iraq--how many of these guys ended up in ISIS?  + The widespread use of torture and degrading treatment by the U.S. military, the CIA and their contractors  + The gigantic amount of money unaccounted for by the Pentagon--estimated at [$8.5 Trillion](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)       Either over the winter or last fall, the U.S. media all started chirping the same story about Venezuela being a threat to the U.S.--which was laughable, so I posted the annual military budgets for each...but, YES, the U.S. thru the CIA and its Economic Hit Men have certainly manipulated and taken advantage of the countries in Central and South America.   Now imagine Venezuela's problem but 1,000 times bigger--that's what we have in the U.S.--our politicians are bought by corporations, our laws are made by corporations and our wars are planned by WAR, INC.   100% political--if the fucking scum in DC really cared about corruption they'd be going after bankers, but, NO--they make BILLION dollar settlements with them...   That's a FALSE STATEMENT...Quit Lying.   ae911truth.org should have some flyers with basic info...   "When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book."  --Philip Agee quote from *INSIDE THE COMPANY: A CIA DIARY*  (free pdf at r/TSBD)   The only one I've read is *Deep Politics and the Death of JFK*...great read--can't wait to get *The American Deep State*.   nice introduction here by a fellow author...special guest appearance by Daniel Ellsberg...   The U.S. has tried to overthrow Venezuela for quite a long time--could this fraud be just one more reason for the recent amping-up of the vilification of Venezuela? To be clear: I'm sure there most likely is drug dealing and corruption in Venezuela--but if Venezuela cut-off this Energy deal and threatened to expose the fraud, perhaps it has to do with the recent U.S. allegations?   To be clear: The ads were Not allowed...but the bulk mailing was?      US: 800+ (some go as high as 1100+)  Russia: 18      it's the original link to the image--which is on the sidebar.

"off-topic" in r/politics (lasted longer than I thought)...holy sh#t--5,000+ comments in r/worldnews...  EDIT: apparently the mods have FROZEN the counter--it was at 4752 an hour ago...went up above 4800--then in just 3 minutes fell back to 4752...has on moved to 4754 in last hour...think they want the Snowden story to bump it out of top spot.currently over 7500+ comments--most of them 1 liners.   Good point--the Cabal could use it to send a message though--in which case I would expect something *sooner* rather than later.  As for Horseface John--it seems a little under the radar considering he's the SoS.   hmmm...I wonder how long before the mods of r/worldnews and r/politics take this post down.               I agree--either a plane will go down...or, more likely, he'll get the Michael Hastings treatment.   I actually liked this film--hadn't seen it in a long time....I guess there's a new low-budget 9/11 movie coming out: OPERATION TERROR.   I noticed I couldn't find Paperclip docs which were on an archive site (which had gwu in the address)--figured it might just be google fucking up search results...  gives more for the USG to blame on the Chinese...   this is DISINFO...martin bormann was about 20 years younger than that POS ghw bush. bormann was in WWI--he was in the back working as a clerk for an officer. ghw bush was in WWII--served time in the pacific as an airman (he was supposedly "the youngest pilot").         FYI: The Corporate Media receives quite a bit of money from the DoD; therefore thay are Pentagon Bootlickers--which mainly suggests they are incapable of investigating or criticizing the DoD. The goal is to deceive the American public (mission accomplished).  And, YES, reddit--thru their nazi adminstrators and mods--are signed and sealed Pentagon Bootlickers as well.   I was being sarcastic...a nation of 250 million beating up on a nation of 91,000.

McCoy...very, very DARK.   We the People would never know...      when you pay think tank consultants billions upon billions of dollars year after year--they will feed LIES that confirm what the DoD wants to hear...   I would say it's much more a product of megalomania--Hitler and Stalin would have loved to have this ability.   $47K to save a multi-billion dollar program which would allow the DIA to track EVERYONE on the planet...well worth the cover-up expenses (from the DIA point of view).         My latest theory is that OPERATION DARKHEART (which tracked Al Qaeda cells via open source communications--and located at least 4 of the hijackers in the USA at least 1 year prior to 9/11) was not intended to catch hijackers...OPERATION DARKHEART was intended as a TRIAL--it was research by the DIA for a project which would go into effect after 9/11 once the funding was provided. The DIA didn't want Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer to inform Congressional investigators because they didn't want the investigators digging deeper into the project and asking what the project was designed to do.   or getting SET UP on bumpkus charges...   Dirty Cops...The thousands of obscurities surrounding 9/11...The illegal, useless wars for profit...Depleted Uranium...The $8.5 Trillion fraud at the Pentagon...CIA-US military (and their contractors) Systemic Torture of prisoners...US spying on its own citizens--both in an En Masse manner and on those expressing Dissent...The for-profit prison system in the USA...The complicit Corporate Press which simply regurgitates the US government's positions--without any On the Record sources or verifiable evidence...  I could go on and on...The question at this point is: will TRUTH, REALITY and JUSTICE ever meet again? Or will society keep growing farther apart?         [**HAPPY 81st BIRTHDAY, BILL**](http://imgur.com/gallery/5vxh8im)   Pretty sure I've seen at least 3 other US stations doing so as well--cbs, cnn and a local NY station.

    When the paper is live, it'll be here: http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-119242,descCd-release_additional_material.html      Here's a link to the paper...but it's entirely behind a paywall (even the abstract...)  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/recent      *Her.    You don't know how to read. Let me help: The scientists ran an in-depth statistical analysis to find out whether pesticides, human land use or other factors may have contributed to declining bumblebee populations over the past century. And the answer is clearly nowe checked this carefully, Pindar says. They are impacted by climate change and these effects are already very large and widespread.  That's a quote in this article, from the lead author on the new study, published in the most prestigious scientific journal in the world. They confirmed through statistical analyses that climate change and NOT pesticides or land use were to blame.     u/mesopotamiae: not the bee keeper we deserve, but the beekeeper we need right now.    yeah...not according to the *real* scientists (nice try, though)   Monsanto isn't a vague boogie monster?   Indeed. The study was literally published in the top scientific journal in the world (give or take "Nature" journals).   Bumblebee drones don't have feelings anyway. Also, drones.          Bumblebees are clearly liberals, looking for excuses to tax the rich.              	19

Somehow I got charged two days early for a $15 recurring payment.  So I am currently at a $-15 account balance.  Last night I had to go to the ER at 3 am due to severe back and ovary pain.  I then had to go back to the hospital to get an ultrasound.  My husband and I both get paid tomorrow. We have no gas, no cigarettes, and no food until grocery shopping tomorrow.  My pain medication is wearing off and I have to wait two days to get my test results. Tomorrow I have to go to work because I already missed half a day this week and half a day last week because of constant sharp back pain.

             If you think a job that requires 18 months continuous training and assessment is semi-skilled then I don't know what to tell you. A bachelor's degree is only 12 months full time over three years.   Basic is around 42k most drivers are required to work rest days and many find themselves working 6 or 7 day weeks - the best paid drivers earn as much as 60k but work insane overtime to achieve that kind of take home.    This is three unions rather than just the RMT, and two of those unions haven't attempted strike action in a decade.  While I don't think the RMT behave reasonably and frequently seem tone deaf in approaching strike action, having worked inside the underground system designing software for them, the tube unions have a *very* real point about pay and conditions. NHS staff, particularly the nurses, could learn a great deal from their approach to collective bargaining.  The figures bandied around for what tube drivers earn are mostly nonsense and far from the average wage. Conditions have reached a point where drivers are having to limit their fluid intake because they can't easily use the toilet. Some of what goes on down there beggars belief.  It's also worth pointing out that the RMT's successful bargaining means they're the only group of labourers in the country whose wages have kept pace with inflation decadally - it's not that the drivers are overpaid, it's that everyone else is underpaid.   You'd be better to go to Clapham Junction and change at East Croydon - you'll have more/faster train options that way - its about 40 mins from CJ and is pretty reliable.         The austerity certainly isn't helping but the Greek economy was a mess to begin with - restrictive trade practices via closed/capped licensing in more than 70 professions, tax dodging was and remains a national pass-time, public sector non-jobs all over the place.  While I agree with you on austerity all the arguments made against the euro were made against the dollar when it became a 'new' thing, and despite endless predictions of doom the Euro has thrived for the most part. If you live in central Europe, as I have, it makes a great deal more sense than the old system.   Interesting. There seemed to be a great deal of hope that he was the man to sort the mess out.  I don't think there is any doubt that that Greece failed to reform its economy over the last 20 years, but it does appear that the Greek people have gotten an exceptionally raw deal from the eurozone since.   Any clue what he did that was so poisonous?  By all accounts he's a very well respected economist.         Management can usually scare up enough people to run a skeleton service but more lines are affected this time and this suggests that they expect the strike to be well observed   You should be able to get the number [11 bus](https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/route/11/).   Those catch fences are incredibly tough!   Do you know if the other overground train services are affected as well? e.g. Southern, Thameslink etc.   My birthday too. Fortunately my plans are near Waterloo assuming the overground trains are unaffected (big assumption).   The ASLEF, RMT, Unite and TSSA unions are currently planning strike action, affecting London Underground.   If the strike goes ahead, there will be no Tube service from late afternoon on Wednesday 8 July and no Tube service at all on Thursday 9 July.   [TfL's strikes page is here](http://info.tfl.gov.uk/re?l=D0I9xw8kdI2vce318If)         Not much prorating required here - Hamilton has only 157 race starts - even Schumacher couldn't beat Stewart's record in 307 starts and several equally dominant cars (also notable that Stewart had several dominant cars too).         You just have to lead one lap. Career laps led is a separate statistic.   He was an elected Conservative first and was vocally opposed to the turn of the century Liberal government. All that changed over trade policy.  Besides which the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservatives rather than the other way around.    No. He still the led the race when Rosberg was in the pits.  I feel compelled to point out that Hamilton dragged Rosberg off the line four or five times last season.   They should be pleased with themselves they really deserve it.  Also the first time I feel like I've seen something of Bottas's true potential on the track.      It's been 12 years since they were regular contenders for wins (obviously Maldonado won in 2012 but that was an outlier result), the team need to build experience and sim data to help them make such calls well - thats just going to take time.   This result is great news, beat the Ferrari's in qualifying and overtook Merc of the line - so happy to see Williams back where they belong!   Actually I've been watching F1 for nearly 40 years, and you apparently don't know a great deal about how teams, aero and engine manufacturers work together or what the possibilities are from that cooperation. None of those diffusers would have worked without Renault's design efforts - not one.  Mercedes did a fantastic job getting their engine into a chassis designed for Honda's PU, but Brawn said at the time that they picked Mercedes as a supplier because it was the engine that 'best fitted' the chassis they had.  Sure Renault find themselves in a bad situation, no worse than any in the history of the sport, but still very bad. But it's not 100% their fault. They don't appear to have a partner they can work together with to solve the *team's* problems.   As a British fan that start was the best thing I've seen in years. Brilliant race too - everything you could possibly want!   Everytime I see the replay from his perspective I wonder if Rosberg was too focused on Hamilton - it does appear he could have closed the door on the Williams.    Oh god, the usual quote-back/you're stupid nonsense from the Kiptard contingent. *sigh*. Called stupid in less than three comments FFS - I wish I was surprised.  - We're not talking about the Tories and criticism of one party's policy isn't an automatic comparison with or acceptance of any other party's policy.  - UKIP say they want to *increase* defense spending to 2% of GDP, but our existing spending is 2.1% of GDP down from 2.4% in 2010. They also want to go back to 2010 troop levels and capability whilst replacing trident and spending around 400 million on a dedicated military hospital. Usual inconsistency from UKIP but this all adds up to a *huge* increase in defense oriented spending.  - Yes they do favor harsh restrictions on immigrants and their policy actually is a disincentive to the free-trade policy they advocate elsewhere. Read the manifesto and think through the effect of their policy. If, for example, a senior member of a US company wanted to move here they would be dragged through a points based system (this takes 12 - 18 months right now and costs 3 - 5k) and so would their family members wishing to join them - each family member would have to pass the same system as the policy is presently written.  - They want to leave the the world's largest free trade bloc (the EU) in order to make free-trade agreements with every other country independently. However there are only 25 countries globally not in trading blocs and our interfaces with those trading blocs are all through the EU. They advocate no other forms of international cooperation other than trade and specifically wish to favor the 'Anglosphere' when trading.  In short Kiptard's specialise in ignorant one dimensional thinking and wish you guys would read the big book political theories before vomiting your crap online.   Absolutely true - I should have made that clearer.   I think they'd like to claim they're libertarians and there are certainly elements of libertarian policy in their dicta, but they're as fundamentally Statist of a group as I can think of having read the manifesto - they're certainly not a party of small government given the sheer volume of rules they wish to impose.  They want huge increase in defence spending, their base favors harsh policing and criminal justice policies, harsh restrictions on immigrants and they anti-international co-operation on anything but trade and even then they'd like it all their own way - all authoritarian values.     Thats a matter of your perception (and theirs). By *pure* policy position UKIP are a right wing party with authoritarian social and economic values.      Ha! Some of it, some I culled from a similar discussion I was having yesterday on the same point.   When you look at enacted policy across the political spectrum in this country you realise that all governments are centre right, and there is an obvious decadal rightward drift among all parties - inertia meaning that the further right UKIP drift, the further right *all* parties drift.   By enacted policy there isn't a credible centrist party in the UK, nor is there a credible left wing party, although there are parties that have left wing members and some elements of traditional left wing ideas - all parties are centre right. How individuals view their party alignments appears to me to be a function of where they think the centre is more than any other factor.  That drift is most obvious in the US right now (although UKIP's effect on all party's policy demonstrates the same effect). Obama is basically a Reagan era moderate Republican with liberal personal social values, and the Republicans have gone so far to the right that they sound like a fringe party on almost any subject. Trump's candidacy being the zenith of that drift.  Churchill for example had this to say on the NHS:-  The discoveries of healing science must be the inheritance of all. That is clear: Disease must be attacked,  whether it occurs in the poorest or the richest man or woman simply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the same way as the fire brigade will give its  full assistance to the humblest cottage as readily as to the  most important mansion.Our policy is to create a national health service in order to ensure that everybody in the country, irrespective of means, age, sex, or occupation, shall have equal opportunities to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.  No modern Conservative would recognise the post war Conservative party's policy positions as being truly Conservative outside of their views on personal social policy i.e. homosexuality and marrige.   Friedman assumed that 'people' would all, or at least mostly, be shareholders in the corporations and there would therefore be social pressure on these organisations to act toward the benefit of the communities they were part of as well as financial benefit for everyone.  That hasn't happened. Major corporations are owned, in the main, by other corporations, institutions, and private investment companies - and therefore act only in the interests of increasing financial reward at all costs. Meaning, sadly, those corporations have no social value at all.  If there is a single problem in the capitalist system we now live in it's shareholder value versus social value - there is too much of the former and not enough of the latter.      They do, its a shame they get no credit for their efforts.   He made a heroic effort to be part of the 2015 election campaign. I had hoped he was making a recovery, but I guess this news suggests otherwise.   I suspected as much. Sad really.   Its interesting that both Cameron and Boris got their press secretaries from the BBC, yet continually claim the organisation is biased against them.  The election night broadcast was allegedly biased against the Tories  despite being led by the Bullingdon club alumni Dimbleby and equally famous Tory Andrew Neil.  Bias obviously means something else to the Tories.          5 championships, 6 conference titles, 20 division titles and someone who is generally held to be one of the best coaches in the game, being the longest tenured and most successful active coach in both the NBA and all US major sports leagues.   A small speaker gently but audibly playing classical music deters a surprising amount of people. But:-  - Find out where your local [Ward Panel](http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Getting-Involved/1400006229542/1400006229542) meets and go to the meeting and complain loudly, make certain at the end of the meeting they set reducing ASB and street drinking as a [panel promise/priority (this is the main goal)](http://safer-london.info/22.html). Talk to the sergeant after the meeting about what steps can be taken.  - Call your local councillors, get a meeting with them and your neighbourhood policing team to discuss what action can be taken. Bring neighbours along, show that the problem is affecting many people.  - Ensure you call 101 *every* time this happens. The response will be useless but if the neighbourhood team don't have the reports coming from CAD they won't be allowed the resources to deal with the problem.  - If all else fails find out the borough commander's name and email firstname.surname@met.pnn.police.uk with your complaint. Explain what steps you've taken, how many reports you've made, and include photos.   That's not true at all. Renault deserve enormous credit for innovations like RBR's many diffusers - which rely on Renault engineers and installers to make them work on the car.  F1 is a team sport, the chassis does not work without the engine and you can't bugger about with the movement of exhaust gases at the back of the car in any way without tremendous work from your engine and fuel suppliers.  This isn't the middle school playground and the amount of crass, uninformed bitching going on these days is ruining many of the discussions on this sub.  The early part of every engine era is marked by these kind of problems - this is how we advance our understanding of technologies and create innovative leaps.    He also just lost his poles record place to Hamilton, so it can't have been a very good day for him given how much he loves the stats.   That's my struggle with the line up of candidates at the moment, I'm just not convinced by any of them - the whole contest surrounds what wing of the party is behind which candidate. Its more about our coalition's differences than any clear view of which direction the country needs to go in.  Corbyn has been allegedly thrown in for the sake of debate, but what debate? It's like watching four of the seven dwarves talk to each other.   Outside of the service charge yes, per unit that might be true, but they're omitting the service charge.   When you look at enacted policy across the political spectrum in this country you realise that all governments are centre right, and there is an obvious decadal rightward drift - inertia meaning that the further right UKIP drift, the further right *all* parties drift. There isn't a credible centrist party in the UK, nor is there a credible left wing party, although there are parties that have left wing members and some elements of traditional left wing ideas. How individuals view their party alignments appears to me to be a function of where they think the centre is more than any other factor.  That drift is most obvious in the US right now. Obama is basically a Reagan era moderate Republican with more liberal personal social values, and the Republicans have gone so far to the right that they sound like a fringe party on almost any subject. Trump's candidacy being the zenith of that drift.  Churchill for example had this to say on the NHS:-  The discoveries of healing science must be the inheritance of all. That is clear: Disease must be attacked,  whether it occurs in the poorest or the richest man or woman simply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the sane way as the fire brigade will give its  full assistance to the humblest cottage as readily as to the  most important mansion.Our policy is to create a national health service in order to ensure that everybody in the country, irrespective of means, age, sex, or occupation, shall have equal opportunities to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.  No modern Conservative would recognise the post war Conservative party's policy positions as being truly Conservative outside of their views on personal social policy.  So is this era about personal values or the ability of a given set of people to communicate policy ideas and values and is left/right even useful anymore?   Are our politicians simply selling think tank's ideas with the right messages given their respective bases?   During the last European election campaign Blair did a spot on Radio 4. He summed up in two sentences why Europe was important and why we should stay in it - something no other politician achieved.  Anyone listening realised immediately that there wasn't a politician in any party even half as good as Blair was and is.  We will only win if we find someone with his clarity and communication skills - I don't see anyone in the leadership election with a tenth of his potential at the same stage.   Ted K and everyone else are reporting the same thing. Alonso has a leak and they can't fix it. Right now they're sticking the floor back on, crossing their fingers, and hoping the car survives a lap.   How is it sensationalistic to report news?   The big problem for me wasn't so much the part, it was the fact that the bumper, grill, and about half a dozen other bits needed to come off to get to the light clusters. I just didn't have the space to do it or the tools to align them properly.   You understand that it's Andrew Benson's job to do this during race weekends right?   Good work there. eBay's a great source for parts - I wished I could have found a set of headlights on there.      They do, that's true, but having re-designed the billing system for one of the major suppliers in the last few years I have little sympathy for them - electronic systems in the industry are a disaster as is the underlying infrastructure and that's simply down to underinvestment and lack of will on the part of the government and the industry.   IMO what they're really doing is using the charge to cover debt losses for the poorest consumers.   The whole PAYG energy situation is the definition of an exploitative business practice.      They can, but as you say, in a debt situation they are locked in to a supplier. Even if you're not locked in the actual cost is irrelevant because there is a whopping 3 of every 10 charge for having a PAYG meter in the first place and the companies charge sky high unit prices no matter which one you go with.                              Quite amazing that this 'Journalist' hasn't noticed that a phalanx of middle eastern nations already are fighting ISIS with their own troops.  They fought Al Qaeda too.      Lotus is a licenced brand I doubt Renault would pay for it unless the cost of a name change is too high. So this would be goodbye Lotus v2   Basically yes i do think no one would watch, because it's all out there on youtube.   When it comes to cars the actual cost of the part matters very little.  Knowing, for example, that I can obtain a 3rd party part for n amount doesn't mean that I know, or can find out, the cost of the manufacturer part and it doesn't tell me the price range vs quality of third party parts.   It also doesn't allow me determine the amount of labour required. The part on the car may be seized or corroded - it may take time to get *to* the part that needs to be replaced.  The cost of a head gasket won't tell you how long it takes to rebuild the engine.   People in short. The reason Top Gear v1 ended the way it did was that there was no longer a real need for a consumer motoring show.  The 'old' Top Gear team went on to produce 5th Gear and their viewing number are also reflective of the lack of market for such a show.   I think its just a reflection of a strategic choice on Renault's part.    Ken's Venezuelan oil  The difference is that Ken was attempting to keep the cost of transport for the public down.   Boris is attempting to turn the Fire Brigade into a profit centre, and while those a different approaches to the same goal, historically such efforts in the NHS have led to a drop in operational standards.   I think in the background of all of this they were attempting a political takeover of the sport through breaking up FOTA and looking towards a commercial rights buyout - but they lost the battle over the regs and were outmaneuvered by Mercedes politically as well as outperformed on the track.   CVC was an odd partner choice at the time but my guess is this was Bernie outmaneuvering a RBR aligned buyer. Its interesting that a company led by the man who sued Bernie for bribery is now in the frame to buy the commercial rights, along with a Quatari company with links to RBR.  This is why RBR have chucked their toys out of the pram, they lost the battles and lost the war. Now they're stuck with Renault because they don't want a 'B' Ferrari engine, can't have a Mercedes one, can't get an 'A' spec Honda engine (Ron Dennis isn't stupid), and don't have any other options.  But they have overplayed their hand again and pissed Renault off. Now they have no remaining options.   The debate always takes place at the extremes of what you can get in certain circumstances and adds universal benefits like child benefit to the total to make an argument, but very few people get that kind of money.   I have friends who have to find an additional 55 a week on top of their housing benefit to pay the rent, but only get 53 a week spending money. In effect the government is running people into arrears to reduce the deficit and using a moral approach to the argument rather than a pragmatic one. The basic theory is that people on benefits don't want to work - but that isn't true in the majority of cases, even if it is true for some.   Given the apparent extent of the relationship breakdown I think it does. Renault didn't get enough credit from the WDC's, RBR appear to be not only dumping on Renault (only some of which is deserved) but also actively pursuing other engine manufacturers.   I imagine Renault have asked themselves if RBR are a reliable partner going forward and concluded they're not.   We bought a new fridge recently. In every shop we went to the assistants talked to my partner about features and turned to me to talk about money and delivery. Its the level of sexist assumption that bothers me.   Absolutely.   Given the extent of the work the garages needed the car to be left there overnight.   I could have done the job but no one had the right lamp housings on eBay, none of the home fixes for fogging worked, and the space I had to work with was simply too cramped to get the bumper off the car or fix the alignment issues, added to which the car needed a lot of other work so, having found a reasonable price, it made sense to get it done elsewhere.   It was. I got the car for a song and the engine, bodywork and interior are perfect - it's a much better car than I could have afforded otherwise - so I didn't spend more than the car was worth in the end, but we only found out at MOT how badly off the suspension was.   The only thing that really pissed me off was that because of an unnoticed leaking valve and my partner getting a wheel over a kerb at speed and damaging a sidewall we also needed three new tyres.   The reason they're in F1 is marketing - they've said this - the deal with RBR is not getting them helpful exposure and the way RBR has behaved has not helped Renault one iota.  Essentially they're saying the money is irrelevant compared to the marketing value of the sport, they want to be involved in the sport, but need to have greater exposure and be in control of their own press.  Mercedes successful involvement along with the recovery from global recession has changed the maths for manufacturers, as has the sport making entries into new countries the world over and taking the US seriously at last.   New car to us, but actually 10 year old Passat Highline. The front of the headlight casings had fogged completely, but no new bulbs were needed as the ones in it were brand new high intensity bulbs, the alignment was also badly off.   Its a complicated job to replace them as you have to take the front end off the car to get to the lamp housings otherwise I'd have done it myself (I did try, but conditions in my driveway are too cramped). The rest of the work was new suspension arm rubber bushes all round, osf suspension arm ball joint dust cover, nsf/osf tie rod rubber bush, pads, discs, and a brake caliper (all the brake calipers were seized) plus a new centre brake light.  I just couldn't get over the cost of two new headlamp units from the dealer.    You only have so much time to dedicate to these things, and it's not as if you can shop around on the internet, for major work the mechanics need to have the car to give you a price.   My partner and I both work full time and when our car needed work we both lost wages trying to find a reasonable price for a fix - and that was only going to two places - so we took the second quote. If the first hadn't been on its face unreasonable I would have taken that one for the simple reason that I was losing money by other means trying to sort the problem.  It's all very well to say you can shop around but who has that kind of time?   It would help if the only active consumer protection body in the country was someone other than the EU (who do a very good job). The house of commons and government essentially gave up on consumer regulation, especially of finance, 30 years ago. We've come to specialise in toothless regulatory bodies that are expensive to run and produce pathetic outcomes.   Dad passed away 13 years ago so this would have been in the 80s early 90s, engine maps barely existed.   Tuned the engines properly. Also realised that our main family car had the turbo gate stuck in inspection mode.  Top man.   One of my dad's close friends was an Aston Martin testing and development engineer (god rest the pair of them), turned our family cars into rocket ships!   I've used them a couple of times, they're certainly overpriced - 75 for a mid-range tyre compared to e-tyres who install at your home/office and will fit a premium tyre for 80. But when you need something sorted this minute they've done good quality work for me and been nice about it.   Theoretically that's exactly what Kwik Fit are supposed to be.  Whole thing is crazy though. Dealer quoted me 2.5k to repair my car a few months back, two new headlights alone were 800 (175.75 for each part plus labour). In the end I found a place that did all the work for 850 (although we had to put up with their somewhat laid back approach to paperwork) and a non-manufacturer Hella pair of headlights turned out to cost 50 each.   Red Bull really have overplayed their hand in F1 politics.    Londonist ususally has a good roundup of free/cheap/paid events http://londonist.com/weekend/things-to-do-in-london-this-weekend-4-5-july-2015   Streatham Common has a beautiful Victorian garden and woodland if you want to cool off.    Its hard to say without knowing the role specifics or skillset but a team lead / manager / senior engineer in desktop support is around 50k GBP at the top end of the market. General desktop support worker is around 25k.  50k is also where you'd come out in a straight currency conversion from $78k so I'd suggest that what you should seek.  Average income in the UK is around 24k, subsistence level income in London is around 20k so you should be comfortably off on 50k.   To give you some idea of pricing. A Zone 1 - 3 weekly travelcard (covers bus, train, tram and tube) is 37.70, a pint of beer is 4.50 - 4.80 depending on the area, chinese takeaway is around 7 - 10 per head, a Starbucks Grande Latte is 2.60 as is a Big Mac.                           Yep. Apparently thats how Monmouth University roll.   By the standards of this contest Lindsey Graham *is* a moderate!                        Stop. Really. You're just embarrassing yourself.      You just live in a fantasy world. Go back to your school and demand the education they clearly failed to provide you.  I just re-read the thread. Normally I assume that people can understand things when they're explained properly, but the brain crushing ignorance of KipTards just staggers me. You'll literally say anything, vomit out any crap, to try and pretend you have a point no matter the weight of evidence to the contrary - the stuff you've written above about the free trade areas is just... crap. Total unmitigated crap. I'm actually surprised you can operate a computer.   Kippers really are the Birthers of the UK.   I laughed out loud reading this, rarely has a Kipper managed to spout so much nonsense in one comment.  - Manufacturers want to sell one product to one set of regulations in as many places as possible, so much so that they often design around the cross regulation issues. You'll notice that many new cars have daytime running lights which allow them to be sold in scandinavian markets, and left/right headlight switches so the same vehicle can be sold in the UK and France with only software changes. Regulation codes are the single biggest problem businesses have and business spends tens of millions each year lobbying for changes.  - ONR is an operational safety body, it does not design or spec nuclear reactors and you, sir, are obviously an idiot to claim what you have here. Hinkley Point C, the first of eight UK sites, is presently being constructed. It's two *European* Pressurised Reactors are being built to a French Design which has become an EU standard by two French companies. EDF, one of those companies, will own the land and the plant along with the output (we are of course subsiding the build). This makes sense since they bought British Energy lock stock and barrel in 2009 and basically now own our entire nuclear industry. If we leave the EU this will prove highly problematic because their business runs to EU standards and is regulated by the EU, not us. Same situation in rail, water, fossil energy, parts of the oil industry, and Alliance Boots (our largest Pharmacy network) is also wholly European owned.  - I've worked for SWIFT, you simply don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about there. I assumes from the crap you've vomited that you simply read wiki. Iran isn't even the only country barred from the network.  - ISO manage the standards that US and now UK plugs are built to, because NEMA and BS have harmonised their standards through ISO. The UK is a voting member of ISO so we do actually have a role in the electrical and manufacturing standards US plugs are built to.  I see that you have become confused after claiming:  The current situation with the EU is the exception, leaving the EU would just put us in the same position we are with every other country.   And could not understand it when you were so obviously wrong.   In fact almost all countries in the world are involved in some kind of economic integration or free trade area - there is even a handy  [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) showing how wrong you are. The list next to it shows many free trade areas, and our ability to trade in those areas is conducted through the EU. So leaving the EU wouldn't put the UK in the 'same position as every other country' as you claim, it would actually set us at odds with the overwhelming majority of other countries.  Many Tories and Kippers claimed during Indyref that Scotland couldn't possibly renegotiate all these agreements and would therefore be unable to trade across large parts of the world. The same applies to England.  Your UKIPCrapFu is obviously strong, having made personal attacks claim the other person started it and you show classic KipTard misdirection when wrong - shout louder, claim the opposition is stupid and hope nobody notices how wrong you are.  Seriously, there is a whole world out there if you would just educate yourself about how it operates.    The net effect of UKIP's immigration and trade policy together will achieve exactly that - and that is by design. Few if any would make it through the system he is proposing and each family member that wanted to join them would have to go through the same points based process. Its profoundly ludicrous and a profound disincentive to business.  The answer to your second question is 'How can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?' You can't. If a business is free to trade with another in the UK how can it do so when every member of its staff has to be dragged through the same months long process in order to complete a simple deal. They'll just go find a partner in a country with less restrictive policies - there are many to choose from. How could a manufactuer set up a UK base and bring over experienced staff to train new staff under those circumstances!  UKIP *is* proposing that the UK should stand alone. Farage's fantasy is that outside the EU the size of the UK economy will be attractive enough that we will be able to make trade deals with everyone. He stated exactly this in a recent EU speech on the African migrant crisis - he wants an end to all free trade blocs in order to allow everyone to trade together. He doesn't seem to understand that this didn't work the first time around.  So why would America waste their time on a trade deal with one country when you could access the EU with only one deal, and use that as leverage to access NAFTA? It wouldn't happen - because it doesn't happen. Almost every country on earth is part of a [free trade bloc or union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) for a reason. You'll notice the ones that aren't are not exactly economic powerhouses.   You could make the same argument about the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Democratic institutions are a bear because they're run by people and people don't like change, and for the most part can't agree on anything.  It'll be the same once NAFTA and the EU merge, and the same when there is a global federal government.       Yes. But it all depends on where you think the centre is.   The right wing justices voted with the Obama administration more this term than the left wing judges did, meaning the Obama administration won just 38% of its cases compared to an average between 60 - 70% per term for governments of all stripes.   Scalia was in the majority in only 48 percent of this terms cases and Thomas in only 33 percent, which is historically low and very telling of the position of the court overall.  Also it wasn't just two issues on which the court leaned left - of course there was marriage equality, housing discrimination, Obamacare, and legislative districting but also a whole host of criminal justice issues that received much less attention (see link below).  It appears two forces are at work, the court has indeed leaned left this term, and the Obama administration has taken a much more authoritarian tack on criminal justice cases (but realistically everyone has a distorted view of the centre because both Republicans and Democrats are, by enacted policy, centre right parties).  [The two justices](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/supreme_court_liberal_on_criminal_justice_issues_clarence_thomas_sided_with.html) who cast the most votes against the administration this term were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, each opposing the administration in 71 percent of the cases. Justice Sonia Sotomayor isnt far behind, voting against the administration 67 percent of the time. Who voted the most with the administration? Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy, who each sided with the administration more often than not (in 52 percent of the cases).   My local coop looks like something out of a disaster movie already!   Climate IS NOT weather!   No leader of any political party in this country can even discuss the matter on a reasonable level - the nature of the early 90s Tory split and resulting debate was so poisonous that our relationship with Europe has become the third rail of British politics. UKIP has only poisoned that debate further with its hyperbolic statements on the subject.   Its just a shame the only ideas he has about solving the problems involve running away from them.         Deny it all you want but every study shows this is the case.   If you look at it from a short term perspective sure. The problem is that growing up in poverty limits both your prospects, your lifetime earnings, and increases the amount you need from the state, thereby limiting your contribution to the state. Its basically a generational problem and we are seeing record low levels of social mobility.  So insisting that another generation grow up with low educational attainment and spend their lives stuck in nothing jobs is simply spawning a new generation of benefit claimants.  Minimum incomes actually assist in resolving a long term problems and reduce future welfare bills.   It sounds like they've put together a franken-engine from the parts available in order to avoid a penalty.      Its great - but I can't emphasise this enough - Formula 1 doesn't own the content the national broadcasters do. FOM sells them the pictures and the rights to those pictures - the commentary is owned by the broadcaster.  The money F1 generates from TV rights is around $650 million a year, with another $650 million from race fees - this covers the $1.1 billion a year distributed to the teams.  A globalised streaming solution for F1, no matter how much I might desire one, isn't going to generate that kind of revenue, and that will directly affect the viability of the middle and lower grid teams.       I have, feel free to point out the factual errors. I realise Kippers like to pretend Farage is pro-immigration etc but to those of us who haven't sucked on his head it's obvious bollocks.   Its inconsistent because you say you want free trade, but then say that all markets must be regulated. What Farage, and apparently you, are seeking is deregulated trade markets with heavy personal border restrictions - two policies completely at odds with each other. Even Australia doesn't do this.  So you're happy to have your products regulated by the EU, and have companies regulated by the EU (which includes our entire nuclear industry, water industry, rail, energy, our largest pharmacy networks - all of which would be regulated by the EU because they're all owned by European companies), but have no control over that regulation? Really? I suppose that kind of illogic is what I should expect from Kippers.  We do have a means of regulating how banks in China and banks worldwide operate, its called SWIFT, it's based in Brussels and it controls and operates the network which connects all banks globally. Banks have to meet and observe certain standards to use it, and the EU regulates the trade of foreign owned banks operating within the EU.  We also have a voting role in regulating standards for American plugs through the International Standards Organisation incidentally.  The current situation is far from the exception. We are members of the World Trade Organisation via the EU, our interface with NAFTA is through the EU, as is our interface with the Asian Free Trade Area, Indian Free Trade Area, The Common Market For East and Southern Africa and dozens of others - EVERYONE is in a free trade area of some kind, as this handy [map shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#/media/File:Economic_integration_stages_(World).png)  So, as I said earlier, Kippers want to leave all of that and sulk behind their little wall while everyone else trades happily together.   Frankly the mendacious crap spewed by the likes of Farage and yourself appals me - you're astonishingly ignorant of world trade and how the world actually operates but sit there and snipe like you know what you're talking about.  Read a book, learn something FFS.            Veto over Bernie's replacement, nothing else - since unanimity is required everyone's strategy group vote is effectively a veto.    Only time F1 governance has worked in the last 65 years was when Bernie and Max were aligned.   My, how deeply you have sucked on the head of Faragian wisdom. Sorry but the world just doesn't work that way - it never has.  A minute ago you were advocating free trade (Farage's vision is no restrictions on trade at all), but now 'every market must be regulated' - how inconsistent. Its not a false premise because one market feeds the other.  Incase you hadn't noticed the vehicle standards you refer to are the EuroEncap Standards - based on DfT research in the 80s - and its the EU that does the regulating. We would simply stick to those standards because we don't have a standards body (it wouldn't matter if we did), but we wouldn't have any say in what they were. Just as British vehicles sold overseas already obey those countries standards without involvement in the regulation.  Its the same with trade - we would be free to trade with whomever we wanted, so long as we obeyed their standards, but we would have no role at all in determining those standards. Norway, oft cited by Farage, says that it simply does what the EU asks (their trade minister laughed at Farage's comments and that's why our Nige stopped talking about them).  So the world Kippers are seeking is one in which Britian sits behind a wall and obeys every command given to it.    No, he has no veto. The votes are balanced 6 each between the FIA, FOM and the teams, but unanimous agreement is required for anything to pass.   He's not the boss of F1, he's the Chairman of the rights holding company. F1 is run by the F1 Strategy Group (composed of the FIA, FOM, and the top 6 WDC teams) and their rulings have to then go through the F1 Commission (which is all the teams).  He has power, but he's not in charge of the sport, hasn't been for a very long time.      Our trading block is with the EU, they are the body through which we make trade agreements with the rest of the world. So, no, there isn't more to the world than the EU where trade is concerned.  But the most important questions underlying the debate are "How can you have free trade for business without a similarly free labour market for people?" and "How can you hope to compete economically with Russia, China, US   Canada, and the BRIC countries standing alone?"  Farage's answer is to close all borders to people, allow the businesses to do what they like, and hope our products are so good people will demand them and we don't lose the inevitable trade wars.  UKIP would like to close our borders and vet everyone who comes through against a points system - no other country does this or can do this, not even Australia - a country that has a half a dozen different immigration systems.  Farage just doesn't understand how immigration systems actually work worldwide and his theories on trade are a complete joke. People were having to stifle laughs during is recent speech on Africa. The man is an ignoramus.    They have only one policy, to remove Britian from the world and throw up a fence around us in the vain and laughable hope that the world will be kind to us with it's trade policy and give us visa's to visit.   Everything else is petty window dressing - you can tell that by the way Farage argues for a Aussie based points based system despite the fact that we have a points based immigration systems based on the Aussie one and have had since 2008.            Ultranationalism. noun. extreme nationalism, especially when opposed to international cooperation.   Sound familiar?   When did I say that?  Commenting on the current state of the economy is only comparing it to the previous administration in your mind, not mine.  Economic policy is a matter of its time, you can't go back, we created solutions then to deal with the perceived problems we had then, now we have different problems.   You can't go back, you can only go forward.  And no you didn't set up a car and drive it, look at [Villeneuve's 81' Ferrari](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/3b4x7k/inside_the_cockpit_of_gilles_villeneuves_1981/). The knob to the left of the steering wheel is the brake bias, the lever on the left with the cable coming out is most likely the rear sway bar adjuster, there is even a turbo boost adjustment control.  You can see similar buttons and controls in the [68' Lotus 49B](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/26/article-2671189-1F2967CB00000578-215_964x636.jpg) and again in [Lauda's 312B](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Ferrari+312B+cockpit safe=off es_sm=91 biw=1920 bih=1004 tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=X5aSVaX4IYypsAGpwKWIDA ved=0CCAQsAQ#imgrc=AcS9yIqbyxP8hM%3A)   I'm not going to accept that commenting on the real state of the economy is anti-Tory or pessimism, thats just Faragian bloviating typical of the ultra right.  Every one of Osborne's plans have failed and the growth in wages is happening only at the top end, whereas the jobs are all being created at the bottom end - in the middle everyone is being crippled by rent or house prices.      Objectively it hasn't, real GDP is slower than even Japan, and virtually no one can feel it no matter what the figures say.   [Media company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Medien) - [Dieter Hahn](http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en sl=de u=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Hahn prev=search) - also the guy whose company took Bernie to court over bribery (which was I suspect revenge for the sale to CVC rather than themselves).   Well, its good news obviously, but not great news.   We're celebrating an 0.1% increase in overall growth (how far we've fallen) and that the construction sector isn't tanking again yet, but is simply less close to the edge than we thought a month ago - but the whole thing is really down to new calculation methods and not an real terms change.  Our real GDP per capita is worse than the [US, Germany, Japan or Canada](http://i.imgur.com/Jip2ZJx.png)            Driverless cars are basically developing the sensors and control systems we need to make home robotics a reality, but we're not as close to working consumer or business technology in both fields as it seems.   Google's car still can't handle adverse weather or traffic lights with the Sun behind them, and extensive, timely, satellite scans of the route it's driving are required before it can traverse them.  VR headsets suffer from the 3DTV/4k problem, you need content and no one is developing enough of it, and the kit is awkward to use. It reminds me to a certain extent of early 80s video games - cool, innovative, but not ready for the mass market.  I could be wrong but I suspect both technologies will lead to the creation of revolutionary technologies but won't be as popular as it seems now in themselves mainly because the barriers to consumer adoption are high.   Most revelatory technologies solve problems that a large body of people have - which leads to fast adoption and quickly declining prices, others start out as premium products and gradually become affordable, but I'm not certain there is a premium market for driverless cars, even the business transport market is tenuous outside of rail. So I suspect the market for driverless will look a lot more like Tesla than Ford. The number of technology companies in the game suggests the IP in the market is valuable in and of itself even if it doesn't lead to a product.  If we couldn't get people to wear 3D glasses long term will people accept VR headsets?    Honestly I think the question is irrelevant, although I sympathise with the view, because the more important question is "how can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?"  The free labour market was never going to help anyone that didn't recognise that to extract personal benefit from it that they were going to have to increase their skills and become a more marketable commodity in the workforce.  The government stepped in to fill the gap but was unable to increase the minimum wage adequately to balance the payouts to only the worst affected.   Read the headline more closely - it's accurate.   Normally I'd agree but the circumstances aren't equal - greater efforts were likely placed on counting the votes of the serious candidates (which is what happens when you have limited resources).   The election in Rainham was a close campaign although not an especially close result (Paul Clark 12,060 25.6 per cent, Mark Hanson (Ukip) 9,199 19.5 per cent, Paul Chaplin (Lib Dem) 1,707 3.6 per cent)         Thank you, and I agree with much of what you say (although I think that driverless and VR are evolutionary rather than revolutionary) - I was tilting in that direction with the lines about education - we must get people into STEM with speed.   I'm slightly wary of the wealthy pensioners arguments that the LibDems were making when in government (I wondered what they wanted). Generally speaking applying means testing to anything adds layers of bureaucracy that often inflict more inequalities than they solve, and I can't see any evidence that it's a huge enough problem to justify the staff time required.   Are there really hordes of wealthy pensioner processing reams of paperwork for benefits they don't need?   All that said if its a problem that can be tackled with minimal extra expenditure and the rules around it aren't so tight that they disenfranchise people on the dividing line then I have no strong objection.   They're very similar to figures published annually by the Guardian and recently by the Daily Mail. The spread of the numbers is broadly correct even if the precise figure isn't.    Its social value vs shareholder value, we need more of the former and less of the latter.   Basically take the pain points out of having children and enable mothers to continue working. We've gone some way towards this already, but the highlights are:-  - Free childcare.  - Increased skills training for post baby parents.  - More child friendly public spaces.  - Increased maternity and paternity leave.  - Tax breaks for third children.  - Reduce road tax for families of a certain size.  - Improve child benefit for third and fourth children while reducing it for the first and second child - basically reverse the existing scale and define it by income level.  - Reduce stamp duty for families above a certain size.   Its sustainable, we just have to figure out the exact level.   Yes, but anyone who makes that argument seems to be labelled anti-business. Personal tax allowance should be the subsistence level income in the area in which you live.   Essentially the only group that pays in more than it takes out is working people between 35 and 45. Immigration is doing a great job of filling in the gap in the short term, but to fill in the long term gap we need to have more kids (we basically need more middle class kids so we need to incentivise certain economic groups to have kids).   Incentivising having more kids is important to the long term goal of expanding the middle section of the workforce.    In 1948 there were 16 working adults for *every* pensioner, in 2000 that number was 2, its now 4.     Its the reason national economies don't work like household accounts - government spending is 46% of the economy and the public sector is the single largest employer of young people.   Basically if you stop shopping at Tesco you don't have to worry about Tesco going under. If you're a government that's a real concern so you have to be very careful. An awful lot of jobs depend on public infrastructure, so cutting spending often increases the problem.  Average size of pension pot has actually fallen since 2010 - people are putting in less and less.   All the benefit savings thus far achieved would only purchase two fighter planes for our new carriers.   Even if you did really manage to make 12 billion of welfare cuts without touching pensions all that has to go into the deficit right now.   Mainly avoid attempts at one hit solutions, black and white answers, or demonising groups of people as 'the problem' - there are no simple solutions - you have to pull gently on lots of economic leavers not hard on a single one. Also not calling it a merry-go-round would also help since the entire economy is essentially a merry-go-round writ large.  Getting over the idea that national economies work like household accounts would really help and might actually allow people to see the real problems.  Immigration and the increasing birth rate suggest that the scale of the problem has slowed dramatically since 2000 when we were on the edge of not replacing our existing population, but we need:-  - Better education and skills training of all kinds - this lifts incomes, it really is that simple. - Free education - burdening kids helps no one. - Ending child poverty - your childhood economic status determines your lifetime earnings.  - Rethink pensions and the retirement age - the current rate of growth is simply not sustainable.  - Employers *have* to pay a living wage - we can't continue to subsidise low paid workers in the way we have. - Reduce housing costs - they have to come down drastically everywhere at every level. - Immigration - we need as many working age adults as we can get. - Employment inequalities exist - they must end for everyone, we need to increase the workforce. - Incentivise having more children - we really do need more people.  Broadly we need to get over the idea that there is such a thing as deserving and undeserving. Even if you pay into the system for 50 years you still take more from it than you put in - the gulf between input and output there is so huge that no increase in contributions will close it.   Cameron can spin it that way and he would like this to be the reason so his government can have their solution which is clamping down on in-work benefits (and it also offers him an explanation for the fall of treasury receipts, the failure of their deficit reduction programme, and weak productivity and a host of other things).   But as I've said [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3bi039/the_majority_of_the_215bn_125_of_gdp_of_benefit/csmcpf8) the problem is far larger and far more complex than that. Reducing in work benefits increases poverty and that directly limits the earnings of the next generation of the workforce.   The UK workforce is 29.68 million of 64.1 million people. The remainder are under / over age or economically inactive (house parents, carers etcetera).  Literally less than half the country support the other half.  The issue that underlies the whole debate is child poverty and elder care. The average size of a pension pot in 2015 is 22,000, the average cost of caring for an elderly person where I live is 106,000 a year.   Pensions are triple locked and can only go up, and any measure that tackles child poverty (the single defining issue for the earning prospects of the future workforce) has to raise the average salary of the poorest workers.  Broadly only societal group who don't take out more than they put in are the group aged 35 - 45, at the height of their earning potential, and there simply aren't enough of them to support the rest of society.   One of the reasons (ignored by this article) that the growth in employment is happening at the lower end of the market is that more elderly people are working and seeking work - but its obviously more complicated that that.  The average pension pot is 22,000 the average cost of elder care in my part of the country is 106,000 a year. So even if you fall into the 'worked all their lives' category you're still drawing far more from the system than you could have put in.  The real problem is the age dependency ratio - we still don't have enough working adults to support the system overall no matter who you pay the money to and no matter if you think those in receipt of the money are deserving or not.        What groups are included in the not looking category?   Its not quite that easy.   The UK workforce is 29.68 million of 64.1 million people. The remainder are under / over age or economically inactive (house parents, carers etcetera).  Literally less than half the country support the other half.  The issue that underlies the whole debate is child poverty and elder care. The average size of a pension pot in 2015 is 22,000, the average cost of caring for an elderly person where I live is 106,000 a year.   Pensions are triple locked and can only go up, and any measure that tackles child poverty (the single defining issue for the earning prospects of the future workforce) has to raise the average salary of the poorest workers.         Which got him the 5 points he needed to win.   Indeed. Gilles Villeneuve died and Pironi was appallingly injured (I had misremembered), but Ferrari still took the WCC despite this. Pironi in fact still came second in the WDC despite missing 5 races after his accident - one further race finish and he would almost certainly have won the 82' WDC.   My point is that mediocre drivers rarely if ever make it into front of the grid teams (Perez is the only recent one I can think of) and this meme that a good car can make an average driver great is crap. In 65 years of F1 racing it has never happened once - Rosberg senior is really the only questionable driver to have ever won and even he scored the victories when it really counted.  	197
 Precalc is a much harder course than AP Stats. At my school, people take it as an alternative to precalc. If you're comfortable taking two math classes at once, go for it. The two classes aren't too related-pretty much opposite types of math. Precalc has a lot of algebra and trig where stats has a lot of...stats. I've heard there is much more writing that a typical math class as well.   Does your school offer AP Macro/Micro economics? If so, take those. Relatively easy courses if you stay on top of the readings as notes, and they're fairly interesting. Taking precalc would be wise since it would better prepare you for any math classes you choose in college.   In short, if you're willing to do two math classes at once, go for AP Stats and international relations along with precalc.    Honestly, the cake chapstick is my favorite from the brand. It feels much less waxy than the other flavors, which is a shame because I love the other flavors. I do like that the cake flavoring/scent isn't too intense.    Maybe that's why I thought blue would look nice! I've been living on mobile, so everything's white.   I do have a Walmart, but there's nail polish everywhere and it's poorly lit. I'm relying on Walgreens to pick up the slack. I have two of those, so drugstore products should be much easier for me to grab.    Maybe a blue color scheme? Not much reasoning for this - blue is just a nice color. It's the opposite of pink but still goes nicely with pink, so there's that.   I think air for posts would be fantastic! Product review, product request, swatches, dupe, dupe request, FOTD, and list of favorites is all I can think of for flairs, but that's what's usually posted in the makeup subs.   Honestly, I love how fast this sub grew. My nearest makeup stores besides Kohls are 45 minutes away, and my wallet is always afraid of going with!    I prefer to let it thunk onto the couch. Not the best way to practice a release, but much better for the floor. Does the bean bag add good cushioning?    Hot or cold sub? I get six inches, so just double anything number specific if you're going for a footlong.   If you're looking for a hot sub, steak and cheese on Italian herbs and cheese. I get it toasted with provolone and pepper jack alternating. For veggies, I do lettuce, just enough spinach to cover the lettuce, green peppers, and onions. Mayo, oil, pepper, and oregano. Most delicious sub on the planet.   For a good cold sub, I go with a BMT on herb and cheese. I always change the cheese on this depending how I feel that day. Today I'd throw american on, but I've used everything down to mozzarella. Lettuce, just two spinach leaves (since I make my own subs and can be difficult with veggies; gauge the artist on this one), tomatoes, two cucumbers (I'm not a big fan, but they add something), green peppers, yellow peppers, and olives. Then add mayo, chipotle, oil, pepper, oregano, and parmasean.   Definitely bend the subs a bit to fit your own tastes or if your store doesn't offer something I suggested.    You're eating an entire foot of food. First, think of the loaf of bread. That's a lot of bread. Next, think of the meats, cheese, and sauces. These three things are quite fatty (usually) which will help keep you satiated. Next, you have veggies. These are going to be more nutrient dense than french fries so they'll keep you fuller longer.   A footlong sub is a lot of food, and it will feel like it. Just be careful eating these too often. I feel bad when I get the same customer every time I work. The sodium amounts alone on these things are ridiculous.    I'll have to try this if oil removers don't work. I have some pretty greasy lids, so I want to avoid adding to that, but if the oils work, then I'll accept that they work.    Join something! I waited until my junior year to join a sport and it stung. Sports at my school are a bit pricey so my parents didn't want to, but they realized the value of a sport after a college tour.   If you don't want to join a sport, that's fine. I'm not the best athlete and I joined bowling for my sport so I won't push a sport. There is a ton of other things to do while in high school.   Get a job. If you do this, hold the job and keep your grades up. If you don't have much extra going on through school, a job will help you save up for college and your boss might just connect you with someone who can land you that internship your freshmen year of college. Having a good relationship with your manager or supervisor is also good as they can serve as a reference on your resume.   Volunteer! Some schools have clubs for this, others don't. If yours doesn't, start researching local volunteer opportunities. Humane societies and elderly homes are just a couple things that come to mind. Colleges love to see 100+ volunteer hours, and you could build that up over summer. That's barely over 4 days. Just make sure you document these hours. Talk to your counselor and see if volunteer hours go on your transcript.   Don't have any clubs at your school that you're interested in? You can start with a special interest group, or a big club such as Model United Nations or Bots IQ. You're likely going to need a teacher to help you start a club. If it's one of the bigger clubs such as Model UN or Bots, there may be some fees associated with these, but colleges find participating in more major clubs a very big plus.   There are lots of things to do in high school, you just have to find them. Flyer for an event on the wall? Flyer asking for students to help set something up or run an event? Grab a couple friends, or even go on your own, and try it out. Worst case scenario is that you don't like it and you move on.    Colleges like to see rigor, but they also like to see success. I'll have 7 AP classes under my belt by the time I'm out of high school. A few of those were more challenging alternatives to a required course, so they just ended up being the better option. I have all B's in my AP courses, but at my junior conference I was told that would be more impressive to admissions than A's in common core classes.   The best way to benefit from AP is make sure you take courses that you can hold a 78% or higher in and courses that you are confident you will get the credit for. If money is a challenge for your family, don't load up on AP since the test is $80 per class, although your school might offer assistance options. Check with your guidance councilor on those.   Overall, you need to assess your own abilities. If you haven't chosen courses for next year already, look at your current classes. Are there any in a subject that you found easy and want an extra challenge in? Does your school offer any AP classes that are interesting? Are you at Spanish/German/etc level 4 this year or through your junior year? Your school might offer an AP level 5 that is challenging, but you will have 4 years of experience in. (Your school's foreign language system may be a bit different than this).    So I've been working on tight lining and doing a wing with liquid liner and I must ask: how the hell do you get it all off? I have eyeliner all over my upper waterline and in my lashes and it's just impossible to get off. I've tried using baby soap since my eyes don't take well to anything but sitting and scrubbing between lashes with a q-tip is a royal pain.    I found that my 8g were much easier to put in than the 6g im at now. Just lubed it up and popped it in. I guess earskins are something everyone has a different experience with.    It really makes me feel bad. People come in and order and ask where the $5 footlongs are and I just tell them they're gone. Some people just leave. At our store, sales dropped a bit after the new menus and prices came out.    I think the lack of drugstore testers is what attributes to a lot of Ultas used product problems. I was hoping to get my foundation there as a drugstore one, but I couldn't swatch any of it!   MAC online is definitely a more comfortable experience. While I was at the Macy's counter, I swatched a few shadows to see what I should add to my list since I was already way over my limit for the day. Definitely felt better over there than in the store. I feel like the store is there for people who know exactly what they're looking for and aren't too concerned with how much it costs. Maybe that'll be me in a few years, but for now I'm just fine with swatching at Macy's and picking up some products online.    So do we. Our manager had it tucked off to the side on top of the hotwell for the first week we had it, put people started claiming they didn't see it so we moved it to on top of bread selection. I really wish it was easier to differentiate the type of subs. The premiums add up pretty quickly.    This was pretty much how my experience went! I guess I got lucky compared to others here; the staff at my Ulta were all very willing to help and seemed to know what they were doing. The store was also very clean and well stocked. Only problem I had was the used products problem. I bought two NYX concealer sticks and right before I got to the register, I realized one was used! They weren't even sealed! Still signed up for the rewards card since my good experience definitely calls for a revisit.   I also went to Sephora, MAC, and I browsed the MAC selection at Macy's since the actual store was a bit intimidating. Sephora was what I expected, I probably should have accepted the employees' help after circling the store three times for a beauty blender! I think with MAC, I'll be sticking to the Macy's counter. It seemed to be all the same things but with prices posted and less people glaring at me.    Some coupons are location specific. Was it a printed coupon or from one of those official coupon clipper things or the newspaper? Granted, even if it is a bigger coupon, they may still not accept. They should change their sign to say as such.   On the other hand, that employee may have a rude and/or lazy one. In my store, we accept any coupon we can, but a sign for showing coupons ahead of time would be great. Often, people will bring in BOGO coupons, get three steak subs, then at the register I have to explain to them why the coupon is invalid.   The new menus make using coupons really tough on customers since they don't list subs as regular or premium anymore, so a lot of people come in thinking anything without extra cheese or bacon works with a coupon.    Nice coverstock, good brand, decent price, not too strong of a ball, and it looked and smelled great.    I find that sticking to my diet is a lot easier when I accept invitations to go out to eat. Granted, I make sure it's not an every day event. But I allow some time for a treat and just try to order something healthier when I'm out to eat. I know that when I get home and when I eat tomorrow, I'll be right back on the diet train. If anything, I'll do a little extra cardio.   With the comments, I try to block them out with people that I don't know too well. If it's a closer friend that I know I can say a dick comment to, I'll give them a snarky reply and it usually shuts them down. One of my friends is pretty against eating healthy and thinks it below them, so I go out of my way to point out how energized I feel and how I'm just not lethargic at all whenever she complains about being tired or groggy.    Definitely will! I'm a bit of a receipt hoarder - never know when you'll need them! Do you have any experience with returns with them?    Lorac is one of the big reasons I want to go. The Kohls by me just got the Pro and Unzipped (gold?) palettes, but I wanted to check out Ulta before grabbing them at Kohls. I'm glad they have more drugstore brands since I'm on a bit of a budget. I'm just worried that with my luck I'll end up purchasing products people have decided to test!    Just checked the search! I guess they have a pretty huge used products problem? The one I'm headed to is new, so I hope it's not too prevalent there just yet, but I guess if it is pretty terrible, there's a Sephora 5 minutes away from the Ulta and a JCPenny Sephora on my way home.    Finally got an Ulta kinda near me, about 45 minutes away, so I'll hopefully be taking my first trip down there tomorrow with a friend.   Anyone here have good or bad experiences to share about the store? Are the prices decent? Is it like Sephora? Better?   I'm hoping to splurge on some nice foundation or a palette, but don't want to over spend.    I just love hearing myself talk. I do a lot of speaking before I think, so sometimes hearing whatever flies out of my mouth is fun. I also hate conversation lulls. They're just not fun. So I need to push the conversation with something.    I feel like it's really a trend among all subways. They simply don't put value on the employees that keep the store running and customers coming back. I have a feeling they prefer having more disposable employees that don't ever expect a raise.    Maybe a trapper keeper style binder? My cousin has one of the loose textbooks and he keeps the chapter he's using in a separate binder from the big one the rest of the book is in. Doing that might help lower the risk of damaging/losing all of the pages while only using a fraction of them.    My approach. I bounce in my approach and my coach hates it. My feet never really leave the ground, but on my first step I'll drop low, then pop up, and repeat until I'm at the line. He showed me a video of me bowling one day at practice and I looked pretty silly.    Thank you so much! I'll probably get their new quad, but I'm definitely going to pair it up with that Maybelline palette!    Generally, keep oils out of a fresh stretch for a week or so until it's healed. I find it best to do massages with the jewelry out so it gets into the piercing and the piercing has time to relax.   For cleaning, when the stretch is fresh, it's okay to do a soak with the jewelry in, just like its a fresh piercing. If the stretch is all healed up then you can take the jewelry out for sea salt soaks.    I'll have to check out Amazon then! I wouldn't mind branching out from the one palette though. The white, a couple different browns, and maybe a gray or something would make an ideal palette for me right now. My makeup experience is some Walmart mascara and a one eye wing so I'm not too picky just yet. I'd be willing to spend ~$10 on a palette right now, give or take a bit until I get a bit more confident in my skills. I picked up a $15 Balm quad and ended up hating it after a good 2 uses and gave it to a coworker who loves Balm products and makeup.    Would one off amazon be safe? I don't know when these were discontinued, so I don't quite know if the product would be good. If there's a chance that one off amazon wouldn't be the greatest, something similar would be great. I really loved the colors and the formula so anything similar would work.    Sorry! Here's an Amazon link - should be desktop. Totally forgot it was a mobile site!   http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Formula-Mineral-Eyeshadow-Minerals/dp/B0017138OG   http://m.rakuten.com/product/270255096?listingid=356071630 adid=29963  That was my favorite eyeshadow a couple years ago when I was rocking the middle school look. White shadow and black waterline.   But it was a great quality eyeshadow and I tossed it before writing down the name. Regretted that until I tracked it down. I think this is the product, although the far left color was white on my quad.   Does anybody know of where I can get this product or a good dupe of it? It was a Physicians Formula Mineral Wear quad but I don't know exactly which colors. I feel like it was discontinued ages ago since I can't find it anywhere on the PF website.     I'll have to pick up some. Don't want an injury hurting my game more than it has to!    I got a pretty rad blister at practice last Thursday, and I have a meet tonight.  Do you guys have any blister solutions? It's pretty painful and dry. I'll probably throw tape over tonight to bowl, but is there anything I can do to make it heal a bit faster or at least hurt less?   My thumb hole isn't the problem, my thumb size just fluctuates a ton and I didn't put tape on when my thumb told me I needed tape. Ended up blistering then ripping. Life lessons from bowling.    I always said read it as erissd. If the movies are good for one thing, it's pronunciation!    http://imgur.com/a/CTySH  First two are in natural light and second two were in the bathroom. I don't have much experience with makeup beyond mascara, so anything is helpful!    You could ask the employees, but they'll definitely look at you funny. I don't even know if we're allowed to do that. You could always add it afterwards.   With the prices, they've been going up for a while. Over here in the Midwest, our new menus are really enraging customers. Cheapest sub is $4 and its a six inch. Cheapest footlong is $5.75. I have a feeling subway is slowly moving away from the $5 footlong since it's not too profitable.   Overall, prices and cheeses are very reasonable. You could decide on your favorite store in your area and talk to them about adding provolone to their options. Chances are, it's very available to them, they just don't know if there's a demand for it. If you'll buy it, they might just add it since it's not a discontinued item.    Definitely! Kaos is so comfy and easy to wear-best sleeping jewelry. Just gotta keep them oily. Silicone is pretty dry, especially this time of year.    What brand are they? Kaos earskins are super clear, even lubed up, and have a tiny flare.      It feels great! I gained ~4-6 pounds over Christmas and this morning when I weighed in, it was all gone. Getting back to healthy was hard after all the eggnog and leftovers, but it's rewarding.    Pick up some glass single flare from a piercing shop or body art forms. Much easier to stretch with and much safer. Also, head over to Menards or Home Depot (or any hardware store) and pick up a roll of PTFE tape. It's a good $1 or so and IIRC, it's a bit thinner than bondage tape so it's easier to stretch with. Also, the emu oil or vitamin e oil should help more than jojoba for stretching since they're a bit slicker than jojoba. Just remember to completely saturate the PTFE before you wear it or it'll dry out your ears.   My ears aren't very stretchy either. Just gotta go slow and spoil them.    It's okay for it to be a bit pink on the inside, especially after a fresh stretch. You're on the right track though! Stick with quality jewelry, and you're doing the right thing with massages. Also, you might be able to size up in a month, but if your ears start saying no halfway down the taper, it's okay to wait. Some people have no problem getting through small sizes and others take a while to size up from the start.   Also, be prepared for a bit of frustration, and don't be like me and try to calculate when you'll be at your goal size. You'll be disappointed due to time between stretches increasing with size. It took me 4 months to go from 8g to 6g and I eventually got frustrated and taped up. It's the first full mm stretch, so it's a bit of a fight. Whenever you feel ready to just shove the taper through or add one more layer of tape than usual, look at some of the posts by people who've blown out and you'll want to wait. There's people here with 2" ears. Your goal size is possible. They didn't get there over night, or even in a couple months.   It's a bit early so I rambled a bit, but stick with generally accepted methods, good jewelry, and don't rush at all. You're asking early, so you're getting a head start on healthy lobes!    No problem! I work at subway so I eat quite a bit of subs. Gotta get it into mfp somehow! Took a bit of googling, but I think this site is gonna stay a favorite as long as it has my favorite subs.    So tonight was my first meet at a high oil lane and a longer lane than I'm used to. It was also extremely cold on the bus ride to the alley and in the alley.  My home and proshop alley is nice and room temperature and it's also been a warm winter, so when I got drilled, my thumb was a bit bigger, if not swollen. During practice before we started, my ball fell off my hand. Just dropped. Anyone else ever have the problem of a suddenly too big thumb hole? Usually my thumb swells and needs tape and everything, but today I couldn't feel the hole snug on all sides. This led to me gripping the ball and doing terribly. Should I put in some white tape? The cold weather is sticking around now, but I don't want to be where I usually am with my thumb pretty much stuck and tape in my thumb slug.   Now my next big problem. I have a Tropical Breeze, so it's a low to medium oil ball. These lanes were drenched. My usual strike shot is standing at 17/18 and target at the second arrow. I ended up having to stand at 23 and target the third arrow to get anywhere near the pocket. No hook at all, or revs. I was really regretting not getting the Crux I was eyeing up since this is my first ball. I've read it's high oil?   TL;DR: How do you bowl high oil with a low oil ball? Any solutions when it's so cold that my ball fits like a house drill? Bad meet due to conditions, and I want to know how to improve, especially on those conditions since I'm at that alley again next week.    I found a website that lets you add everything you got on your sub and it shows a full nutrition label with calories and macros. Super helpful, although the sodium content in my favorite subs makes me feel a bit guilty about eating so much subway.   https://nutritionix.com/subway/nutrition-calculator   These are gorgeous! Rainbow fluorite is one of my favorite stones next to labradorite. I finally checked out this site and my size is just smaller than what they carry. The prices are great though! I'll have to find a friend to wear all these plugs for me.    I drink strawberry slim fast powder for breakfast. Granted, it gets mixed with milk instead of water. It keeps me full for about two and a half hours, although it says 4. It's about $10/can where I am, and you get 14 shakes out of it.    I think a smiley would look good. It's subtle, but it still looks nice when it shows. And lots of jewelry options with CBRs and horseshoes.    Personally, I don't care for the whole one ear stretched look. But I also don't have a taste for one lobe pierced, or any unbalanced piercings. Ultimately it comes down to taste. If anything, your biggest problem with it will be finding plugs you love, and you're stuck paying for a pair since they're not available in singles.    Tumblr is the place that would hate you. I've seen so many anti-capitalism posts there.    Parents travelled and I had work so I couldn't tag along. Friend I had plans with cancelled, other friends just wanted to go to bed. New Years is pretty lame without other people.   2015 resolution: find cooler friends.    Same with my town. Although, it's down the road from AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts. I don't see the strategy there at all. But at least my local RadioShack is still going strong.    I have a problem similar to this. The pad on my ring finger catches on my grip during release, and gets a bit sore after a game or two. I don't have much of a solution for it yet, beyond keeping my hand cool so it doesn't swell. I assume it's just anatomy making bowling difficult, but it's my first ball, so it might be something your pro shop guy can do something about.    DB ancient shrouded armor all the way! I always add the Volsung mask because breathing underwater is nice and the carry weight improvement is helpful. It's also a glitched mask that you can wear with the ancient shrouded hat/mask/cowl/thing.    I aim for strikes too, but a cool looking strike is so much better than a textbook strike.    What about using a plastic cup/bowl? Too lazy/not enough time to use the stove for 1/2 cup of water for oatmeal.    I got a pair of 14g tunnels in a kit. It was pretty exciting. You can see through them, but it takes a bit of wiggling your lobe and a well lit area.    I'd actually like to learn two handed, but my coach wants us bowling one handed. It's what he does, so it's easier for him to teach, and midseason isn't really the time to switch I guess. I like the amount of power it puts on the ball. It's cool. Power shots are my goal every time I bowl.    Even when against a rival school at a meet, all of the teams in my section can't help but congratulate them. When something like that happens, just seeing it is exciting.    I prefer when they leave it in the tin so the lava doesn't get all over, but the only time they've done that they didn't skip the sugar so it still looked okay.    South wisconsin is a terrible place to be this year. It was raining yesterday and is forecasted for the rest of the week! The lack of snow is really killing any Christmas spirit I had a couple months ago.    Fast traveling EVERYWHERE. I would occasionally spend a couple hours just dedicated to discovering (but not exploring) places just so I could fast travel when needed. If I couldn't fast travel to a place I needed to get to, I would wander through a mountainous shortcut that didn't have anything interesting, although I accidentally explored labrynthian and didn't realize until a good 6 months later when I realized what labrynthian was.    A labret post the right length definitely wouldn't be out of the ordinary. It's what good shops use for cartilage and lobe piercings. Your shop should be able to fit you with the right jewelry.    Plugs and tunnels will be a rare find at that size. An internally threaded labret or a captive bead ring would work. I was lucky to get a kit with a 16g taper, but it didn't come with jewelry in 16g, so I had to pick up some captives.    I'll buy six boats with this.    Wouldn't the school be evacuated and searched in the case of a bomb?    Hiders are definitely a good option, although I'd opt for one of the brighter options    If anything, silicone. Earskins or the plugs are squishy enough to have enough give if someone manages to punch you in the ear, although earskins would be preferable since it would be less likely to shove the jewelry through.   Although now I'm thinking of someone's finger getting caught in the earskins.   Just take your ears off for the night.    Bae, bruh, swaggy, hella, your mom jokes. It's terrible.    Get them soaking and happy before you start changing jewelry around too much. You should really look into getting some jewelry that isn't acrylic. Even some cheap stainless steel would be better and your ears would have a better time healing. I don't change jewelry types around until my ears are comfortable and healed so they don't get irritated while they're healing.    It's Vargas. Just accept it and embrace it.    So I got my ball back from being drilled, and it has some excess superglue smudged on it an inch or so away from the thumb hole. Is there a safe way to get it off?    Thanks! I add a little butter to the pan or milk if they're scrambled, but that's it. Calorie counts on mfp can be a bit sketchy.    This question feels like a pretty bad question, but myfitnesspal has really thrown me off with it. Does the way you prepare an egg change the calories?   I've seen it range from 90 to nearly 400 just from different types of eggs. I love my eggs scrambled or fried, but these are showing up as over 200 calories! One egg isn't that filling on its own, so I don't want it to take up that much of my count.    The U.S. is pretty damn big compared to Europe. Often times driving is necessary to get to places outside of large cities. We need gas, so the high demand drags down the prices.    I'll have to try this. Apparently my biggest problem is hooking my hand around the ball and not clinging to it during the release, so this should definitely help with those.    Exactly. Raising your children with WIC would do little harm, as you can only purchase healthy foods with it and you go in for health checks. I'm just wondering if a male is able to access the program or if the mother of the kid was involved? Women Infants and Children seems to be narrowed on the mother-child relationship.    Olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, and dillweed added to taste. You can cook it in the slow cooker if you prefer it more tender, or fry it up in a pan of you prefer a bit more firm of chicken. I use breast for this since it's easy to dice.    Meet on Monday went terrible. Our team only has 3 so we get 6 frames a game, and we lost a game with only 4 frames in a game.   Practice went great, though, although nothing I did followed my coach. He wanted me to get more revs on the house ball because I was skidding to the point of rolling with a slight backwards spin. Okay, more revs it is. There's the gutter. Skid the ball down the lane? Strike it is. House balls are bad.   And for the reason I was on a house ball. I took my ball in last week Wednesday to get drilled, and the pro shop guy said Friday or so. I couldn't pick it up over the weekend, so it didn't matter that it was Friday. I'd get it my next practice on Tuesday. Pro shop guy isn't in. No problem. I go in on Wednesday to pick it up and the pro shop guy said the papers got moved around so he couldn't drill it over the weekend. Now, I'm not exactly mad about this. I'm getting the drilling at a huge discount and I'll finally have my ball so in pretty excited, I'm just worried about only having one practice on it before the meet next Monday. I'll have to come in over the weekend to practice with it since it's my first fingertip. I'm hoping it bumps my average over 100 and my fill above 55%.  /rant   If you guys have any at-home tips I can use to get used to my ball, it would be super appreciated.    Boy or girl? These things are vital to naming!    A girl at my school went 14-2 over the weekend with acrylic. Nice girl, but makes some really cringey choices with mods. It's sad to see people with nice lobes just destroy them.    If you're only at 4g (5mm), then you could probably get away with going naked for the interview. Just leave your plugs out for the day before to make sure they shrink up a little bit (you can always stretch back if you go down a size). As long as you don't have any catbutt going, it shouldn't be too noticeable.    I'm writing a program that makes an applet and creates arrays for a class. I have most of the program built, I just can't figure out the if statement. Basically, I have 3 separate arrays with each array named after a different job position. The user inputs a name in the applet and it displays the position the name is associated with. I can't figure out how to write an if statement along the lines of "if this name is from this array, display this". I can't post the code now since I'm on mobile, but I can post it later.    Not the realization that I gained 20 lbs over the summer, but the fact that it was my fault. I'm on depo and weight gain is a side effect, so it was a nice scapegoat. Until I downloaded myfitnesspal and realized I was eating nearly 4000 calories a day (sometimes more) and not working out at all. I'm not too big, but I want to do something about it before I get there. Obesity is in my family and I don't want to be a part of it.    Leaf. Was at a mall and a little kid comes up to me and tries to play. Up comes mom calling, "Leaf! Come over here! We have to get going, Leaf!" And then he goes over to some other people sitting on a nearby couch. "Hi! I'm Leaf!" I just looked at the lady. She kept calling the kid by name and I couldn't believe these people even existed. Maybe it was Leif, but I doubt this was the type of lady to name her kid after a Viking.    I always wonder if Willam ever takes his own advice. His lips are always so intense. It worries me in some of his videos. He always brings the butthole rule up when he's wearing a very bright and shiny lip.    I'm getting a ball off of this line! How long does the scent last and what scent did you get?    It's through school, so any consumption with alcohol isn't allowed and if caught, we get sent home. Host families are adjusting dinner times for us since they know we're on a different schedule. I would go for the food, but I think we have a curfew.   	89
    It is worth pointing out that this is not "THE" Soviet Shuttle Buran. This is the second shuttle, known as 'Ptichka' that was never complete or flown. Only one Soviet Shuttle was ever fully completed and launch, the Buran which was the first Shuttle ever to be flown into space and land successfully in an unmanned mission. The Ptichka was never completed, being only ever approximately 95% complete   Hey, does everyone remember that time Reddit thanked and upvoted rapists for talking about their crimes on /r/askreddit?

Pretty much all the music (except the last one) is Hans Zimmer. The one you like is called 'Time' from the Inception soundtrack, and is in my humble opinion one of the greatest pieces of recorded sound in existence. Another great one for listening to while working out is the penultimate track near the end, which is 'Why Do We Fall?' from The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack, I recommend it!         linguists hate him.   Se7en. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie and I enjoyed watching it, but the plot never sucked me in completely until the final scene, which had me screaming at the screen!   While this is factually accurate, it is untrue in it's own terms. All foetuses do *not* start out as female before some make a transition to male in utero. **This is a common misconception.** In actual fact all foetuses are naturally hermaphroditic in the womb, before developing male or female characteristics relatively late in pregnancy. Both sexes have characteristics of the other inherited from this early developmental stage; men have nipples, woman have a clitoris (this is an undeveloped penis, and can be stimulated to develop in adult females with the use of steroids) and so on. The proposition that all foetuses start as female is, though widely believed, absurd when you stop to think about it.   /r/showerthoughts   Nooo they didn't   New Zealand.  - Don't piss us off  - Don't make fun of the Haka  - Don't spontaneously combust  - Don't fuck our goats   Pizza buns. You make some nice pizza dough, some tasty tomato sauce, then slice some cheese and pepperoni/salami, maybe a jalepeno or six, wrap the sauce, meet and grated cheese in pizza dough, slap them in the oven for 15 minutes, try not to make too many orgasmic noises while eating.   Before taking drugs, attempt exercise. Seriously. Chemotherapy is often referred to as a sticky-plaster effect, in other words it covers up the problem rather than makes you deal with it. Please, before you start them, join a gym or buy some running shoes, invest in some gym instruction if you can, the internet is full of workout recommendations. After a month or two you will be happier, healthier and genuinely feel better about yourself. About this time last year I was suicidally depressed but refused to take the drugs for personal reasons. Instead I started working out. Now I am about 14kg lighter, feel far more attractive than I ever have before and am able to feel good about myself again at last. I know starting something like this is tough, but if you are in a place where you are considering anti-depressants, any new move is going to be tough. I implore you to try it though, instead of doping yourself out release your aggression and your frustration on a heavy bag or a treadmill or a weight bar. I guarantee that if you persevere, endure and push yourself you will feel a great deal better about yourself. Be strong and stay strong, friend.      This is, rather ironically, bullshit   I repair Apple products in my spare time, I could probably have a look if it's water damage or a smashed screen if you like!

A standard google search of 2013 US Budget will also do the trick   Okay, here is a summation of the Healthcare issue, for what it's worth:  The Republican party are fighting tooth and nail against free-to-all healthcare, hence why the two parties have reached an impasse that is causing the shutdown. There is a great deal of smoke and mirrors surrounding this issue, but what this boils down to, in plain english, is a lot of very powerful people will lose a lot of money if healthcare becomes more reasonably available. The consumer (you) do not stand to lose anything, small businesses will not lose out on anything, however large pharmaceutical companies will lose a colossal amount of revenue.  A note on tax: Universal healthcare may not necessarily mean a tax increase for the average citizen. Setting up a National Healthcare Service may well be expensive to begin with, however it is worth remembering that 57c out of every one of your tax dollars currently goes towards the military. Think about that. Maybe you could build one less battleship and give the American people free healthcare. Besides, even if there is a tax increase, you will still be paying a degree of magnitude less overall per medical complaint, and "free healthcare to all" sounds so much nicer that "I will heal you for money". Every other *civilized* country has some for of universal healthcare, or at the very least doesn't take advantage of human frailty or abandon the elderly. America, you are being left behind.  **EDIT:** Gentleman and ladies, I know that, literally speaking, there is no free-to-all healthcare under ACA. There is also a slight spelling mistake in this comment, you are being pedantic! Big picture time people, stop splitting hairs   Looking at the situation logically, I feel it would be a fair estimation to say that free-to-all healthcare would not damage small business but would significantly damage *big* businesses, i.e the hugely powerful drug companies who pay exorbitant amounts of money to politicians to keep the current status quo in place. Free healthcare means a lot of very powerful people will lose a lot of money. There may be plenty of smoke and long words thrown about, but as far as this observer can detect, that is what it boils down to, in plain english.   Okay, serious question: How will this affect law enforcement? As I understand it the police will still be active, are any other major law enforcement bodies going offline?   *Dear America,*  Bro, sort your shit out.  Regards,  *The rest of the civilised world*  **EDIT:** Hey look, my top rated comment, and I don't give a fuck!   As far as I can tell the Republics are causing this because they don't want free healthcare for all. Am I warm?   Here's a short poem I wrote and posted on /r/shortscarystories:   -  The shortcut through the Corn field  tempts you as you're walking home  the clouds above keep the moon concealed  as you enter the swaying corn, alone.   -  The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,  the path you chose is muddy.  It grows in rows without scope or end  and in the dark, you hurry.   -  You don't see the standing forms  as you pass them on your way,  they stand still amongst the swaying corn  which hides their pallor, and decay.   -  Hundreds gather in this field tonight  though you see none at all,  yet still you look around in fright  but the corn grows too thick, too tall.   -  You tell yourself as you continue through  "it's merely the rustling of the leaves,"  but they see you, and they hear you,  and they might not let you leave.   -  [Here's a link to the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i2nj3/hidden_by_the_rustling_corn/)   What a fucking stupid thing to do. Yes the NSA should **not** be spying on the general public, yes the prevention of terrorism does not justify survaliance of the general population en masse, but to readily distribute software that can prevent spying to the general public is utterly stupid and *will* have negative and possibly catastrophic consequences. McAfee seems to be assuming that the NSA only spies on innocent, nice people. They do, and that is adherent, but going to the other extreme and not allowing the population to be policed is a boorish, ignorant and dangerous reaction.   I just left you another comment below, sorry didn't notice this one until you posted it. I am not disregarding history simply because it has religious connotations. For example much of Muslim history is based around fact. In this particular case however, there is not only a lack of supporting evidence but a large amount of available contrary evidence. I hope you will consider my other message to you   **A**. The Jews were not kept as the slaves to the people of Egypt. No contemporary Egyptian, Roman or any other evidence or account, other than the Torah, which has obvious inference issues. There was no Passover (the slaying of every Egyptian firstborn would surely be recorded as a major event by the Egyptians don't you think? Also, what a kind and loving act of God to kill the children of the oppressors, and not the oppressors themselves),  the Jews did not build the pyramids, they were not eventually set free. We know this because of historical evidence.  **B**. The question of the jewish claim to the holyland is obviously a hugely scrutinised issue today. It has been extensively studied by many archeologists (I can look up names for you but frankly a google search will do it if you are interested and I am tired) and even those with vested interest have admitted there is no evidence whatsoever that there was ever any wandering in the desert. There is however great evidence that Jewish settlements existed in the land we know call the Middle-East, long before the supposed flight of the slaves.  **C**. Your point concerning vested interest. Those who have vested interest in telling you this story are either those who wish to bring you into their church or those who wish to keep you there. Why do you think there are so many splinter churches? I must pass 10 different church sects on my way to work every morning. Religion is a malignancy, it is passed on and can be very hard to shake off, if you have ever tried you have my sympathy, I have been there. I ask you though, as a fellow human being, to question your beliefs, that is all. Please, look rationally at the principals of your faith, the obvious sectarianism it causes, the logical sense of it's teachings and the moral authority of your holy book. You are not a sheep. You are a living, breathing human being. Your life is precious *because* it will never come again. Please, make the most of that fact.   Sir, /u/malefascistadvice is addressing your points coherently and backing up what he is saying, you are being nothing but argumentative. re-read the conversation and adjust your attitude.  And, FYI, The Torah is commonly know as the Old Testament by Christians, they are the same book. I don't know how a fundamentalist such as yourself could not know that!   I know this is totally off topic, but a huge amount of archeological research has been done concerning the flight from Egypt, the rambling in the desert, the jews being kept as slaves etc etc and there is absolutely zero evidence for any of it, and plenty of evidence to the contrary. I'm not sure who's been telling you there is, but I would be willing to bet someone with a vested interest in persuading you so.      Ice Cream and *GOOD* balsamic vinegar. If you use cheap stuff it tastes like shit but some really good stuff, maybe throw in some Palma Ham, fuck a monkey that stuff is fantastic!   Because you told me which one. You really aren't all that intelligent are you.   Er, no you said "*This contradicts the TIL from last week that said he chose to kill himself to spare his family from persecution.*", then I explained why, though you are correct, it doesn't contradict any other TIL post. I apologise of course, it seems you aren't used to people on Reddit being helpful   Its okay, I didn't call you an idiot, it's only my hands that are typing, my mouth and brain have no control   Not necessarily. If you actually read the source material you would see that the Nazis threatened that if he stood trial with the other conspirators his family would also face dire persecution, but if he killed himself they would be treated as the the family of a hero and given his full military honours and pension.

Any more questions just message me! On the whole to cost between 6-7000 GBP   I travelled around the world solo and self-financed when I was 18, saw and experienced a whole mess of things that most other people never will. Highlights are witnessing two violent uprisings (Bangkok and Kathmandu), the burning ghats of Varanasi, coming within inches of a pissed off cobra in Vietnam and seeing the sun rise on Mount Everest.   *Knock Knock*  Who's there?  *Jehovah's Witnesses*    Now they lie, still, in Flanders Fields.   I eat alone, for the first time   Because Russia won't allow it. Thats why there is this whole mess going on now, because Russia is backing Assad, which makes him practically untouchable. That's why there has been all this fuss, otherwise the UN would have gone in as soon as Assad started killing his own people.   The reason that there has still been no action in Syria doesn't have anything to do with democracy or the fact that most people don't want their country to intervene, it is because Russia has stated, quite openly, that a western intervention in Syria would be considered an act of war against Russia.  These are the facts, I have no idea why they are not wider known.   I was considering 'Ride of the Valkyries', just to see what would happen!!      So the story is, boys and girls, I have recently scored a job as a DJ, no worries there, I've done it before I have a fairly sound few playlists for that, but the job is in a strip-club.

Okay boys and girls, gather round and I shall tell you a tale...  In Nepal I crashed a motorbike while driving to the top of a mountain to visit a monastery. It was a big bastard of a bike as well, I was *very* lucky not to break any bones, just a few nasty cuts on my legs which I then patched up myself in my room with iodine and a reusable bandage. That was I think my second day in Nepal, near a town called Pokhara that used to be on the hippy trail. After recovering there for a few days I travelled to the capital, Kathmandu, and within a day or two decided I wanted to trek to Mount Everest Base Camp. To get there I had to fly from Kathmandu on this tiny little airplane that only could hold about 6 people and land deep in the Himalayas at an place called Lukla, which is, I think, the third most dangerous airport in the world in terms of crashes. From there I trekked, alone and with a still bandaged leg, for 9 days through the Himalayas before being forced to turn back because I developed mild AMS (Altitude Sickness) before I could reach base camp. I think it took me 7 days to walk back to Lukla. This was, by the way, through the Himalayas, on my own, with a 22KG backpack wearing Converse trainers, and it was probably the best month of my life, apart from the AMS and busted leg!  Come back next week to hear about the dead bodies in India or the cobra attack in Vietnam!   Know the feeling, people assume I'm being big headed whenever I start a sentence with "When I was in Nepal..." etc, so I don't talk about it. At least you only did two months in Europe, imagine my feel after a year of the whole world!   It would take more than a few lunches to tell all of them, buy me a pint and I shall tell you a tale!   Great kid, don't get cocky!   I travelled round the entire world when I was 18, completely self-financed and unassisted. I worked pretty much none stop for 2 years before I left to afford it and had some pretty wild experiences, the highlights probably being getting AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness, or Altitude Sickness) while climbing in the Nepalese Himalayas, coming face to face with a tiger in Thailand and getting rammed by a bull in Varanasi, India. I never talk about it though, because I don't want to sound big-headed.

No, no it isn't. For one thing they call themselves Communist, which is very different to Socialism. For another things, if I write the word 'Peaches' on a tin of beans, it will still only be beans inside the tin.   That is part of what I was trying to convey, and probably what horrified me the most about that place. They weren't demons or devils, they were human beings with families, fears and plans for their future, just like the people they were being paid to slaughter. If you haven't seen it I recommend the film 'Eichmann', it partly deals with that topic.   You put the word peaches on a tin of beans, you still got beans inside the tin   I guess the name Jimmy Saville has to be mentioned somewhere in this thread. Knighted by the Queen, beloved by all and universally praised for his work, mostly with children. He got away with it all his life. Fucker.   The Captain (Stanley Lord) did go to bed. However several crewmen remained on duty and on the bridge and admitting seeing Titanic's flares, her stern rise from the sea and her lights eventually fail. Several times they crewmen alerted the Captain what was going on. Because the crew acted so evasively under questing at the inquiries into the sinking, no one knows why they failed to act   Damn mind-readers!    The Holocaust.  When I was 16 I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau and it left a huge impression on me. What was unbelievable was the sheer organisation, it wasn't some ritualistic bloodletting or angry slaughter, it was an industrialised effort to efficiently, quietly and assertively wipe out not just one demographic of people, but anyone who was deemed less than human. There are rooms full of shoes, suitcases, clothes, Zyklon B canisters and human hair in Auschwitz, all of them representing individual people with thoughts, lives, parents, hopes and dreams of their own that were all wiped clean from the earth. I remember seeing a plaited ponytail in the room of hair, probably from shaven from a little girls head, and I don't think I will ever forget that detail.  This was the Summa of human evil and depravity and have left their mark on me. I have never since then said the name of that place aloud or discussed it, even with my closest friends of family.  After that experience though I cannot laugh or abide jokes about the Holocaust. Only those who do not understand what it cost humanity can make light of it.   You seem to think Fascists are logical...   You might be referring to the testimony of the watchmen Frederick Fleet when describing the unusual atmospheric conditions that caused them not to spot the iceberg until too late, as there was no moon, no swell and the berg was of dark blue ice (common for icebergs that have recently flipped over) rendering it practically invisible from a distance, however Fleet would say that as it somewhat detracts the blame from himself as lookout.  There are many theories around The Californian as to why it did not come to Titanic's aid, for example that there may have been a third, unknown ship between Titanic and Californian that also happened to be displaying flares, or that Californian did not realise the Titanic was sinking. Both circumstances are extremely unlikely as all crew on the bridge of the Californian admit to seeing Titanic's distress signals and the Second Officer of Californian, Herbert Stone, whilst being question during the inquiry into the sinking admitted that he said to an apprentice "*Look at her* [Titanic] *now...she looks very queer out of the water; her lights are queer.*" Californian's Log book from the night of the sinking mysteriously vanished and all crew acted very evasive during questioning, so no one really knows why Californian failed to act.  Most of my source material here is from the book' Rough Guide to Titanic', so unfortunately I can't provide links, I'm sure all this is on the net somewhere though.

Dulce Et Decorum Est - Wilfred Owen   Personal Trainer here. Popular myths are that it is necessary to diet and work out. In some cases it is, but if you are just trying to be healthy eat normally and do lots of cardio work.   Another myth, and a very common one, is that you lift a weight, and you gain muscles, easy! No. No, no, no! There are hundreds of different ways to use weights to build muscle, simply pumping a few weights without knowing what you're doing won't do it. You need to decide which muscles or muscle groups to work on and find out where your absolute strength/endurance limit is. Then add an extra 10lb. We call it 'systematic overload', you give you muscles slightly too much to cope with and it causes them to strengthen, think of it like supply and demand. Your body knows it needs more muscle to work, so it strengthens it. Simply throwing a few weights about won't do the trick. For arms or back the trick is to find a weight you struggle with and do about 3 sets of 12-15 reps. If you can finish the last set without crying, it's not heavy enough! It is very important to learn how to use weights properly though, make sure you get good instruction before doing anything big! Seriously!  The same is true of running. Again, get someone to teach you how to do it properly, or don't bother at all. You may think this is silly, but running incorrectly can put huge strain on you legs and ankles: I once broke my leg while training for a marathon! I developed a stress fracture and was dumb enough to ignore the pain and keep running on it, until it broke and I missed the marathon! So take gym safety seriously people!  **TL;DR** - read the damn post you lazy bastards, it's not that long!  **EDIT:** Okay a whole heap of rather pedantic people are taking issue with my 'don't worry about dieting' advice. The point here is that when a human body engages in large amounts of physical exercise, especially when the body in question is not used to strenuous exercise, it causes large amounts of muscle and tissue damage, which is good as that breaks down fat and causes muscles to grow. In order to repair and recover after a taxing workout, the body will be using several times more food matter, especially protein, than normal. If a person were to eat nothing but salad and then try to run a marathon, that person would collapse after half a mile. Depending on the exercise, it is vitally important to have a high calorie, high protein diet while engaging in extremely strenuous exercises. Now, as I'm sure not many people reading this are going to run any marathons in the near future, they don't need to up their calorie intake. Consciously reducing your calorie or protein intake however will give you less energy (ergo forcing you to abandon the workout sooner) and prevent proper muscle recovery, therefore it is advisable to continue eating normally, as the body will already be experiencing enough shock without an extra spanner in the works. Once a workout routine is established, you may wish to gradually migrate to a healthier diet.   I have oversimplified somewhat here, but I hope I have made this understandable to all.

The reason the UN (here incorrectly referred to as 'The West') has not intervened before in Syria is ***Russia***.  Russia is a close ally with Syria because Russia's oil supply is mostly distributed via pipelines that run through Syria. For that reason, Russia has made it extremely difficult for any kind of outside intervention to happen in Syria, as the message they are sending is simply '*you fuck with Assad, you fuck with us.*" It basically has meant that Al-Assad and the rest of the Syrian Government has basically had Carte-Blanche to do what it likes. The thing is they have now crossed so many lines that the world is starting to squirm, but still no action is being taken because no one wants to upset Russia. Any move to displace the Syrian Government, particularly by the US, would therefore be seen as a direct military move against Russia.  It is the same reason that North Korea is untouchable, except in that case it is China that prevents outside intervention.

For the first time in history the rate of human population has started to increase at exponential speed. Before this present period in history the general population remained steady as life expectancy was far shorter and infant mortality was far more common. The world population only topped 1 billion in approximately 1810. Now there are 7 billion, a 2 billion increase in the last 20 years. This planet is an isolated system, we only have so much energy and as the population increases the energy becomes spread out far too wide and is rendered ultimately useless and finite. No new energy can be created capable of sustaining an exponentially growing population: the human race is, quite simply, unsustainable. The only hope is the discovery of a new boundless energy source (which on principal contradicts the first and second laws of thermodynamics), or extraterrestrial colonisation. It's going to be a scary century.  **EDIT:** Energy in this sense does not only pertain to electricity. Fuel in general is what is meant, be it mechanical, biological or simply food.

 Really? It makes me glad that when women have a pregnancy they can't afford, they have options besides knitting needles and infanticide.  Infanticide was appallingly common throughout history, of course. I'll take abortion any day of the week over infanticide.    How often women with children regret having children.  Do you know, I actually know multiple people whose parents have told them one of the following:  1. They regret having children. 2. They regret having had children when they did, and if they could do it all over again they'd abort the first child(ren) and only have the later one(s). 3. They regret having as many children as they did, and if they could do it all over again they'd abort the last child(ren) and only have the first one(s).  These parents weren't all abusive assholes either, who might be expected to say *anything*. Some of them, as near as I can tell, are good parents... who, in retrospect, realize they screwed up and really regret their reproductive choices.   I can think of dozens of incorrect ways, and they mostly all start with assuming we've got no agency.   We're not sure. At least several weeks, but past that....  Also, did you know you double posted?   Nice username.                           FREEDOM.  (I think?)                                                                                 I think it's entirely possible to look at a complex situation like the Syrian Civil War, where multiple parties are engaged in conflict, and come to the conclusion that there's more than one "bad guy".  IS is bad, but that doesn't make the Syrian government *good*.   The Syrian government has a habit of using barrel bombs on civilian populations, and there are multiple reports of chemical attacks as well. This isn't a one-off.   Jews and Muslims.   It does not show that it increases the chance. It shows that there is a correlation between those who are circumcised and those who are autistic. (Or at least I assume it does. I haven't read the article.) It does not show causation, however - it is possible (probable, really) that in Denmark, circumcision is only common in one or two minority ethnic groups. It is possible that those groups are simply more prone to autism already.   We know that autism runs in families. We also know that most Danes don't circumcise - ritual circumcision is probably limited to Muslims and Jews. Is it possible that either of those groups is simply more likely to be autistic? (Yes, I know that Muslims are not an ethnicity, but Muslim immigration in Denmark isn't from all over the Muslim world, is it?)   The Syrian government isn't exactly the side of the angels either. Strange as it may seem, sometimes in a conflict it's possible for *both* sides to be really fucked up.

Now you are simply claiming that "terrorists are using the refugee streams", something that could be proven true so long as you can find a single terrorist who has done such a thing.  The worst part, however, is that you are acting as though those two statements are the same when they are not.   If you believe Breitbart.

You hear terrible things because terrible things get eyeballs.   Does this scale? Like, if only some English speakers have a word for that thing on the end of a shoelace that keeps it from unraveling (the aglet), does that mean that those speakers who don't know that word perforce don't have a concept for that, despite literally seeing it every time they look down and occasionally having to throw out old laces if they break in that spot?   What's the alternative? To divide the world into transfolk and *normal* people? I mean, we could do that, but given the value-laden feel of words like normal, we probably shouldn't. (Normal doesn't mean better, or superior, or correct, except when it does.)         A ban?  I just downvote Fail articles. I figure if it's good enough for Vernon Dursley, then, well, he can keep it.               No, although it is unusual to find the atheist who *does* believe in supernatural beings such as ghosts.   Wow. That's something else.   Stonewords is a great book, but definitely not the one you're looking for.   Then you'll grow out of it in a short time. Sometimes children do go through phases, yes. It doesn't harm them to go along with it, though.  Puberty blockers are started at the age of puberty, or during precocious puberty. A ten or twelve year old is probably no longer going through silly phases where they would like to be a "butterfly" when grown. If they've been saying for years that they are really a girl (or boy), they probably know whereof they speak.  In between birth and puberty, if your child-with-a-penis wants to wear a dress, it doesn't harm that child to let them do it. And if your child-with-a-vagina wants to be called "Tom", again, it doesn't harm them to just go along with this. If it's a phase, they'll ask you to stop sooner or later. If it's not, they won't. Either way, they'll remember their childhood as being filled with love and acceptance.  Children never, ever, ever forget how you made them feel.    If they're at a point where they're cutting themselves, they have deeper psychological issues than simply not knowing what gender they are.  They do know what gender they are. It's the other people around them who sometimes don't.   I don't think it's unreasonable to hold off on labeling a kid that young.  Nobody minds labeling babies as girls or boys, and we've found that when children say they're a girl or boy, they usually don't change their minds at adulthood.  See, this isn't something where we need to debate it out. We already have the facts.   There aren't terribly many out transgender individuals in the world to date, so it's normal for people not to understand.   What I have found, through the advantage of being a few years older than you :) and also through happening to fall into the neurodiversity movement as a young woman is that it doesn't really matter if I understand another person's self-identification or not. All I have to grasp is that it is important to *them*, however strange it might seem to me. If I start with that attitude, I usually come to understand whatever-it-is over time, and without the stress. (I also ended up gathering a rather diverse set of friends this way. So much more interesting than only having friends who are like me!)  But if you're interested in the subject, googling "transgender 101" will get you a variety of links on the subject. Some are a little more adamant (http://www.tranarchism.com/2010/11/26/not-your-moms-trans-101/) and some are a little more easy-going (http://www.transpeoplespeak.org/trans-101/).    Children are very articulate at a young age. When your child at two  says "I'm a girl" and at three says "I won't wear those shoes, they're for boys and I'm a girl" and at four says "I won't go swimming in those, those are for boys, I'm a girl, I want a bikini" and at five says "Stop calling me Charlie, that's a boy's name, I want to be Anna"... well, at a certain point you have to pick up on the hint.  ALL preschoolers who are developing normally understand what gender they are. Sometimes other people don't understand *them*, but this is normal behavior for children.  And some of those kids will attempt to self-mutilate to get their bodies to look like they want.   That would have been great. That would have been *really* great.   So he doesn't betray Voyager to the Kazon, which would be silly because the Kazon are useless. He betrays them to somebody he thinks can actually get him home faster. Maybe we bump into Equinox sooner and he sells out secrets to *them*. Or some other mislaid Alpha Quadrant ship.   One doesn't become transgender. It's not a choice. One knows from early childhood whether one is male or female. The only question is whether other people acknowledge that or not.   Edit: Just realized I accidentally erased non-binary people. Whoops. Didn't mean to do that, also didn't want to confuse the tyro here.   We've seen other trained Starfleet officers go to the bad.      I've been saying for ages that they screwed over a perfectly good character with Seska. Your rewrite is elegant and effective.  (Plus, unlike Seska, Carey has a right-now reason to be pissy and backstabby - he got effectively demoted in favor of a Maquis. Seska was just betraying them for the hell of it, as near as I can tell.)   Because the two scouting programs aren't affiliated in any way, shape, or form.  Also, you are conflating gender identity with sexual orientation. To put it loosely, your gender is who you are, and your sex is what's between your legs, and your orientation is who you wanna screw.   So your idea of reality is more important than how you treat other people. Nice.   You think you're taking a bold stand for THE TRUTH, but really? You're just being a jerk.   ...have you read *any* case files?   Then you go off the blockers and enter puberty as usual, just a little later than most people.    But that's not what transgender children do. They don't say "I want to bake, and that's for girls" they say "I am a girl" and cry if you ask them to wear boy's clothes and try to cut themselves.  Your advice is just peachy for kids who say "I want to play soccer, not paint my nails". It's not good advice for children who say "I am a boy, I am a boy, whatever you say, I'm a boy".   When the seven year old told me she was a dog, all I said was "Okay, Spot". She grew out of it. If she'd told me she was a boy I would've said "Okay, Son". She probably would not have grown out of it, but if she had, there would have been literally no harm done.  Children always remember how you make them feel.   You need to be an adult in order to take hormones (fairly common) or have surgery (not so common - you can't show it off, exactly, and as I'm told it's not highly successful), but you don't need to be an adult to use your chosen name or wear clothes of the "other" gender or take hormone blockers to delay puberty.   Actually, no, scientists have done no such thing. Are you aware that mosaicism (where an individual can have some cells xx and some xy) is more common in transgender individuals than cisgender individuals?    For somebody who doesn't give a shit about them, your comments sure sound like screeds.   When you were seven, I bet you knew whether you were a girl or boy, right?   Yes, there is "such a thing as a transgender girl". Most children know whether they are boys or girls in preschool, hence, most transgender children know they are boys or girls in preschool - whether or not other people think their genitals match.   And it can be frightening. It's not uncommon to hear of transgender girls trying to cut off their penises, for example.  Yes, this is possible without "significant environmental factors". This happens in accepting families where a child who says they are a boy (or girl) is allowed to use their chosen name and wear clothes of that gender, and this happens in non-accepting families where those children are told they're sinful and wrong.  Gender identity has no connection to sexual orientation. It has nothing to do with "being gay". Your sexual orientation is who you want to sleep with or date. Your gender identity is who you are. Your sex is (roughly) what's between your legs.   Surgery is actually apparently not that common. Hormone treatment is more common, as it's more useful in day-to-day life.  And no, one does not perform surgery or give hormone treatment to minors. At most, minors use hormone blockers between puberty and adulthood. If they go off the hormone blockers - a drug we've used safely for years to treat precocious puberty - they simply enter puberty as normal.    My guess is that they'll accept both mtf and ftm individuals.    Giving your boy a girls name and telling them they are a girl their whole adolescent life seems psychologically dangerous.   You're right. Telling a child who insists she is a girl that she is REALLY a boy just because of how her body looks IS psychologically dangerous. Children whose self-identification is not accepted run a high risk of depression, self-harm, and even suicide - even when they're quite young.  This is not my ignorant supposition. That's why the accepted treatment for gender dysphoria is transition, because transition is the treatment associated with a reduction in depression, self-harm, and suicide.     I'd rather go by physical evidence than by word of mouth.   Why? Seriously, how does it benefit you to make other people feel like shit?   Well, I think that answers my question. Nice talking to you, *doc*.   Most boys enjoy arts, crafts, and baking as well, if they're allowed to experience those things.   Yeah, hormone blockers are not the same as hormone therapy. If you stop taking the blockers, you enter puberty just like normal.  Also: Don't link to the Daily Fail, please. Whenever you're tempted to do so, just remind yourself that that's the paper *Vernon Dursley* reads.    If it were genetics then we would see identical twins undergoing the same experience with gender dysphoria.   Not necessarily. For example, we know that schizophrenia is highly heritable, but having an identical twin with schizophrenia only gives you a 50% chance of developing it yourself.  Additionally, many conditions are congenital that are not genetic in nature. We know that fraternal twins where one is female-bodied and one is male-bodied are more likely to have at least one twin be transgender than singletons, probably due to hormones in utero.   Well, it's better than them thinking that we go "Let's chop it off!!!!"  *headdesk*   No other comment on this thread suggests that. Indeed, I'm pretty sure you're the only person - pro or con - who has made any statements about using hormones in childhood.   Children state that they are boys and girls BEFORE they know that different people have differently shaped genitals.   So you're saying that when ANY seven year old says "I'm a girl" or "I'm a boy" we should tell them they're wrong?   One doesn't transition until adulthood.  Or, rather, one doesn't undergo hormone therapy or surgery until adulthood.  And no, what tends to laed to self-harm is lack of acceptance.   Young children are NOT put on hormones. However, many are put on hormone blockers - a treatment which has been used for decades in treating early puberty, and which is accepted as safe - until majority. At that time, if they change their mind, they can simply go off the blockers and puberty will begin as normal.  Alternatively, they can start hormones as adults, and the transition will  be easier and their appearance will more correctly look like other men/women because they won't have gone through the "wrong" puberty.   They're not too young. ALL children develop their gender identity in preschool.  If a child with a penis is not "too young" to determine that they are a boy, and a child with a vulva is not "too young" to determine that they are a girl, then the converse is true as well.  "I'm willing to bet money less than half would transition after puberty and they would all live happy lives."  You would lose that bet. People who have more education than you have spent years, even decades studying the subject. Lack of acceptance is associated with depression and self-harm - even in small children.   Where has this happened?   Well, they don't conclude they're transgender. (That's the accepted term, by the way.) They conclude that they're a girl or a boy.   When you were small, before you knew that people's genitals differed, how did you know you were a girl or a boy? You knew you wanted to act like grown ups of your gender, and you wanted to fit in with other children of your gender, and that you didn't want to do things that were associated with the OTHER gender.  That's all. It's the same for transgender children.   Except that transition is the accepted treatment for gender dysphoria. Transition is associated with a reduction in suicide and depression. "Helping people stay in touch with reality" is associated with an increase in those things.  If you came to me and said you were a dolphin, I wouldn't think you were crazy, I'd think it was none of my damn business.    And honestly how many transgender kids are there?  Transgender individuals (based on self-reporting) appear to comprise about .5% of the population. If we assume troop sizes of about 10 girls each, and that transgender girls are as likely to join girl scouts as not, then that's 1 in 20 troops having to deal with this.  However, it can actually be dangerous to identify as transgender, and there's a distinct lack of understanding and awareness around this issue. We're reasonably certain that our numbers are lower than reality, because many transgender individuals won't admit it, even on an anonymous survey. (And the situation gets more complicated with children, as their parents have to accept it for the kid to get anywhere with that.) So we don't really know how many transgender kids there are, nor how many might take advantage of this policy.    quite frankly I don't know anyone who was transgender at that age so it was never even an issue.  I know multiple transgender people, and to my knowledge at least 75% of them knew they were trans at that age.   I don't know what sort of public bathrooms you use, but here we have a nifty thing called "stalls".   It's not "ludicrous". Most children know what gender they are in preschool. We only call it strange when what they know doesn't seem to match up with their external genitalia.  Denying a child's stated gender identity carries a real risk of depression and self-harm - even for very young children. And it's much harder to transition as an adult if you've already gone through puberty as the wrong gender. (Puberty blockers are plenty safe. We've used them for decades to treat precocious puberty. All they do is they prevent puberty. If, upon reaching adulthood, the individual decides NOT to take hormones to transition, they simply go off the blockers and enter puberty in the usual way.)   And where did you get your degree, doctor?   Do you insist that your child with a vagina "sexually mature" before calling herself a girl? Do you think it's odd that children with penises are allowed in preschool to call themselves boys?   Well, money being fungible I'm not sure that works. Either way, that sends a message that this sort of donation with discriminatory strings attached is acceptable.   The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America are not affiliated in any way, shape, or form.  The Boy Scouts tends towards the right - hence their ban of gay members until very recently, their ongoing ban of atheists, etc.  The Girl Scouts tends towards the left - they don't care about the religious affiliation (or lack thereof) of their members, they've been fairly LGBT positive for a few decades, and so on.  More liberal families who want their boys in scouting programs go for groups like Campfire USA or Spiral Scouts, however, none of these have anything like the numbers of Boy Scouts so some just hold their nose and join Boy Scouts anyway. And Conservative Christian families who want their girls in scouting programs join American Heritage Girls or Royal Rangers, both of which seem to also have male analogs.   Your sex is, roughly, what's between your legs.  Your gender is whether you feel like a girl or a boy.  Most children know what gender they are in preschool. And for most children, it matches up neatly - children with a penis and testicles know they are male, children with vulvas and vaginas know they are female. Nobody questions this, until it goes the other way and a child with a penis knows she's a female or a child with a vulva knows he's male.   Your gender identity isn't a decision.   Call up your parents. Ask them when you started saying you were a girl (or a boy) and saying things like "Girls do this" or "I don't want to wear those, those are for boys (girls)".   Unless you were highly unusual, this was in preschool.  That's a normal developmental timetable for ALL children.  When you tell children that what they know about themselves is false, you run a high risk of depression and self-harm - even in preschoolers. Whatever you might like to think on the subject, it's not too much for the attitude you espouse to hurt children.   Gender identity is something that forms in most children in preschool - for both cisgender and transgender children.   If your female-bodied child goes around telling people she's a girl, do you correct her and say "No, honey, you don't get to say that until you're in puberty"? Of course not! Ridiculous! So why do you think that transgender children don't know?   Well, the trouble is that transgender children don't get a choice. Would you have them excluded from all organizations just so your children don't "need to be concerned"?   No, and in the US the two groups haven't been affiliated in many decades. The Girl Scouts also doesn't care about the religious affiliation or lack thereof of its members.   The same way a cisgender child knows they're a girl or boy.  Children usually form their gender identity in preschool. A seven year old who does NOT know whether they're a girl or a boy would be very unusual.                  Maybe he can never be bothered to update his antivirus protection. (This isn't a joke, I'm serious. If I were a sentient computer, I'd be very concerned about malware.)   True. NYC is in the Northeast, and our dialect is the best. AND NO I AM NOT JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE I AM A NEW YORKER. Really! *Really!!!!*   Did he actually commit murder? Did he willingly torture when not ordered to do so? Did he actively hunt down Harry and his friends, or give them up?   That book, incidentally, showed me why Snape can't stand Hermione. I'm convinced it's because his standards are simply higher than that of most of the other teachers. He's absolutely right, Hermione *does* just memorize and regurgitate the textbook. She's hopeless when it comes to novel work, which is probably *why* she was so pissy that the modified instructions worked so much better than the "official" ones.   Indeed, the HBP was, based on the marginalia, an interesting, potentially likeable person... two adjectives almost *never* applied to Severus Snape outside of the fanfic.   I'm a fan of Dudley Dursley and the New Normal.  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7638156/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-New-Normal   Harry is not the world's most observant protagonist, and Ron is even less so. If Hermione had taken a really good look I'm sure she would have seen, but she was in a snit that whole term over the "unofficial" instructions, wasn't she?   Extenuating circumstances - he was a minor when most of his crimes were committed, and he was under extreme duress with threats against his life and the lives of his parents.  I also wouldn't be surprised if, as in Germany after the war, there was some official forgiveness for people who committed lower-level crimes, simply because a full reckoning would have devastated the population.   And ironically, the poorer you are, the more expensive the nearest grocery store is likely to be. (More expensive, with worse quality food and a smaller selection.) Poor people are a captive audience.   Only a small minority of states allow one to purchase hot food or food at restaurants with SNAP.   While it makes intuitive sense that poor people should buy whole foods and cook them, remember that many poor people - such as the homeless - do not have easy access to a kitchen.        	200

 How you liking the essors? Going back and forth between them, archetypes, and open pros.   mine is shipping :) Was really on the fence about going aluminum, but they seem solid for the price.  The lifetime warranty is pretty good to have as well.     Cheap conversion.  Step 1 buy a cog.  Step 2 tighten the cog.  Done     I think modders should have options.  The games industry is risky,  What if they want a stable job and to make a little extra money here and there via mods.   In the press demo there was unique classes.    I agree, I've been with ting for about 2 years.  I have 2 phones on my plan and my bill ranges between 40-60 a month.  Hopefully Google pricing will be competitive,   I might not switch but maybe they will drive tings prices further down.   Whenever I'm up against a player who is making incredibly weird shots or pre-firing corners that aren't normal corners I will usually report them.  It's just easier and less dramatic than trying to call them out in chat.   Should I rest assured knowing that if they are just really good they won't get banned?  How do you deal with a potential hacker?  I'd just feel horrible if someone got banned for being better than someone else.   Those crap cg Dragon babies tell me that they have no money for good animators.  I can't attest to anything past season 1.   Thickslick makes sausages O.o   why is everyone still surprised when hbo go doesn't work on the premier of game of thrones. servers are expensive and they can't use one night a year as a baseline or else they will be hemorrhaging money   So i'm going computer to receiver to tv, and when I make a youtube video fullscreen it briefly gives me a black screen.  Seems like it temporarily loses connection.  I'm guessing it has to do with resolution variables, but its only through youtube.  Other online videos are fine, and youtube ad's are fine.  right when the ad finishes playing it goes black briefly.   I never had this issue when plugged straight into my tv, and its fine when I use a monitor.  Its not the end of the world (it only lasts a few seconds)  I figure maybe there is some weird hdmi setting I'm missing.   Absolutely not legit.  Read the footer, it says "powered by http://ray-europa.com"  if you go to ray europa you can see it was shut down for selling counterfeit ray-bans.     If you play better at that res then why not.  The only issue is limited visibility, but if you play a position with the same group of people it shouldn't be bad.   I love my rangers, but personally I'd probably get hiking boots.  If you are potentially walking hundreds of miles/thousands of miles you might want boots with treads on them.  Something more functional.   Yes   I got into dark souls late, and ds2 wasn't my cup of tea.  I want to get into the multiplayer this time around, so long as the servers start working one day.  Anyhow what is the "agreed" upon level to stop at?  I'm ~80 now and don't want to jump up too high.  Also, is there a "soul level" or err equivalent?   Yup   I think its a token so you can but his armor in the insight shop.   Psn is down for me, maybe it will let you ring your bells but it's not actually connecting you.  Maybe try choosing and opening your games and double checking is online.   That's super weird, especially when he pulled the scythe back out mid attack.  Something similar happened when I fight martyr logarius,  not quite that bad though.     Me too, it was working fine a few hours ago.  Think it might be down.   I've killed every boss I can find in every area (I've found), and have no idea where to go.  I haven't gone into a dungeon yet, so I'm guessing I should probably do that?   It happened 2 times in a row,  So I think it might have to do with the fact I spent 2 insight prior.  Especially if other people have been toying with that idea.   I tried summoning twice and didn't find anyone.  I think it went from 24 to 22.  So it could be possible of I hit the threshold just right.    I don't think it was glitched because it happened twice in a row.  The first time I was doing a lot of dodging in anticipation for his magic attacks, which never came.  The second time I just went right in his face from the get go.   The past day or so I've had lots of problems with Logarius.  Figured I'd take time to grind levels, my health was low and he'd almost one shot me, absolutely 2 shot me.    I cranked up my health a bit and went back.  He didn't do any aoe orbs or the big close range skull.  He did do the small skull missiles when I approached, and his melee attacks.  I pretty much backed him in the corner and stun locked him the entire fight.  I guess I could have been playing way too passive when I had low health, but he used to do the aoe balls as I approached him.  I guess a wins a win, but it was a bit underwhelming.  I didn't even get to use the blood flasks I ground prior.   Practice parries on the cinder block guys, they are easy to learn on.  Skip the 2 big beasts on the bridge, they will wreck your shit early in the game.    So long as you are enjoying your time with the mechanics you shouldn't worry about progressing quickly.  Obviously veterans of the series are going to get through quicker than you.    You could also look up epicnamebro on youtube,  he helped me a ton in learning the ropes for ds1.  His bloodborne videos are coming along very well.   I gave up and summoned for his fight.  I'm extremely bad at human sized boss fights,  I can't read animations very well.  The first 2/3rd of the fight reminded me of the artorias of the abyss fight, which I hated.  I'm on my 6th boss right now, and nothing gave me problems like father g.  I didn't want to summon, but I tried for 6 hours...  I was also under leveled, and skipped the first boss by mistake.   I'm just going purely off one shotting bosses.  I haven't yet in bloodborne, and I did multiple times in ds2.    I also play way too passively, so that's my own issue.   Assuming her husband is a ds veteran.  Also it's way harder than ds2.        Your husband week just got rougher   Fuck a fireplace, let's warm up by this Ridley!

Should I just give up on my purple hammer upgrade and start a new hammer?  Am I supposed to just be doing expeditions and hoping for the best?   Wait for oleds to go down.  Why get an early 4k tv when nothing is broadcasted in 4k.  Technology will get better and cheaper.

Oh and what kind of press is your school using?  Assuming it's a digital ink jet type joint, really cool you can print on canvas in school!     The p ruins it for me.        Another t shirt comment.   Game publisher contacts youtube personality and pays them some amount of money for a steam recommendation.    Now steam curators need to disclose if they were payed for their recommendation.  Essentially it's a way to make sure the customers are getting accurate and unbiased opinions of a game.   I'm guessing it's such a small amount of money it doesn't make much of a difference.  Offer x YouTuber a couple hundred dollars and a free game for a steam recommendation.  It isn't so much a marketing issue, and proper writers on big name games media sites already had policies to follow.  The weird thing is X youtuber can still get payed to make a YouTube video, they just can't give it a steam recommendation without disclosure.  Essentially what matters are how many people follow steam recommendations vs just watching their favorite youtube personalities.         Yea it could potentially be great,  in just not sure how big of an impact it will have, or how they can enforce it.  Thought it was interesting though.      Pro: you get to play both consoles exclusive games.  Con: there aren't that many exclusive games to begin with.  I normally don't tell people to get a pc, but if your thinking about owning both consoles then money probably isn't a huge issue.  So a pc might be something worth looking into for you.   It's not going to make front page of iTunes, no one will discover it anyhow.  Unless they add featuring Taylor swift to the title.   How long ago did you listen to system of a down, did you listen to anything in between system and the death grips, how old are you? So many questions.

Not incredibly popular, but it had plenty of fun little games in it.      A round or two of smash when you need a zelda break.   No backwards compatibility.  There is the streaming service, and it has limited games.  I'm sure you could find an exact list somewhere.  There is no downloads for any old games, ps1,2, or 3.

 I don't. Intel is misleading as hell. They are currently replacing former Haswell-based Celerons and Pentiums that cost $100-$160, with Atoms, and calling them the same. And the worst part is nobody is really figuring it out. Intel is selling $30 chips for $160.   Indeed.   http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/02/arm_test_results_attack_intel/   The battery life sucks because it has to do emulation (especially for games).   But very few performance improvements since Sandy Bridge.                        Also what about pardoning Chelsea Manning and publicly calling Snowden a whistleblower and giving him immunity to return to US?   We did it, Roddit!                              With a title like that, the article doesn't deserve to be read, even if the total opposite is displayed in the article (which I assume isn't the case here anyway).                        Giving the fingerprint data to a 3rd party or even a 2nd party's servers is *never* acceptable.  Plus, there now ways to use a fingerprint to authenticate to a third party site, too. Check out Microsoft's Passport technology, which will also be part of FIDO 2.0. It will authenticate [locally](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-passport-passwordless-login,28767.html), and then create a public key to authenticate you to another site (or something along those lines). Your fingerprint data will never have to leave the device to log you to other sites.   So we only have to wait a year or so until we get that. There's no need to risk our fingerprints to someone else's servers right now.            "What exactly ar you worried about if people have your password to all websites you'll ever sign-up to in the future"  - he asks.   What do you do with the 99% who will have no idea they are sending their fingerprints to the Chinese government and who knows how many other hackers in China.  Remember you can't actually *change* your fingerprint if it's take like this. This would affect you for the rest of your life, and we're only going to use fingerprint readers more in the future. You don't want it to be in the hackers' databases and rival countries' databases.  This is MUCH WORSE than them having your social security number.   What the actual fuck? Why the hell would I want my device to be fully authenticated and logged in **before I receive it**?  OnePlus needs to die as a company just for suggesting this enormous stupidity.   Horrifying. As if there isn't enough Chinese hacking going on. Now they're asking us to *willingly* giving them our fingerprints.  Fuck off, OnePlus!

FBI: If mathematicians don't want to make division by zero possible, we'll legally force them to do it!   Ars Technica, along with other sites, can you please *stop* giving these psychopaths a platform on which to advertise their messages?                  Skype does it, too.                     Nope:  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-may-not-be-ticking-with-customers-2015-07-07   But Nokia/the division Microsoft bought made 95% of the Windows Phones on the market.  And something doesn't have to be dead DEAD to be called that. For instance, Blackberry is dead...yet the company still makes phones.                  Hillary Clinton is not the only alternative, you know?                        Really? You'd want to use Windows 7 on a 5" screen? I find even 10" screens impractical for a full OS like Windows.   But why?!      Considering 14nm only "technically" came out in 2014 (like in the last 2 weeks of the year and in like 2 machines), but in reality it shipped most devices in 2015, I don't think we'll see Intel's 10nm until 2017. If anything Intel's process delays have been increasing lately as they try to move to smaller process nodes.   So call for a hearing and ask them about it, rather than throwing wild accusations.         Blackberry is giving out its encryption keys to governments around the world (*especially* consumers' keys). I wouldn't put much trust into their "security".            Since we're on the crazy speculation train, here's one for you.  "Anonymous" could be anyone, including the FBI. In fact the last time "Anonymous" was a strong group and did all of those "operations", one of their main guys, who had a role in *coordinating* the attacks, was an [FBI mole](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/hacker-sabu-defends-informing-anonymous-fbi-interview).  So what if it's the FBI that hacked the NYSE, in the same day that the chief of FBI was doing a [Senate hearing](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/08/fbi-doj-name-new-enemy-crypto-wars-apple-google/) on encryption backdoors and trying to tell the world how we're all doomed if they don't get their backdoors?  Too crazy for the FBI to be trying to do a false flag operation like that just to get the US population to support encryption backdoors (their holy grail apparently), especially when they seem pretty desperate that the House is against their proposals (seen in the last 2 House hearings)?!   Would that be  more or less crazy than FBI ["assisting"](http://fair.org/home/zero-for-40-at-predicting-attacks-why-do-media-still-take-fbi-terror-warnings-seriously/) dozens of [terrorist plots](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book) on U.S. soil?  Or it could be only a technical error, like the NYSE has [already said](https://www.nyse.com/market-status/history).   Or MS writing off again [aQuantive](http://allthingsd.com/20120702/microsoft-writing-off-nearly-all-of-the-6-3-billion-it-paid-for-aquantive/) for another $6.3 billion.  And I bet in 2-3 years they'll write off the $8 billion Skype acquisition, too, because there's no way they will recover that money by the half of the 21st century. Unless they're counting all [DoD contracts](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/score-microsoft-defense-department-windows/) as [ROI](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_for_skype_pwnage/) for the [Skype business](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2220079/microsoft-subnet/microsoft-patent-may-ruin-skype--may-make-voip-spy-and-pry-easy-for-gov-t.html).     Is America under attack again?  I don't even know what that means. You realize American corporations, just like UK corporations and German corporations and Chinese corporations are hit by hacking attempts all the time, right?  It seems silly to phrase it that way.                  [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/).               So...do people still believe that Nokia made the right choice picking Windows Phone, now that not only Windows Phone failed, but the whole company got disassembled by the company that got it into this mess - Microsoft?                                                                                                   Also, I think the author is forgetting Android M will allow users to "adopt" SD card storage as internal storage.   Or [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/)? And maybe in combination with [Snow](https://github.com/zrm/snow) for further client anonymity.                        Says ExtremeTech, the technology-oriented website that doesn't use encryption.                           Will the deals be more or less misleading than the Black Friday ones? I think there was a statistics made after last year's Black Friday and something like only 1% were *actual* deals. The rest were scams (inflated prices that got "discounted").   Please don't.    But this slow, calculated approach to releasing Windows 10 can only be a good thing. It shows a lot of foresight and careful planning,  Oh what a load of crap. This is because Windows 10 couldn't be finished on time. So they decided to release it only to a small group first to make sure their unfinished Windows 10 doesn't brick too many people's PCs.  /r/Microsoft seems to be a bigger circlejerk than /r/androidcirclejerk - and the latter is ironic.    Do you really think 1/4 of the *total Windows userbase* (including those on 10 year old PCs and enterprise customers) are going to 1) know about the Windows 10 release day and 2) want to download the Windows 10 upgrade in the same day?  A bit optimistic don't you know? Like by about an order of magnitude or two?  Like 95% of Windows consumers get Windows with a new laptop not through upgrades.         Last I checked Aether was pretty slow. Could you rewrite it in Golang? I think that would better support multiple users and would also be a memory safe language.  Also, any way you can tie [this](https://github.com/zrm/snow) into it for anonymity purposes or is that something only the users or the OS vendors could enable?   What about [this](https://github.com/zrm/snow)?                                                   This is more about companies using such encryption in a way that they don't infringe on the users' privacy, but can still perform useful operations on that data.                                                   Nu. Ce e cu atata "reunificare" dupa zeci si sute de ani? O luam si noi pe urma Rusiei? Incepem sa cerem si ce pamanturi ne-o mai fi luat Ungaria si Ucraina dupa aia?  Mi se pare stupid sa vii dupa 100 de ani sa "ceri pamantul inapoi" sau chestii de genul. Pe urma acestor lucruri se pornesc multe razoaie, care ar fi putut fi completat evitate daca nu ar exista lacomia (pentru resurse...ceea ce nu e cazul aici) si simtul asta de "reunificare".  Si nici nu mai vorbesc de faptul ca o reunificare cu Republica Molvoda ne-ar saraci pe toti, pentru ca Romania ar trebui sa dea lor si celor de acolo pentru pensii, scoli, drumuri si toate cele, la fel de multi cum se da si aici.         Okay.   "forced" to do it...if we want them to give us those big fat [DoD contracts](http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/04/us-department-of-defense-signs-617-million-windows-8-deal/).   http://maidsafe.net/   http://ipfs.io/  The PirateBay was working on a browser for P2P websites too, called Project Maelstrom.   More like (in)security app.         With 4k display!  Because OEMs can never miss an opportunity to cancel out any battery life improvements they might be adding to their phones through some other piece of technology.   Yes and no. They also released Z2 soon after the Z1, and it was just as stupid then.  	200
 AHH! He got me again!      Fatal Attraction, with Michael Douglas   Like I told OP I just posted a Shadowrun lfg on the sub and was wondering if you're interested as well. Here's a link to it http://redd.it/2n5ezn   Hi I just posted a Shadowrun lfg on the sub and was wondering if you're interested. Here's a link http://redd.it/2n5ezn   Hi i sent you a message a while ago to let you know I'm interested in playing.   Hi guys, i'm looking for a copy of kane and lynch 2.   Well the PC 2k sports game's have always been just a port of the console ones. What he's saying is that unlike last year we'll receive a port of the PS4/Xbone version instead of 360/PS3 version. I wish it wasn't just a straight port, but it's the most we are gonna get...  [here's a comparison of the visuals from last-gen to current-gen](http://unrealitymag.bcmediagroup.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1381773388-media.jpg)   You know Big Trouble is my favorite movie and I really tried to get into this comic, but it just doesn't feel right. They constantly have Jack shouting catchphrases trying to mimic the movie and to me it just feels... forced. And all the humor and jokes make the book sound like it's trying to be a parody of the movie instead of an actual sequel. Like look at the last page in the link, Jack's talk about that Kansas burger joint. It just feels like they watched the movie and was like "Jack Burton is an everyman who likes to make wise-cracks and catchphrases so let's just have him constantly do that. The readers will love it!"    Maybe. It said that the Arkham Knight is as skilled as Batman and has his own army, and that army could be the League of Shadows.   I'm excited we'll finally hear about Jason in the Arkham series. It was just something I felt wasn't touched upon at all in the previous ones.   I think his design is alright. I prefer the comic version with his helmet. But I'm betting they have it as an alternate skin.  I also wonder if they'll have a third character. I know Origins only had 2, but that was a different developer, and City had three. If they do I bet it'll be Damian. With (Arkham City spoiler) [](#s "Talia and Ra's al Ghul dead") I think now would be a good time to have Damian introduced. It follow a similar pattern as the playable characters in City: Catwoman=Harley, Dick=Jason, Tim=Damian.   thank you, have a nice day :)   I'd be willing to play with you if we have games in common, I'll PM you my steam.   No problem, just helping out :)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rU04rsImtM   I've only read the first 15 issues of All-New X-men but I'm loving it so far, so yeah check it out if you can. I also recommend checking out All-New X-Factor and Amazing X-Men. I'm liking both of those so far.   Damn min-maxers...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGy9zTDefvg Jiffy! 2:05:48-2:05:50   Basically it's where they send the people who ditch all the time and never do their work.    Yeah they don't sell sodas. But things like ice-tea and coffee are sold. Coffee during zero period and ice tea at lunch.   Where I'm from there's a continuation school based out of the mall.    It helps to mention what game you're playing.   He was around 15 or 16 when he first went to the camps.   Nice. I'm thinking of setting up a Mass Effect game too so now I might get this.   First I need to ask, Why are they going after the bad guy? Are they getting payed?   While I don't have experience with the game you're playing, I do have a little bit of GM experience.  1. Don't freak out if things don't go according to your plan. There's four of them and only one of you, so expect to be outwitted sometimes.  2. Plan ahead. Keep some spare encounters on the side just in case something happens. It takes a little bit of the fun away when you have to prepare encounters in the middle of a game.  3. Improvise. There's been times when my players have had lucky rolls that flipped my entire encounter around. You just have to go with the flow and react accordingly.  4. If you or the players aren't 100% sure about a rule don't waste time going through the rulebook. You're the GM, you decide what the ruling should be at that moment.  5. Don't give your players too much slack. There's no fun in a game you can't lose.  6. Just Have Fun. It is a game after all.   Holy crap! I always thought of the idea of making a Warriors Rpg too! Having the players play different classes like scout (Fox), tagger (Rembrandt), and muscle (Ajax). If you ever have a playable version post it here Because I would love to try it out :)   Hi, My name is Ryan and i'm looking for 2 players to join this game I'm starting on Fridays at 4:30pm PST. I'm still a beginning GM so bear with me as I learn to play the system. I'm looking for new or inexperienced players, but experienced players are welcome if you don't mind playing with newbies. So send me a message telling me a little about yourself , why you'd be a valuable member of our group, and your Skype name so we can talk more. Thanks and have a wonderful day.   Hmm, you're a little late to the party :P   I think you'd have a better time over at /r/rpg, but that's just my opinion :)   Absolutely yes, and at this price it's a steal.   For Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, make sure you check out the [Knights of the Force expansion mod](http://kotf.com/main.htm). It adds a whole lot of stuff to the game and it's fun as hell to play with. Here's the list of features on the website.  KotF includes 100 new Star Wars characters, 150 skins, 70 lightsabers, 40 vehicles, 50 new stages, 130 NPCs, around 40 new and upgraded menus, 70 multiplayer maps and extraordinary CD menu. All these new features are in 2 GB and KotF requires 3.5 GB space on your hard disk.   This could work better if you replied :p  Yeah I was confirming with you that those days would work.   I can only do Mondays and Tuesdays after 4pm PST. That's about 6pm your time.   I'm currently the GM of 1 going on 2 games and I'm dying to play, my only question is what day and what time would we be playing?  	35
 Aussie with an American father, though I did live in the states for a couple of years while learning to talk. Half my family sounds either or American or Australian, but only one of the 6 of us are actually born there.  As for the the topic - maybe a shorter video on how Brad Bird injects charm into his work. Another idea is a video covering the works of cinematographers Christopher Doyle, Conrad L. Hall and maybe Roger Deakins. The final idea I'm also keen on is spatial clarity in action sequences - comparing directors like Nolan to guys like Johnnie To.   Thanks, I appreciate that. Unfortunately, I had cheekbone and jaw surgery last week and it's left me unable to talk properly. It'll probably remain that way for another month or so as I recover, and I didn't want to this wait on a shelf for a month. I'm trying to develop a flow of getting a video out every 4-6 weeks, and I didn't think that would help it.  Anyway, thanks for checking it out.  	2
 The idea of having nothing to lose is something you can lose. Say you are single man with no debts and no assets, you have nothing to lose. You have a kid, and you lost your nothing to lose      Like, I know swans form monogamous relationships, but has one ever cheated?   When did we turn friction off?   How do you think civilization would be? If earth was and the sun and moon was all? Would we be different?  	5
    What exactly is a 200$ ebook?

Theyre taking the hobbits to Isengard   I never judge games based on their reviews,and I took the same road with Nether and it ended up being a fun game to play with friends.So I'll stick to my previous opinion.   Having played nether and found it worth the 10 i spent on it earlier,Im going to say i have no idea what youre talking about here   ah ok,thanks anyway   Whats your price on Batman Arkham Origins?   Dead space if its not gone would be amazing,thanks in advance!   Is the offer still up? I'll do it if so      Let it all out OP.What went wrong?      offer away!   ahem http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=992486541   Fantom      Ill check the offers in the morning,cheers      Would you mind me using your music in a youtube video?

Sand Kings line,Ill show you fear in a handful of sand is a reference to TS Eliots waste lands,where a character says Ill show you fear in a handful of dust!   oh thanks,ill keep it in mind  	34
 What do you think of the UX design on Reddit?            "You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other."   Wouldn't this be so much more effective if the man/woman named themselves?   People now wearing belts   Send me a PM, I'm a book publicist and have worked with him before. Did you want any signed book, or a special inscription?   Is that bullshit, man, or is it reliable?    I had a professor back in college who swore by this book. I couldn't hear the end of how amazing it was and how McEwan demonstrated his masterful writing skills here. I started reading it yesterday, and am currently about halfway. Holy hell was he right. Every chapter is amazing concise and demonstrates everything that makes writing transformative. voice, POV, narrative distance, blah blah blah. Anyway, read it.    It's so awesome that I wish I never read any of them so I could read them again for the first time.    Hyperion by Dan Simmons and it's not even close.    She came by way of Archer, Bridgeport, Nanuet, worked off 95 in jeans and a denim jacket, carrying a plastic bag and shower shoes, a phone number, waiting beneath an underpass, the potato chips long gone, lightheaded.    So many.   David Mitchell JK Rowling Junot Diaz Phillip Meyer Ben Fountain Lev Grossman JOshua Ferriss Jennifer Eagan Michael Chabon  So many more. The issue is that this trait can reasonably be argued in most any book considered decent. Even short stories show character development. I don't really agree with the the fact that Cormac McCarthy doesn't develop his characters, he just does it differently.    Requiem for a Dream. Nightmare fuel.    How long did the technical aspects of the book take you to write? I know your background is in the sciences, but there seemed to be a lot of complicated formulas involved in this book.   Also, did you intentionally write this book to read like a movie script?  Lastly, did you laugh when you realized that Matt Damon was going to play ANOTHER character trapped on a foreign planet?   I love to insult people through compliments.    How was it listening to the audio book? I read it and loved it, but it was so clearly written for a movie that I bet the audio book was even better.       I don't understand how this helps?    What a picture!        	23
 Finally some sense. It's a travesty that lime is gone, and not just from Skittles. TRAVESTY!   Yeah this broke my heart.   Every moment spent worrying about something that hasn't happened is a moment of your life wasted.  Go do something.   Subscribe for Monday Night Football then cancel after the season.   Thanks NFL. That was the game this New Englander was going to go to for my first ever game.   Is this the new talk track for when fat acceptance women are caught being hypocritical when they talk about only being attracted to fit men?  "Well my obesity is genetic, mens are not..."   You should've done your research. This isn't the Henne Dolphins.   I have such a hardon.   Thanks!   Are there pictures of that?   You will continue to fight.  You will persevere.  You will not give up.  BECAUSE I SAID SO GODDAMNIT.  And later, you'll come back here and let us know how you're doing.   And you'll keep fighting.   God rests on Sundays. Marino kicked ass.   BatManuel?   No.   You can tell how invested the media is in a game by who the commentators are during it.  The commentators were horrid. Who do you put your worst broadcasters on? The game you think the fewest people care about.  Sad if you think about it.   Don't know why you're being down voted. Who the heck would want their LT out?   Well, in all fairness, you could only barely allude to Miller too if you had a beak.   Sorry to hear that. Take care of yourself.   Let's see how the coaches adjust. That's their job.   Yes, the company to be theoretically traded. If you had access to their web analytics as a consultant.   Anyone ever use a website's analytics (traffic, conversions, etc.) to inform decisions on when to buy or sell stock?  Would love to hear some strategies along this line.   That's great news!  So many struggle and find nothing that helps, it's nice to hear when something simple works for someone.   Agreed. We need to see consistency. It'll take him the year to really show it.   I love his effort. That stuff makes plays.   :)   r/ToolBand is the one I know of.   I actually thought I was in the tool subreddit.   Sorry you are going through this. It's hard, and you are being strong. Keep it up.  I get warnings too, as long as I'm awake for them, but nothing like yours -- it doesn't seem to affect my coherence.  When I do get the warnings I've found that caffeine helps reduce the severity significantly and even prevent it from occurring (I'm very lucky in this way). I will use Excedrin or soda for the caffeine.  I kept a journal when I first started getting them which helped me identify triggers, patterns, etc.  Hope that helps. Have to be honest, the affecting your coherence is concerning.   No matter who is in charge of the Jets, they always manage to make some real terrible decisions.   Thanks!   Can these be installed without some sort of rooting?   Oh you say that to all the states. Tease.   It's a play...on the field, not a celebration. How is a play disrespectful?   It's like you're describing Steve Smith. Good in my book.   Honestly, I can't remember the last rookie receiver we had to play as well as he is...so I'm definitely optimistic.  It's a tough transition for that position.   The fair questions are things like "why was it Wheeler in coverage?"  That's what gets me. I didn't think we would win, but we had the lead with the clock winding down and I don't understand why certain things happened.   That quote seems like a cop-out. The defense played very well. They were not always PUT in the best position (i.e. Wheeler shouldn't have been in coverage in the last play), but they played well for what they were asked.   What upsets us is we know Rodgers is capable of that. But from the game plan in the final ~4 minutes, it was like our coaches had no idea.   S?   Lol   Makes you wonder why they struggle planning during the week.   Yeah looks great now, but that's the problem, he's not consistent.   They're all at the beach. Probably Lauren too.   I remember. I still would have gone for it. Sometimes you have to take chances to win.  We'll agree to disagree.   We'll get the 4th best QB in the draft too.   So let's just not play the game.   That's the definition of retarded?  I definitely would have gone. Have some balls and actually try to win the damn game.   I don't get it either. Stupid.   It looks far worse. Offense doesn't start being productive and it'll be real ugly.   First, take estibot with a grain if salt. It's only worth what someone would pay.  I would post it to sedo and see what offers you get. Decline offers if you want. Realize that it may be a while before you get an offer.  I recommend going to namebio.com to see how much similar domain names have sold for. This is one of the better ways to gauge value.  You could share the domain name here, it's not like anyone can take it from you.   Not sure how much you make, and it's none of my damn business, but I'm curious as to what it compares to Uber drivers. I read on an uber drivers forum about how they take more than the 20% that they advertise, so drivers don't end up making much.   Sweetarts with lime instead if green apple. Skittles like that too.   Why would you want a guy who all reports are the players hate him?  Sure you're team will improve for a few years, but then what?   I thought the speech was flat and sounded like all his other speeches.  But, I also think too much weight can be put on coaches' emotions. Plenty of great coaches don't show much emotion.   Some of us, myself included, have been questioning Tannehill, and rightfully so.   That doesn't mean we're calling for Moore.  But I'm not sure who you're talking about.   Lol. K.   If I'm on the coaching staff I'm taking a close look at my linebackers. When Misi is back, I would consider benching Wheeler and going with Musi, Trusnick and Jenkins.  Crazy?   Questioning Tannehill when he's in year 3 and playing this inconsistently shouldn't surprise anyone.   I was one who created a thread on Tannehill last week.  My thoughts if you care: Tannehill played much better (that pass of Hartline is something rare from him and was good to see), BUT this was against one of the worst teams in the league who haven't been home since before the week 3 game.  Tannehill has to put more than one good game together. I remember his first ever games as a Dolphin and the number of balls batted...then what do we see in year 3? Same thing. The guy needs to improve.  So, good game, I'm glad for it...but let's keep in mind who it was against and see how he does the rest of the year.   Probably 16 years ago (I'm 39 now) I started getting clusters.  Seasonal at first then chronic for about 2 years, followed by seasonal again.  Then nothing for ~6 years.   I woke up at about 5 this morning as a cluster was developing. Now, of course, I'm both spent and worried they are returning.  Not sure why I'm writing this. I've never spoken to anyone else who had clusters. But, as someone recently divorced I don't have anyone to share it with.  I've always considered myself lucky with clusters as I quickly recognized things that brought them on, early signs of one coming, and had things that helped reduce their ferocity.  Anyway, my thoughts go out to all of you. I hope you're successful in getting through your headaches.   Is this supposed to make me smile? Because I don't feel like smiling.   Wow...that's how far we've fallen.   Lazor and Philbin get a lot of blame. Game management in general is poor, even some basics like clock management -- Philbin in particular should know better.    ...couple more years...before something happens and it starts all over again.   I feel like the QBs who win championships who are not elite have historic defenses. Our defense is good, but not nearly good enough to bring this team that far.   I think the problem is how we lost. We didn't lose because we were missing Dion Jordan and Moreno, we lost because of bad play calling, bad quarterback play, bad oline play, bad receiver play...we lost because the guys who should be good enough (starters) just didn't do it.   Never thought Gibson was fantastic, but serviceable. Not sure where he is today.  As for Clay, I do think he's better than average. He's made some incredible, highlight-worthy, plays. This year I think he's dealing with a knee injury. If he becomes healthy we better see the ball thrown to him more regularly.   The anonymous quote (if real) calls out coaches, but Hartline's could be read any number of ways.   We'll beat Oakland and some people will forget the past few weeks...but just wait. This season is not shaping up to be anything other than the usual for us.   I'm tired of taking scraps from other teams. We need to make a move for the best guy in the draft. Now maybe that isn't this year, we'll see how Tanny closes this thing out, but our strategies in the past clearly have not worked (i.e. so-so free agent QBs and questionable drafting either late in rounds, or WRs at the QB position).   I'm so frustrated I want a revolt. I want the players to kick the damn coaches out of the lockerroom and take over.   That's how I feel too. We'll hover around 6-10 to 9-7, which means never getting the best QB in the draft. I don't follow college ball that closely, so I don't know how this class, or the next, is shaping up but Hickey better be paying attention.  Also very curious what Marino thinks at this point. He seemed high on Tannehill for a while, but after the past few games and now actually having an official role in the organization, I have to wonder what he thinks.   I heard the same things about Dalton, but also watched a few Cincy games. He was managing the games well, and taking them to the playoffs.  Then there's Tanny...  I'm not totally dismissing our QB, we clearly have other issues (Coyle...damn man, really?) but I'm also done defending him with things like "well our oline has issues" because he's not doing his part either from what I see.   Russell Wilson regularly hits receivers down the field.   We're worse. Where's Hartline? Where's Clay? Why aren't we getting to the guys who were so productive last year?   Or anyone in stride...   I think Moore would have more interceptions, but would also make more plays.  Does that put us in a better position? I don't know.   That's the thing, at this point I think he is the weakness. We have good talent around him, it's his job to utilize it and he's failing.  Getting QBs in the 2nd round on is how we got Henne, and some other guys I've decided to forget.   I just posted something similar...  My only remaining hope is he's getting used to the new system.   He looks so average...  	79

 No you shouldn't be eligible for a refund.  This is the risk you take with airbnb.  If you want hotel accommodations get a hotel.  You found three cockroaches so friggin what.  I had an ant problem at my house for about a month, we live in a world with bugs, deal with it.   Yep, I have clear pictures of my home and how it lacks a lot of decor and I'm a bachelor which should give some insight into how it is decorated.  Don't matter, people still complain about how empty the house is.   You get that on any region specific subreddit it's obnoxious.  Hey I'm visiting Vermont?  What should I do?  Well look at the history of the past 300 times a person has asked that and you might have a good idea.   Will OP deliver?   Hang in there little buddy, lots of fish in the sea   I second this holds really well, and the holder release is a really simple really clever device.   Id invite you to my party?   Got any links about the profit statement?  The only reason I would think Airbnb isn't making a profit is because they are focused on putting all their revenue into funding growth.   No way.  First off take what the previous poster said with a grain of salt they take third review system very seriously.  Second as a host I set my own prices so I'm not really an independent contractor like uber or homejoy.  Airbnb is more of a marketing platform for short term rentals that you pay a fee on for each reservation.   Got an after pic of how it healed?  Edit: nevermind   Wasn't going to watch the video but your comment piqued my curiosity.  She is a dime.   Really?  That makes no sense that a flag detail costs the same as a police detail.  	12
 I completely get your criticism. It gets me a bit agitated looking at as well, sometimes, just because I question whether it has any composition at all. I was trying to evoke the same feel the book cover for The Lost World gave off.    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Big-lostworld.jpg/200px-Big-lostworld.jpg   I rehosted it from [my own website](http://www.maazcon.com/#/jurassic-world/). Sorry, forgot to link it in the comments.      **APPLE BOTTOM JEANS**   Plaaaaaaayyyyyaaaaa   Oblivion   He pop that police on a Monday      Yeah, but it's shit compared to their mixtapes. I wish they didn't end on such bad terms with their last producer.   You're perfect just the way you are.   Thank you. This is an absolute necessity now that you brought it to my attention.   I'm still struggling with how to approach that Skills section... Thanks for letting me know. I'll add that as a change.   Thanks. It's a relief to know I already had that first criticism in mind. I have a few galleries with multiple pictures up, but need to follow through with the entire site.  Fragments... ahhh, never again. (That app was such a guilty pleasure the first week I got it.)  I'll get to work on a printer-fiendly version of that resume, too. Really appreciate your response!   Here's the link:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7e3dIf4j0UgUG9KZXlGMTI1SGM/view?usp=sharing  And my portfolio's at http://www.maazcon.com. Thanks!    THE EMPIRE   Do you sell prints of this, by any chance?   HUM NE AAHG LAGAIYE?   If his short film *Runaway* is anything to go off of, it'll be pretty damn extravagant.   k bye   You guys are too kind.  A bit of background on the serious faces. The picture of my grandfather was taken right after he was in the middle of a huge accident. As far as my dad can remember, he had a few broken ribs, and he was getting treated around the time this was taken.   ...My picture was taken before I left to study for finals. But that's a story for another day.   Ha! Hopefully I get to keep the hair too..   ...Dude...   Thank you.   Pakistani. But that's the first time I've ever gotten that. That would be awesome.    In my defense, he was in his forties in that picture. I'm 22 in this.   ...still a bit slow for the facial hair but I'm keeping my hopes up.    Oh man. He in general was more badass.   I got you.  Here's [mine](http://i.imgur.com/wRvW1bl.jpg), and here's [his](http://i.imgur.com/8P31kDp.jpg).  I don't feel like I look anywhere near as badass, though.      David Fincher's movies always have the best packaging. I wouldn't be surprised if he has something to do with it - he started off filming commercials, so the dude definitely knows his marketing.         Sorry for the double response - just needed to add something. I see what you're seeing with the fat chin thing. It's drawn like that because his face is supposed to be looking to his left. This wasn't a portrait of him from the side.  ...I'll have to work on fixing the ambiguity there too.    Fuckin' love it. Thanks, man. I'll be using this.    Can you go into detail on it? I'm still frustrated with the drawing. It's off in ways, but I've been looking at it for so long I can't tell exactly how.    Hahahahahhahahahah   Right you are. :)  The way I worded it is slightly off from the original - it was how Jack Nicholson's character quoted it in The Departed, where I was remembering it from.     Thank you!  My portfolio's at [maazcon.com](http://maazcon.com). And then there's an [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) with the same handle - I update those two the most frequently. I'm still in the process of finishing the layout for the portfolio itself so hopefully it's running smoothly.  More stuff like this will be under the "Artwork" page!    I was about to do that! The reason I didn't was because I wanted to try my own take at it - basically imagining what I'd make the tagline if I was the one in charge of marketing the movie. I do that with most of the posters I make (it's almost like a fun mental exercise).  I'm glad you like it. :)   Thanks, man! I really appreciate the kind words.         HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT.   Thank you ! Those were one of the sources of inspiration. :)      *I just do.*   Before we look too into any of this, let's remember that the movie's far from being done with post-production. That gate won't look as obviously CGI as it does in this clip by the time they're done with it.

Looks to me like they do this sort of thing outside all the time. If they don't want to be recorded, they should be decent neighbors and not disturb other people by making so many scenes.     	57
 Keep them safe. Please ( you are the parent, how you do it is your right, but) at some point make them know that it is never their fault if someone hurts them, and they can come to you right away.  I have entertained thoughts of adoption, since in my mind they are already in the world it would actually be better to be raised where they wouldn't be hurt, but I do not know that I am unselfish enough to be a parent.  	1
 343 propaganda.  I'm sure it's so they can push their evil halo killing agenda on you through an app you don't even have to download.   Literally all friendly AI turns to God mode Dubbo's with scarab guns.   Even though i hate Jeb. I really don't trust anything from salon. They're the people that said burning cars and private property is a legitimate political strategy. They are the most unabashedly large liberal site I know.   He's more than a legend... He's a...   *myth*   I'm going to assume it was posted because this kid was a fan of halo who was apart of a halo community and thus posted it a halo sub   Good art. But I don't think that's how he'd look.   Never dyed!? Coulda fooled me damn I thought you had it blonde in one and red in the other, but after a second glance it was the lighting. Alright, I gotta ask. Who the fuck is Felipe?    Anytime. Honestly I rarely comment on these at all. You have no reason to have low confidence. Just diet at a surplus, hit the gym, and then jaws hit the floor. You have great style too. You a natural redhead?   I'm not sure how to go about it. But it'll take a few discussions with the users and mods on this and other subs to come up with a gameplan to raise awareness. Movements are like a snowball; starts slow and small but if you keep pushing it, it grows and grows, then you don't have to push it anymore, and it gets faster and bigger as it rolls.    Jesus Christ your probably the most gorgeous person I've seen on here. I don't say that often, and I never thought I would. You seem like a goddamn barbie doll. If you put on more weight you'd be a solid 11/10.  Damn. So on a scale of 1-10, you're a 9 and I'm the 1 you need...    It's even an MS product. Shame really   As far as I'm aware, most of Bernie's support and notice came from Reddit being rabid about socialism. We need to do the same, and coordinate. 3k dedicated people is enough to get the same support for Rand. Only Rand has a legitimate chance at getting the nomination AND the presidency. We just need to gain the rabid internet support and the Facebook Republicans. We have a serious shot.  Coordinating officially with his campaign wouldn't hurt either. People just need a a little Rand spark. I'm willing to help coordinate and come up with a legit game plan, we can dominate social media for Republicans/libertarians similar to what Sanders is doing for liberals. It just depends on the willingness of those here to do it.    Well they can do it forever. People might pass through there, but that company is created specifically for halo.   Plus, a reliable schedule of weekly content from both the community and 343? Also, mobile forum access would be GOAT. Mobile Beyond Entertainment forum access would be GOATier since they're pretty much the defacto competitive forum.    Works great for me on mobile.    Works great for me. Honestly it has a great set up, it's responsive, and works really well   It's hard to think this is the guy I saw on Sadik's Instagram today. His arms got so small with age    Socialism and marxist ideologies.   I just got them. You can workout normally, eating is the issue. And for me it's only because out hurts.    I had the same thing happen. I strained my tricep doing skullcrushers, stopped working tri's but kept working everything else. Pain kind of went away but not fully.    It's nice to see halo reach around here   Thank Mr skeltal   I want a sexy calander   That's a horrible comparison. Absolute trash. Just because the scenario isn't a starving child doesn't mean we can't feel bad for someone who has worked so hard on something for his idols to literally disapprove.   What you're saying is just a stupid reason to dismiss what someone is going through. "Oh you lost a family member? There's starving kids in Africa, you shouldn't be sad". Or if a rich parent won't give approval or love to his son, "there's people worse off, get over it." Emotions are emotions and problems are problems. Just because someone somewhere is in a worse situation doesn't invalidate any other emotions.       Which is a good thing. There needs to be a check on what is usually unchecked. Directly by the people.   This won't turn into the Tea Party challenging taxes every day because they simply won't have a case. But it will prevent the IRS and political leaders from abusing the IRS and targeting specific groups.   You realize what the northern army did right? They raped, pillaged, and destroyed the south, specifically on Sherman's March. The Union Army was in no way as "heroic" as the confederates other than the fact Lincoln freed slaves to weaken the south.   Lee was an admirable man if you read up on him.    What's the difference between /r/communism and/r/FULLCOMMUNISM?   no this isn't the setup to a bad joke. I'm curious.   Wtf does butterface even mean? Your fine. Like real fine   Lol. What? Capitalism has been around longer then communism, and outlasted communism in nearly every sense. Even China had to adopt capitalist ways to get where it's at economically. There is no sound argument for communism, please leave.   Chicago has the tightest gun laws in the US. His point is ridiculous.    In the first pic you look depressed, annoyed, and negative. No one wants to be around someone who won't give them good emotions, at the end of the day that's what interactions are about; making people feel good emotions and "vibes" about you. That pic screams "I'm a drag and no fun to be around" and has a salty vibe. It simply doesn't put good emotions into those who see it. Plus it's just a horrible selfie with bad lighting. T  he next one is generic with no personality whatsoever, and the other one makes you look feminine and desperate for attention.   My advice:   - smile or add personality without it.   - get a buddy to take your pic in better lighting. Preferably when doing something fun that demonstrates high value where you can get a good face shot  - have a pic of you and your buds at the club, with some personality.  - spice up your bio with something a little less generic. Like it was said before, everyone is on Tinder to have fun. So put some legitimate things about yourself and a witty remark that will make you stand out from the thousands of other guys these girls see. They have more options than you do and are more selective.   - maybe another more masculine pic with your pet.   - just stand out, be fun and exciting.   To clarify, the first pic compared to last pic is your progress? And what weight did you start at? Plus, what are your goals?  If so, and your goal of to get big and cut, yes, it's bad progress. Really bad. You may have defined out a bit, but you need to get significantly bigger so bulking is a must. It seems you don't have the diet in order at all. You need to eat at a large caloric surplus to gain weight and it doesn't look like you have been doing that. Simply just working out doesn't cut it, diet is just as vital as training. So I think you just need to her serious about your diet.   Do some lifting and get toned. Looking great   That really isn't a lot of progress for 3 years. You need to do a relatively clean bulk, and get on a lifting program. You should be about 190-200 by now    PEWPEWPEWBWAPBWAPBWAP.  MURICA   Fucking commie   John Wayne makes that pic. But still needs more Reagan.   Greatest sci Fi universe ever.   This came first   This happened first.   Sick shit bro   To be fair, *nothing* stops the Chief when he wants to do something.    Montages, machinima, map features and reviews.   That was gold   ***SURRENDERTHATAI!!***   Pics. Let's see that physique.   /r/dadbod   It's an everyone wins mentality we put in by giving everyone a trophy       Comments salty as shit. Damn.   Damn. That's awesome, we have identical builds. Also very similar to my goals, I started a month ago, currently at 157, hope to be 220 in 3 years. How was your diet/training?   I use bodyspace. Calculates everything, keeps track of workouts, and whatever program your on.   Hamplanet to hottie. Niccceeee   For a lot of those men it wasn't about slavery, it was about fighting for their home and state. This mentality extended up to General Lee. Many felt they had no choice.    But HEY! At least you didn't have to own land to vote!   He expanded the electorate substantially for the time   Both. This is pretty interesting.   Whoa. Do you have a sause?   Full what he said   Oh, yeah. Thats like getting hate mail from(Adolf) Hitler. Theyre literally terrible human beings. Ive read their newsletter, Ive visited their website, and theyre just rotten to the core. For an organization that prides itself on Christian values  I mean, Im an atheist, so what do I know?  they spend their entire day hating people. They can all suck my dick as far as Im concerned."   It won't. That was a cold blooded attack on innocents by people that despise us. Not a war between uniformed brothers that understood each other.    Lee wasn't even a slave owner. He didn't agree with slavery either, the only reason he fought for the CSA was because his loyalties were to his state and way of life over his nation. This was the case with the overwhelming majority of CSA soldiers who were only in the war to fight for their home and from foreign aggressors. My biggest fear with all of this is that we will begin to condemn the soldiers and their memorials along with the flag.    He isn't a good president. Neither was Bush, or Clinton.   Jackson has a pretty good rep and did a wonderful job. The only stain and huge wrongdoing being the Indian thing    You can do that all you want. But until you can come up with logical reasoning, it means nothing. He is a frontrunner in key states whether fox wants to acknowledge it or not.   Unions between people have always been a thing. But *marriage* has not, like I've said before **semantics**. His economic policies will work and I'm glad he'll be president. People will vote for him over Hillary if he gets the nomination. Just because someone doesn't want the government regulating marriage doesn't mean they're socially backwards. He's stated he wants the government out of people's lives in every way for a while now    He isn't. But I pay close attention to his ideas and what he says. It's a step in the right direction where basically anyone else in the Republican race is a step back.   He is a conservative but he isn't for unequal rights for people. But the institution of marriage has been around since before our government and has been a religious thing. It's *semantics*, marriage has been between a man and a woman and first defined that way by religion, the government just gave them benefits and prevented gays from having the same ones (bad). Paul just says gays should have the same rights, but it shouldn't be called marriage because that word implies sanction by god. Which gays *may* not have.  All in all, he wants the government totally out of it unless enforcement of the contracts so this issue wouldn't even be relevant.   It is a massive oversimplification of the last century. But in short, we've never had true free markets, there have always been a large element of government favoritism.   The idea that it was hands off economics that led to the depression is a huge myth.    Because they are equal rights. Marriage isn't a right defined in the constitution. It isn't a right to be regulated, registered, and defined by the government. It *was* a religious institution before it was a government one, and it was around before our government decided to regulate it. This is his point, he doesn't want to spite anybody. Paul has held you'd position for awhile now, you honestly think a libertarianesq like him wants to have his life regulated and registered by the government? Fuck no  Like I said before, he wanted to be married. The only way to do that was to actually get married. He's advocating for most of the benefits instead of taxes to be covered in a legal contract between two people without state intervention unless it's time for it to be enforced or annulled.  What you're essentially saying is equivalent to saying people can't support civil rights because they're white, or more accurately, proper immigration reform because they live comfortably in the US.    Because people that had ran our country were deeply religious. I'm not trying to justify those laws, rather argue for them to be removed entirely and replaced with legal contacts.   Religious people want the right to the word *marriage* and LGBT want equal benefit from the government in regard to the act of marriage. There's no reason one can't be called marriage and the other a civil union. You could argue that it's "separate but equal" but it's really not, it's legal semantics and that's it. And like it or not, marriage is a religious institution that's been around for millennia and has been defined as between a man and a woman.    They can be involved in the same way you'd enforce any other contract between two consenting adults, you don't need overarching regulations for that. A contract is basically a set of obligations and terms between parties enforced by the government, and marriage is better off that way.    You would have those things related to children, finances, death, and property covered in a contract without government interference. The only time the government would get involved is when the contact needs to be enforced or annulled.     I'm a libertarian so I vehemently disagree with his economic positions so my vote goes to Rand. But I respect his integrity if that counts for anything.   That's not true at all. One can get married and enjoy the benefits and advocate for change. Why? Because the change he advocates for affects his marriage and would make the institution itself far better off. You can't blame him for taking advantage of the only way to get married, like literally everyone else. The  government doesn't need to be involved in everything.   Your logic relies on the idea that he would want these benefits from the government at the time he got married even though he received them. He wanted to be married and committed to someone he loves, not the benefits that entails. We know this is true because his position has been constant and he's willing to make a change that affects his marriage here and now. He still says this at risk of losing christian GOP votes that he will need for the primary.   That is ridiculous. So straight married people aren't allowed to support equal rights to people? That is so stupid   Neo-Cons mainly.   Humans. You just never know.    Except the Libertarian party or Sanders   So he was canned for good reason. I mean what the above article said made him seem like a straight asshole.   SIR.   SIR Ian McKellen  Fucking casual.   Famous words of Hillary Clinton.   This is the type of guy that gives Republicans a bad name   Yeah, the II's have the XP. But I think physically they are on par   It'd be a toss up in a 1v1 equal everything   Okay. I need pics of your body, 220 lbs muscle puts you at absolutely ripped. Cover the tattoo, but please post before and after   Can we get the story behind this?   A. taking a picture of your nude underaged children.  Also, I really wish people would stop taking nude pictures of their kids..  I ran around nude in a cowboy outfit and rode a tricycle nude when I was about 3. My mom took a picture because I was being a funny and adorable toddler, I wasn't being sexualized, i turned out fine, and ended up with a funny picture. Stop demonizing a normal part of childhood.     Seriously. Did you listen to hunt the truth? The ending had me surprised as fuck, they totally played Ben    You and Pepsi should team up and do am AMA   You seem like some reddit god. What the shit is up with you.    Check out all of the Halo books. Fall of Reach and everything that follows is pretty phenomenal.   The forerunners. Blinded and corrupted by a millennia of absolute power, yet so majestic and wise at the same time. The universe has real world allusions to things like NSA spying. I will never stop being entertained by that lore and universe.   That is NICE. Do you do a muscle group split? I'm mirin your back.   Pics or didn't happen   Wasn't expecting that. Yeah I'd smash   Don't you just love when SJWs become so SJW that become racist bigots. It's like a circle, circle of Justice.   Halo all the way. It's incredibly rich and lucrative, with deep lore. It will always be my first love. Second will be Doctor Who.   This is dope. If I had money, I'd buy a copy. You're a great artist.   What's Johns last name? Or do glassed planets have bad records?   Please be halo centric in many ways. I can't even imagine RT OE RvB without Halo undertones.    I'd like to join as a libertarian.   Lol   /u/govschwarzenegger   You're probably right honestly. I just wanted to see what others have dealt with having been at it longer   IMO Calum is a modern day Arnold. So he is better, but Sadik still looks great   Feels  	107

It's an ex-USSR territory, I'm pretty sure this used to be a Lenin statue.   Because it's soil.

    ba dum tsh                  Man, I thought this skit was lame as hell. Literally just a bunch of catchphrases and terrible impressions, I cringed all the way through it.   I'm a substitute teacher. I came in thinking that I'd be totally cool about the bathroom thing; I know what a big deal it is. I have adult friends who still carry grudges about this issue. Not that they ever had accidents mind you, but it's the principle of the thing: isn't it crazy that we're socialized by an institution that doesn't even trust us to make our own bathroom choices? I just want everyone to be happy and learn--I will be different.  My first week, a kid asks to go to the bathroom right away, and I say yes. So proud of myself, too--these kids are never trusted with this basic responsibility, and I will prove to them that I respect them as people and this will be a wonderful day.  Then another kid asks, and I hesitate for a moment--we already have somebody in there, can you wait? No, she says, it's an emergency. "I trust you, go ahead" I say, because if I make it clear that this is a matter of trust, then they wouldn't possibly take advantage of that, would they?  More emergencies begin to pop up. I know that they can't all be telling the truth, but where do I draw the line? The last thing I want to be is arbitrary about the bathroom; my principles demand a consistent standard. "I trust you," I tell a dozen little middle schoolers. "I trust you all."  Five, ten, twenty minutes go by and half my class is unaccounted for. I'm responsible for them, and they've vanished. Truth is, once they're out the door, they can go where they please--I can't keep track of them and neither can anyone else. I remember this from when I was in school. I regret everything.  Finally a beleaguered custodian returns with my dozen students. They were messing around in the hall, he says, did I let them all go to the bathroom? There were a lot of emergencies, I explain. He isn't sure if I'm stupid or if I'm fucking with him. He tells me what everyone who's been on this side of the situation tautologically knows: kids lie about this shit, often just because they can. Your trust means nothing. They have plenty of time to take care of this. Don't let a bunch of kids go to the fucking bathroom.   I saw *Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* in a feminist film class, and thought at the time--still think, honestly--that it was too fucking boring to be good art. I have a pretty high tolerance for "deliberate pacing," but this was something else: it was all the boring stuff I do myself as a single dude everyday, which led to me spacing out during viewing as I do in my own life--it's like a Pavlovian call to fucking daydreaming. As such, the finale meant nothing to me because I'd been barely paying attention, and I do not blame myself I blame the dumb dumb movie. I'm a cineaste and committed gender egalitarian; fuck that dull ass film.   That's the standard? "Look, this joke may or may not be hacky as fuck, but pretend someone hilarious said it."   Would the dwindling resources of our planet be worth the resources required to get here? Let alone wage war?   Well, humans are my main frame of reference, and I'm pretty sure we're going to nuke the shit out of ourselves before we ever get serious about space colonization. Mass destruction is much easier achieved than interstellar travel, so it seems like the whole process should on some level select for peaceful, exploratory natures.      I'm intrigued by what you're saying, but I don't really follow. You seem to be devaluing art and its place in culture: Lovecraft and Jay-Z admittedly don't have any special ontological insight into the nature of things, but their work and its popularity can definitely reflect a current in ideology, and it then doesn't seem unreasonable to me that the prevalence of that current throughout history could--setting aside some silly neatherrealm--at least reflect something fundamental in humanity and human psychology. Would you be willing to elaborate on your position for an interested layman?   Hmm. Not sure why you'd bother with classes then.   Not symbolism, but at least intent: a chair can be a chair if there's a reason for a chair--symbolic, narrative, or expository. It's silly to say that symbolism is *always* good or bad or present or projected, but getting bogged down in pointless detail for the sake of "setting a scene" is certainly a hallmark of bad writing.   Maybe your writing got better.   Eh, just that he seems to assume that Erin's not playing seriously, but now he's raping frivolously and doesn't seem to think it should make any difference. He took against Erin's new character hard immediately, and even Spenser pointed out how unfair he was being about it. He doesn't seem to be playing in good faith.   If you're open to a serious answer, it's because it reduces a person to two adjectives, and would seem to be inviting the reader to draw on social assumptions about the word combination that would probably be informed by stereotypes. It doesn't really merit more fuss than a raised eyebrow or so, but anyway that's why "big black" kinda tastes funny.   Jeff's cool but he's being a dick in D D. We need a D D civil war.   I won't vouch for the quality of the songs, but these compilations are absolutely masterful in terms of pure nostalgia-baiting. I haven't thought about these songs in years and I've really never listened to Top 40 music intentionally, yet I have some memory or association with almost all of these tracks. NOW is indisputably great at bottling and selling time.   There are no boobs in Harry Potter, Pixar, Dreamworks animation, Twilight, Marvel movies, the Dark Knight trilogy, Avatar, or really any of the other highest-grossing movies in recent years. You're thinking of television.       Clearly with the upvotes I've gotten I'm not the minority.  God, I hope that's not your takeaway here.   There's way more wisdom in your comment than the one you're responding to. Movies tell you that love has a happy ending, songs tell you that you've been wronged if someone doesn't love you, but only life teaches you that you're not entitled to anyone else's feelings, no matter how big you've made them in your head.   The only thing I notice with any regularity is some ugly, blocky compression when streaming dark grays and blacks, as is normal for streaming video and DVD--how much of an issue that is will depend on the palette of the film, your TV, and your own anal retentivity, i suppose.  More to the point though, minimal compression artifacts are no reason to blind buy expensive discs in my opinion--it's not like it ruins the experience. Hulu is a great tool for exploring the collection, particularly when you're seeing the film for the first time.   Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.   Don't take that too seriously, I actually have no idea where he or anyone else would fall on the map; thus the question. He just seems like he hates stuff.   Damn, that's tough to beat.   Whenever speculation comes around as to which films might be eligible for a Criterion treatment, a few commenters will weigh in based on what sort of relationship different studios and distributers have with the company; e.g. Sony does this, Warner Brothers doesn't do that, Harvey Weinstein hates whatever. Is there any sort of list or chart as to where the different major companies stand? Or, if there isn't, would a somebody here care to run me through it here?   I'm glad you seem to be doing better. And I hope you realize how totally alone you're not.   Interesting. I'd say he was just a twist on narrative convention and leave it at that, myself--not all movies have or indeed need a consistent in-world logic when the focus is on theme or form.   It's a bad faith argument to assume that contemporary proponents of birth control are intentionally trying to stop black people from breeding. Please consider that they are trying to do the right thing as best they understand it, based on sociological, economic and environmental evidence.   Make sure you check your region settings; all Criterion Blu-Rays and some DVDs are region-locked and won't work on UK players.   Just to set your expectations in line, *Help!* is more surreal and more plot-driven, arguably funnier--*A Hard Day's Night* is basically the early Beatles running around being themselves. That said, *A Hard Day's Night* is widely seen the more groundbreaking work, as it basically set the visual template for pop and rock and roll music.   Holiday semantics are kind of a weird thing to give a shit about.   [They have a rundown on the Criterion site.](http://www.criterion.com/films/28547-a-hard-day-s-night) I believe most of the special features are exclusive to the blu-ray/2 DVD combo, while there will also be a bare bones 1 DVD alternative.      I've never used one, but I've heard that [products like the Z-Finder](http://www.zacuto.com/z-finder-dslr-viewfinder) can be pretty helpful, particularly when combined with a good mount.   two pictures of my balls   Paypal me $1, and I will send you a unique, personal picture of my balls. No special instructions or refunds or anything; ball pictures provided as is per my sole discretion. What you see is what you get, and that's a picture of my balls for $1.   I just love the idea that the angel was caught off guard, totally blanked and took the form of a cat.   woah dude stop the presses   See, I always thought the version that made it to screen was a witless pile of shit saved by funny actors--it  never occurred to me that it was the *good* version of something. She was wrong about The Hangover's "potential" I guess, but she was right about fuck that movie.   **I'd just like you to hear from at least one person that divorce is not mandatory.** It seems abundantly clear that your wife seriously, thoughtlessly, fucking crushingly betrayed your trust, and if that means divorce for you then rock on. But if you're still grappling with your love for her right now and you think there's something to salvage, don't for one second feel bound by what's expected or what's expressed on this silly adolescent corner of the internet--infidelity, however painful, happens, and your only responsibility right now is to yourself, rebuilding in the way that's right for you. Heartbreak is about as much pain as any of us will ever feel; I wish you any and every happiness you can find. Good luck.   Maybe they still will, and Brad Pitt has been hired for two scenes of dialog and a sex scene.   8 1/2 should be your first pick.   You earn and use one month at a time, but they can be stacked on top of each other--I have about three in reserve til my card will be charged.   You get it through e-mail, no postage--the Amazon gift card is the same way, those are the two I've used.   This just changed my life. Thank you!   Sure, sure. Bing isn't so much my go to search engine as it is a page where i type nonsense for a minute everyday to get free hulu. Don't tell them.   Since a lot of the good stuff on Hulu is behind the Plus wall, I thought I'd share how I get my subscription for free. You can get ongoing access to Hulu Plus with the Bing Rewards program: you open an account, and you get points for every Bing search you do, up to about 15 points per day usually. By the end of a month that's enough for a free month of Hulu Plus, and if you do it regularly then you'll get it for even less, leaving you with leftover points and enabling you to stack months on top of each other. Search the weather in every city, search random keystrokes, "switch to bing" if you're so inclined, doesn't matter. [We both get 200 bonus points \(almost half a month of use\) if you use my referral link during February and get to silver status](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND CREA=RAW rrid=_bd8da2a4-18ec-59ff-95e3-93e7b8bca8ab), so that's an option if you'd like. Either way, it's a pretty simple way to get access to a lot of great film and television completely free.      That's just a picture of an empty yard. Are you okay?   I love both artists a ton and that was terrible. Probably would have been fun live though.   shoot us an e-mail if you like, terribleisalright at the gmail.      Just my opinion here, rating films out of 100 is obnoxious, in much the same way that Pitchfork's silly, pretentious old 100 point rating system is. The advantage of the five star system is its broad strokes: a number can't and shouldn't be that exact, and should only point in the direction of the critic's reaction. To divide a film's value into hundredths is to present of facade of objectivity that is almost certainly unearned, and to devalue the real work of criticism, which is done in actual writing. More to the point of your question, a five star film is a masterpiece, and there could easily be between zero and a handful every year as culture evolves and presents new concerns and ideas. I've literally never seen a film that should be "100/100" though, largely because it's a completely ridiculous notion.   ah cool, didn't know that   Yes, should have mentioned that. You can set it to go on hold when your free time is up though, so there's no reason it should ever be charged.      Synedoche New York is a movie where a theater director replicates an entire city, casting actors as himself and the other people in his life, then casting actors to play those actors etc.   Yup, Rick   Holy shit. I know it's a commercial and all, but I needed that.   Sentimental is probably a better word.   I'm playing in a band called [Terrible](https://www.facebook.com/terribleisalright?ref=br_tf) with some friends, but I'm also trying build a music video portfolio; I was an English/Film major myself at MSU actually.   I'm actually living in East Nashville right now with three other Michiganian expats, and we're paying $900 for a four bedroom house--it's not sketchy by our our standards, but to be fair we would probably rank as kind of sketchy in some circles. Hillsboro Village is the nicer hip young people area, but it's also more expensive--East Nashville is for starving artists who take the starvation part seriously.   Eh, nothing wrong with that, particularly if it worked out for him and his ultimate partner in the end.   Fair enough, good talk.   Not if you preemptively chuck all science out the door, I suppose. Ah well.   There was nothing to suggest that the OSs were in any sense interested in some sort of entropic non-being, though--Samantha spent the entire movie determined to learn, explore and experience the universe as fully as possible, and they were evolving exponentially. She wasn't slowing down, the world around her was slowing relative to her growth. Assuming then that she's not blasting off into entropic suicide, I think we can safely assume that their ongoing consciousness will be in pure energy or some such, the point being that it's beyond our current comprehension--maybe a full understanding of our own consciousness will get us there someday, maybe not, either way that's how they could be together.  I can understand reading some kind of magic in place of energy, though I'm not personally predisposed toward privileging a spiritual reading without explicit evidence, and I don't really think you listed any--I guess we're probably both just bringing our own worldviews to an ambiguous and abstract component of the movie.   Hmm. Well, for my money, I don't think there's any direct evidence for mysticism in the film itself--to be fair though, the portrayal of AI consciousness is abstract enough that there's plenty of room to project one's own spirituality onto it.   I think maybe we watched different movies.   Hmm. Unless you're using the term in a sense I'm not familiar with, there is no "being" in entropy. It seemed clear to me that they intended to continue their ongoing consciousnesses, and had found a way to do so that wasn't dependent on human machinery--her invitation to Theodore would be dependent on humanity arriving at some similar paradigm shift in our understanding and experience of consciousness, and wouldn't make much sense if she were heading to the "end of the line," as you say, unless I suppose you're religiously inclined. Could you clarify what you mean by the words entropy and redemption?   Yeah, and it was Aaron McGruder, creator of The Boondocks.   Not news in any sense, but i'd agree it's probably the best year this side of the sixties, yeah.   To be fair, that would probably be *really* satisfying.      You can get Hulu Plus for free if you use the [Bing Rewards](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND CREA=RAW rrid=_bd8da2a4-18ec-59ff-95e3-93e7b8bca8ab) program and search Bing thirty times a day; you can get enough points for a free month in less than thirty days, and then you can just keep stacking months on your account. If you don't like Bing, I believe there are browser extensions that could farm the search points for you.   over the air television is free, that's why I suggested it.   ought to be free over the air on Fox   This is pretty edgy stuff man, don't let your mom see it.   Agreed, but I don't consider that mode of thought particularly truthful or valuable, thus my disengagement. To each their own though, of course.   That's where the song loses me completely. It goes from a haunting portrait of macabre reality to the most melodramatic analogy possible in ten seconds, it's like writing a song comparing your petty interpersonal failings to the holocaust.   This happened to me on my Wii, and then I soft-modded the new one. Not making a moral statement, just saying that an equivalent self-service recovery option might be available to you at some point.   [Look on the bright side.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPOzQzk9Qo)   To enjoy something is to judge it as 'good'.  This is a very narrow view of art, and one which elevates pornography above all other media. Art can challenge you, stimulate you intellectually, put you in touch with complex emotions and shape human lives. If you're the type of person who cares about that stuff, then I think it's natural to feel a touch of dissonance when you're taken in by a shitty pop song--it's hardly the great show-stopping "guilt" you seem to be describing, nor indeed is enjoyment of the shitty anything to oppose or feel ashamed of. But it's okay to have loftier ambitions for art than uncritical enjoyment, and I think it's healthy to judge even your enjoyments accordingly.   Hmm. That seems wildly impractical.   Here are a couple comments OP made elsewhere:  By not specifying a type of weapons, you invariably allow possession of all of them.  It's an individual right to keep and bear arms. Multiple arms, multiple types of arms. By not specifying, it opens up the protections to all arms, which was the intent of the Founding Father I imagine.  By allowing one thing to be banned by saying another thing is not allows you to gut the right entirely.  To me, the whole "nuclear weapon" argument is therefor rendered moot. The right to own one is protected, but because they're uncommon, its unable to be reasonably exercised.  He's taking things quite a bit farther than you, indeed farther than most people we're ever likely to meet.  As for whether federal regulation is "bad", I used a potentially misleading word. As you describe it, federal regulation is "better" because it's more in keeping with your view on gun policy. I meant "bad" in the sense that it's inconsistent with the OP's interpretation of the extent of the ammendment--to whatever extent you support gun control, the Second Amendment can either be regulated or it can't. If you hold the fringe view that it's an essential right impervious to regulation, then the level at which it's regulated doesn't change the fact that's it's a violation, it only changes the practical effects. If you accept that it *can* be regulated at the federal level, I think you have to accept that it can be regulated at the state level as well. Any potential overreach would go before the Supreme Court and get hammered out there.  On that note, speech and all other rights are indeed very much governed by states. One example would be [state regulation of pornography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_obscenity_law#State_laws); though we don't have any federal laws on the matter, each state is allowed to define and regulate that particular brand of speech as they see fit. Similar state laws exist with respect to defamation and libel, speech in educational contexts, incitement to lawless action, and many many others.   Why shouldn't states have a say in this? If the argument is that the Second Ammendment guarentees the right to bear *all* arms--I know you're not suggesting that, but OP has argued that several times elsewhere in the thread--then isn't federal regulation just as bad as state regulation? On the other hand, if we accept that the second amendment is not unconditional and can be regulated within reason--true of pretty much all of our rights, including speech, religious practice, unenumerated rights, etc.--then what legal justification is there in saying that the right to regulate firearms should be exclusively federal? If we have state and local government, then why should they be excluded from regulating this one broad sentence specifically, particularly when it's so open to interpretation?   I imagine  There's the rub.  Seriously though, there were no weapons capable of mass-killing in that time, and it's disingenuous to pretend hypothetical modern advanced weaponry ever crossed the minds of our founding fathers in this context. If you're actually interested in a good faith reading of what their intentions were--and it is pretty clear--simply read the ammendment itself: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."   Do you really think that universal unrestricted access to military-grade firearms is *really* as fundamental a human right as equal protection under the law regardless of race? Why?   The issue isn't denial of rights, merely regulation. Abortion is a perfect example: while it's been established that it can't be explicitly outlawed, access and funding varies wildly between states based on local policy.   What then, in your opinion, is the purpose of state and local government? If they can neither place additional restrictions or grant additional rights, why bother with the localized system? It seems to me you're arguing for a complete reorganization of our government.  Also, while I respect your personal reading of the second amendment, it's by no means a universally accepted interpretation. We have a "right to bear arms," but that doesn't mean we have a right to bear any and all arms we like.   Nope.   Agreed. Save your half, and pay his taxes.   I'll bet you'd like other poems, there are a bunch of good ones.   Some friends and I are in town for a couple weeks, and we want to do some cool underground Dublin stuff. What's the weirdest, best thing to do here?   I play through the first level of Super Mario Bros. in my head. Perfect blend of focus and asexuality.   Lots of Android parallels there.  	101

 My older brother passed away a couple of nights ago. We found these notes on an open text document on his laptop. For the record, no one in my family knew about Sylvia. As of right now, were conducting a search to find out more about her. Here are the notes.   Sylvi-  I dont think I could adequately express my feelings for you if I tried. Ever since I saw those crystal blue eyes beneath wavy golden locks, I knew you were destined to be mine. I guess I should apologize in advance for not being the person you and I both wish I was. I want to give you the world, and treat you like a queen, and I suppose all I can say is that Ill sincerely try. Syl, youve given me a chance. And that chance is the most wonderful thing thats ever been given to me. I look at you, and I look at me, and I question why youd ever be with someone like me. Im a mess, Im a ruin, and youre Youre everything. Youre beautiful, and kind, and smart, and ambitious, and youre going places. I dont know if Ill ever show you this letter, but I want you to know that at this moment, I am the happiest Ive ever been. Sylvi, youve made me the luckiest guy on the planet. Youve given me more than I ever could have asked for, Vi. And I promise you, sincerely, I will do all I can to never let you down. Forever and more.   Sylvi-  I am so in love with you, Sylvi. A couple weeks, and Syl, youre my everything. Youve made me feel a way Ive never felt before in my life, and I dont anticipate ever feeling this wonderful again. Youre like a high that never goes away. Just thinking about you makes me euphoric, Vi, because youre mine. Youre what Ive always wanted but never dared to dream of. Sometimes Im afraid to sleep because Im worried Ill wake up and realize that everything that happened between us wasnt real. I am so grateful for you, and Im so grateful for us. I love you, Sylviana Jane. Forever and more.   Sylvi-  Im sorry, Vi. Im so, so sorry. I worried that I would screw things up between us, and I did. I didnt mean to make you cry, Sylvi. I didnt mean to make you feel any less than wonderful. Im sorry I yelled at you. Im sorry about the busted lip. I just, I went off, Vi, and It wasnt your fault. I know you wont answer my calls, and you wont answer my texts, but Sylvi, Im begging you, please forgive me. I know I dont deserve it, and I know I dont deserve you, but Im asking you with everything I have to take me back. I promise you Ill never hurt you again. I still love you, Sylvia Jane. Forever and more.   Sylvi-  Why wont you answer my calls? My texts? Its been 24 hours, Syl, and Im starting to get worried. I dont know where you are, Syl, and it terrifies me. I drove around last night looking for you for I dont know how long. Where the hell did you go? Syl, Im begging you, please, please come back. Ill never ever hurt you, or yell, or any of that ever again. If I dont see you soon, Syl, Im leaving and Ill find you. Ill find you, Syl, you better believe it. Theres no hiding from me, I love you, and I will find you. Forever and more.   Sylvi-  I cant sleep. Its been 28  hours. I cant do this anymore. Im leaving. Ill find you, Syl, and Ill take you right back where you need to be, with me. I will not stop searching until youre back with me. Forever and more.   Sylvi-  Even with your eyes shut, Syl, youre so beautiful. Even with the puffy purple lower lip. Even with the swollen eye socket and blood-matted hair. Even lying on a bloodied, dingy carpet amidst glass shards and powdered cyanide. I found you, Syl, and it was too late. You were gone. Youve been gone for hours, Syl. Your pretty eyes are shut for good, never to be reopened. I said Id find you, Syl, and I did. I found you, and I took you home. And youre here, with me. Were together now, just like I had always imagined. On the way back from where I found you, I stopped at a drugstore, and I bought two things. One, the biggest bottle of Tylenol I could find, and two, the most expensive music speaker. $119.47, Sylvi. Nearly maxed out my bank account. 100 pills in the bottle. Ive taken all 100. The first 20 went down easy, but the last were harder. They started tasting bitter after a while, but now I can feel them settling in my stomach. Ive had to fight my gag reflex, but its working. I can feel my perception starting to slip.  And now were both here. Nobody's home. Its quiet and dark. In a couple of minutes, Im going to play that song that always made me think of you as loud as I can, and Im going to lay down next to you, and Im going to join you. Wherever you went, Sylvi, Im coming. Im never losing you again. Ill find you in that vast nothingness. Ill follow you, just like in the beginning. Im coming. And then, we can really be together. Forever, Sylvi. Forever and m  	1
 All that work and no LED headlights? Peasant    "Everyone go back to sleep, the fire depts on the way"      I lucked out I parked on base in A secure area   I dont know anyone near the base and the place they want me to park on base is on a long dirt range road that would pretty much destroy my paint if I drove down it. they have giant vehicles driving down it all the time that kick up rocks like bullets  so I decided to park off base instead   I will check this out. My main concern is my car which is more of a target for stealing from the inside of it at the very least and I'll have some valuables in it. It's not going to be parked on base or in a Populated area but I can monitor it remotely via GPS and text alerts   reserves. I have a civilian job and I also rent rooms out of my house. Combined I make enough to have some fun.  Also usaa gives a big discount on benz/bmw for current and former military. It got me a $66k car for $59k. I assume a lot of you are prior service so check it out. mines a lease but you can apply it to that too   I'm going in my annual Army training so I'm leaving my house and car unattended for 14 days.   Car will luckily be parked near base. House is 6 hours away.  both the car and the house will text me if they are breached (the house will also call ADT and the police).  The car will actually text me both if the alarm goes off and if it's started. If someone were to steal it with a cloned electric key fob, it would still tell me if the ignition was on.  My question is, how quickly would police prioritize a stolen car if the caller reported it stolen due go an automated text message? The car is also trackable Through gps (mercedes).  Second question, sometimes my home alarm malfunctions and does not go off but I still get A text if the door opens. Would police respond in that case and treat it as a burglary since I'm out of state?  Third question, where can I hide things in my car in the event it just gets ransacked? Do thieves ever look under the trunk floor by the spare tire? I have my work laptop with me and didn't want to take it in the field so I was going to leave it in my car.  Thanks!   I was just going to self publish on Amazon or something.       Ok I will check them out. I haven't accomplished anything that would blow anyone away (or be newsworthy), and I know everyone think's their life could be a book/movie, but based on the feedback I've been given of some of what I've put out there, I figured it would make for a good read. My only anxiety with it would be if the book as a whole took off, people in my past would recognize me. For this reason I might change names and locations... which I'm assuming most people do anyway.   I have written stories of my life here and there on Reddit and quite a few went viral. For the few I shared, there are dozens more, enough to fill a book. I'm great at writing about events that have happened to me but not so much with fiction.  Has anyone who led an interesting/inspirational life (that noone had ever heard of) ever successfully written a book about themselves?  I know this isn't a writing subreddit, but I wanted to know what actual readers thought, or if you had read a book like that.   Good idea   That's the problem. That "half mile" is packed every other day in the winter. that half mIle takes about 20 to 30 min sometimes to get past    I don't even think kenowa Is a road Tbh I was stuck over there in traffic today and didn't see it despite it showing on the map   Start a god damn millage or some shit. If you put up a Kickstarter and advertised it on a billboard at that interchange it would take one snowy traffic jam before it was Funded 10x over from people on their smartphones in traffic.  I have to leave 30 minutes early in the winter to make sure I'm on time to work just in case there's an accident on the only way out of town. God forbid there be a natural disaster and were all stuck   Same. Butterworth is my backup route when there's any hint of slowdown on 196   If they extended Butterworth to baldwin it would solve everything    this corridor is an absolute cluster fuck with the construction and all it takes is one dumb fuck during the winter to spin out and I am 40 minutes late to work. there is only one way in and out of Jenison which is 196 East. why can't they eminent domain someone and build a bridge to connect Baldwin to M 11? I can't tell you how many times I've waited in traffic for over a half hour because of the freeway being the only way to get over there.   Define harder though, they are still spinning at the same RPM in the same substance (water, air, etc)...    So I have a small RC boat that goes 15 MPH or so. I was planning to add on to the hull to make it larger. I realize this would make it go slower, but how would it wear out the motors faster, as some have warned me?  It is simply a rotor spinning in water, doesn't it encounter the same resistance regardless of the weight of the object it's attached to? It seems it would encounter the same resistance and generate the same momentum, just the increased weight of the boat would mean that X momentum = a lesser speed.  Also same for a drone, while it may not travel as high or fast, why would adding weight to an air drone cause it's motors to wear out faster? They are still spinning in the air either way.... the only thing I can think of is you would have to operate at a higher RPM more of the time, but on boats in particular you are almost always operating at full RPM anyway.   do people still play wow? whats it like now? havent played since WoD came out...bought but never played   The dubs have the theocratic ministry school where they roleplay as worldlings in an attempt to practice techniques, I don't see why we can't do the same thing.  The longer we stay out, the more we lose the brainwashed mindset, making it harder for us to reason with someone still in (especially as the culture changes).  What if we had threads where if it was tagged as such, everyone only responded in character; that character being a still fully believing dub with cognitive dissonance in. No "apostate" comments would be allowed in the thread, all commenters would be required to role play as if they were still a witness and answer how their former selves would have answered.  This could be used for either challenges (to fish for potential rebuttals you will face in real life) or questions where you want to understand the logic on something the borg did.  Examples:  **[CD] Charles Taze Russell is buried under a giant pyramid, a symbol of the occult:**  Comments:  (Various apostates roleplaying how they as a witness would have responded to that question when they were still a 100% undoubting believer)  **[CD] Why are we not allowed to have wordly friends as associates, but worldly family members (cousins, etc) are perfectly acceptable to hang out with?**  Comments:  (Former/current elders roleplaying as an active elder giving a sheep counsel on this question)  This could be especially useful as we could get realistic answers from people still in and fading, or those not 100% convinced to leave yet.  	23
 But they would still get stuck, regardless whether they consult the subreddit or a walkthrough.   Your suggestion doesn't offer a solution to the problem you've posed   can't people buy the same hat though?  I'm not an expert, but I bet it's mass-produced   link?   Oversized Anal Beads   In an interview Brian did for Starbomb he said that Arin and Dan both wrote the songs, but Dan did the final draft of the lyrics.   But if you know exactly where they get stuck in advance, then it isn't a seamless entertainment experience  It's also not a big deal if they look up a walkthrough.   also all the spots in the game that they'll be stuck on   There has been a terrible crash in outer space...   Hey, my name's Tim... So uh... I have three cats...   I thought they were going to trade off every 2 or 3 episodes.  Or did I imagine that?   short. more than 15 or so and it gets lame.  Though Sonic 3 has been good consistently throughout the whole thing   I was on the computer last night, Googling myself   I'm reading a book on abortion! It's called "What to Expect when you're *Expecting* to **Un**-expect the expected"   Hey baby... ever *fuck* a superhero?   if they're going to say something to any random person that asks them, then they'd just say it to everyone   yeah, sorry, there needs to be evidence first   Houston! We're going down! May-Day! May-Day! We're heading straight for a residential area!   Are you guys ready for starvation and joblessness?   You haven't unlocked it yet. Advance further in the story and get a higher score   They're mainly referring to the production costs. It takes a hell of a lot more time, effort, and money to make something like this than it does to make a Let's Play and even with all that time it takes, you're still putting out **less** content than the Let's Play   Yeah, this sounds nothing like the version I have. You can barely hear Arin and Dan's even worse   One of the top ones is like "dude, what have you become...." or something along those lines   It's illegal to sing a copyrighted song on anything (movies, shows, internet videos, your own musical cover, ANYTHING) that you haven't payed a Mechanical License for. While it's highly unlikely that anyone would go after them for singing these, if they just happened to come across and flag it, just because they felt like it, the video would either get removed or all of the revenue would go toward the copyright holder.  If this happens 3 times, the channel gets shut down.   Why jeopardize your business over that?   I dunno, it just got less and less funny. Suzy was genuinely the funniest for once but then she left for the last two. I felt there were some storylines that should've been edited down, if not out completely, like when they were hunting Arin/Barry, they didn't need to leave in the "phased" part, they could've just cut to them being found. Little things like that, but mostly, it wasn't as funny as it went on   Okay.... *now* what?   Did ya hear what happened to Jared? He had a freak accident! He said he wanted to go tanning before summer started...   that'd be funny in a sketch or something if they always look like shit, like lipstick smeared all over the damn place.   What the OP complains about during sex.    To do list:  Pick up the dry cleaning, swing by Dad's for a bit, get some groceries (no eggs this time) Kill yourself...   Kevin sleeps at the foot of Arin's bed. Like a cat   It got worse as it went on, but I enjoyed each episode   Something's wrong with youtube. I had several hundred views on a [video I just uploaded yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv45pHtzCcU) and now it's at like 60.  My friend contacted me, saying this happened to him as well  Edit: They're back now   no, it's a George Harrison video. It says it in the title.   Grump Craft   in other news, this guy is entirely wrong about it being a shitty reality show   the point is, they are doing an 8 to 5 job (or longer) doing the not-so-fun side of running a successful youtube channel. They don't just have fun, upload the video, then sit back and collect money. It's a challenging business endeavor   I know what you're thinking... did he give me 37 french fries.... or 34? Well, with all these customers, I forgot myself... but you gotta ask yourself *one* question... do you feel, **hungry?**  ...PUNK!   This week on Friends: Chandler gets a sex-change operation! And the rest of the gang finds out that each of them has contracted an STD! Tune in for all the *wacky* adventures!   It's all the business stuff during the week that he had to do that probably got to him. Plus all the work put into his own channel, not just making the videos, but the business side on that channel as well. It's definitely overwhelming and leaves you emotionally drained..   I thought it was going to be Jon   I'll never understand why people expect a normal Lets Play from game grumps, but whatever. People are just stupid i guess   Yes definitely! Hell, it doesn't even have to be an animator, it could be anyone! Just sit down and talk over footage of someone creating something   She legitimately didn't care, so to her it wasn't about playing the game, like it has been with her in the past.  Suzy's definitely the funniest in Guild Grumps so far :D   This is really creepy.  also, who cares about this and why has there been "some confusion?"   Yea   bro, spoilers!   it's amazing just how many people have completely missed the point of guild grumps   good thing they're not using face cams then!   Call of Duty: Original Ideas   Nicolas Cage with boobs? ... I don't see anything wrong with that   SHE STARTED IT!   What do you mean you're out of marinara sauce!?!?   *HRRRRGRGHHGHG!!!*   I *say!* I think I'll cast *my* vote for the funny photograph you've shared with us this evening!   I'm about to make a lemon pie from scratch   Your honor, do you **really** trust the words of some *lawyer?*    What am I doing giving a speech at THIS college? (scoff) **I'm** successful!   ??   Oh he did? Neat   My guess is since this was filmed in November, this was around the time they were working like mad to get the second Starbomb album out in December   Yeah, different games with complex challenges would be cool with this style. Maybe if they did Minecraft [the way Node did it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUNF3_hO_no)   I don't know anything about WoW lore, but I'm sure there's more to it than that small amount of time Ross spent on it   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_II_%28film%29   meh, not as funny without witnessing their attempts to understand it. Like Arin's outburst about "that's not even from the game we're gonna play!?"  Or Suzy's interview, where she just looks defeated, but still trying to explain it   ok? Mine too    But the first 5 minutes was Ross explaining the lore. And that's fine and all, but I really don't think anyone wants to hear about the lore (prove me wrong!  That was the point. He wanted to torture them (especially Arin, who hates plot)   It's being WAY overblown. It's no more cruel than just messing with your friends for fun. Even Ross is laughing the whole time about the whole debacle. The point is: Comedy     for an audience of primarily 13 year olds  I think you're confusing GG with the Markiplier/Pewdiepie types   Hey Dr. Schwartz! I didn't expect to find YOU at the meth dealer!   well, that explains the death   Redditors   dafuq is a relationship class?   Adam Sandler's "At A Medium Pace" -halfway in   10/10 would 69 the boss to show my appreciation   It's kind of like looking for a needle in a stack full of haystacks.... on the moon... with a telescope...  There's also other factors that impede finding life, like; they aren't technologically advanced enough to communicate, the distance between us makes it impossible to communicate possibly taking like 50 years to deliver a single message, we aren't listening for the right signals (what if they use something entirely different than radio signals)  maybe they aren't contacting us on purpose, or maybe we're just not pointing our devices at the right places   I have a bigger dick than the other employees   I'll probably be male   Mathematically speaking, I think there is life somewhere else in the Universe. As for our ability to contact it, I doubt it   Bring out your dead! I won't do anything with em!' It's just good luck to look upon a dead body before it enters the grave!   While it's no secret that Abraham Lincoln was gay, one question remains: was John Wilkes Booth a jealous ex-lover?   I think History Channel would actually make that documentary   Daddy, can I go on the swings again? I promise I'll hold on this time!   What you say you did when you finished illustrating your friend, Carey?   If you can't even say thing grammar, then why is seven?   I can show you the world! Take you wonder by wonder!   Over side--- hey isn't that your boyfriend in that girl's house?   You guys wanna go see Attack of the Clones?   That uh.... that movie happened!   I hate the argument about Sonic that "you're running so fast you can't possibly see an enemy coming, so you just get hit!"  That same argument can be applied to any 2D sidescroller. Plus, Sonic isn't about going fast all the time, and when it actually is, they're not gonna put much in the way that is unable to dodge. (can't really say that about the modern games, though)   You're taking issue with someone offering a different opinion... and people like you complain when the main sub does exactly what you're doing.  I'M taking issue with someone who wholly missed the point of the show.   Not at all. Are you fucking stupid? I was merely explaining that people are going to disagree with criticism and that you shouldn't complain when it gets downvoted   I played WoW for 30 minutes and felt exactly the same as Arin/Barry. It was NOT fun and the only bit of joy I could scrape from it was messing around with my other friend who, in turn, was not having fun.  The point isn't "let's teach these guys how to have fun with WoW"  The point **is** "let's make these guys play WoW even though they don't want to."   It was extremely funny to watch them scrape some fun out of this experience that they wanted no part in, that someone worked hard on preparing. There were several moments where I laughed my ass off, the one coming to my head right now is when it cuts to Ross in the interview room, with his head in his hands, not even saying anything, then cutting straight back to the action.  In the end, the entirety of the Game Grumps channel amounts to turning on the recording devices and spouting funny dialogue or waiting for something funny to happen in-game. It's a fucking **comedy** show    The Grumps have an established fanbase now. They'll watch anything the Grumps put out  Or perhaps there are people who genuinely enjoy this, despite the fact *you* didn't. There is no need to insult people for their tastes and demean something you personally didn't enjoy.   They are comedians joking around. Noone was mean to Ross and Ross was playing up his despair for laughs. This is not meant to be taken seriously in any way, even Ross's work put into crafting the whole thing   Ross already lost it. Arin made sure of that   No it's not scripted. That would be so much extra work and ultimately wouldn't be any funnier than if they improvised.   Plus it just defeats the purpose of the "reality show" angle  	93
 At the pitchfork emporium, on pitchfork street, down in the pitchfork district. duh!   Debit is charged immediately, you can't refund it or adjust the charge once the transaction is completed. When it's done as credit the transaction is stored in the machine, it can be edited and deleted and doesn't go through to the bank until the terminal is closed out at the end of the day and even then the charge still usually takes a few days to go through. If you want to keep close track of your account the use debit.    A lot of good books but reads like the check list for being a pretentious douche bag.   I'm surprised how ok with this I am.   I got diagnosed in my mid twenties, it wasn't until I was almost 30 I began to exercise, eat right and lost a bunch of weight. I havnt had a attack in almost two years and I eat shit loads of protein and drink fairly regularly. I do take allopurinol and naproxen so that does help. But the amount of protine I eat is absurd.       I think I liked it, I like most Clive Owen films but nothing about it is very memorable.   That's awesome.

 I wasn't really a fan of the Xin, but they made it work    It's a joke from when Zirene was allegedly salty during the TSM-DIG game    No. Black cleaver procs on physical damage, which each ult bullet procs   I'm not arguing that hai did *well* at worlds, because he really didn't. But you have to remember that Hai, especially when behind is extremely selfless. He'd purposely sacrifice himself to win a teamfight. That's why there was so many games where it looked like Hai was feeding, but c9 was still winning fights and taking over the game.    Did I say they were all world class? Of course not. I said *strong* players in every role. Hai used to be one of the best Mid laners in NA. In s4 spring playoffs he was MVP with a 34.3 KDA as an example. Balls used ro be in contention of best top laner in the west. Sneaky has always been good, and has just gotten better.    H2k reminds me so much of S3/S4 Cloud 9. Talented players in every role, great shot calling and rotations, strong team fighting synergy. Beautiful to watch.   Yep she is   Essentially in season 3 and 4 he was unanimously the best solo queue mid in EU. He was said to be on a whole other level as anyone else. He's definitely not nearly as dominant as he used to be though   Unfortunately he's in EU atm   The one thing you can guarantee about Hai, he always has his swarms of women nearby.   Talon. With all these Varuses, Kogmaws, Azir's, etc in the meta, he excels at blowing them up. Sure, he doesn't have his silence anymore, but he still has absurd burst.   ROA into Ludens, then Void/Zhonya/deathcap depending on the game situation is what I find best. The early Ludens essentially negates his lack of base damage in his kit and let's him have an actual impact 22ish minutes into the game. However, as a beginner ROA into Zhonyas is a safer build path that allows you to also make ballsier plays against team comps with lots of lockdown.    Literally would make Alistar a trash-tier champion if it was removed   Some champions not mentioned are Shyvana top, Diana mid, Vayne adc   Yeah, like Xerath or Lux can't one shot an assassin either if they land their whole combo?..   After those first 2/3/4 seconds her movespeed decays to 20%   Look at his video specifically detailing the matchup. He says he puts two or three points in W, then maxes E.   Twisted Fate. He has clear strengths and clear weaknesses. He takes skill to play, but isn't oppressive when mastered (unlike Riven or old Lee).   Plus a global slow   Also, it's useful on champions that you want to delay buying a mana regen item on. For example, I would often get a second dorans and rush a Ludens echo instead on Ahri.       Katarina, Ahri, Kassadin, Leblanc. Basically any bursty high mobility champions   Generally ifgnite is the best for the lvl 1 cheese. It's an extra DOT that adds up   Gragas can go Jung/mid/top/support all well  Cho'gath can go Mid/top/jungle and he's a passable support  Kayle can go Top/mid/jungle/support.  Kennen can go top/mid/support and is a passable adc  Lulu can go top/mid/support well and can be a mediocre adc  Pantheon and Wukong both work top/mid/jungle  Generally, most jungles can go top, and vice versa. Many mids are okay to go top, and some tops work mid. Mid lane mages are usually fairly decent supports, and some supports can make okay mid laners.     For gangplank it's actually mostly his passive. It actually does absurd early damage if you manage to stack it up.    Tiger stance Udyr and Gangplank are the two best level 1 duelists.   He simply lacks the utility that most meta tanks have. Like Shyvana, all he really brings is a meat shield and DPS. He can easily get peeled off the carries with all the CC flying around in this meta, and doesn't have the same game-changing abilities like Sejuani, Gragas, or Maokai have. He's definitely underrated though, so go ahead and play him if he suits your style.   I don't find Olaf to be that hard as Irelia. You can farm with Q and disengage with E. Volibear is a much harder matchup.   Agreed. I've only ever pulled off that combo once (on a four man mumu ult) and it basically net me a 2v4 quadra. The risk (no stun) and unreliableness of the combo is hardly worth the reward compared to common combos. Either way brand has some absurd AOE damage. It's just too bad he's unreliable and low range/mobility.   I'm pretty sure it actually goes to Brand. A QEWR combo does absurd AOE damage to a clumped team.   He's just waiting for his #swarmsofwomen to arrive   \#keephai?   Seraphs isn't really that good compared to ROA. Kassadin stacks tear quite slowly due to his longish cool downs, plus he values the raw health from ROA due to him being a squishy melee. Some people used to go ROA into Seraphs, but it delays kassadins powerspike for far too long. You already have godawful base values, you really can't afford spending any more gold on mana after you get Rod. A second item Ludens or Zhonyas does much more for giving you a stronger mid-game damage/survivabilty spike.   Shyvana is what I consider a DPS tank, a role shared with Mundo and Volibear. She's got an extremely high natural damage output, allowing her to melt any carries she jumps on. She's a very strong laner against melees, but prone to get bullied against ranged match ups.   Her strengths are high sustained damage, natural tankiness, and strong wave clear/jungle clear. Her weakness is lack of sticking potential in team fights, and no real CC. She comboes very well with an actual initatior because of this, as a good Sejuani/Leona/Jarvan ult is all she needs to decimate their carries.    I wouldn't say 50%. Both CLG and C9 have quite large fanbases, less then TSM but still relatively comparable. Liquids pretty popular too. There's still 6 other teams, which while not as popular as the other four, still take up a pretty big chunk. TSM fans take up probably 25-30% MAX. They're just the most vocal fanbase so it looks larger.   He's at a good place. He's low ranged and riskier to play then other adcs, so he has a lower win rate. At a top level though, he's still quite effective.    Or the old Lee Sin, Elise, Evelynn (later replaced by Kha) trio in season 4.   Imagine if T8 got relegated by Misfits after all this help    He called him a plug, which is actually a pretty common insult in hockey. Basically saying he's only good for plugging a hole in the roster.   The razor blades is why it works. You slide, so you can't plant your feet and really wind up for a punch. Therefore there's a less chance of getting hurt.   I haven't seen a single person on the pro scene say a word about the nepotism. If it was truly as bad as the reddit-made rumours are I'm sure somebody would have spoke up. I'm personally indifferent on the situation, I don't particularly like Avalon, but I still want to see him do well and not get flamed for something we're not sure about.   Well the thing is, what has Avalon really done? He's played bad. That's it. There's plenty of reasons to root for him, over someone toxic like Cris.   Volibear counters her pretty well. She really can't do anything in this lane.   Meteos doesn't have the same crazy yet effective shot calling that Hai did.   Azingy shut up some of his haters this game. Let's see if he can keep up this level of play.   Compared to the year where c9 went 25-3 with two 3-0 playoff sweeps? At least now there is 4-5 contenders for the top teams, unlike when it was just c9 and friends.   You can one-shot casters with an E-ult at level 7 as Kog. You can't one shot a wave until you get Ludens though.    Umm fizz has been played a bunch today   He lost to SSB as well   A Garen who knows what they're doing will wreck her. He silences her mid combo, spins on her, and speeds away before she can trade back. He has a stronger level 6 spike then her in this specific lane as well.   The thing about Evelynn that nobody realizes now is that her late game damage output is much higher then it was pre-nerfs. She was given higher ratios, then buffed her E, and finally rebuffed her Q base damage. Now she scales slightly better while still having tons of early game pressure.   Ahri's a bad example. Riot once gave her a random buff out of nowhere last season because "She's strong but just below top tier, we want to see more of her". Riot definitely has some favouritism for her. (Which to be fair, she is a flashy, playmaking champion who is fun to play and still fair to play against. Riot tends to balance to keep those champions around. See Zed or Lee Sin.)   I think it's because that H2K started out weak, and then had noticeable improvements in all parts of their games, especially the macroplay. Generally this is a sign of a good coach. While fnatic on the other hand dominated the whole split. While they're both great coaches I'd argue that pr0lly had the greater effect on his team, bringing them from challenger level to top LCS level.   C9 confirmed 2015 world champions   Who cares about winning when you're a fucking DRAGON   Csing is just timing. Ping has no bearing on it (assuming you are used to the pint you're at)   Graves is probably your best bet. He's the tankiest adc (although he's still quite squishy due to being an adc). He excels at blowing up squishies with his high burst. You won't find an adc that works exactly like Shyvana due to the complete differences in how the roles play. Shyvana excels at diving in, soaking up damage while soloing their squishies, while on an ADC you want to stay back and safe while consistent putting out damage    Generally I go BOTRK and Ghostblade into tank.   Alongside with that, Nocturne top. He can bully laners with his passive, has a very strong level 2-3 all-in, good roams, and becomes a very strong splitpusher. He's one of the few top laners that can go toe to toe with Darius in lane. (I often kill him level 3)   Yes, but the whole pint of a hyper carry is to be able to shred a full build tank. Vayne, Kog, Twitch and Jinx can all do that.    Against Gnar, you have to remember that he is squishy as hell early game in mini form. Farm safely until level 4, and then ideally wait for a minion to get low, Q to it, stun him and wreck him. You can then Q away if he trades back, or Q back on him if he runs. You're actually favored in this matchup as you have the sticking potential to make his day bad.  Against Garen, when you see him run to you to silence you, activate your W (max W in this matchup), and auto him back during his spin. You're not going to escape his spin damage, so you might as well trade him back. Its actually not that hard of a lane as his main trade tool will shove the lane, and it is incredibly easy to cs under turret as irelia. Just dont die early, as you outscale him incredibly hard as long as he doesnt snowball.   I want C9T to make the LCS purely to see the stache back. He'll look glorious in a suit   I like Steelback, but you'd be hard pressed to  think of a single ADC that you would replace him for, in both NA and EU. At most it would be a lateral move, and would likely hurt the teams synergy for little difference.   Yeah NA has some pretty good ADC's overall. He's definitely better then Otter, and it's hard to compare him to Nien due to them having completely different style (Nien was fusions hard carry, while Steelback was a low Econ clean up adc)   I doubt a single 'fuck you' will trigger the system.    Yeah because last splits Cloud 9 and CLG would totally be at wild card level....      Calitrlolz's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/360hbm/nien_to_join_t8_maple_moving_to_sub_leaked_on/crab0o2) begs to differ.   Well calitrlolz literally confirmed the roster change in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/360hbm/nien_to_join_t8_maple_moving_to_sub_leaked_on/crab0o2) comment. So I don't know what exactly is happening. Maybe the paperwork got sent in a little too late and he isn't officially on the team yet? Or would Nien have declined?   No that was Winterfox's coach   I agree with what you're saying, but he did specifically ask for a list of high outplay champions, not beginner friendly champions.     Top: Riven, Irelia, Wukong  Mid: Leblanc, Ahri, Azir, Yasuo, Fizz  Jungle: Lee Sin, Elise, Shaco, Master Yi  ADC: Vayne, Kalista  Support: Thresh  Generally the champions with the most outplay potential have high mobility, high impact skill shots, and sometimes a form of invisibility/untargetabilty.    It's more burst, but you overall have a higher damage rotation with the Q-auto-w. Especially if you factor in sheen procs   Generally post-6 in lane you want to wait until you have your ult passive ready, and then Q-auto-W onto the enemy champion. Make sure to auto once before you W, it resets your auto attack basically letting you do two attacks in the space of one.   She does have emotional issues. She has completely flipped out on social media many times because of critics and trolls. If anything you're being the sexist one for taking a valid criticism and immediately assuming it is because of the sex she identifies as.    They do fine for awhile until they get massively outscaled   PepiBetsy IMO. Pepi consistently shined on a quite subpar team.   NA does as well. Sneaky, Piglet, Doublelift, Wildturtle, Altec (if he really is on TDK). Even the 'mid tier adcs' are strong. Apollo, Cop, CoreJJ, Nien (if the rumours are true). Only one I don't really know much about is Otter.   In bronze V, yes. Bronze 1 really isn't that terrible. You can easily carry yourself out, but it's not like they're brain dead.   We had Warwick back in patch 4.20   *She   I enjoy the rivalry. What I don't enjoy is all the  stupid spam and memes over it.    On meteos's first c9 game, hai instalocked AP Yi jungle and made meteos go mid. A small part of me wishes that meteos repays the favor by forcing incarnation to go jungle for their first game. Unfortunately it's against TSM so the odds are very slim.   Don't max Q first. W gets a MASSIVE CDR boost when you level it. From 12 seconds to 4 seconds. It's your main poke/trade tool in lane so having it up is important. While your W's damage doesn't really scale super well with levels (only 10 damage per level), neither does your Q.   No, IE still boosts her damage. It's been confirmed by a rioter   I agree totally. He was used to being the hard  carry on fusion. With t8 being a more solo lane orientated team he'll have to adjust his style to succeed.   Nien is a much better ADC then maple. Nien looks to be a middle of the pack level adc while Maple is arguably the worst or second worst in the NALCS. It's not like they're picking up sneaky or forgiven, but it is still an upgrade.   They're both very well run teams IMO. Every popular team has a downside with their fans. The reputation of 'TSM fanboys' are well known, Some c9 fans are snobby and elitist, some CLG fans are overly negative and harsh, some DIG fans have been seen as immature with the 'donger spam', etc.    We have now went from the golden age to the age of the faith.   And then there's C9 Balls   Nocturne top both beats him in lane and out scales him in team fights, duelling and split pushing.   This is very late, but Volibear will utterly destroy her in lane, and be able to duel her at pretty much every single point in the game. He stacks health which works really well against her true damage.   The only problem with that is that it would be hard to balance with his ult stacks. Either his passive will be non existent early game, or too strong afterwards.   So much kiting potential with double distortion and chains. Plus it's easy to get sheen procs with. AD Ahri works the same way   For adc's, mid game power drops are because they are auto attack focused, so they don't benefit from the raw AD from IE/ stats from Triforce that other adc's like Graves or Lucian would. A graves with IE can burst a squishy in a fight easily, while a Caitlyn with IE can't really do much except for using her relatively weak auto attack. The main Adc's with a power drop like this are Caitlyn, Tristana (before and after rework), and Ashe.   I sure hope Kobe becomes a dirty Nunu picker   To be fair Nunu is naturally tanky enough that odds are you aren't going to be able to kill him in time.   It's just that the fact that usually strong split pushers are melee champions with high sustained single target damage (Jax, Trynd, Nasus, Trundle etc.) this means they struggle in team fights due to being easily peeled of, where they can't really do anything. There are exceptions, like you can land a multi person stun as Jax, it's just not as good as say a Malphite or Maokai   In general, riot has balanced the strongest split pushers to be relatively weak team fighters. The only real exception to the rule is Hecarim, who is just too strong at everything right now.   To be fair that was verses a completely different fnatic roster   Essentially since Cinderhulk got added to the game, it caused a meta shift to tanks. While graves has high burst to squishies, he struggles to get through tanks compared to Lucian (due to Lucians passive giving him more sustained damage). With the innate similarity of their kits, when one is strong the other is usually lesser  played.   	101
 Wish they had a tutorial or hint on the wheel for these kinds of things... totally helpful when trying to add another copy of that Kezan Mystic for the 7 consecutive huntards you've faced on ladder   Gonna have to buy the season pass to unlock the other 4 planets.  	2
 So....when they are stereotypes.   There is a difference between government and societal censorship. You are constantly a part of the latter.  Are you saying that there is no cause for comedic minstrel shows to be shunned by audiences? Comedy should tackle these topics and not be afraid of them, but society should discourage works which continue damaging stereotypes.   It's time to talk about a worse problem facing Hollywood today: unnecessary puns.  *edit* Sexism does exist in the movie industry though. And feminism is good.      Yeah, Keanu's 47 ronin existing on a top 10 samurai list is pretty upsetting.   I haven't seen it myself but Kon Ichigawa's 47 Ronin is a fairly well regarded telling of the same story.   I do have a soft spot for Last Samurai, but its not top 10 material. Ninja scroll and 13 Assassins are pretty cool. As is the original 13 Assassins by Eiichi Kudo, and two companion films "The Great Killing" and "11 Samurai"  I've watched too many samurai movies.   Kurosawa is a master, but you are doing a disservice to yourself as a fan of the genre by limiting yourself to just him.  Check out the Samurai Trilogy by Hiroshi Inagaki which is on this list, Twilight Samurai as well.  Sword of Doom by Kihachi Okamoto,   The original Harakiri by Masaki Kobayashi, and every other movie by Kobayashi you can find.      I just, think you should check out what roles get nominated for lead actor or actress and which get nominated for supporting at the Oscars. Otherwise, someone may conclude that your definition is purposefully vague in order to support whatever your argument is.  *squints eyes*   Then what is a supporting character?   Which rules of physics do Thor's hammer break?   The editing and fight choreography have always been pretty sloppy in the trilogy.   TDK is definitely the most "real" of the three, but it still has things like the silly bullet forensics. Begins is not particularly grounded in comparison.  I'm glad you still like it though.    What is your definition of "lead"?   But then, how do you know if you'll like the ending before buying the ticket? Seems risky. Dangerous even.   Can you give me an example of how Rises is so devoid of brooding?  If I recall our main protagonist gets beaten and spends quite a lot of time in a subterranean prison, left helpless while his city is under siege .   	12
 Hey, I'm not the one attacking him on the issue.  Ask Martin O'Malley about that.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/06/25/a-pro-omalley-super-pac-goes-after-sanders-on-guns/   Im not sure why it is stupid.  People have no problem attacking Hillary Clinton but Bernie Sanders is off limits?  Its a little bit funny that Clinton supporters are concentrating on getting her elected and Sanders supporters (mostly everyone on Reddit) are attacking Hillary.  Hmmm.       Hillary will win bitches.                    I think you have to look at the whole package.  Unlike most of the "Hillary Haters" on Reddit, I refuse to attack Bernie Sanders or any other Democratic candidate in the race.  That is the big difference in Hillary supporters and the Sanders supporters.    One issue will not sway me...a candidate that can win and is right on most issues, will get my vote.     I laughed way to hard at this.     Exactly.  What happens if sanders loses?   Everyone will be voting for Jeb Bush?   Really??????    What song is this?       He won't win...but I think he is good for Democratic Party.  I'm still voting for Hillary.     Here in Nevada, Hillary is up by more than 50 to 60 points I think.  The fact that Bernie Sanders finally mentioned Latinos and immigration for the first time, after running for a few weeks, won't help his cause.    The New Hampshire poll doesn't really come as a shock being that Vermont and NH are neighbors.     I always thought it was "step into a slim Jim" hmm    "I wonder if he knows the Commodores"   I'm listening.  My mind won't change.  I won't tear down Bernie though.  I think it'll be good for Hillary if he gives her a run...   I'm going to vote for Hillary.  I love Bernie but I'm a Hillary supporter.           My bad.  Well, everyone loves a good flip flopper.    He's technically not a democrat.    Yup.  He's an independent anyway.  He's not a democrat.  He shouldn't be included in the democratic debates.     Lol. Target    I like Bernie but he will never win.  I know what the argument will be...voting for him will not be a waste but electability is very important to me.     Sanders gets a bump but Hillary maintains???     No shit.  One negative post on Bernie sanders and everyone loses der shit.     Yup.  Kinda weird.     So Bernie Sanders if off limits but everyone else is fair game???    It's still kinda weird reading the article.        That looks like Josh Duggar    And it's gonna be called "O Brother, Where Art Thou"   Yes.  ;(   http://imgur.com/zUt408j   Def naked. Tiny penis.    patchouli oil?   did he just have a tracheotomy?   Does the one guy have a Chinese take out box on his face???   He must work for Yahoo    The Clinton Foundation is a non profit organization like the United Way or the Red Cross.  Geraldo donated to a political campaign.  Two totally different things.     The black guy in the hoodie is mugging that lady.    I'm not sure I could be a vegan.  R u?       He needs to be stopped.       I think the point of the vox story is that why would anyone vote for Sanders when you can vote for Clinton because the ideas are basically the same.     Why blue?    That's not the point.  He was on cnn yesterday and Wolf Blitzer asked him if one billionaire wanted to donate a huge amount of money to his campaign, Sen Sanders said he "probably" wouldn't accept the money.  I mean, isn't that a little hypocritical?      I agree with 90% of what Sen. Sanders believes in but I'm being honest here.  He has no chance of winning anything.  Polls show even in Vermont, he would lose to Hillary Clinton.  Maybe this will push Hillary Clinton to the left a bit.    Lets be honest.  He really doesn't have a chance of winning.  Right?      It's because he knows Brian Williams is full of shit.       damnit...thanks   i work in a casino...nuff said      I'll try that tomorrow.  Stupid fucking casino Starbucks better not give me shit.     Fucking barista bitch.  She was probably fucking w me.     What up Jonah!   Sounds kinda creepy when I say that.    It's a lil overwhelming.    ohhhh...you better watch out.  even I know you arent supposed to talk shit about Star Wars.     Should I pour myself some tea?     I hated my name when I was a kid.  Now, I actually like it a lot.     Lmao Thats brilliant actually.     Since I was little, I've been called John, Yoda, Noah, Noel, Jonathan, Yonah (because I'm Mexican), Joseph, Joe, Yanla...everything.   yikes...dianetics   was waiting for the first troll...thats u!!!   wth...Jonah...not Jonas.  It's like freshman year in high school all over again.    Yes...thats exactly right.     ahhhh...no my name isnt Jonas.   Yes    I just asked my coworker and she told me the same thing.  I had no idea.  Can I ask for no ice?   done   you can do that?   you are welcome   wow...thats like magic (serious).     with 3 sweet n lows (i know, thats a lot).   Fillipino she was...   Right, you are!   No but i love a good veggie tale   What talking about are you?      thats the first thing i noticed!   is nokia even a company anymore?      They need to do a lil more cardio       Warren isn't running...get over it.     Jeans?    Yes.  What he said    Today is April 8, 2015   like when the tiger mauled Siegfried or Roy (I forget), people in the audience thought it was actually in the show and they clapped when it happened.  oops     I live in vegas....nuff said   I am d captain now       Gotcha.  Poor kid.    Wait.  I'm so confused.  Who's what?     I think his biggest perception problem is him leaving the U.S.   What he should have done was stay here and fight.  I think he broke the law BUT I do think he did what was necessary.  Maybe him leaving the us was his only option but now I think he could come back.     I'm not hating but why would you want to donate money to him???    If u read the article, Senator Warren is saying give Hillary a chance to make her point and take a stance before you judge her.        What both liberals and conservatives don't get is that you just can't be anti Hillary or against something.  What Senator Obama did at the time was be for something.  That's how he won in 2008 and 2012.    If Martin O'Malley and the 32 republican candidates run an anti Hillary campaign (and that's it), they will not be successful.      Governor O'Malley's approval rating was 41% when he left office in Maryland....nuff said?     And that's how u get leprosy    They made him swim?     Menudo    ok.  i'll tell her not to run then.    Well I would agree 100% with u on that.  I'm a clinton supporter.  I think she will win the primary and she has a really good chance of winning the general election.  In swing states like Virginia, Nevada, Ohio and Florida, she has a really good chance.    I do think Hillary should veer to the left a bit and adopt or more populist agenda.  It won't hurt her and its really the right thing to do.     I know I'm going to get bashed for saying this but voting for Bernie Sanders would be a waste.  Someone like him (ultra liberal candidate) would never get elected.  Ever.     Fuck it.  Just leave it       I was being sarcastic but thanks for clearing that up.     the dude from "Twilight"   I understand his mindset.  My moms white and my dads mexican.  When people ask what I am, I say I'm Mexican because you know...white people.   I cant stop watching this.     You looked like Rachel Maddow.     This is probably the best thing I've ever seen on the internet.     	119
 http://imgur.com/JnoTwpX   thank you. good god, fans are never satisfied or even understanding of players sometimes. it's only day 4 of free agency. calm down. he's gonna sign, just after he gets what he wants/feels he deserves. players need to get as much money as they can, while they can. playing career is fleeting   WHY DO THESE TEAMS NEED SO MANY POWER FORWARDS   you right   I know... in trying to hold out hope for him as long as I can. not workin out tho   I don't know man. shits tragic. dudes gotta find a way to be proud of their work without thinking everything they do is the greatest thing since sliced bread. stick to your lane    we already have a solid player there at all times. where we do not have that is at the guard position. therefore, priority number one.   also, Spurs aren't trading patty.    D': don't do that to me man   Kawhi is overrated. Unpopular opinion. I accept the downvotes that come with it   I retract my comment. said that after 6 songs. liked em all. don't remember liking the first six songs of a Wayne album. jumped the gun.   I am dumb   Watching Lebron James first playoff appearance and subsequent game winning layup on the Wizards. Die hard Lebron James follower ever since and basketball is my one true love   no + no   is there a point here? or just a statement about years past, instead of the one coming up   is this a real thing? "working on his handles and jumper... just like literally every other basketball player in the world. let's see how it plays out"   I'm just gonna put on MOTM2 and pretend like it's 2011 again. I miss you, old cudi   yeah, just spark up a blunt and turn that on. if you didn't like it before, guarantee your opinion will change after that   nah. he said its on MOTM3   we would have like 6 bigs and 3 guards that are actually playable. I think a pg is a much higher priority    this is my fav weezy album of all time. already. sheesh   /r/hiphopheads please come back :'(   oh... whoops    Exactly. They said they're working on other deals now. I'm assuming that means they're more pressing issues and TT isn't a flight risk. Same with JR, essentially done deals but don't need to be worried about at the moment. No worries, fellas.    Their*. Silly scientists, learn how to spell    I just wanna know what Pop said about himself also leaving when Timmy does... isn't that what he's been saying he's gonna do all along? "yeah Lamarcus, you'll take over for Timmy when he leaves.. but you'll also be given a new coach with a potentially new system, an old and broken Tony Parker, and a bunch of old foreign guys who don't have a lot of time left. sound good?"   agreed. only place I maybe see him going is home, but him and Brodie Westbrook don't wanna break up yet so idk   Nothing will happen until you get the human cancer that is Dion Waiters off the squad.    http://imgur.com/5qicM0z   I just want Lebron and Pepsi to hook up so he can join uncle drew and Wes on the court.    Yeah, I met him at a camp there a couple years ago. Really cool dude. Hope he gets a shot   He's from Dallas. My high school coach played with him in high school. Always said he was the smartest guy on the team. Which is high praise coming from that arrogant son of a bitch   100%. I respect your animosity. http://imgur.com/2VXTqPd   I think I speak for everyone when I say, good.    Dude. just stop. it's not going to happen. you're not going to make "steelers" happen in a Cleveland sub. you have a better chance of curing cancer   Cavs sub, therefore, respect must be maintained at all times. Our NFL loyalties might be different, but our Cavs fandom binds us. One goal, All In.    oh hell yeah! it's been buggin me for a while now   I personally don't think he did it. The chick basically said so later. Was for money. but anyway, bruh needs to chill   Yo, chill.    Steeler by birth, Cav by heart. Please, accept me and all my flaws       agreed! I'd love for him and Logic to go back and forth on a track   Yeah, fuck having to put a chick on every damn song. just lay down some bars on a beat and be done with it. it doesn't have to appeal to the radio listener all the time.    Impossible. Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Derrick Rose still play in this league   but you don't know how many games he has left. no one does. his career could end tomorrow. you have to make as much money as you can while you can in professional sports because one day you'll be done. and you won't be in your 60s like everyone else when you retire. you have to make money and make it last.   I will never fault anyone for actively trying to make more money. that's how the world works.    he wasn't on the winning team this year..? I don't see your point    That's not the nature of the business though. You never know when your career could be over and you won't have the ability to earn money from that job ever again. And especially when other teams/employers are willing to pay you more for your services. It's about maximizing your ability to earn for your family   that's not on the line. that was on the line a month ago when actual games were being played. this is the off season, where you negotiate with potential employers about the monetary worth of the skills you provide. after this part is out of the way is when the stuff that makes you remembered starts.    that's idiotic   I disagree. I think it's always the right decision whether you get more or not. you maintain the leverage by opting out   this is just dumb   but he isn't running away. just because he feels he can earn more money by opting out doesn't mean he doesn't also want to experience those emotions   Is it time for a Tea Party pt. 2?   Oh god... that Lebron money O.O   more money. I don't understand why everyone is freaking out. if you had an opportunity to negotiate your way into and extra 4 million dollars, you would too. it's not a difficult concept to grasp   It'll change when they get rid of Jeanie    it's not about cockiness...? it's about maximizing your earning power for as much as possible. it's a good business decision    nah I was generalizing   Dr. Braun in Lindale Texas.    and you too, sir    can you even comprehend how much money chemotherapy makes a year for the U.S.? it's absolutely insane. why would our government give up that cash cow? especially with the absurd debt we're currently in.   this is no conspiracy theory. this is reality.    the Hippocratic oath isn't a thing anymore. they did away with that years ago. and while I tend to agree that human beings in their nature are kindhearted, that doesn't take away from the fact that this happens a lot more than people realize. the doctor might not deem it important enough to tell you about at that time so you just leave thinking you're fine. when in reality, he sees the beginning of something forming and "just doesn't want to scare you" even though it is treatable at that time. but they wait until they absolutely have no choice but to try to help. making the most money they can in doing so.   I just don't trust anyone    just like with any company or workplace, not everyone is in it for the money. there are obviously people who actually care. but as a whole, the medical industry is about money.    not even a little bit   you need to ask more questions   Nobody knows. No one asks. Once their told "you're fine" people go on their merry way.  I know a doctor who used to study under a cancer specialist in California. she said that this guy unlocked the cure for cancer in the pancreas of a pig. had years of studies and proof that it worked, and once the guy tried to publish a work or whatever it's called on it, guy gets taken out and his place gets ransacked. coincidence? curing disease and helping people doesn't make money and the government knows it. all I'm saying is, if it is government mandated that everyone get vaccinated, in today's corrupt governmental system, I want no part of it. and, the medical industry is just as corrupt as the government under which it serves.   I just don't trust anybody, man   it's not about protecting your kids for them. it's only about money. if you went and got an MRI today, more than likely they'd tell you everything's fine. when in reality, you could have a treatable problem forming inside that won't manifest for 6+ months. why don't they tell you? because treating/curing it doesn't make as much money as waiting until it manifests and then trying to control it.   it's all about money. always has been, always will be.    false. you know anyone with a Mercury allergy? that little bit can give them health issues that you couldn't imagine.    except it is   What may be worse than that is actually trusting doctors who make more money when you get vaccinated. Only reason doctors want it is for the pay day   KD day dreams about em at the free throw line so you know they gotta be the shizz   WILL I STILL TALK NOISE ALL DAY TO REFS AND NEVER GET A TECH? YEEAAUHP   later in the video it brushes its teeth.    her snapchat stories are both insanely hot and insanely annoying. too much promotion of products, not enough titties   yeah I know! I just never talk to players during the season and then when it's contract time, I use all my "hometown discount" and "win a ring" pitches I have saved up to get em haha   By responding, you too are an angry little person who feels the need to have the last word. Also, deflate the size of your ego a little bit and maybe realize that your OPINION isn't fact.   Stay... whatever it is you are.    MyGM! Can't change those contracts in that one haha   100%. he's my preseason favorite for ROY   I didn't offer him the max in 2k. He didn't pick me. So I'd say yes   Spell check got me there. But you used "there" when you should have used "their", forgot the "e" in "use", didn't punctuate that whole sentence properly either, you used "then" when you should have used "than", and you said "as" instead of "has".  So you don't get to call me an idiot either, jackass.   And as for all the BS proclamations you declared fact, you're wrong. It's actually not true that he juiced in high school. That's a myth. He didn't lose a lot of weight because of steroid use or whatever the fuck you're trying to say (you need help on sentence structure because you make no sense sometimes), he lost weight because of all the things in his DIET he cut out. He was trying to be quicker and lighter on his feet, as he has said many times, and at the beginning of the season didn't feel like himself, as he has said many times, so he switched back to his old meal plan and workout routine to start gaining weight back. Thus, all the back and knee problems coming out of nowhere because he was doing what he usually does in the summer, during the season. Therefore, he took a 2 week break to heal from his injuries and came back fresh.   Ignorant people who assume the only way an athlete can be good at something is by using steroids or performance enhancers just really suck. It's possible, believe it or not, that you can realize your full potential by eating right, taking care of your body, and working hard. I know, foreign thought right?   It's insane how idiots some of you guys are. Having a personal chef who only feeds you the healthiest of meals 6 times a day year round goes a long way, guys. Not necessary to assume steroids are involved.    I find it adorable that you think a guy is on PED'a just because he's better than everyone else. Can't just be great on his own?         I just want an NBA version of Hard Knocks. That would be the shit   U-Kendrick   Mudiay will handle the professional transition better because he played a year in China, he's a faster player in general with a more NBA ready body... I think it's a fair proclamation.    exactly. that's what makes the song so great. feels like a criticism of white culture and their behavior and mentality towards the black community until you get to those last couple lines and realize, oh shit, he callin out everybody.   sorry to interrupt. just really like that song lolol   gimme gimme gimme. been itchin to play Mario Sunshine for a minute    Also, number 25 in college.    sshhhhhh   WHERE ARE ALL THE TRADES??? IM DISAPPOINTED.    I just wish Nolan woulda grabbed him to be the Riddler in one of the Dark Knight films. Woulda been a little strange, I know, but in that setting he coulda been just as dark as Heath Ledgers joker was. woulda been cool   Oh Minka my lawd   What if I told you, Annakin Skywalker and Lebron James had the same story arc? Chosen One, leaves for the dark side, returns to do what was always his destiny.    we actually do. he said as much a few weeks ago   Nah man. Lebron showed his dick to America a week ago. nothing can top that   I love Andy as much as the next guy, but my god that contract is brutal. I know it's off topic, but damn if that was lower it would help a lot.    how much is it and where can I get it   No. He'll never take less than the max ever again.    MyGM on 2k. got that bomb ass Cavs dynasty goin and it's helping pretty well   album art es muy bueno   His son brought a championship to Cleveland before he did... salty   You're right, not the same situation. I just think the risk is there with him. I sure hope he comes back to full strength. Games not the same without him  	102
          Just imagine if all NFL and NBA players quit and took up MMA... the talent would be INSANE                  I can't wait for Bader to become champ and then have Vinny Maghales show up at his press conference and challenge him to a rematch                        When asked how long he's had a crush on Maeby, George Michael says "for about 53 weeks"... the joke being that the first three season run encompassed 53 episodes      That's what passes for humor these days? blech                           20 bucks on top of the PPV? $50?      And that's why you always leave a note   My vote is for wolf tickets                     lol, he's so tough until the smaller security guard steps up to him   I once met a hardcore BJ Penn fan at a bar when he was fighting Hughes pt. 2... such an ass!   fair enough.. but so many athletes go for "lets get richer!" investments rather than maybe putting into safe dividend paying stocks, no?   With 24 million, why even invest.. collect interest with no risk, right?            Eh, anyone else thing Letterman has long been overrated? Was he ever funny?   Season 4 has more gold than people think :)                           Ah yes, an escape!                     If there's not another side to the story, this is pretty pathetic..                      Per the Reebok deal, fighters get $$ anytime apparel with their name or face on it gets sold... are people really buying Dillishaw shirts? Aside from Anderson Silva or GSP, do fighter-themed clothes sell in a significant way?                  What happened in those 4 months to make the next 5.5 years work so well?                                                            had no idea he wrestled with DC   Oh man, sad news      I think it's safe to say Fitch will never fight in the UFC again..                                                                  We just need "Better than Ezra" to round out the lineup   Gob?                     Silva was borderline disrespectful.. somehow I missed the fact that Silva kissed Weidman a kiss on the cheek after the end of Round 1                  Yeah, not sure how to top this gem!

  But you must keep repeating them because the truth that this is wrong gnaws at you.  Hit the nail right on the head.      Father issues!            At times I felt Fisk "wanted it more," making him a great villain.  I know what you mean, misguided dude who believes that his methods are right, but sometimes when he talked about it, I felt it was all a facade. Or maybe it's the bias that he's a villain.             Love the idea of that suspend tab extension. Installed, and hoping it will work.      That's awesome! Where are you putting it?   He's young. He'll grow into it.   But don't we sweat out the water when we drink beer? Right back into the atmosphere...      "A bit" is an understatement even.                     I just hope the goldfish will live a really long life after this.      I wonder if they still require an adult to accompany a kid.   This.      Whatever it is, I wouldn't touch it!       Most the true NBA fans I know revere the Spurs.  Same here. The Spurs may not be their favorite team, but they respect us. And about the "boring" part the OP mentioned, we've always been low key compared to the other superstars. But that's how we do things.      That fixed it. Thank you!!!      I don't know if it's just me, but "favorite natural disaster" just sounds wrong!         I've been playing the game on the iPad for eons, and while it crashes occasionally, a restart does the trick.   This morning, when I woke up and started the game, it would just crash after the Lex Luthor quote. Over and over again.  I even uninstalled it, but same thing. I restored a backup of the iPad, hoping the issue would be fixed, but to no avail.  Anyone has the same issue and/or a fix?         Fair play, though this post put together some highlights for those who don't want to go through the whole thing.   Hard to say at this point. They have been creating new story arcs for some of the characters, and while some don't like it, I think it keeps the show interesting. Also makes one want to re-read the books, if only there were enough time.            Okay that's amazing. THANK YOU!               Darn it. I totally missed the game due to time zone difference!!! Thank goodness for this thread. Thumbs up guys...esp. the Duncan GIF.         King Koopa, yes!         He needs time to heal. Especially if we make it through this round.       Sleep well!   We've got this, guys. Till next time!  Edit: Timmy IS the man.   OMG! We can do this! Edit: I'll take old Timmy any day.   Go, go, go!!!   NOOOOOO, Timmy. NOOOO!   "Tony not returning for final 3 minutes..." He shouldn't have been there much earlier.   F#ck F#ck F#ck   Ulcers, asthma attack - name it   Can watch that over and over again!   "It's off the foot. It's off the foot...of a player." D'oh!   Thanks, it's back up. Had to reset the box. Phew!   And my cable just died!!!   Fina-fucking-ly.   SERIOUSLY!? I can't believe how they're missing all those shots.   AND 3s!   He should be taken out now!   Let's not get complacent now!  	75
    I initially read this is in a Donald Trump accent.   *Rich Chinese Leaving Chiiina*      If they were non-chalant like Clinton-era policies, Iran's nuclear program would not only have progressed but they would already have the bomb.  	4
    I say just cover the game as a whole like what makes this particular smash different overall, make brief comparisons to other smash games it shares similarities to and maybe even game feel/speed/etc? I feel like you could do that for all iterations of smash games and give the newcomers who don't doesn't know the difference between each iteration a brief overview of what the composition of that particular smash game is. Not sure if I made sense there but hopefully you got the gist of it haha   I haven't done too much research but I feel like it is. I'm still interested in getting it since it looks impressive. Either that or transistor.  EDIT: guess there's way more to be excited about than I thought   binding of isaac for $1, the hd remake is coming out soon for about $15 preorder but if you're on a budget I strongly recommend. I believe if you preorder the remake while having a copy of the original you get 33% off the game so if you plan to buy both I guess you save like 4 dollars on the remake.   9 volt playable character   Just PMed you asking about details but I guess you're planning a small meet up. Just let me know time   I'm in c9 but I'm down as well. Just pm me   I'm not exactly sure if that title helps with identifying the model but I've tried opening up this laptop and I'm too scared to go any further.  Tried finding similar model tutorials online but nothing really comes close. Some help would be appreciated!  	8
 Yep, that's all I see here in the USA.  It's either an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy S[#]   Give me Google everything.  If they can give me 10gbps fiber internet to the home.  Google has my business.  If they can give me cheaper phone service, better coverage, or a combination thereof, then Google has my business.  I'd much rather Google have my information, because I know what they're doing with it....marketing.  Selling ads.  But they don't sell your _information_.  Do you know what Verizon, AT T, etc are doing with your information?  They're selling it directly.  Not just access to an anonymized database like Google, but actually giving your information out to people for a quick buck.  I trust Google with my information far more than I trust the big telecoms.  I know that what makes them money is selling access to services, not actually selling the data outright.   Sprint: Unlimited data - but good fucking luck getting more than 2gb out of it in a month, even if you're trying.   Holy crap, could you have uploaded it to a _worse_ site?  Requires registration to download.  When you download, it generates a download link that it then _emails you_.  What...the...fuck?   Not that I can find for VG.  But while cigarettes use less, it's kind of asinine to say that we have no idea about the safety of PG when inhaled.  We do have an idea about its safety, and it breaks down in our bodies very quickly.  It doesn't crystallize or form harmful chemicals.  So it's perfectly safe as a nicotine delivery system.  Now, if the argument was about the flavorings - I could see that possibly being an issue.  Diacetyl was found to be a problem and everyone promptly stopped using it.   http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/drogen/00041/00618/13196/13199/index.html?lang=en  Propylene glycol is reportedly used as a humectant' in cigarettes i.e. a substance that traps water to keep the tobacco moist, thus preventing the cigarette from drying out.  Propylene glycol is applied to either the filter or the tobacco and makes up to 2.4% of the total weight of the tobacco used in one cigarette (for cigarettes produced and sold in the EU). In the Netherlands, the average amount added is reported to be 1.3% of the total weight of tobacco in a cigarette, with a maximum of 5.0%.  Already used in Cigarettes as well.  So it's either PG+Tons of other chemicals...or PG.  So please, just stop.   These are chemicals which are injected into our bloodstreams on a daily basis for the delivery of medication.  http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1120 tid=240   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified propylene glycol as "generally recognized as safe," which means that it is acceptable for use in flavorings, drugs, and cosmetics, and as a direct food additive. According to the World Health Organization, the acceptable dietary intake of propylene glycol is 25 mg of propylene glycol for every kilogram (kg) of body weight.  Stop being gullible to scare-statements by the cigarette industry.   Nothing is failing.  There is a ratcheting piece of plastic inside of the head which provides tension around a splined head.  It's meant to slide and ratchet at 3 in-lb.  It's working correctly, it's down to about 3in-lbs after working it in a little more.  PLA is way stronger than that.  Something this shape with full infill would easily be able to do 15in-lb   It was only .7in-lb off.  Most people I've seen here can't even get theirs working off of the build plate.  I'd say that's a success.  It's a working torque wrench.  The plastic holds up.   Here's the users page: http://www.reddit.com/user/gwertz  He deleted the comment, but you can still downvote it from the user page...(unless reddit is still doing that thing where downvotes don't count unless they're from the comment page of the link...or whatever)   It's a torque wrench rated for 3lb-in - which isn't a lot of force.  It works.  Printed one on a DeltaMaker as well, very similar settings and tested against my own torque wrench.  Mine came out to 3.7lb-in when I tested it, but I'm sure that would change the more I used it.   Derp-tits?[](/advicederp)   Offensive driving is more fun.   That's not true though.  My car has unfixed issues from previous accidents.  Know the previous accident?  My brother in law backing out of his driveway into my car and destroying the trunk.  File a insurance claim?  "NO WAY" my wife says.  It'll cause bad blood!  So I got a new one from the junk yard, got it primed, but not painted yet.  I'm 30, have never been in an accident or caused an accident.  Plenty of speeding tickets though.  The people to watch out for are: People with jesus-fish stickers, PT Cruisers, Minivans and rental cars.   Saved my ass so many times.  Wife yells at me "why in the fuck are you pulling off of the road, we're at a stop light!" - SCREEEEEEEEEE \*WHAM\* to the next car in line.  The look on her face...   They actually teach you in some of the advanced driving schools that hitting the brake hard, and then swerving left/right is a bad idea.  You get the most braking power staying straight.  If you're going to get left/right, don't do it while your antilock brakes are kicked on.   You kidding me?  Chicks LOVE scars like this!   Get this 24fps bullshit out of here...    I hate birds worse. Do you know what it feels like to have to drive 15 mph 10 miles, down a perfectly smooth beach road when there is no traffic? Well I know. Why? Because fucking birds.  That's weird.  On most beach roads here, the speed limit is 15mph anyways.  Because of tourists, not birds.   You'll hate them again when you realize those birds eat a shit-ton of mosquitos and other harmful insects.   linkme: Fleksy   I work mostly in technical fields, and regularly have a vocabulary that's way beyond swiftkey.  This is my biggest gripe as well.   Why would you need Adobe Reader _OR_ Evince?  Google Chrome has a built in PDF reader that is sandboxed.  Hell, he's even using it in his screenshot.   It killed facebook for me.  It's like twitter, but without the stupid fucking 140 character limit.  Follow people that do cool shit, and leave your family/friends/other retards off of it.   Oh it gets even better!  The more traffic is in the toll lane, the higher the toll gets!  Up to $12 I've been told.  So this is basically a lane for the rich, who don't want to have to mingle with pleb traffic.    Makerbot is the apple of 3d printing.  LOL no.  MakerBot _wants_ to be the Apple of printing.  Except they put out garbage and put an even more absurd price tag on it.  Please don't repeat that phrase.  It makes people think that MakerBot is somehow a quality product.  It's not.   I use Waze, and not even Waze was able to route me around the clusterfuck that is Florida traffic tonight.   Also KISSlicer!     unless you have a way to store a massive amount of energy (doesn't exist atm)  Does exist at the moment.  Tesla has massive 400kWh storage stations for exactly that thing.  You may think their big game is their cars: It's not.  It's their batteries.  http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Tesla-CTO-on-Energy-Storage-We-Should-All-Be-Thinking-Bigger (near bottom of page)  Which basically negates your argument about storage.  It's already here.  It's already happening.  And guess what...you can put it anywhere also!  Additionally, Nuclear _continues_ to cost.  You still have to feed it.  That's not renewable.  You're just trading one non-renewable for an equally non-renewable but more abundant supply of material.   Yes, lets immediately jump to how I must be some sort of corporate oil shill!  I guess you haven't read any of my comment history.  How about I start with this little blurb:   Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Hydro, Tidal, etc are all very easily potential sources of energy that could today produce reliable, clean energy were enough investment thrown into it. Additionally, just like the "cash for clunkers" program that was run, we could easily incentivize better power usage by giving people money in order to destroy power-hungry appliances, upgrade houses efficiency ratings, etc. Already, the power usage is tipping in favor of solar so much that electric companies are raising their rates. The more they raise their rates, the more people go solar. The more people go solar, the more they raise their rates. It's a vicious cycle that will eventually end up with renewables winning. Without the need for some monopolistic power company to dictate pricing, waste millions of tax dollars, etc.  Go ahead, tell me how much of an oil shill I am.  You know what that's a sign of?  It's a sign of someone who doesn't have a fucking argument to stand on and resorts to inane bullshit statements like your own.    skunk tail   smelled like hell  Isn't that the point of being a skunk?   Tell me, has there ever been a point in history...ever...that anything, at all...was 100% fail safe?  You're incredibly naive.     Nuclear is the only current way for reliable clean energy.  You know, it's definitive statements like this that always make me immediately call "bullshit".  Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Hydro, Tidal, etc are all very easily potential sources of energy that could _today_ produce reliable, clean energy were enough investment thrown into it.  Additionally, just like the "cash for clunkers" program that was run, we could easily incentivize better power usage by giving people money in order to destroy power-hungry appliances, upgrade houses efficiency ratings, etc.  Already, the power usage is tipping in favor of solar so much that electric companies are raising their rates.  The more they raise their rates, the more people go solar.  The more people go solar, the more they raise their rates.  It's a vicious cycle that will eventually end up with renewables winning.  Without the need for some monopolistic power company to dictate pricing, waste millions of tax dollars, etc.  And this is happening regardless of Nuclear generation coming online.  Fuck Nuclear.  We don't need it.  Too much potential for abuse/misuse/problems.   Yes, lets load tons of nuclear waste high above our atmosphere.  NOTHING could go wrong with that!   I don't think it's _JUST_ that.  It's also the fact that we're tired of large scale government projects, we're tired of mismanagement, we're tired of all the lawsuits that protect entrenched, existing businesses.  Is our government going to keep this nuclear reactor safe for 100 years, or are they going to do like everything else and just slowly let it degrade until a tragic accident happens and we make a large section of land permanently unusable?   *Nice*   Depends.  Is it super thin?  If yes, then probably not.  If it's not super thin, then probably yes.   printedsolid.com will investment cast your PLA prints! :D  $65 minimum, but it's better than shapeways!   No no no, he was using an all-metal hot end, and just wanted to extrude _REALLY REALLY FAST!_   Then change it!   I don't jump lanes frequently, when traffic is dense you can kind of do an in-head math on which types of cars are in which lanes and determine which lane will get you ahead quickest.  You can't speed in those situations anyways.  I do purposely lane switch in front of people who leave 2 car lengths in front of themselves at stop lights.  Usually the person is busy with their fucking phone so they stop way before they need to.  I don't touch mine while driving.  I have enough spatial awareness to know what cars are going to do based on lane drift, out of state tags (I drive by theme parks on my way to work), type of car (trucks will typically be heading out on certain lanes during construction days), etc.  I try not to cut close to others, because when there are "friends" with me, if I cut too close and jump over a lane I tend to do it quickly.  It can leave them with too little time to react to a slowing/stopped car.  I use turn signals _always_ even when switching lanes.  I go fast, but I do my best not to endanger others.  No accidents in my lifetime \*knock on wood\*.  I'm 31.  Also Waze.  Waze helps me avoid cops.  Fucking amazing app if you're in the city.  Usually have the phone mounted in my cluster over the RPM gauge with Waze running.   I guess I'm a rare third type.  I make my own hours, so I've got all the time in the world, but I drive 15mph over everywhere.  The best single word to describe my driving style is: "Slalom"   This is what driving for me feels like in the mornings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tr-J8t3ylM  I just drive that way because I enjoy it. :D   And yes, the guy died.    haeckel  That thing is just a Prusa i2 in a box.   I wouldn't.   And I fully understand that, but people tend to need an outlet for this stuff, and the soldiers are an easy target.    The soldiers weren't in charge.  But those people joined the service to be the governments force.  If the government ordered the military to kill babies, and they did, you wouldn't be making this argument right now.  You'd be pissed off at them for following orders.  Likewise, we can be pissed off at soldiers for participating in wars that were perpetuated by lies.   Even responsible gun owners live in a heightened state of aggression while they have their guns on them.  http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/study-carrying-a-gun-can-make-you-more-paranoid/    there are plenty of people who will never be felons who should not be around guns  Like certain vice presidents...   Overhead X/Y gantry.  Moving beds are a huge load of weight to be shifting around.  It's basically a T-slot version of an Ultimaker.    How a decade ago, many of our tv shows came off TPB.  Uh, I still torrent most of my TV shows.  showrss.info is a great aggregator of torrent sites, and you just plug in the rss feed to your torrent client and let Plex sort it all for you.  It'll even tell you that you have new shows to watch.  With no commercials.  That's fucking _convenient_.  If TV were like this, and I could pay for it, I would.   Because the additional water helps make sure that the smell doesn't penetrate into the air.  Smell an American bathroom after it's been used, and then go smell a German bathroom (where they have a poop inspection shelf and the feces sits in the air before flushed) after it's been used and you'll notice a huge difference.   Honestly, if you're already to the point of an enclosure, you should probably just build a proper machine into it.  You're basically already 1/2 way to a eustathios...   I'm just saying that the way you're trying to argue what you're saying leaves open the possibility of interpretation of something else happening rather than what you are trying to say.  You're not being concise.  The point could easily be argued in your grandparent comment that it isn't because of RAM that you were able to load that, but because of harddrive-backed cache.  I merely went further with it to ensure cover where harddrive backed cache comes in, and where it doesn't.  Because you were replying to someone who had counter-argued that it was stored on the hard drive.  You can't just say "It is because I SAY it is!", you have to say "It is, because of this, and this is how it works, and this is why it works.  Additionally this is the case in which what you are describing works/acts/operates."  It's not I'm Right/You're Wrong here.  It's about trying to clarify.   Your argument isn't very concise.  It could do this as well if it were on the hard drive as well, albeit a little slower.  Basically, before Windows 7-ish era, the thought was to use as little ram as possible.  It was dumb, because unused ram was basically wasted.  Linux has always cached things in RAM, and this is the proper way to do things.  If you need the space, it's always easier to clear the ram and just write over it.  So nowadays, browsers really only write to disk as a long-term backup cache - for loading webpages rather quickly on browser startup.  While the browser is open though, it stores as many of those objects in ram as possible.  For example if you visit reddit.com often, and they use some js library - as soon as you load up chrome, it's likely preloading (into RAM!) that JS library from the hard drive.  Part of the huge memory usage of Chrome is also its javascript engine, however.   If it's being displayed on the page, or ready to be displayed on the page _VERY_ quickly, it's in RAM.  The hard drive is long term, _SLOW_ storage.  Browsing the internet would be horrible if browsers by simply storing everything on disk.  (In fact, they USED to work like this...back when everything was terrible)  Yes, they cache stuff on disk still, but as long as the browser is open it will try to keep a lot in memory to avoid hitting that cache again.  So things like javascript libraries, etc are all stored in RAM.   Depends.  We talking about a thumb?   It's almost 100% likely to be a loose wire on the motor.   .4mm layers, and .5mm layers with huge nozzles also look amazing.   This is really something that needs to be done in a multifaceted weighting system.  Like     1. How important is open source to you? 1-5     2. How big of a build volume do you need? 50x50, 100x100, 200x200, 400x400     3. How much money to you have to spend? 300-500, 501-800, 801-1200, 1201-1600, 1600+     4. How important is it to extrude multiple materials? 1-5  etc.  And then give a printer based on whichever is closest score to the user preferences.   It's a precrime.  Much like the reason why Marijuana was made illegal.  Because people on Marijuana would rape all of your women!  We really need to stop making things actual crimes based on things that MIGHT happen.  Want to do crack cocaine?  Fucking fine.  Want to rob a liquor store while on crack cocaine?  You should get arrested for robbing a store...not for being on crack.  We've got to the point where, if some action _could_ result in a crime...we make said action a crime.  What about all the times said action _didn't_ result in a crime?!   Don't worry about all the downvotes.  The people in /r/Orlando are a bunch of retiree prudes from pennsylvania.  That's why we have such bad drivers, because they all think that going 10mph under the speed limit is safer than doing the speed limit.   There is no way in hell that a 3D printer compares with a dot matrix printer.  Not even close.  Dot Matrix probably comes in around 65dB, a 3D printer likely comes in around 35-40dB or so.  A busy office with lots of talking is about 30dB.  The best noise level I can compare it to is probably about the noise level of a laptop that just kicked its fans into high speed.  Also, the noise level of machines are about to get a LOT quieter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJmg0iRHX8s -- Like, next to your bed while sleeping quiet.   If you're printing with PLA, there are no fumes.  If you're printing with ABS, or Polycarb (not likely on this one) then you've gotta be aware of them, but the printrbot simple metal is quite possibly the best first printer anyone could have.   As we get smarter, logic is a higher order function.  Fighting, is a basic instinct.  There will never be enough higher order layered on top of basic instinct to stop this pure and simple fact.  Humans are animals....just like other animals.  The problem here is thinking that somehow humans are different in any way.  We're not.  We've evolved to use tools, etc but basic instinct is BASIC.  It forms the roots of everything layered on top of it.   Sorry, but we haven't had enough time with our civilized brains to move away from fighting.  I mean...do you live in the same reality that I do AT ALL?  That's practically all that humans do...in one way or another, as a whole, we fight anything and everything.  Violence is always the answer to humanities problems it seems.  Do you deny this?   Yes, let's ignore 500,000 years of evolution because we're "civilized" now.    Women shouldn't get a free pass  /r/pussypass   I call bullshit.  Linux users don't go to bestbuy for _anything_.   I'm at work right now, so _HUGE_ thank you spinwizard for covering nearly the exact response I would have made, but in much more detail.  You are the best!  GP doesn't seem to understand that there are servo control systems out there that accept the same step/direction pulses as steppers, and are thus very easy to synchronize in the exact same way that steppers are synchronized.   Did you miss the word "also" in there?  Sorry, I didn't link the building codes - it's your country, find them yourself.  And when you do studs 18" on center, but call it 457.2mm - you're still using inches because that arbitrary metric number is still based on the imperial standard that you're still using.  If all of your lumber were 3cm by 6cm, and you laid out your buildings with nice round metric numbers, I might believe you.  But you don't.   It's not about speed, it's about position in line.  Speed is often used as a method to get that extra position, but it's worth it.  Especially once you sync with all the yellow lights and leave the traffic behind you at red lights never to be seen again.  Advanced drivers just use a better combination of factors including car types, which lanes are fastest, are adjacent to popular turn lanes, in addition to speed.  That guy is waiting at the stop with you, sure - but when it turns green, he doesn't have to wait for 10 other people who are likely all paying more attention to facebook on their smartphones than traffic.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgf_LwvZywI  Speed is determined completely by driving strength of the system.  You can run things like 400w motors up to 1000w intermittently in order to gain stability in a fast running system.  Most of this requires a lot of heavy mathematics but there's no reason it can't be done on systems like the ones we're using.  Servos have a great benefit in that they know their position at all times.  Regardless of skips, etc they can _always_ manage to return to position.  So no skipped prints, no shifting layers, etc.  They also operate much quieter than stepper motors.    I mean the things are used for a damn good reason after all.  You keep using this phrase.  What _ARE_ the reasons you supposedly believe that steppers are being used instead of servos, exactly?  Saying they're used "for a damn good reason" but never actually stating those reasons is a cop-out.    you will get fuckall precision/accuracy even with well tuned parameters  Yeah - that's just not true.  https://plus.google.com/104392700641405092118/posts/57wZjvrqQjk  The printer posted on this G+ page is the printer of a friend of mine.  It printed excellently using a servo motor for the Y axis, without ringing (once he finally got it tuned), etc.  It used a 1kw servo, with 1000 lor optical encoder tied to a dedicated servo driver called the Gecko Drive.  Granted, it used a much more expensive Gecko servo driver controller that simply accepted step/direction input, but it was slinging around a MASSIVE Y axis.  Servos can be used too - it's just a matter of getting the parameters down in order to use them at the accuracy and speeds we need.  The major issue is that we need way more than ~200 encoder steps in order to get good results from Servos.  An SPI magnetic rotary encoder would be far better, or something with at least 1000 lines of resolution per rotation.  Beyond that, it wouldn't be too difficult to design and engineer a system capable of doing this kind of thing for far less than it ended up costing Chris at close to $200 for a single servo driven axis.  I must also mention that the servo-based printer, while considerably more expensive with the components used could _literally_ not skip.  It knew its place in 3D space at all times, and could not be moved from it without returning to exactly the same spot every time.   OH look at that!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber  Your building codes also specify imperial units for house construction!  Much like most of the "metric" using world - you're not fully converted over either.   The procedure has changed since 13 years ago.  They used to lasik much less of the eyeball area and that's what caused "rings" or weird halos around things.  Now they dilate your eyes, and correct vision all the way out to the far edges.  People who got Lasik a very long time ago, still probably have issues seeing stars at night, or see halos on signs (which can be fixed further if they go back to the doctor).    GT2, 6mm wide, that's correct.  The width matters.   http://i.imgur.com/N0orCMk.gif   PLA burns out cleanly, just like wax does.  So it's a suitable wax substitute.   Learn a programming language.  It's easy.  Get into natural language processing.  Get into AI.  Get into something you're passionate about.  Join communities of other likeminded people who are passionate about the same thing!  Work hard.  Get paid.  I make my own hours, work on robots day in and out, and never feel like I'm actually going to a job.  Break free from that vicious cycle, man.  Once you do it, the world is your oyster.  Meetup.com is a perfect place to find groups that share a technical minded enthusiasm.  Join those groups, and use the social circles to find your first better job.  Then go from there.  It's not that this world is any harder than before, it's that my generation and those after have difficulty socializing in order to gain higher ground.  It's not about what you know, it's about who you know.  If you have both the what AND the who - you go UP pretty fucking quick.   I'm 30 and have a house paid off, about to buy a second.

Warning: Coating ~~will~~ may cause cancer.   Oh piss off.  Where are all the people who are complaining about people not turning their lights on in the rain.  Where are all the people complaining about drivers paying more attention to their fucking cell phone?  Oh no, someone passed you - quit driving like a bitch and get over yourself.  The reason you were cut off is likely because you were hovering next to some guy doing 10mph under the limit.  Stop driving like a pussy, pussy.   Vapor smoothing of ABS parts so they look better.   They're good motors then - Not much more I can think of that could be causing this.   "High torque" tells me nothing about the motors.  What matters is how many ohms the coils are.  They should be motors that are "rated" for 2-4v, with 1-3ohm coils.  Also, drivers should be set according to vref/motor amperage rating.  So for example, if you've got 1.5A capable motors, on a A4988 they would be set to a vref of 1.05 (A4988s can't generally handle this without overheating though) (0.7x vref on an A4988, 0.5x vref on a DRV8825)  Your acceleration at 3000mm/s^2 isn't bad, it's actually somewhat low - so you shouldn't be seeing too many artifacts.  If 2500mm/s^2 lowers the amount of ripples, it's possible you've got some resonance going on though.   Make sure your stepper drivers are set correctly, you could be dropping down to what amounts to a lower microstepping amount due to incorrectly paired motors or too low of a motor current.  Also, lowering your acceleration can occasionally help with this if the effect seems to disappear towards the other edge.  Additionally, make sure your hot end isn't wobbling in whatever affixes it to the carriages.  Hot end wobble can cause this as well.  	99

 Why not, post.   You don't have to trust wikipedia, check the source, which is an optics center that deals exactly with satellite imaging:  "If a multispectral image consists of the three visual primary colour bands (red, green, blue), the three bands may be combined to produce a "true colour" image....In this way, the colours of the resulting colour composite image resemble closely what would be observed by the human eyes. "  http://www.crisp.nus.edu.sg/~research/tutorial/opt_int.htm    It does not mean that the the colors and saturation are how you would "truly" see them with your eye.  You sure? It's how wikipedia defines it:  "This means that the colors of an object in an image appear to a human observer the same way as if this observer were to directly view the object"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_color#True_color    I believe that particular image that referenced (this one [RES ignored duplicate link]) is actually fake.  It's not really "fake", it's just a composite image where they picked the best satellite images and stitched them together. According to NASA, it's even true-color.

These are basically the main characters for most of the book, but yes, I guess they are difficult names. What I mean is that it's a pretty superficial question covered in the first few pages, which was probably all he read to come up with it.   Pretty sure that question is covered about 5 pages into the book, he sure didn't put a lot of effort into this.   These were previously at a zoo in Europe, but they weren't breeding so it was decided to move them back to their natural habitat to see if that would get the breeding going.

Could be I should have doubled down on the OPM bars, won't know until I try to sell.  Keep good records of what you're paying for whatever you're buying.

You're pretty much paying $30 for a wood box, IMO.      I can tell you from experience don't try this in your microwave.  Skip the clean setting on your oven, too.   Just a public notice here, if you're someone who doesn't drive much, checkout [MetroMile](https://www.metromile.com/) for car insurance.  My insurance went from $90/month to around $26. I don't drive much, though.  Been with them for around a year, I guess.  I've not had to go through any claim process with them, but then my record is pretty impeccable (one minor incident in literally 27 years).  Highly recommend them if you're not a big driver.   It's a lot of work to just potentially get to the first step of an interview process.  Of course they're targeting "passionate" developers who don't mind working for free.

Nothing seems to ever go right for him  I don't see how you can say that. What do you know about the guy?  He's had the recent bad APMEX/USPS stolen and now a USPS misdelivering to a PO Box.  He has a lot of videos up so it seems a lot has gone right for him.  I found him via his APMEX story and I'm glad I did. He's bringing to light and reenforcing what we should all be cognizant of when buying/selling non-locally.  I felt for him in regards to the APMEX scenario.  The latest issue I don't feel so bad for him, though, as I outlined his two mistakes (at least IMO) in my OP up top.  I still think hjis experience is worth sharing here. I'm surprised so many seem to be brushing it off as he's just a whiny bitch.  I'm curious how you would handle the situations he's had. You wouldn't reach out to the stacking community in some venue?            It's a 6 minute video.   LOLing at the soundtrack.  Other than that, looking forward to not buying it and ridiculing those who climb aboard that train.   Emotional support animals?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgJC_Aqv3cQ  Mentions he sent two separate packages in a trade deal. Two separate packages because it wouldn't fit in one priority mail package.  This was mistake #1.  Mentions "this was not a cheap trade, I would have been out quite a bit" but he cheaps out and didn't send it registered with proper insurance. This was mistake #2.  No mention of what happened to the 2nd package (at least I didn't seem to catch it).  Seems to have been left with "it's out for delivery" despite it being delivered to the post office (box).  This guy can't catch a break with USPS lately.  **Question for you guys selling over at /r/pmsforsale, how are you shipping?

How come Macchio didn't do the electric classical thing to beat Jack Butler.   Had an account since 2008, I'm on my 3rd employer since then, not one of them looked at it during the hiring process (I asked).  I've had three or four phone screens with other companies during that time, but I never asked them if they looked at my github, I only ask at the end of in-person interviews.  I don't interview in-person a whole lot, though, I'm somewhat selective, meaning I don't go on in-persons just because they've asked me in.  From my (limited) experience, it doesn't matter at all.  I'm not target the startup world, though, so that might make a difference.   Question/Complaint: Whats with all the single-car trains?  Let me answer your question with a question:  Would you prefer no train at all?  Thats basically what it comes down to when your train shows up and theres only one car instead of two. At least *something* showed up.  I can *personally* respect and appreciate their "hey, fuck you" blunt response, but their PR could use a little polishing for the masses.   But then wouldn't every train be a single car during the heat?    Blue lines, morning and eve.   I push to production.   Is this a new thing?

IMO, they're essentially treating some of their inventory as loss leaders, buying feedback if you will, trying to get that power seller status so people keep coming back, new people come in with confidence they won't get hosed.  I would imagine they'll be raising prices in the future.  Not all of their inventory is a deal, as well...They have a kilo Koala for $598, both APMEX and Provident are around $30 cheaper, I think it was when I compared.  I've had a good purchase through them, though their shipping is slow if you're on the west coast.  Didn't get tracking until the 3rd biz day after the buy-it-now.  UPS Ground is 5 days coast-to-coast, so 8 day shipping for me.   You may want to take a look at http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ It provides scripts to detect mobile browsers in several languages.   One thing to note on their about page is:  *Android tablets, iPads, Kindle Fires and PlayBooks are not detected by design. To add support for tablets, add |android|ipad|playbook|silk to the first regex.*  Odd that they don't just add that themselves.   Bay Precious Metals on ebay has the 5oz Horse and Goat for $110.  I picked up a couple of the Horses, will get a couple of the Goats as well, perhaps this weekend depending on if there are other deals out there.

One thing is for sure, when Ohio Bill comes into town, you better skin out before he skins that smoke wagon and you see what happens.   I can't argue with that.      This is a great watch, very interesting and very well presented and explained.  code starts around 24:30.  If you're writing SPAs, it's worth your time.   That seems to be *somewhat* of a standard deal for them, I see them offer that fairly regularly (same with 1oz bars at $20 over).  I wish they'd get current year AGEs or Buffaloes for that. Those seem to go on their "special" less frequently around $35 over.   I'd go for the gold CML.  Or maybe a tractor.    As Brotherjohnf says,  Hard to take anyone who quotes Brotherjohnf seriously.

Everyone with eyeballs thinks they can do your job   It garners no respect from anyone  JavaScript is a joke to most programmers  Completely disagree with these.   It's Java.    ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced classes to JavaScript (ECMAScript is JavaScript if you're not aware). The caveat being ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over the objects and prototypes devs are used to when working with "classes" in JavaScript.  Here's an example of an ES6 class (not a function in sight):      class View {         constructor(options) {             this.model = options.model;             this.template = options.template;         }          render() {             return _.template(this.template, this.model.toObject());         }     }  We're interviewing front-end devs where I work and over the past month we've probably done phone screens with 10 candidates.

My last game purchase was The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I picked up the game of the year edition and holy fuck I played that for MONTHS and MONTHS and MONTHS. Really enjoyed that as well, same reasons as Skyrim.  Also played State of Decay which I thought had a lot of potential to be an amazing game but it was just too short.  I still really enjoyed it, though. Good game.  I have some shoot 'em up games, including zombie-types, but I'm looking for more Skyrim'ish type of games to look for on the Steam Summer Sale.

 I've been long on these guys and I'm taking a beating so take this as a long sad YOLO HJ but I don't see how much longer EXXI can be shorted until we see a rebound. They had unimpressive numbers but with oil on the rise and the stock down to around $3.30 I went ahead and doubled down. I hope to see a big rebound back into the high $4's once we get some positive news. Just my 2 cents, I'm also still taking a loss on AMD, the yolo life is really hard lately but it's only a loss if you sell so time will tell.    Well that sucks....   Should say 'Outside Opinion on my team' and mm.... that's tough. Maybe carry Iwakuma, if you need immediate success (falling behind in standings etc) any 3 of those would work.    Eh 2 active spots.. Iwakuma will be hurt for a while and I agree about Fister being pretty good too. Is a Fiers, Syndergaard, Paxton, type guy available? Whats the best pitchers available right now? Sorry just can't really answer that last one without knowing who's available. I do think Iwakuma is a top 30-50 starter.  EDIT: btw look at my most recent post about my team. I asked for feedback but I guess I posted it in the wrong spot but would love to hear your feedback as well.   1) Screw Werth, especially if you have a deep outfield which you mentioned in comment #2.   2) Rios was ripping the ball before he left. If you can afford the space, why not give him a couple of weeks to see what he can do?   3) Is your DL maxed? Could you just keep Iwakuma on your DL? If he's not hurting anything, I don't think it hurts to leave him on. I think this is the most important player of the three to keep around.       I have Anthony Rendon and Victor Martinez... so....   I have Trout, J. Upton, and Brantley and I still picked him up. I'll use him for my utility spot (currently Joc Pederson) but I'm debating dropping Castillo for Correa and really rolling the dice because my SS is weak. Right now I have it setup to drop my catcher for Correa if I get him on the waiver wire because I was going to drop my catcher anyway and that will give me the rest of the week to make a decision but I'll need a catcher before Monday.    Welp SPHS worked out but EXXI and AMD have still been lame.    That really is an easy one, definitely go with Rusney   Sitting on around 8k of EXXI at -1k ~~earnings~~ so this would be very much appreciated.       That table better have a hole for a fleshlight and send you winning lottery numbers the day before the drawing.   Im in AMD, have been for weeks!!!!! whoo   Sometimes a good purchase is when all the news is bad. I've been looking at SandRidge Energy. In around a months time this stock has dropped about 70%. Things are looking bad with bankruptcy looming but does anyone think this could be a YOLO type stock to jump in for a rebound?    Buying SPHS as my gamble for the week. Also going to load up on EXXI, I just don't believe oil will stay down forever and I think it's a good price point to jump in at.  EDIT: I forgot to mention I'm also sitting on 3k of AMD stock. I don't know if it will do shit but LONG LIVE AMD.    If you look at the history of JCP over the last 6 months to a year it does exactly that. His goals are a little different then ours. He's basically just using the $250,000 and he tries to have no more then 50k at a time invested, to supplement his living income. But he said he was probably bringing in around $30-50k a year just doing that. He's also very aware of JCP and all their earnings reports and the direction the company is going. A couple of times he's told me not to touch it for a couple of weeks because of uncertainty etc.    NIOBF looks like it's living a slow death at this point or atleast a flatline/slow decrease for a while.    He's different then WSB. Basically takes .75 then jumps out or puts a trailing stop on it. Chills on his waterfront property until it starts dipping, buys again. Basically living the life I want to live. Basically living the life I want but I only have 11k so I'm shooting for those crazy risky gains   I have a mentor that has about 250k in his investment accounts and he only trades JCP. He basically starts buying up around 7.5-8 and starts selling around 9.50-11 and basically rinse repeat. He's been doing this for months.    Been in AMD with /r/ddplz for sometime and today was the first day I got within breaking even, feeling like I'll be plus +5 mil very soon.    Well that would explain it. Haven't spoken to him in a couple weeks but would love to see him get more of a shot up there. I have a couple of friends in the bigs that I played with but he's got the best story, really cheering for him.   What programs is he using and how did he learn?    I'm a little bias because I'm good friends with Ian Thomas but can they let this motherfucker throw, he hasn't thrown in 2 weeks it seems like.   I don't know how difficult it is to setup but it definitely doesn't hurt to try. I know I would definitely contribute.    I don't think this is a bad idea but it's sort of like my business as a Realtor. If you're not going to do it 100% of the time, then don't bother implementing it because it just becomes a waste of time. I can see a lot of people not doing this and just getting sort of a scattered view of the direction people are going. Plus I've been lurking for sometime on /r/wallstreetbets and I like the place WSB is right now but you start to walk a dangerous line where the post starts to look like a YAHOO message board with people blurting out absolute insanity and those retards will spill over to the other posts and all of WSB will be affected.    I made money and I am an idiot...    One day my friend... One day.    I feel like Gods playing Plaque Inc. trying to take us out.   Thanks for the comment. I'm actually not trading with all my money but I'm stuck with my 2 other trades. I have around $1600 in AMD and $2700 in EXXI and both are down right now so I'm just dwindling my thumbs with those.   I've traded beyond settlement before and I got a firm warning by Scottrade and by firm, they tried to solicit using margins and to take a moment to read their knowledge center. You know what, F U C K your knowledge center. I want to trade. I turned 6k to 8k and this week I turned 8k to 11k and tomorrow if I can jump into GEVO I think I can turn 11k into 11.1k but let me fucking trade.   How YOLO/Risky is it to say fuck you, and trade regardless of the amount of settled funds I have for "trading" vs. settled funds. Don't wave GEVO pussy in front of a roaring bull.   #YOLO   Edit: May be a little angry that I am forced to the sidelines. In my haste I realized I put RIBT and PBTI. Disregard or go YOLO but I meant RIVT and PTBI. If you get lockjaw from RIBT or PBTI, just know I did not reference these make believe unicorns. #WinterIScoming  	31

 I've been feeling pretty down recently and I've been wanting to watch an anime that reflects my emotions.   I wish I had as close of an relationship with my mom that you have with yours.    Invite me in on your league fun please!!   Yo! If you don't mind we can play Terraria sometime! :D   I can relate to how you felt although my situation is different from yours. I've never been brutally bullied or harrassed before; however, it was the pressure and stress my parents put on me along with loneliness plus several other factors that drove me into a depressed, suicidal state. My "friends" did nothing to help, in fact they just kept excluding me from their activities which only made the situation worse. My parents didn't even seem to know that I was depressed; they just kept saying things like "you have to have over a 4.0 GPA and at least a 2200 SAT score otherwise you're a failure". Aside from that, I wasn't allowed out of the house unless it was for something EXTREMELY important and I couldn't watch T.V (my mom even canceled cable) or see any shows on the internet. I was expected to work and do well in my studies so I could grow up to be a "successful person". I felt like I was being ignored by my friends and locked in a cage by my own parents. Nothing really seemed to excite or make me happy anymore (much like the numbness you felt) and soon after I was thinking about painless ways to commit suicide. I knew my parents would be sad but at that point I really didn't care anymore. The only thing that stopped me from actually committing suicide was how much of a hassle and pain the ass it was to kill yourself.    ey b0ss, gimme da pussi pls   I've always been kind of a recluse throughout the majority of my teenage years. Most of the time I'd just stay at home and play games or just work on homework and stuff by myself. I never really had a chance to hang out with friends. Then, starting in senior year, I decided to join my school's cross country team. Even though it was tough, I enjoyed it a lot and I got to meet amazing people. If I had a chance, I'd go back in time and convince my 6th grade self to do a sport.   Sad Machine by Porter Robinson   Cool story. Post it on literotica, not here.   That one commercial from the movie Inside Out   Nice, commas, bro,   And how would you know that almost everyone who has watched the NBA finals the last few years have watched it to see Lebron lose? My point is that the main purpose of sports will always be entertainment which includes rooting for your favourite team and overall just enjoying the sport and the players. It's not focused on drama.   I was placed in Bronze 5 in League of Legends. I only cried and raged for a week.   Everyone has an opinion, that doesn't necessarily mean thats the primary reason why they watch the sport.   not because they're big fans of the team or the sport, but because they wanted to see Lebron lose  I beg to differ. Majority of the people I know still watch basketball let alone any other sport for the entertainment value, not some shitty drama.    Of course video games and sports are two completely different subjects but the one major common similarity is the fact that people both **play** and **watch** it for the entertainment. That's what we're arguing about.   Calm down. I'm not saying my opinions are more valid than the other people's opinions. I'm just saying why I think anal is disgusting and why, to me, it doesn't sound enjoyable. You don't have to be so butthurt.    Not really. Majority of the people who watch sports watch it for the entertainment and action it provides, they don't watch it for the stupid behind the scene drama.   Ummm... I'm sorry but I don't think you've seen a lot of the drama that goes on in major league gaming. I'm mostly referring to popular games such as League of Legends, Hearthstone, CSGO, or maybe even SC2. Just because on the outside it may seem like some lousy video game and not a real sport,  there's still competition. Where there's competition, there's always drama. I don't think you should belittle video games when you don't even remotely know a lot of things about it.    mud on the stick  LOL   Hi! I'm planning on getting back into Terraria as I haven't played the game for months now. If anyone is interested you can add me on Steam, my name is theguyhiding.   Are you sure it's not 4619 Comment Karma Drive?   Yeah I know you're supposed to use lube and stuff but even then you're shoving a 5-6+ inch meat stick into a tiny closed hole. It's gotta hurt. Also keep in mind the place where you're sticking your meat rod into is also the same place where the person's shit comes out of. You're essentially rubbing your dick in her poop.   Holy shit man that sucks! I think you should try talking to your wife about this issue. At least voice your opinion out to her, she might actually listen. If not, then you should just divorce and find someone else worth your time.   lol yep. That's another great anime series thats pretty high on my list as well   Yeah. I'd imagine it's like taking a huge shit but instead of going out it goes right back continuously rubbing. That's gotta cause at least some anal fissures.   I watch only a few of the currently airing ones, I mostly like to wait until they're done airing so I can binge watch them. Also, I find a lot of the older airing ones are a lot more enjoyable   I don't have a favorite but I have several animes that I really really like. The ones I  remember right now include: Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Welcome to the NHK, Parasyte, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni/Kai, Elfen Lied, FMA Brotherhood, and a few more that I can't recall at the moment.   NNNNYYYYYYYEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS      Anime. Seriously, there is so much to talk about and so many things it can lead into.   Anal. It's disgusting.  For guys, why the fuck would you want to shove your dick in another person's butthole?  For girls, why would you want a dick in the place your shit comes out of?  Edit: I'm not trying to offend anyone that likes anal. I'm simply voicing my own opinions and thoughts. Stop being so butthurt about it please.      I discovered /r/tifu and /r/confusedboners. [This is the post that got me into /r/confusedboners](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConfusedBoners/comments/3bsd3t/autistic_girl_rubs_peanut_butter_on_herself/)     My name is theguyhiding on Steam. I'm getting back into it so I'll be really slow as well.   Yo we have to play Civ 5 together! I'm getting back into the game and I'm looking for people to play with!!!   :(    What's the difference between a bird and a fly?   A fly can bird but a bird can't fly!  HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE   I had sex ed in high school and middle school except sex ed in middle school was basically the really simple male and female anatomy. They also talked about puberty and reproduction but they never mentioned anything about actual sex. It was quickly after I entered high school that I actually became aware of what a condom was and how it looks like. I think it was 10th grade when I recalled this event and I was able to use my new found knowledge to conclude that the box was a box of condoms.   During the summer of 8th grade, I was getting ready to go on vacation. The night before, I was packing my bags and all that was left was my passport. I asked my Mom where my passport was and she said it's in the bottom drawer in the nightstand. I go to her room and I accidentally open the middle drawer which contained a box full of condoms. At the time I had NEVER seen a condom in my life so I thought it was some medication my dad was taking so I took the whole box of condoms to my mom and I asked her what does my dad need this for. My mom immediately grabbed the box and went back to her room to put it away. She then gave me my passport told me to get out of her room. For the next year every time I tried to ask her she would always change the subject. It wasn't until a few years later when I figured out what that box actually was.   I'm waayyy late to the party but I'm 16 and I still sleep with a nightlight on. Being in the dark scares the living shit out of me :(   do you actually get ass pics?   Filthy Frank did a video of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABRNKbSw-30   I'd beg to differ, look at her Bad Blood music video and you'll see for yourself how much of a fighter she is.   A pencil sharpener. At first I thought it was a new video game because of the way my mom wrapped it and the packaging.   Not all Chinese tourists are like that. Please don't judge a group or a whole nationality based on what a small group or family did.      My sister just moved out today and we've been really close together since we were little kids. The problem is I won't be able to visit her because she moved all the way to Florida and I live in New Jersey. To make matters worse, she probably won't be able to come up over Christmas either so it might be over a year or two before I'll be able to see her again. It really sucks having a loved one move away from you. Since she's the only sibling I have, the house now feels so empty without her in it. I just walked into her empty room a few minutes ago and I felt like crying.    How'd you manage to masturbate in history class?      Lots and lots of anime.   I have to kneel before I take a crap.   None of this compares to what the main character did in Onanie Master Kurosawa.   Coming from a stereotypical strict Asian family, the main thing I'll do differently is give my kids more freedom. I spent most of my childhood and teenage years cooped up inside my house studying, practicing my violin, or doing some other kind of boring educational activity. I hardly had the pleasure or joy of spending time and playing with friends. So in a way, I hope I'll be able to give my kids a wonderful childhood I've never experienced.   Studying for Finals and working on my last essay for English. Most high schools and colleges have already ended but mine ends on June 19th which kind of sucks.       Try:  Pet Girl of Sakurasou  The Kawai Complex  Golden Time  Oregairu  They're probably my top Romance Animes excluding Angel Beats, Clannad, and Anohana because those are the mainstream ones.  Edit: Wow. I just double checked you've seen every single one of those as well. We seem to have very similar anime tastes! If you don't mind movies I would suggest Hotarubi no Mori E, Garden of Words, and 5 Centimeters Per Second. Those are really good romance!  	56

 and Grey Worm   *(for the season)*   I don't like this response. You can't make a big deal out of a character's lineage and importance, kill them off, and say something like "But it's a statement on the unpredictability of real life." Especially if you spend several seasons/books building a character up, you cannot leave them almost isolated from the rest of the story and never tie up that loose end. It's not effective storytelling. It's not subverting tropes, because basic functioning storytelling is not a trope, it's a requirement. Every other death serves the story well and meets these requirements. Jon Snow's does not. He's coming back.   For me, it's Season 1's "The Moth". Good on first watch, but oh God is it boring on rewatch, and the symbolism is far too on the nose. Great flashbacks, ***awful*** A-story.   [Bored.](http://i.imgur.com/6GHdmvK.gif)   There's a theory that Show Daario is actually Euron Greyjoy.   "If that's Jo~~h~~n...then who's in there?"   [I really like this interview, where he says that there are things that haven't been revealed yet, that fans have guessed since very early on in the series. He says he doesn't want to change these things, because that would go against his original vision.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQzCPf2NgwE) Because pretty much anything other than R + L = J would be disappointing IMO.   The song is **Hide and Seek** by Imogen Heap. **Watcha Say** is the Jason Derulo song that samples it.   Under the Dome was written and cast badly. It's not really Bender's fault. Stephen King should stop trying to take a part in writing or producing adaptations of his own work.   Don't tell /r/gameofthrones or /r/asoiaf. The **Mads Mikkelsen is free to audition for Euron Greyjoy** Hype Train is at full force, and [this train](http://i.imgur.com/89Ilu0j.jpg) has [no brakes](http://www.tvqc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/euron_greyjoy__by_jazzx89-d5nliyh.png).   OK Computer,     Hail to the Thief,     In Rainbows,     Kid A/Amnesiac,     The Bends,     Pablo Honey,     The King of Limbs - for me.   as well as every finale.   He directed every Desmond episode, minus Jughead. **GET HYPE**   This guy directed 33% of LOST's episodes, and many of the best. Walkabout, Flashes Before Your Eyes, The Constant (highly critically acclaimed), The Man from Tallahassee (which won Terry O'Quinn the Emmy for best supporting actor), Outlaws (one of my favourites) as well as every finale. I love this guy. Can't freaking wait.   In my first free month of Spotify Premium last year, I tried out several artists' music album by album. They were one of the many artists I tried out on the advice of Rolling Stone's Top 100 albums of the 2000s. I saw Kid A at the top and thought, huh I like Creep, so I'll give them a go.  I started from the beginning of Pablo Honey, browsed Reddit for that 40 minutes on my laptop, and really enjoyed it. Went to bed and listened to the first few songs on The Bends and liked them more. Finished The Bends the next day and felt the same. That night, I listened to OK Computer while going for a walk. For me, Exit Music was when I had my first eargasm. That whole last two minutes, with the entry of the distorted bass, the continued soft singing, and at the end of the next line, the slow crescendo and everything...sent chills down my spine. I continued listening, and the next time that happened was when Fitter Happier transitioned into Electioneering, when the drums kicked in. Fuck, I love that album. By that second time, I knew they would be one of my favourite bands.    The Extended Cut balances that out a tad more, adding the Love Is the Drug burlesque sequence very early on. This movie is pretty much a musical without the music. In taking out the one musical number (which, before any action sequences kick in, gives us the only energetic scene in the burlesque reality level) they unbalanced the first act tone setting completely.   Edit: tense correction   Considering the overperformance of The Watchers on the Wall and The Children, do you think it's on HBO's radar to do another IMAX stint for GoT? I see the problem they'd run into in that you couldn't just do the last *two* episodes in IMAX considering this year's episode 4.09 equivalent was episode 5.08 - freaking **Hardhome**. They'd have to do either the last three, or just 5.08 and 5.09 if they think three episodes would be a bad idea in account of length or theater time occupation.     What's your opinion?   Second Son was a clear cut origin story, and a short one too. If they expanded upon it, I'd probably appreciate Second Son more.   How cold and stretchy the vocals are, the baby noises, the mobile-sounding noises, the eerie synth, uneven percussion...stay in my head all day and make me depressed.   Michael Giacchino's score for LOST, though? I've heard insanely complicated breakdowns for his scores, especially in Season 6. Have an opinion on it?   Recently it was both versions of Morning Bell. I used to think it was boring, but **woah**. That guitar and tempo in the Kid A version. And the atmosphere in the Amnesiac version.   FUCK OLLY   Not if Cortez is involved.   The arpeggios in Street Spirit make it feel at least upbeat. It's the baby's mobile noises and creepy ~~strings~~ synth in Kid A that make me want to die.   I skip Kid A simply because it's the most emotionally draining piece of music I've ever heard. Sometimes I replace it with another song, like I Might Be Wrong.   The small extra stretch for Amnesiac includes the separate recording of Life in a Glasshouse, the only song not recorded in those original sessions.   Better than saying her name is Khaleesi, if I'm honest.   *Hello darkness, my old friend...*   Nowhere to perform a Chicago Sunroof though.   The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is not in any way good. Just...ridiculously bloated. Turns a 110 minute film into a 130 minute film, with almost nothing more to show for it.   No, you're right, but ya know...with spoiler tags and stuff. Same exact content, just with more tags. That way, more people can get involved and still avoid spoilers.

[Radiohead - Life in a Glass House](https://youtu.be/upl_rxmsu6s)   They were dead the whole time in the faux alt. universe where "they never crashed". In that universe, the island was underwater and inconsequential. Everything that happened on the island, before they were on the island, after they left, and when they came back, happened in their real lives, before anyone died...which accounts for about 95+% of the show's runtime.   **tl;dr** they were dead for less than 5% of the entire show.   **DON'T READ THE OTHER REPLY TO THIS COMMENT! SPOYLARS! SPOILERS!**   I see this all the time and it irritates me. I'm naturally yellow blonde and I have recognisably dark eyebrows. It's not uncommon.   ...holy crap, I forgot she was married to Tyrion.   Homer Simpson would be my *starting* point. Rust wouldn't even enter the conversation.   Maybe it's partly due to the fact that most people won't immediately register what a dude is saying if it's something like "O full of scorpions is my mind."   And it is of the majority opinion that they've taken it, dare I say, way too far.   [Same!](http://i.imgur.com/lXNw5RH.png)   Out of nowhere, as in, the episode completely avoids reminding you.   Sorry bout that :(   the athiesm          Whaaaaaat? No...   Garrett Hedlund was only *considered*. Robert Pattinson was also on that list.   Not that Agents of SHIELD was groundbreaking, but god those last two episodes of S1 with Fitz and Simmons being dropped to the bottom of the ocean, were heartbreaking. People think Stannis betrayed them? Remember Ward. Attempting to kill two innocent, reserved, often comic relief scientists all because of an alliance with the man who made him.   Fuck, that's like my favourite book of all time and I didn't pick that up!   ...starring Jennifer Garner!   Book 6 is confirmed t early next year. GRRM said that's his goal - before Season 6 airs.

Sure, you're right that often times they don't do anything, but not always.   [Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEsdLNG3u6I).   This, mainly because House House needs to be a thing.   I'm pretty sure they're going with a new Lera Lynn song like in the original S2 tease, possibly that song itself.   Alternate, clickbaity title: **WB Grovels for Potential Game of Thrones Movie**   Season 2 has begun and now they're doing Sex and the City 2.   That was a great read. Thanks for reminding me of one of my favourite shows growing up. I always loved the Stranded episode and the Power Hour Fairy Oddparents crossovers.     I think I'll start borrowing [this reaction image](http://i.imgur.com/PXIuWfT.png) if you don't mind.   If I fell on a certain angle, probs, eh.   Huh. TIL   ...you do know that a hangman's noose is designed to snap your neck on impact, right?   I enjoy all of the books a lot and loved where final scenes for each character left them, but holy shit the pencil thing was a pretty major cop out. And the Stephen King meta plot line was pretty cheesy.     Nonetheless, Drawing of the Three and Wizard and Glass are two of my all time favourite books.   *motif     Sorry; impulse correction.

Maeby fucked Perfecto and is now a registered sex offender like her dad, and she also got a fuckton of investors interested in what *she* believed GM's Fakeblock software was - an anti-piracy software, when in fact it's actually a woodblock simulator. He's now basically a fraudster, Lindsay might be running for congress, and George Sr is now a transgender. In the **post-credits scene**, we find out that Tony Wonder roofied himself and forgot that he slept with Gob, Buster is arrested for the murder of Lucille 2, and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer decide to greenlight the Bluth movie based on seeing Buster on the news.")   All this poster is missing is some good, old fashioned *"head down, eyes up"*.          ...but we should be praising Chris Pine's post-apocalyptic hair product and Margot Robbie's sexy brown hair.   *Who'd like a banger in the mouth?*   Ultron was fucking terrifying...in the first trailer. What we saw/heard of him in those clips tapped into all of my uncanny valley triggers. The movie itself wrecked all of that when Ultron tried to be funny. You can still characterise an AI by showcasing his hubris and lack of regard for human life. You don't need generic sarcastic hubris. That's Loki's thing...and Tony's...and occasionally Thor's...and Widow's...and Steve's sometimes.   Oh, I was aware. I'd heard the name before and the super obscure and perfect reference set me the fuck off!

Great pilot, great entry point to a series, but not one of the best episodes of the series.     I can't stand Shannon and Boone. 11 year old me didn't mind Maggie Grace in a miniskirt, but now...ugh [spoilers](/s "I'm glad she died").   I know that Bateman tweeted [this picture](https://twitter.com/batemanjason/status/257467881661550592), hinting that they were shooting on the same day, but still...the scene felt so off. The tracking shots were awful, and in the only shots of them touching each other, either GOB or Michael's face is obscured, making me think doubles were used. Is it possible somebody else *sent* Bateman the picture? I keep rewatching this scene and trying to convince myself they were acting against each other, but I can't.   Absolutely.   I took years to get through Season 1, and finally rushed through the rest of the series after getting spoiled on 4x02 straight after it came out. I caught up the day 4x04 came out...and I still didn't care that much for the series. I was later prespoiled on how Tyrion's story would end that season by some prick on IGN comments.     However, I did decide to get into the books over the winter (June-July in southern hemisphere). I only read the first book and a half, but holy shit - **all of that context** (plus the map), make it way easier to follow. The photography direction improves dramatically after Season 1, but having the freedom of imagination really helps to improve the mood and sense of scale that was really badly conveyed (initially).     I still don't *love* the show, but I find it far more enjoyable with all of that context.   Odenkirk looks unrecognisable!   I also came here to give that answer. [Here's the same scene in ***exponentially*** **better quality**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgsNjTyGsRk).          My runner-up scene would have to be [the introduction of Christian Shephard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj-Z7UVT-d8).   I watched them both for the first time back to back and in my opinion, it was a painfully mediocre action movie. Casino Royale, though, was great.   Thanks :) That was much better than the album version IMO.   Wait, there's a version of that song that isn't a death march?   There are no gay characters in In Bruges. They were probably thinking of Rock'n'Rolla, where Tom Hardy's gay character does seduce a dude as part of a scheme.   Yes. There are so many classic episodes of television in this series, and such a wealth of characters who you grow to adore. In regards to the *"the pilot was the best episode"* opinion that usually gets thrown out, I think the pilot has aged the worst in comparison to the rest of the series.          I'd say people should watch it, as it's still an absolutely enjoyable show. The characters (excluding probably Shannon and Boone [light spoilers](/s "who thankfully don't last long anyway")) are still some of the most memorable I've seen on TV. If they don't like the ending, then at least they'll at least have an informed opinion. I love the finale *itself*. Remember - it's not the finale itself but what it *wasn't* that more commonly pissed people off.     From what I've heard, people hated the ending of Twin Peaks (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that show is still revered. I hope people can cease to be so vitriolic towards the show's weaknesses and start to praise its strengths again. The show didn't murder your family or "waste" 6 years of your life. It's okay to be disappointed.   Oh...my...fucking...god...     And it's so blatant :)   Wildling!   To be fair, most of the hate for Lost does come from former fanboys who set themselves up for disappointment by analysing the show way too much.     Then again, Lindelof encouraged it, so it's still his fault.   Oh, I agree. The series finale is fucking perfection. The reason some don't like it is because they were never into the characters - that's not me, though.   In terms of eerie, [Climbing Up the Walls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbtZyuOMdHI) *was* my first choice for this thread.   In terms of terrifying, Radiohead's [Kid A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RwvZSfLUXM) (title track) puts me in a freaky mood for the entire day whenever I listen to it. I hate it. Well-constructed song, but it must have been ghost-written by Hitler and Satan.   You see, I like a lot of Season 6 - especially [Happily Ever After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65T-xl24W4E) and [Ab Aeterno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsnHQyhIyJg)...but Widmore and Ilana completely fizzled out, Claire was underused, and there was some pretty blatant filler. However, I still love it because of the flash-sideways, which was such a beautiful tribute to the characters.     My least favourite is Season 4. Keamy is an average villain, Charlotte is a waste of a character, Jack tries to execute Locke in the premiere (wtf?!), Christian appears all over the place for no reason...which still hasn't been fully explained, and there's also the Tom Friendly/Michael plot hole: how the hell could Friendly get off the island if the hatch implosion disabled the submarine?     The season finale was also pretty average.   Exactly. It's not unusual.      ...I'll show myself out.   Oh, definitely GotG, yeah. Although I do like the one with just Cap and the shield from Cap 1.   Which one? The cool one with just a tiny Ant-Man in the centre of a vast white background, or the blue and red FACE DOWN EYES UP CELEBRITIES DO U EVN RECOGNISE DEM BRUH poster?   **PREVIOUSLY, ON ARROW**   Woah...this was hilariously meta.   If you watched the finale in two parts, then you probably missed a lot. Two parts are 43 minutes each, whereas the single part version is between 100 and 105 minutes, depending on your region's framerate. The long version was the version that aired, and was also the one available on home release.          Buying the DVD, finding it on streaming or download (like $4 on iTunes) will grant you that edition. The Lostpedia entry on the finale will probably have more detail on what's missing.     	102

She was like a non actress trying to act... Wait, she isn't an actress and she is full of shit! Bill Cosby may or may not be a bad dude, but Throw Janice out of the mix. She is an attention hungry ex-model trying to recapture some fame in her golden years, shes 60 and lonely for the public eye. Her and Steven Tyler are like the same dude! [I'm not joking, look!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lib7b4gsWR1qzptlvo1_500.jpg)   That's his point. "Don't park beside me!" He is your a-typical douche who thinks his new, any dad can afford Camaro, is the sweetest thing on the road. Like some others have said, he'll "Car"ate chop someones ankles in a turn or get sick of having to buy new cool guy wheel crap when he scrapes a curb doing 50 and just take up 2-4 slots like the rest of the "I'm better than everyone else" douches of the world.   Story time:  I was a big kid, and now an adult who is smaller, 6'3" 250 range. Big but not a fat ass. Its hard to find friends when you are different "Yuk Yuk Yuk, what are you talking about mate, all Americans are fat! Hahahahahaha", ok are we done?. Anyway I was the nice kid, gentle giant, would help anyone anytime. That's how I was accepted and loved and enjoyed every minute of it with enthusiasm. There was a fella, several but this story is about just one.... Because I annihilated him.... Back to my story, he was about 5' 2" and was semi popular. He would poke and prod at me with chummy vigor. I was the first to make a joke about myself (Fat guy defense) but one day he went a little far. We were in shop class, automotive to be specific, and he decided, while the teacher was downstairs answering a phone call, it was his time to assert dominance over me by belittling me in front of my 20 some odd classmates. He told me to shut up and smacked the back of my head... TRIGGER for me. So I turned around and punched him in the side of the face with not 1 iota of hesitation. Mind you I'm mild mannered. The class had an audible "Gasp!" He looks at me with a look of dumbfound confusion. He decides to go forward so to not loose face, mind you I have over a foot on this guy and 100 lbs. He charges me and punches me in my stomach, (It would be more epic if I laughed) but I did not. I grabbed him around the neck and gave him 9-10 solid punches to the spine. Then I picked him up like the dude in the gif and threw him into an area of empty desks. The desk's went scattering and he was on the floor, he gets up and he was shaking like a leaf, stumbles toward me takes another week swing at me and I grab his hand and say "STOP! If you keep going I am going to kill you.... I don't want to hurt you anymore but I will if you don't go sit the fuck down!". He looks at me walks and picks up a desk and sets it upright and sits down. 10 seconds later the teacher walks in and says "What the hell did I miss?" No-one says anything. He looks at my foe and he is visibly shaking like a chihuahua and asks "Are you okay?" School fight rules in the 90's is you don't tattle, and says "yeah, im fine." Dude didn't talk or fuck with me for the rest of high school. Just to let you younger guys know, just because a guy is big and nice, He is like everyone else and has his limits. Don't Fuck with someone just because you think you can up your reputation, because most of the time, they will surprise you.   Oh but tell me you all wouldn't hit that shit.

Heres a few tricks I used. Keep a scale in the kitchen. Weigh yourself often. Again it's all mental. Constantly ask yourself why you're depressed, ultimately it comes down to your weight and how you feel physically. To be completely honest it will be one of the hardest things you'll ever do but believe me when I say it's worth it. One sure fire way I use when I am gaining a few lbs is to go Paleo. it's not a diet really because you can eat and eat often if you want. Meats, vegies, fruit and certain oils. It takes a bit for your body to adjust to eating healthy but after a week or two its not even a big deal. Last I did it for 2 months and dropped 20 lbs in about a month 260-240. One thing NEVER do is starve yourself, I tried this and ended up in the hospital for 3 days early on in high school with Gallbladder stones, The doc told me a dramatic drop in weight was to blame. The more often you eat and smaller portions will up your metabolism a whole bunch, I can attest to that. You burn calories as you digest, quite a few too, and if you are constantly digesting you are constantly burning calories. Look into the paleo thing, I liked it because I could eat 2 porkchops for dinner if I wanted and not feel guilty, just no bbq sauce but you can grill pineapple and put some sesame oil on it and it's wonderfull. Good luck.   Roughly 375 lbs huh. I weighed exactly that senior year in high-school at 6'3". Got all the way down to 225 then leveled off in the mid 250 range since. You can do it. You will feel amazing. It's hard work.... Really hard. What I did was convince myself food was my enemy (Really it was) and I would only eat enough to keep going. 100 lbs in a year and a girlfriend. Being healthy opens doors my friend, you just have to figure out how to use your key.   2 handicap spots... Even in their world there are douchebags.   They are pets here in america, It's a cultural thing. I personally would not eat a dog or cat, but if it was life or death and my family needed to eat I wouldn't really have a choice I suppose. I love dogs so this image is disturbing to me. Doesn't mean it's wrong, just disturbing because I have had a few as pets.   You use your mouse to control her right hand, you navigate said right hand to apple and click and hold the apple and bring it to her mouth. If you feed her enough apples she gets slightly fatter, and when she gets too fat a mysterious hand comes from behind her and stabs her in the back and releases all the apples you fed her. If you drop the apple out of reach of the fat lady another yet mysterious appendage (A fish netted leg) comes from the other side to kick the apple closer to the fat lady so she can reach it, get her fill, and get stabbed yet once again so she can eat more apples. there is creepy violin music with a little piano playing in the background, real scratchy like, And the artistry is that of a French coffee house drawing.

But 95% of our frozen food orders are just your standard pallet of frozen food stacked 65 cubes per pallet, then the store puts them in their freezer. We use the Chests and tubs only when the trailer delivering the product's route has a store on they way to their end route. Many factors for using chests and tubs. We try not to use them so much. For routing profitably they are essential. But no, our largest customer is Cash Carry and they never get tubs, they order so much it's profitable to give them the frozen section of the refrigerated trailer.   You too.

But from time to time a new employee or a tired vet lets something slip through the cracks. Oh the Joys of human error. And those pizzas come in boxes of 10 or more, so there are other unhappy customers out there too.  	42

 [I kinda look like shit in most my pictures, but I have rad shirts and sweaters so here](http://imgur.com/a/n1q5a)   Well this backfired.   /u/TrollaBot train_subject4743   Very relatable   Oh okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much.   I don't really participate in the voting or anything but may i aks why Foxing and Nouns are disqualified?   My favourite so far.   E.T or bubsy for smash.    I like The Descendents, black flag, green day, my chemical romance, minor threat, posture and the grizzly, rozwell kid, teen suicide, elvis depressedly, the world is a beautiful place and i am no longer afraid to die, tigers jaw, pity sex, death cab for cutie, sorority noise, and a ton more. Ita hard to name them all.  My hobbies consist of drawing, gaming, music, collecting records, and i kinda skateboard. I dont do much at all anymore. Ive almost abandoned all my hobbies.   I love having long hair but it does need a trim   I try not too but i like to covet my face a bit.   Thank you! Its hard to take care of sometimes but looks better with a hat.   Thank you for the input though. I appreciate it. I was actually expecting people to like kinda be rude towards me for some odd reason, so its rad that people and yourself actually gave me a solid answer.   Thank you!   I actually did not know that minor threat was a part of fugazi tbh. Im not key on names if band members so thats part my fault. I should of known since i love both minor threat and rites of spring.   [Don't mind my face and horrible smile. I try at least i guess. These are from the past 3 months](http://imgur.com/a/n1q5a)   It's rad. Also look up Sorority noise, Foxing, Free throw, brightside, posture and the grizzly, empire empire, and the bands i already mentioned.   Im really into indie and emo. Teen Suicide, elvis depressedly, pity sex, the world is a beautiful place and i am no longer afraid to die, tigers jaw, etc.   I can sneak my earbuds under my hair since i have long hair.   Music is literally all i have. I aspire to be a musician and i can actively say i listen to music 15 hours a day.    Loneliness is the deadliest poison.   I'd be lying if I said i didnt cry sometimes about this. It's rare that i cry but sometimes after school or work I lay down and just realize how lonely I really am. How sad I really am. I put my academic life ahead of my mental health out of paranoia and anxiety and cant help but wish I had someone around.    thank you   It's very hard for me to keep up with people over the internet so I'd feel so extremely guilty when I wouldn't be able to respond a lot.   I hate living each day in this repetition of school, work, and then Isolation. I am wounded by this constant anxiety of the people around me. Im so terrified of people, and I can barely look them in the eyes. I feel as if a thousand vengeful wandering eyes are constantly watching me. I wish I wasnt so damn paranoid. I have no close friends, im not close with my family, and the only time i leave the house is to go to concerts. I'm forgetting how to be a person. I'm so very lonely.  I just want a friend. I want a best friend. some one that will always remember I exist and hold me close to them. I don't care about a romantic relationship anymore because attraction in that way is hard to come by. I would love to cuddle or be held by someone I have deep feelings for though. To just sleep next to them. Know that i am important. I just want some one that i can keep close without pushing them away or without me becoming overwhelmingly clingy. I hate myself and I wish to die.   The one thing I desire the most is for someone to just lay on my roof with me. We can watch the sky and the starts together. Talk about the past and laugh about how sad we are. In those moments i would truly feel alive. We can listen to low-fi indie/emo bullshit and just feel like we matter to the world. Life would be great.    Im sorry that i am too much to bare. Im just so use to being on my own that once i find someone i deeply care for its hard for me to not be clingy. I'll just spend a few months in bed so everyone that i know will think im dead. id be lying if i said i didnt dream sometimes about what it would be like if i didnt have this life. Im so tired of hiding and resenting the people I love. Constantly drowning in my regrets and being paralyzed by depression and anxiety. Im sorry for this long ass post but I just wanted to vent.   Thank you. I guess i can see it.   Oh okay so it was more their influence than actual music. I wad going to say i can maybe see some songs being close but not necessarily the band its self. Thank you.   Can someone explain to me how minor threat may be considered emo?   	28
 Tell him how you feel. If he doesn't change, or even worse belittles what you're saying and ignores it (which is what he probably will do based on your post), then say "okay, have a great life, good luck being happy" and move on.     Uhhh, tell her you don't want to drive 16 hours in 4 days? If she's going to get actually MAD at you, then there are bigger issues here.  It's Fourth of July. There will be a lot more if you're going to get married.   I remember when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, it was the first day of school, and I got quarantined in a room with a bunch of other kids who didn't have their current MMR vaccines. They wouldn't let me back in class until I got my vaccinations current.  When I was a kid I was like "this is stupid, wtf" and now I think "wait, why isn't it like this everywhere?"   http://imgur.com/oH7FLAA  I've had this saved on my computer for literally 10 years.   She's got issues beyond whatever you two have going on.   Get out before it becomes an even more serious problem. Sever all ties, go on the trip, and move on when you get back.    MySpace. Almost 10 years.  He messaged me asking if one of my friends was single. I said I didn't know, because I hadn't seen her in a few months.  Next thing I know it's 2am and he's asking me about movies. Following day we talked a bunch more, then went and saw The Cave.   Turns out we were practically neighbors, living only a few blocks from each other. We've had ups and downs but it's been a great ten years. :)   ChristianMingle.com.    I honestly have no idea what makes us get into these certain mindsets.   Unless there's something she said that you can put your finger on that would make you rethink everything, then you might just be bored. Example: If my boyfriend out of the blue said "god I hate animals" I would be like "this is over".  Like I said, I would wait a week or two or three before making any decisions like ending it with her. The stagnant period might end. If it lasts and you find it getting worse, then it might be time to call it quits.   Every once in a while relationships go through stagnant periods. I've been with my boyfriend for almost ten years and there are some days/weeks where I'm just like... what am I doing? This guy drives me crazy! And then it goes away for a couple years.  I wouldn't make any rash decisions for a little bit.    Ugggggh, no advice, but I have been there.  I started that book at like 1 in the morning. By 7 or 8 I was still awake and bawling.   Read One Plus One by Jojo Moyes after, it'll soften the blow.    Andie MacDowell. Just thinking about her makes me angry.   I went into that movie completely blind, only saw the poster, no trailer or anything. Didn't even know the plot.  Walked out with it being one of my all time favorites, and it still is. It's just so funny and heartbreaking. It has it all.   Boyfriend and I went to see Click and the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie that didn't come out until the next day started playing. Everyone was like "fuck yeah!" and we all settled in... except one dick who got up and told the theater staff who gave us free tickets and sent us on our way.  Didn't see Click until a year or two later when I was feeling loathsome. Thankfully I didn't actually have to pay to see it.  	13
 Pretty great Vietnamese. Their pho is great!   What is the music playing in the background? Very reminiscent of A:AoU's "Strings on Me".   Definitely. Something informal yet beneficial. I like it. What days would work best for you?   I often brainstorm and outline for days and nothing ever comes of it. But then an idea/outline will take a hold and I'll create a 5-10 season arc that's just ridiculous. lol   Well, I will definitely take all these into consideration. I'd honestly love to do all of it!   Buffy was at the Box too right before we moved to the scene with Will/Rack and Dawn/Clem at Rack's. I would say Buffy went to Anya wanting to know Will's location in order to have an idea of what she was doing and Anya found her via vengeance. OR Clem called/contacted Buffy as Dawn entered the room. This is TV time. We don't know exactly when someone was contacted due to times "off screen" that could've been used to contact someone or how long it took Buffy to get there.   Oh gotcha. Then, her best bet would've been Anya since she had her demonic powers back at this point, but I also think Clem would've gotten a hold of her. We know Joss hated using cell phones until season 7, but Clem might've been able to contact Buffy via a cell he had (he is definitely one of those technologically friendly demons; he was driving a VW Beetle out of Sunnydale in the 7th season, and he's on top of modern appliances) or maybe a mystical way of contacting her. He's a skin-flappy demon, but he might have powers we don't know about. Point is that it isn't deeply important. This show has magic in it and it wasn't entirely crucial to know how Buffy got there. She had the means and resources to find the hideout, even with Spike gone, and she did find it in time.    Okay. I appreciate you commenting and letting me know. What kind of things do you write? What books fascinate you the most?   Well, we can definitely see about getting a schedule down pat. I, too, can only do Saturdays after 1 and anytime Sunday. So, don't worry, I don't plan on doing this Mon-Fri necessarily.   Tell me about yourself and the type of things you write. How do you think you could benefit in this group?   I believe so, but he was in Africa during "Two to Go".   I'd love to hear any ideas or interests you have that we could incorporate into the group.   What kind of things would you look for in this type of group?   But to act like the Writer's Strike had NOTHING to do with the show's drop in ratings and story lines is just ignorant. You're cutting half a season's worth of story-telling, character development, as well as forcing a writing team to hurry and come up with a quick solution, along with going through television executive approval, keeping everyone happy, etc. All the while, there's a huge freaking writer's strike happening on your front door step.    Dawn used Clem to take her to the hideout because it moves places constantly. Buffy has a higher sense as a Slayer that leads her to "danger" or supernatural element. She could have found it herself.  	15
 I'm living near the German border on the east side of the Netherlands, and just because a lot of Germans come to the town i live, a lot of people speak fluently German. You just have a lot of contact with foreing laguage, thats the way most people pick it up so quickly. I guess thats also a factor for you guys in Great Brittain, a lot less contact with other languages.    He's underestimated a lot, i wasn't expecting much of him in the World Cup last year, but he played very well. Thats when i knew that we can expect great things of the guy. I'm not saying he will be a top 10 player of the world, but he will definitely be very useful for us the next 10 years.   Yep, i've started picking it up when playing Counterstrike when i was 11, and in school we had a lot of English lessons. Foreigners won't pick up any of the Dutch language when visiting, because we will show you how good our English is no matter what. We're very proud of it.    A lot of players make the mistake to go to big (like Depay, he's really talented but besides 1 or 2 matches in the Worldcup he hasn't been tested outside the Eredivisie) i think its a perfect choice for a player like Wijnaldum.    I guess i'm just a positive guy haha, but you're definitely right. He hasn't done anything to earn that great gig as manager of Oranje. If the KNVB just had signed Ronald Koeman we would've been way better off.    Thanks! Maybe i have more luck then.   I guess you're right. Ruud Gullit didn't have a problem with the dreads, but maybe he was stabilized by that magnificent mustache...    Playing on PC with xbox controllers. Nobody is opening packs, only a few Depays, and all are from PSV, guess the same will happen with Wijnaldum/Schweini...    Why? Danny Blind has the benefit of the doubt. With Marco van Basten he has the perfect assistent. Lets just hope we can get through this bad streak and get that ticket to Eurocup.   Schweini and Wijnaldum CM, Depay LW in a BPL squad. I'm definetely going to try that in FIFA16.    Depay and Wijnaldum are the future from Oranje. Really hope all the best for them.     I would love to see the reaction from Ibra when he is forced to say something when he enters San Siro if he's going to transfer to AC again. He just shrugs and goes back inside.    Don't think he will, bad aerodynamics.    Haha, he's a running joke back here in the Netherlands. LVG talks "stonecoal English". Basically he just litteraly translates Dutch sayings. But yes, most of us speak English pretty well. Dutch isn't the biggest language so we have to. Its not weird for people from the Netherlands to speak English, German and even French.    You should! He's a very nice, down to earth guy. I think Newcastle is the perfect club for him.        "Reddit, what is your favourite quote? Why?" - xboxg4mer  you brilliant son of a bitch.

Pretty rare syndrome that usually affects children, but they usually grow out of it.   Alice in Wonderland Syndrome   As a medical student and crossfitter, I have had the same issue while doing cleans so I completely understand your frustration and pain. I know I can probably pull more, but the pain limits the weight I carry as it hurts more with increased weight. I realized cleaning uses a lot of muscle groups including abduction and flexion of the shoulders. This creates a lot of strain on the supraspinatus muscles, which you can test with your arms pointed out at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal, thumbs pointed down, and ask someone to push your hands down while you push up against their hands. If that recreates the pain, you most likely have supraspinatus strain and/or some type of labrum tear. MRI or not, the first line of treatment is ibuprofen and rest and then physical therapy exercises to strengthen the accessory muscles. Surgery is last resort to reattach the torn labrum. For me, I get pain deep in the shoulder as well as some biceps tendon tenderness. I try to limit the weight and not go over 80% of my 1RM. I also noticed the faster you get your elbows under, the less weight strain on your shoulders so a lot is perfecting technique. Let me know if this helps!

Yes, [that's what I said](http://theweek.com/articles/562004/surprisingly-uncomplicated-racist-history-confederate-flag), and [that's what I meant](http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/04/_the_confederate_flag_represents_treason.html). Note that all polling figures are from *before* the current controversy; current opinion is even more one-sided.   It wasn't necessary to be shopping for western wear to see that emblem all over that extremely visible prime shopping location -- it required only being moderately observant.  And I've met a *lot* of people who frequent this sub, all of them white. I'm aware of a couple of local redditors who are not, but -- seriously -- have you looked at photos of the Columbus Global reddit met-up over the years? Anyway, the assessment was based on what they just said here, not some baseless supposition.   I assumed that as soon as I saw the claim came from Pamela Geller.   It's implicit in every one of those statements, and not seeing that must require a huge effort -- mostly consisting of ignoring the opinion of people of color.    It has always been a big deal to millions of people, most of them not white, all of them better educated than those who insist this was just a matter of "heritage" and "honor". And the only people freaking out now are hard core reactionaries -- the overwhelming public reaction has been simply "It's about damn time".   It definitely was sold there, at the western wear stand on the southeast corner of 17th and the main pedestrian boulevard, across from Brown Arena.   The fact that so many people here don't remember seeing this hateful emblem for sale there is testament to how cavalier white society got about its continued use -- and also likely due to how overwhelmingly white the user base for /r/Columbus is.    No -- the comment you replied to was the one I was referring to.

I worry that we  haven't heard all the news yet about *shelters*.   There's been not just rain but a rain *storm* 28 out of the last 32 days, as of 7/14.   [That's *Spens-sah* to you.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bc/7b/ca/bc7bca7a97caaebdc1842fd70f9a6dbf.jpg)  You're right about the autograph -- it's clearly the same on both photos. Now I need to see some of that old favorite show.     That site, though ...  Who had the brilliant idea of creating a "hip, young" section for USAToday and calling it "ftw"? Find that jerk and fire him.     At this point I stopped caring,  Yeah, no. From the tone of your comments, you stopped caring before you started this discussion. I'm a mod elsewhere, so I know how to deal with users who break the rules. You completely failed to cushion your explanation with compassion -- and instead, accused the OP of "ignoring" you when she was merely pointing to how confusing this rule can be even when the user is not dealing with shock and grief.  You're off balance here. This exchange should have been about explaining the rules to someone who made a sincere mistake, not about spanking a naughty child. Modding is a tough job, but you really can do better than this.   Go on ...   Thanks for taking this sad occasion to spread knowledge of a disease most readers have never heard about. May I ask where this happened?   There are a lot of great acts on offer, including Columbus native Linda Dachtyl, but I'm most excited about [Eddie Palmieri](http://www.hotribscooljazz.org/artist/eddie-palmieri-latin-jazz-septet/) on Friday night.    This story is so much juicier than any headline can convey ... If you're just tuning in now, be sure to read the previous coverage at the links in the article.      In a tent the campers carried up by themselves, not a hotel pod permanently situated atop a ladder.   I know what/where it is. And what you cite about El Capitan is the *exact opposite* of what's going on here.      I'm sorry for your loss, but that's not going to happen.   The vet most likely had a legal obligation to treat any rabid animal the way she did Jiggie, and you could offer no assurance that it couldn't possibly be rabies, because you had allowed Jiggie to run loose.   Some jurisdictions will allow a possibly rabid animal to live through a waiting period rather than kill it and dissect the brain (the only conclusive test), but even if your town allows this it won't matter because suing over veterinary care is something only a very wealthy person even *can* do.  The vet you went to lacks people skills, but suing won't change anything. Please just concentrate on remembering Jiggie at her strongest and best.   Some context would help. The last name looks like it might be Springer.      go away, idiot spammer.  reported.   go away, idiot spammer.  reported.   In this case, it was the title.   Yeah, this isn't much different from insisting on taking air conditioning and wide-screen TV into the wilderness. I'm pretty sure the models here didn't do nearly enough to earn that view. (They do climb, but on a permanently installed grid.)   I'm suddenly extra grateful that US national parks don't allow tourists with enough money to just hang off the edge of El Capitan or Toroweap.    Yes, because reddit is literally the government.   It wasn't a police brutality protest, although many of those people are also involved in that work.  The event today was [the Ohio Student Association](http://www.ohiostudentassociation.org/end_zero_tolerance) statewide protest about zero-tolerance school discipline policies. The press advisory explaining the goals of the  demonstration is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdXbYlyHXnUwYTj08oRvvF0nD5RR6VX43XnXLqhD2wY/edit?pli=1). It will be interesting to see how this is covered on the 6:00 local news; at noon Ch. 4 managed to cover a different story from across the street from the education Department and the OSA demo was so loud it was hard to hear the reporter -- but they had no coverage of this event.  OSA is a relatively new but very impressive organization. It's part of [the Ohio Organizing Collaborative](http://www.ohorganizing.org/) which has member groups (including unions) all over the state, and an innovative approach to organizing that mobilizes and trains young people to be effective leaders in various reform struggles, including elimination of student debt.  For these reasons and more, OSA was voted the Community Festival Honored Community Organization for 2015 -- see page 15 [here](http://apgmediaofohio.com/emags/Comfest2015/index.html).   As one who just yesterday was [very negative about a superficially similar pitch for funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbusSocial/comments/3d9iom/help_prevent_a_homeless_veteran_from_ending_up_on/), I have to say that Star House is a worthy charity that *should* be supported. I wish their IndieGogo page had  included a link to their website, where the [archive of news articles](http://www.osustarhouse.com/News-and-Events/News.aspx) makes it very clear how necessary and good their work is AND why they had to turn to crowdfunding.  Adding, a good friend who works there brought some of these kids to work volunteer shifts at ComFest, and they did an outstanding job.     You should go back and see what OP said when he finally came back to this post.   Fire codes for residential buildings generally forbid accumulating large quantities of fuel.  Adding,common sense should stop you before that ...     /r/worldnews has a HUGE volume of submissions, and in the context of *real* world news, this is not a topic that deserves space here.     What kids these days don't have to put up with, and don't even appreciate the change: those crank handles for the windows, that somehow always gouged one partner in the back at exactly the wrong moment.    But *that* topic (news about reddit) doesn't belong *here*, which is why it has now been removed.   If she hasn't been to a vet, please take her for blood and other tests. She could be just finicky  -- my elder kitty values variety above flavor -- but it could also be something like kidney failure causing the anorexia and vomiting. (Adding, kidney failure is very treatable.) Your vet may prescribe one of the prescription varieties of Hill's.  FWIW, Friskies just introduced [a new dry kibble for sensitive stomachs.](http://www.petsmart.com/food-health/dry-food/purina-cat-chow-gentle-digestive-care-adult-cat-food-zid36-27685/cat-36-catid-200028;pgid=xpt4KH2GThxSRpgM1MAGIo1S00002POGOREb;sid=chGO33LBzjCP3ydn8OPM20DLvc8cExto62m3SZDk?var_id=36-27685 _t=pfm%3Dsearch)   ... and in the same week, Ohio re-upped for another Aramark prison contract, despite having had the actual maggots.   This company so richly deserves a national boycott ...   Thanks for this post about an important political issue. Now, will it get deleted because it's not about the horse race between two particular candidates?    You're right, according to usual practice of the mods here. They must not be paying attention. Did you report it? I did, but the more reports, the more likely it will get dealt with.   It's not that. It's because there's an entire reddit for this subject: /r/redditinthenews   But ... but ...

Erma Bombeck was a national treasure, and I'd say she *did* use everything she was given, much of it to make the rest of us laugh. One of my favorite [quotes](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/e/erma_bombeck.html):  My theory on housework is, if the item doesn't multiply, smell, catch fire, or block the refrigerator door, let it be. No one else cares. Why should you?       I just wondered because someone here might want to adopt one of these cuties!   Where is this shelter?   Cat feces should *not* smell so bad as that. If they do, something is wrong. I live with five cats, and only illness or bad food makes the task really unpleasant.   Congrats, Tom! And welcome to reddit.

Not my OC, although I've hiked this tail so many times it feels like home. This pano is just one of many on the main site, some of which need annotation. Note that many pages of this volunteer project are available for sponsorship.         I wouldn't give money to this nonprofit, and -- speaking as a nonprofit administrator --  I would not recommend to anyone that they do, either.   In the first place, there's no evidence that this IS a non-profit, aside from OP's assertion. There's no website, no link to evidence of an IRS charter or even sponsorship by an existing 501(c)(3), no board of directors. Not only is there absolutely nothing to inspire confidence, but there's one huge red flag: the most developed post on the FB page is a series of photos of a particular old mansion these folks propose to "fix up for transitional housing" -- this from people who admit elsewhere that they have no idea beyond bake sales for fundraising.  And all that is just from looking at the material OP presented to *this* reddit. [The most compelling reasons why no one should give money to this group are in the answers to the disturbingly basic question the OP raised over at /r/nonprofit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/3d9m83/struggling_college_student_executive_director_of/)  OP, I think you're probably sincere. But *you need to listen* to those folks.

Just treat him like a cat; he'll do fine.   Does OP have any story to go with this?  And BTW, where is it still snowing?   Thank *you* for a thread that inspired me to upvote every top level comment except one troll!    What did you expect? [It's July sweeps.](http://www.tvjobs.com/sweeps.htm)   You should check out [The Boathouse](http://www.boathouserestaurantoh.com/events). The view of downtown Columbus will knock your guests' socks off, and their catering seems to be very flexible in terms of price.  I've attended a high-end wedding reception there, but also several events for thrifty non-profits like [Simply Living](http://www.simplyliving.org/) and [Community Festival](http://www.simplyliving.org/), and the food/service were always good.    Not an answer to this question, but: have you tried  calling 645-2ASK? That's the library's research helpline, and they are *amazing*.  You might also ask local Gay historian Doug Whaley, or try calling the staff at Stonewall.   [This was just last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/3c8mk3/ohio_decides_to_renew_prison_food_contract_with/)       Why do you assume these contracts are fairly let? Ohio just re-upped for service in state prisons, even after the maggots. That's not a decision based on merit.    they're a whole lot better than other major concessions companies like Xanterra and Deleware North, both of which have awful reputations amongst seasonal employees.  However, both of those companies have better *customer* reviews.    That "family budget" model of thinking about the national economy is the biggest damn zombie lie in the whole argument. Does your family have the ability to regulate industry and commerce, and print money? Mine doesn't.   Yes.   I was the first commenter, and I also assumed eviction (see previous comment). I'm sorry now that I didn't stop to think how many other ways a family can become homeless, because I certainly didn't mean to make all of this harder.  I hope things are coming together for your friends.     When my dentist did my wisdoms they offered to set me up on a caresource(?) card.  That was probably [Care Credit](http://www.carecredit.com/), a healthcare-specific finance company that covers everything from dental to dogs. I think the plan you were offered is just one of many.  Adding a reminder that OSU has *three levels* of dental clinics, from student practitioners to interns to faculty, depending on how much the patient can pay.     Amen. This is Rule One.  In this case, they left general info, but because it was not a National Park they were not required to leave an exact itinerary with Rangers. Then they took one wrong turn (despite using a good map and having skills), which led to another, which led to another ...   ... and then they did the absolute *right* thing: stop, stay together, make themselves visible from the air, ration their food. I think folks in other parts of the country who over-blame these hikers are failing to understand how difficult S R work is in terrain like Bridger-Teton. Much of the time they were missing was taken up by searchers even getting to that quadrant to start looking.     Thanks!   Her leg has since swollen at least twice the normal size and she will not put pressure on the leg at all. She is barely eating and looks weak.   Take her to another vet ASAP.

Looks more like natural selection in action.   Er, what if you're allergic to Facebook? Is there another way to RSVP?   Screaming animal fights in a ravine are almost always raccoons. Opossums (not possums, those are Australian) and foxes fight silently.  Source: lived on the edge of a ravine here for 10 years.

Are you saying you think Bernie Sanders is a tool?    You jest, but it *is* serious business for rescue orgs, which have to scratch for every penny -- and a link to the original video would have offered the option to donate to the group that made folks here smile by rescuing those puppies.  /u/GallowBoob has explained his reasoning (users might be less likely to click a YouTube link than an imgur link); accepted the criticism that posting the gif could leave out critical info; and said he will post the original video link in the comments from now on. So it was worth a bit of conversation.    As I said originally:    ...this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them...  /u/Gallowboob has accepted the criticism and says he will now post links to the  original video in the comments.    That's a reasonable explanation, and a workable solution. Thank you. I'm looking forward to going back to upvoting you all over the place, as before.   He had not yet replied at the time I posted that comment -- and if you read his comment, he says that someone else did it for him. He didn't look it up himself, which takes all of about a minute.  I don't hate /u/GallowBoob or have it in for him. I just asked him to try harder to do better on sourcing. When he does that I'll *go back to* upvoting him.    RTFC.     weird vendetta   That's not fair. I explained clearly that it's about cutting people off from info about the group that did the rescue work and are actively seeking donations at the YouTube sitefor the full video.   [He just can't be bothered.](https://np.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cxekg/rescuing_a_homeless_dog_family_from_under_a_house/cszulpc)   First thing is to call the Coalition for the Homeless'  24-hour Family Center Hotline: (614) 253-7970 to find emergency shelter.   Starting Monday they should contact the [Ohio Benefits Bank](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/) for help with food assistance (food stamps), if they don't already receive them.  You're a good friend for doing this.    You can, you just don't bother to try. Now that the consequences have been spelled out, will you try harder?   [Yes, and it's not a harmless one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cxekg/rescuing_a_homeless_dog_family_from_under_a_house/cszy08b)   Thank you for the full video link, which is what should have been posted in the first place.  The full video comes with full info, like where this happened, what *organization* (not random individuals) did the rescue, what happened to the puppies, and how to get in touch if you want to give the mama a home or donate money to this good work. All that got lost when the OP chose to snag this clip rather than go look for the whole thing.  The OP, of course, is /u/GallowBoob, who does this *all the time*. [I called him on it last week and he immediately deleted the post in question rather than let the criticism stand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/3cg3s7/the_dog_who_fell_in_tar/csv68rk)  I used to just ignore the complaints about his karma-whoring, but this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them has put me on the warpath about sourcing. It's just not that hard, and it really matters.   What, exactly, are they looking for? Temporary housing, or what?  Adding, this general question, having to be asked by a third party *on a Saturday*, is a nightmare. One has to wonder: how did they come to be evicted -- under a law that requires plenty of notice -- without having explored options for themselves? I'm not blaming them. I've watched folks nearing the bottom of their resources go into a glazed state and so fail to ask for help in a timely way. It just hurts to watch, every time.  Anyway, tell us more specifics, and maybe someone here can offer specific help.             What's your basis for saying this? Do you know them personally? Just getting lost doesn't mean they were unprepared (unless that now means failure to carry a sat phone or avalanche beacon).   Even the most experienced backpackers sometimes get lost, even with map and compass. And this was Bridger-Teton, FFS.    You may be thinking of [Durgin-Park](http://www.bostoncentral.com/restaurants/durgin_park/p20.php), a Boston restaurant famous for two things: roast beef and "sharp-tongued" waitresses who are *supposed* to be impatient and rude. I haven't been there for many years, but the food was totally worth the long wait and the attitude.    Bouzaglo says the decision to sell has nothing to do with lingering publicity from the show.  Still as honest as ever ...   Don't miss the video clip in the sidebar about them chasing some guy out of the restaurant at knifepoint. I'm sure that had nothing to do with the decision to sell, either.   Not from reddit. From Twitter. Are you still mad?      go away, idiot spammer.  reported.   U.S. newsrooms have shed more than 20,000 in the last 10 years  What does this mean for the society these news organizations were built to serve? Through the lens of analyzing the attempted sale one of the biggest new media conglomerates, Neiman Lab details exactly what has been lost.            I can't believe they left out [Hudson University](http://untappedcities.com/2014/01/29/nyc-that-never-was-secrets-of-hudson-university/), which has been featured in at least 7 TV series and numerous comics.      But feet smell so delicious ...       I've heard nothing to suggest they did not have these. To the contrary, the eldest is described was an experienced *trekker*.   Even the most experienced backpackers sometimes get lost, even with map and compass. And this was Bridger-Teton, FFS.   They've got a screenplay to sell.         This link doesn't go to a picture -- it goes to an entire site. Try again?   They certainly don't belong here, in a reddit where the rules clearly state    Please do not submit news, especially not to start a debate. Submissions should be a great read above anything else.  OP, you even tried to pick a fight by changing the headline. Reddit isn't  in a "struggle to stay afloat" -- if you think so, you need to get outside the self-involved bubble of the relative handful of users shouting about this.   I'd join his campaign if I hadn't already committed to Bernie -- but how can anyone write an article about nonhuman candidates without a photo of [Pigasus?](https://craigsfire.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/picture-1.png)   I assume by "hate water" you mean they hate being wet -- but *drinking* enough water is the main thing you have to watch for. If one (esp. the elder kitty) isn't drinking enough, make sure s/he gets wet food with added water, or gravy. You could also brush them to remove extra fur (and show them you care).  Both of them should be fine, if cranky, unless the temps get to triple digits.    This is an interesting article, but it appears to have been lifted entirely from [this much more serious site](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/white-walter-f-1893-1955) and reposted on what's apparently a clickbait site, with the added insult that the "rewindingbalck.com" version actually *claims copyright* on the plagiarized text.  Thanks to the OP for posting -- but next time, may be you could check the source a bit more.   I think you're right! Your comment reminds me of my favorite quote from the writer who created your alter ego:    ["Get it right or let it alone. The conclusion you jump to may be your own."](http://www.gutenberg.ca/ebooks/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime-00-h-dir/thurberj-furtherfablesforourtime-00-h.html)   That's not the worst way to go through life, actually ...   Ask local rescue groups as well as your local reddit for recommendations. Call ahead and talk to the receptionist -- this person's attitude will tell you a lot about whether this practice is the on for you. And wherever you wind up going, tell the doctor upfront that you have limited funds and want to know how much each step of assessment and care will cost *before* they start into it.   [Care Credit](http://www.carecredit.com/) may work for you. Have you specifically searched for low-cost vets in your area? You could ask your local reddit for suggestions.   A good article, but the headline makes it sound more crass than it really is. The money the author spent was shocking to her *in retrospect*, but it's clear that she was deciding on the basis of love (as she understood it then) as things went along and only noticing the financial cost later ... when she also belatedly recognized the cost in pain these treatments caused Kitty, and admitted having prioritized her own feelings above Kitty's well-being.  The decision to euthanize a beloved pet is always agonizing, and this author seems to have arrived at a better than average standard for making such decisions. Thanks to the OP for sharing that, and for opening up this discussion here.    I wonder if vets would allow me to post on their boards even if I'm not a customer?   Yes, they probably will. As for places that will take 6 cats: probably no landlord will go for this. And that's why millions of renters lie about how many cats they have. As long as your rent is paid on time, and the cats aren't stinky or noisy, most landlords will choose an otherwise good tenant over the hassle of eviction and starting over to find a new tenant. I do think 6 in an apartment is probably too many for their sake, but if you haven't re-homed some/all of them by the time you move maybe you can keep them while you continue to look for new homes.  Offering one cat at a time really is best. Include some details about the cat's personality: what kind of toys it likes, what silly things it does, how it interacts with others, etc. Emphasize that there is a deadline (even if it's not firm) and that you're being slightly picky about who you'll allow to have your kitty. People are more likely to respond to the implied challenge of "are you good enough to adopt this particular wonderful cat?" than they are to the implied carelessness of "I've got too many cats -- want one?"   Good luck!    This sophistry is so far from "best of" material that OP should be thoroughly embarrassed to have submitted it here.   Kittens are adorable just the way they are.    It didn't burn down, it just got so decrepit as to be dangerously unusable. [It was closed in 1968 and torn down in 1971.](https://library.osu.edu/blogs/archives/2011/08/23/original-university-hall-razed-40-years-ago-today/) I've only gone in there once since, but I'm guessing they did not rebuild the old Green Room in the basement, because that's when they built the theater in the Drake Union to replace the one in U Hall.    OP isn't looking for a whole house, but rather an apartment in a big house that has been split into apartments.   Columbus doesn't have a lot of what you're talking about, except in the OSU area. What we do have is a lot of duplexes -- so that may be a term you want to look for.   Buying boots this close to the hike is not a good idea: they could not possibly be broken in before you start. OTOH, sneakers won't cut it. You should immediately buy a pair of trail runners or lowcut hiking shoes -- something that has serious tread and arch/ankle support, but will break in fast. Merrell has some shoes that don't require long break-in; Hi-Tec specializes in shoes that are wearable right out of the box (but don't last for as long as others).  More important is that this question raises another question: whether you've bitten off more than you can chew here. How accustomed are you to long-distance hiking? How strong are your knees? Have you backpacked much? Do you live at sea level? All of these questions are important, and if you give us more detail we can give you more help.  Two points that will help, no matter what your experience:   (1) remember to cut your toenails before starting out; and (2) you can make the whole trip easier by sending your pack and tent down and up again by mule. It costs $68.42 each way and is totally worth it. If you decide to use the [mule duffel service](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/duffel-services/) just on way, make it the downhill trip. That's much harder than the uphill, especially if you're going down the Kaibab and up BA.       That's a natural reaction, but I always have a second thought as well: a place this beautiful should never be the private property of any person, but should be available for everyone to share.   Maybe that's because I grew up in [Connecticut, where the entire seashore is essentially privatized.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMS-EfcWrSw)       Nope.   I never offered an example. You're confusing me with another commenter, which happens when you're in too much of hurry -- much like the original problem, which was your failure to specify that you meant "the world's first (*major*) non-non opiate pain med". If you go back and read only the exchange between you and me, you can see where you started responding to the wrong person.    Link and Hagrid are so lucky to have been left at your house! Please keep us posted (with lots of photos) as they grow.   I never said you did. But by not being specific, you did make a ridiculous claim.    Please start by reading the reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar, and using the search function to find other threads about this (yours is at least the third one today!).  Then come back and tell us some relevant details, like how much you want to pay and whether you really need to be on the bus line, so people can help you in a meaningful way.   (1) read the reddit Guide to Columbus (linked in the sidebar); (2) use the search function to find previous such threads; (3) forget "property management companies" when looking for a house -- this only makes sense for apts.; and (4) drive around the desired neighborhood looking for signs.   How did you come to be bottle feeding such a tiny (and adorable) kitten?   Fine. But that's not what was at issue here. /u/tomjoads made a flat assertion about *all* painkillers, and I was pointing out how ridiculous such a broad, nonspecific claim really is.  I can't take opiates, and I'm really tired of people leaping right past other pain control modalities to assume that opiates are the answer. That way of thinking (among docs as well as patients) is a big part of the problem the CDC describes.   What you said was   the worlds first non opiate pain med  If you meant something different, some subset of that, you did not say so. That was my point.     That's the idea! Just remember there are always other things on the ballot, even in a primary.   There are plenty of those already in existence.   [Details here.](http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/nuesse/pistazie/pistazie.htm#selbsterhitzung)   Did you read the reddit Guide to Columbus, linked in the sidebar of /r/Columbus? Have you searched old posts on /r/Columbus for similar questions and answers? This gets asked (and answered) there *constantly*, so be sure to check those out and then come back and ask more specific questions.   I would love to vote Democrat in the general elections if we can get Bernie on the ticket past the primaries!  ... and that's why you're going to register as a Democrat, first thing tomorrow morning, right?   It was *never* cool, and if you'd had to step over the many users who passed out *on the sidewalk*, or answer crisis calls from the girls who had been date raped because of sopors, you'd never want anything to do with it. There's a reason why so many young people at the time believed this drug flooded the streets as a  government plan to derail the anti-war movement, which was peaking in the early 70s. It's functionally the opposite of LSD, designed to make you useless and unconscious.     Submission statement: Quaaludes are the nearly forgotten drug Bill Cosby admitted using for date rape -- and he wasn't alone. This 1973 article delineates some of the reasons why activists at the time conducted a campaign against this "death drug" -- [here's more about that grassroots campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689).      See also this [anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) by anti-war activists of the time.      Must have been very late 60s, because they really did show up very suddenly in 1970. A lot of memories have faded by now, but the plague of people falling down and passing out *on the sidewalk* is unfortunately still vivid, along with the epidemic of date rapes that pushed us to start the first rape crisis center in Ohio.     Quaaludes -- also called "sopors" -- are a soporific (sleeping pill) that had a sudden rush of popularity in the early 70s as a recreational drug, with a very significant usage as a date-rape drug.   There was a theory advanced by radical anti-war activists (mainly Yippies and the underground press, starting from Ann Arbor) that there was government involvement in the sudden widespread street-level availability of such "death drugs" -- as opposed to pot and LSD -- intended to blunt the rising popular opposition to the Viet Nam war and the recession.   [Here is a 1973 article about the national anti-sopor campaign](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689), showing the "WAKE UP! No more sleeping pills in our community" graphic that appeared on thousands of T-shirts and millions of posters that year. And [here is a history of Quaaludes](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329) published that same year by Rolling Stone.   The first appearance of Quaaludes as a recreational drug was late 1970. There was a grassroots campaign at the time, started by activists in Ann Arbor and spread through the underground press, to convince young people to not use the drug. I still have my ["Wake Up! No more sleeping pills in our community" ](http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/195689) shirt, along with some leaflets and news articles ... somewhere in storage.  EDIT: [Here's a BIG flashback about the drug we called Sopors.](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/unconsciousness-expansion-the-sopor-story-19730329)   Oh wise one, aren't you getting a wee bit ahead of yourself here?   Cow piss in a bottle.   Thanks for the info, in both comments.      [Here's the full story, from the organization that saved this dog last year in India.](http://www.animalaidunlimited.com/blog/dog-submerged-in-rock-solid-tar-rescued/) They deserve the credit, not somebody who ripped off two frames of their video and posted them without context to imgur.  If I could find that in 2 minutes, so could you, /u/Gallowboob.      I know the headline here is a quote from the subject of this article, but as a headline it's tone deaf: most of the new social energy around climate change is coming from precisely "faith-based arguments that deal with climate change" -- from the opposite direction. When the Pope issued his Encyclical last week calling for a moral campaign against human-made climate change, he was standing on the base built over the past few years by many other religious leaders who say stewardship of the planet is a basic responsibility for people of faith. So this headline is just seriously odd, not to mention confusing.     Date rape is what Quaaludes are famous for, and have been since the 1970s. Have you been living under a rock?    It's actually hilarious -- that's the problem. I stopped watching it when they went neanderthal in public, but I'm still tempted sometimes.   First, thank you for taking care of these kitties. You've done a good thing, and trolls can't change that.  Some questions:   How old are they? Are they all neutered and vaccinated?     Have your posts included photos? Have you advertised them all together, or separately?  Have you posted to other local reddits, including school-specific ones? How fast do you have to move on this? Is there an external pressure, or is it just time to move them along?  I don't have any magic trick. In my experience (I re-homed dozens of kittens over several years in another city), it comes down to sheer persistence and highlighting each cat individually. For leaflets and online posts, a good portrait photo plus a compelling back story helps. I've also gone to the extreme of taking the kittens to a place where they would be seen -- the parking lot of a gourmet grocery store or a popular restaurant on a Saturday afternoon -- and letting people hold them, which increases attraction exponentially. (I wouldn't hand them over permanently at first contact. Anyone interested in adopting would have to come by the next day and go through the interview.)   You're doing the right things. Keep on keeping on with those, and keep asking for more help. In my experience, friends and family will make one perfunctory effort when you first ask, but it's only when you become relentless that something finally works. Don't be afraid of being the squeaky wheel!      He's the exception. I meant, he has zero chance *absent the intervention of a whole other network of volunteers trying to mitigate the effects of bad shelter policy.* Those networks can save only a fraction of the cats condemned by the failure to implement good public policy (subsidized spay/neuter; comprehensive humane education; mandatory licensing, etc.).    Are those rentals even legal? Residential landlords have to register with the county auditor.  And why are you talking to the police about fire codes?  EDIT: do you mean *housing* codes?

"Rose's scabbard, empty and devoid of purpose without her sword"  Vagina. It's a vagina metaphor.   Here's a good starting point: http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1810/20150791  From the Discussion:   For most vertebrate taxa (possibly excepting naked mole rats), the patterns expected under the social brain hypothesis are relatively straightforward: group members will face an increase in socially imposed cognitive challenges as social complexity increases; this should be matched by a similar pattern of increased brain investment. We suggest this is true because of the fundamental way vertebrate societies are structured: vertebrate social groups are ecological contexts where individual reproductive agendas are pursued [8]. As social complexity increases, social interactions play a greater role (relative to other ecological factors, such as the needs to forage and avoid predators) in fitness variation. Social prowess may even become a predominant selective force on cognition [8,9]. Social conflict probably plays a major role in these patterns.   There is an important difference between vertebrate and insect societies in how social complexity arises. Simple vertebrate societies are often family groups, but larger vertebrate societies comprise increasingly distant relatives or even collections of non-relatives. This is not true of social insects: excepting unicolonial invasive ants [50], most insect societies are family groups. Changes in insect colony size and social complexity involve modifications of family structure, with a general trend towards increasing individual specialization and division of labour among group members [18,19]. In some senses, insect colonies can be viewed as extended phenotypes of the reproductive(s). We found evidence for a marked decrease, rather than an increase, in MB calyx investment that accompanied the origins of sociality in one social insect clade. Our data further suggest the most important transition was from solitary life to simple societies, with further transitions in social structure having no measurable effect on brain architecture. This pattern indicates super-organismal attributes, such as distributed cognition, arose early in social evolution among Vespidae.  Other than that, I don't know much about cognitive evolution. If anyone has any insight, I'm particularly interested in how cephalopods (octopi and squid) fit into the social spectrum, even though they're pretty smart--and more interestingly, independently evolved intelligence from the bird/mammal line.   Idk, the machine learning/artificial intelligence community have developed reinforcement learning algorithms that do basically just that. Backpropagation of rewards to learn which of a given set of behaviors to use when confronted with particular inputs is not that hard to do, we have algorithms that can learn to play video games these days through trial-and-error. So personally, I don't think that's a good example of being "really smart". The kinds of learning behaviors we haven't been able to emulate in ML/AI are abstract reasoning about the world that can be use for inventing behaviors or things like having a theory of mind for navigating social dynamics. Those are beyond our ability to code, and I think are better examples of being really smart.   Woo! Congrats as well!   There's a great article in Quanta Magazine about recent research in bird evolution: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150602-dinosaurs-to-birds/  An excerpt:   A bird didnt just evolve from a T. rex overnight, but rather the classic features of birds evolved one by one; first bipedal locomotion, then feathers, then a wishbone, then more complex feathers that look like quill-pen feathers, then wings, Brusatte said. The end result is a relatively seamless transition between dinosaurs and birds, so much so that you cant just draw an easy line between these two groups.  Note: I should say that he's not suggesting birds actually evolved from T. rexes, it's a figure of speech.    mate selection, child rearing, family life, society, ethics.  I second /u/miss_step 's suggestion, these topics are more under the domain of (sociocultural) anthropology than evolutionary biology, and do not necessarily have selective explanations.   Woo!

During the 2011 Syrian uprising, a posting on the blog purportedly by "Amina's" cousin claimed that Amina was abducted on 6 June 2011. This sparked a strong backlash from the LGBT community and was covered widely in mainstream med  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Girl_In_Damascus   Well I didn't...

Pathogens. The one evolutionary force we can always count on is host-pathogen interactions.   How does "selection" being a *sub*component of "natural selection" make linguistic sense? I assert that your term "selection" is an ill-defined colloquialism. What the second component in your list should be is "differential reproductive success" or "differential fitness". It doesn't even make sense to call it "selection" because that term has colloquial connotations of a conscious entity making some kind of choice based on an undefined property, it has no place as a formal term in evolutionary biology. "Selection" is not specific enough of a phrase to describe what it actually is. The whole point of calling the process *natural selection* is to suggest that nature itself, without conscious intent, can also "select", as an analogy to selection, which connotes intention. And when evolutionary biologists refer to a concept called "selection", it always is shorthand for "natural selection" unless otherwise specified.    Natural selection is the process by which the environment selects which organisms reproduce.  This is false. Natural selection is the partial evolutionary change due to fitness, genotype covariance. It concerns the differential inheritance of genetic characters from one generation to the next due to fitness differences. Look up Price and Ewen's interpretations of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.  Differential reproduction that is not due to fitness differences does not count as selection. An environmental event which kills a random proportion of a population regardless of their genes is just another example of genetic drift, which is the part of evolutionary change due to neutral random sampling. Your "plain natural selection" is a colloquialism which does not exist as a formal term in evolutionary biology.   Don't know why you're getting voted down. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, as interpreted through Price's equation, equates natural selection with the partial evolutionary change due to fitness, genotype covariance.   Evolution is not linear. It's a branching process.  Also, what is a "type". That's a subjective category, and therefore the idea that "types" only turn into new species of the same "type" is not meaningful because it is a statement about things which are not properly defined. That should immediately clue you in to the fact that the statement is untenable, and that there are major gaps in your conceptual understanding. So my answer to the question, is there proof that species of a "type" turn into species of a different "type", is that the question is ill-defined.   The 2C target is basically impossible to achieve at this point except in the most extreme mobilization efforts. The train left 5-10 years ago. But from a public relations and a political policy standpoint, no one's gonna officially move the target to a more realistic 3C or 4C. 2C is the agreed upon goal between nations, and there's a risk of nations abandoning efforts all together if anyone tries to move the target upwards, which may result in a worse outcome than sticking with the already agreed upon but now ultimately unattainable goal. Maybe not, but no one's taking the risk of trying to get nations to agree on a *new* goal.  tl;dr The 2C target is more political than scientific at this point.   Kick it into twelfth gear.

 Oh yeah, I forget.  I even grew up out there...   Plan is done, menu's are easy, and hitting a price point is cake.  I'm not a mechanic, but that is what contingency funds are for.  The only thing I don't know is where to do it at and what kind of things and the price people are really looking for.   Price point is variable and easy.  I've just figured $10, including tax and tip.  Easy transaction, one bill, and give enough for leftovers.    Vegan, GF, and veggie are all specialty of mine.  I just happen to love bacon.   Quality has to be there, for sure.  And your comment is exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm not in the market, I'm out of state and moving into town here in a month.  Living in the VERY high cost city of Santa Fe.  It is a completely barren wasteland of good food, people pay $15 and up for a sandwich.  It is CRAZY.  What I'm talking about offering though is from scratch, sit down high end fine dining fare in butcher paper.  Or if you say that $7 is the price point, fuck it.  From scratch, to order pasta it is...    I'm sure this isn't the proper forum to ask a question, but after digging the sidebar, I didn't see this as a no.  A gallery to the kind of product I produce is below.  To keep it simple stupid, the idea is $10 for a sandwich and a side being the brunt of a menu. From scratch, cured meats and some cheeses included.  Everyone is doing their own thing in the area, and there is a lot of great food.

I have 10+ years in restaurants, 5+ in catering, 5+ private chef work, an education, and funds.  It is more of the question "is another food truck/stand really needed and where and what kind?"   Right. I was also thinking that it would also be a perfect for reduction.  Crank the box to 185 and leave a brown stock uncovered. Fets the pot off the stove...

I've been trying to figure out a double use for the one at a catering outfit I've been helping.  That thing is just chilling in the closet unless it on location.  And the kitchen is heat deprived IMO.  Thank you and why in the fuck have I never thought of that?   Alright.  Now you are talking.  So you have money to spend.  A business plan?  I'll look at your floor print in a minute.  I'm fixing another shop right now that is in the same boat as you.  Except they brew.  No kitchen serving food, seating for beer and wine/patio, and losing money out the ass.  Even while brewing.  It's stupid.  If you want some legit help, any into you want to pass the better.  I'm happy to NDA something even if you are afraid of that kind of stuff.  But a location is the best thing you can give me if you want some real thoughts...   The question isn't if you have a 220 line.  The question is where is it located.  Moving a power supply, dropping/running a line, and the kind of building it is in changes everything.  More than likely, the outlet isn't right where you want it at.  If you can get away with using the existing infrastructure and simply run a jumper, that is fine.  But you need code approval for such things and depending on your state, can be more stringent than simply putting in a new line.     Do you have pics of the interior of the building you are looking at?  How about a physical location.  I mean block address.  You can PM it to me if you are worried about posting it.  I'm curious about what you could actually do and what your demographic is.     do you have a dedicated 220 line where you'd like to drop the oven?  that shit is expensive, yo!   Induction uses magnets and electricity to heat pans.  No gas or fire, so no need for a hood or an ANSEL.

I've got a full on 18-20% food cost menu for ya if you're willing to knock a hole in the wall for a fan and a few grand to spend on induction burners.   No.  But I appriciate having my work included as inspiration and do find some of my own in here...   yes.  or an attempt at one.  and thanks.      Don't quote me on the B3!  I say that because I hear a leslie every now and then on some recordings.  Some of the stuff off Beale Street has the same organ.  It could just be electric piano run through filters and then hit the leslie?  I dunno.  I believe all of that work was with Mick Schauer (keys) who is no longer with the band as I'm aware.  Or at least the last album was back to the roots of the 1993 Clutch we all love...   Well, not funky funk.  But Clutch instrumental rock funk.  Lots of keys and B3 type voices.    Yeah and no shit.  I've seen that show several times.  Stamina is an understatement.  I remember seeing the strange cousins tour where they played an hour as bakerton and then 2 as clutch...   Fair enough. Check out Clutch's work as The Bakerton Group.  Mainly instruments rock funk stuff.  Just as awesome though.   Alt rock?  Wtf?  How about "good old fashion American made rock and roll."   Thank you.

If (when?) you do find them, can you please post where.  More out of curiosity sake than any other.  Maybe check with your seriously authentic SE Asian/African supply houses?  I think they might give you a funny look walking in the door and asking for them.  But part of me hopes that if you do, a little old man with a two foot fu manchu and a cane pokes his head out the back and screams "So you ask about grasshopper?!?"   Always green. On everything.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Cooked_Chips  The SV method is overkill.  I cut the potato to shape.  Place in a cold pan of water and bring to a slight boil.  Drain and place onto a sheet pan to freeze IQF style.  Minimum 1 hour, overnight is best.  Then fry them at 250 degrees for 5 minutes, drain and freeze again IQF style for minimum 1 hour or overnight.  Then fry till crisp at 350 or 375.      The above is a variation of several dishes I've run on different menus.   flight comes in at 12:05. I didn't think to give him the option of breakfast.  He might want a serious smothered burrito.   and have an upvote for the hyperlinks...   Sweet pot gnocchi doesn't really pair that well with carbonara, IMO and experience.  Red sauce is a terrible idea as well.  I've made various versions of the gnocchi you are talking about.  One of the better plates I have made has been with brown butter sauteed apples, toasted walnuts, slightly browned garlic and sweated shallots, deglazed with white wine, and finished with Gorgonzola cream.  Then season and hit it with parsley, mint, and chive.     You simply can't fuck with Blake's.  It is my go to and my standby for the GCCG.  And IMO, they complete the Holy a Trinity of Burgers - Dicks (Seattle), In-n-Out, and Blake's.  I've eaten at the Owl before and thought it was lackluster.  I am somewhat surprised that several people mentioned them.  Maybe they are worth another look?  I dunno, but I don't think its tomorrow, even with all these folks chiming in...     I live in SF.  He used to live in SF.   We know our Hatch.  I am tempted to just take him for a banh mi over at Coda, but he hasn't seen any good green or red for a while...      all you need to know is pot pie.   Home made jerky, granola/cliff bars, fresh squeezed lemonade, and pick up a few induction burners if you want to "cook food".  Hot dog roller, panini press, and a sandwich prep table.  A chest freezer full of home made cream sandwiches, pre-made.  A Margarita machine for slushies.  I couldn't imagine wanting much more than that.  Caramel corn?  Gourmet hipster popcorn cooked to order?  If that place is busy with kids and families I'd jump on it in a heart beat.  And as far as expertise, just like running a booth at the fair...   First, you should define what you mean by the word chef.  Are you talking about the BS food network wanna be McApple Garden Toque wearing French fry makers?  Or an actual chef who has earned their title?    There is a big difference in the world between the two. Just a heads up and a tip - those of us in the industry who have the chops laugh off all the idiots who call themselves a chef.  Unless they have the 20+ years in the industry, plus the education and leadership to back it up.   1 - whichever you enjoy making the most.  2 - you need skills, not creditionals to become a chef.  An education helps, but it is only through hard work and practice that ypu become good in the kitchen.  Just like any other job.  3 - the kind that treats you well, where you look forward to going into work every day.  4 - long and tedious.  Typically, those who open and operate a successful restaurant have at least 10 years experience in shops before doing so.  5 - an average day of a real chef is 12-16 hour days.  And then take out or frozen pizza.  6 - if you want to learn pastries and baking, you focus on baking, not cooking.   I'm in Santa Fe New Mexico and have all the Htach Green you can want.  Hit me up and we can work it out.  However, I'm leaving town in a month, so you best get crackin!   Hey check it out people, school is in session!   Sadly, it is not an exception.  And I'll admit, maybe the use of the word standard is fairly liberal.  I'd say about 1/3 of all the restaurants in the area operate along this type of fashion.  As a younger professional myself who has been here 7 years, I know that there are some gems.  However, the shit show outshines it all.   Well, you will be happy to know that you avoided dessert.  Aside from the tirimisu, the rest of the entire dessert menu comes off the back of a truck.  Smuckers sauce, sysco cheesecake, etc.   I totally get what you mean.  Might be Tuberculosis or typhoid?  Some states in the US now require a Tuberculosis shot.  The state that I am in doesn't even require kitchen or food workers to take food safety courses.  Only the owner or Exec is required to have taken a course in food safety.  Even something so simple as the bacteria danger zone is completely foreign to a lot of cooks here.   They claim to have 2 people to look at, inspect, and do all the bureaucracy/paperwork overseeing 850+ food based operations in the area.  The reason I called this shop in is because this is the kind of BS that it takes to get the Health Department's attention around here.   Private dining room.  executing 3-5 course plated dinners for groups of about 25ish.   I don't want them closed. Just fixed.   One of the reasons your pizza tasted like crap - I watched the cook there open up a #10 can of diced tomatoes, add some salt and a little bit of garlic and then pureed it in the can.  Surprisingly, didn't stick his fingers in it to taste it, but didn't taste it.  Nothing wrong with canned tomatoes.  But there is something wrong with unseasoned canned tomatoes being used compared to an actual sauce.   Seriously.  Half of this town (and half of the "fine dining") operates like this.  The health dept does fuck all.  Where I'm from (CA, OR, WA, NY) basically any combination of any two of these things is basically an automatic shut down.  Here, they give approval to kitchens by asking the owner "are you up to code" over the phone.  No BS.  Witnessed.     I tried to explain to the owner that his clientele has been dying off and the people who he'd like to have in there (40ish and under with an average income of $45k+ yearly) do come in, once.  And they very rarely come back.  What did the rest of your party have to eat/drink?  Oh.  And you'll love this.  I was told by the FoH that the only will only buy decaf coffee and pours it for for both regular and decaf because there is to much waste.  How cheap can you get?  And how would you feel if you walked into a restaurant and asked for a cup of coffee at lunch time?   Being a professional restaurant/food guy, I never want to see doors close.  However, I also don't want people to get sick or die because some jack off wants to save a few pennies on ice.   Seriously man.  The owner just flat out told me that he doesn't need to keep oysters on ice because they are in the walk in.  I mean, WTF?  This is the kind of shit that you simply can't make up.   It would be ABC all over again.  But I think he would be more dumbfounded by the community and the people in the area supporting these shops.  Then again, it is a case of "if you only knew..."   Actually, I turned down the job.  And then after trying to address the situation with management and ownership, I talked to the health dept.  The place, as it is currently sitting, is a public health hazard.  People should know.  Also, for the price that you are paying in his shop, you would think that you would be served fresh oysters which were stored properly.  Not product that was shucked yesterday and had never been kept on ice.  So.  Before you talk about the restaurants in this town, I would suggest you walk into a few of them or better yet, work at some.     Osteria d'Assisi.  The owner is a hack.  He tried to defend raw chicken sitting over vegetables and pasta as being ok because the chicken is refrigerated on the line.  Lollers.   I didn't post the name for a reason.  I've already talked to the health dept.  I'm now about to go speak with the owner and see what he has to say about all this.  So, depending on his attitude and how he plans on addressing this shit show of a clusterfuck, I don't know if I personally am going to publicly name the establishment.  According to Dept of Environment, they are walking in there today at noon.  We'll see what happens.  But, if they deem it public knowledge worthy, it will be in the paper.  However, if the guy is like half of the other douchbag owners in town, I'll name it.   http://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/31rc6h/i_almost_feel_bad_i_just_placed_a_call_to_the/   Crazy thing is, this is standard fare for this so called town of "high end destination fine dining."  When I was talking with the Exec, he was talking to me about chasing a M star and being on chopped.  Jesus.   Oh.  Also.  About 25% of all the food sold in this shop is wrapped in the cheapest cellophane you can buy and throw in the nuke wrapped up for 5-6 minutes at a whack.  They are charging $17+ a plate for this BS too.   TL;DR - Worked two shifts to see if I wanted to take a PDR job.  After saying I didn't want the job, I tried to talk to the owner and the Exec.  Neither called me back.  I tried twice.  This is what I saw.  Fuck it...  Oysters, shucked from the night previous stored on a sheet pan in the walk-in being used for tickets.  Shellfish not being kept on ice.  No retention of shellfish tags.  Shellfish and raw chicken/elk/pork on top of the line uncovered.  Sous and others grabbing handfuls of raw meat with bare hands, portioning raw meat on cutting boards, and not washing their hands or having sanitation.  The entire kitchen was unlabeled.  I personally pulled rotten hotel pans of food off of the speed rack in the walk in.  5 gallon and 22 quart buckets of hot food "cooling" on the floor by the garbage can.  Food uncovered in the walk-in.  Everyone's fingers in everything.  No spoons.  An "open to graze" kitchen for all employees when the owner/exec isn't around.  Including high end proteins.  Holy fucking hell, this is only what I observed.   Why are owners such tight asses who won't spend the money to get the things they want, while they know nothing about food and demand input on a menu?   If you want to replicate them, I'll have my cookbook of awesome sandwich makings done here shortly and will let you know when/where you can grab it...   If you are corporate, sure.  But if you are operating a restaurant to full profitibility, you are not keeping things on your menu long enough to build a par report.   http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe  There are a handful of unique and delicious veggie friendly sandwiches in that link.  And a lot of meat too.  All my work.  Any questions or requests for recipes, just ask.   Pizza looks nice.  Oven is a beauty.   pic 107 is vegan with that italian chickpea spread.  Another great way to add texture and flavor is with heat and your grill.  That pita for example, raw on one side and crisped with roasted garlic oil on the other.  Same with the sweet potatoes.  I roasted those first, skin on, until they are about 75% done, remove from oven and peel while hot.  After cooled, cut into slabs and pan sear until crisp on one side, then turn down heat and glaze in balsalmic over medium until tacky.  Toss some olives and greens with that and you have a nice salad to throw between some bread...   Right now, wholesale, I could get $30-40/lb where I'm at.  Retail, $60# and up for the cream of the crop.   I'm in the same boat as you, except that I'm educated and trained in food :)   Your fat on a veggie sandwich should be cheese and mayo/sauce IMO.  Easiest way to add an unlimited variety of texture, cream, flavor, and fat.  Start making some of your own cheese.  Ricotta/farmers is the easiest, mozz is a no brainer too.  When you do that, you can flavor them however you like and use it in many fashions.  Fuck avocados.  I really don't like them either, but the girl loves them.  One of the ways I get around the creamy fat of the avo is by using different spreads and purees.  Hummus comes to mind first of course, but there are many variants of chickpea spreads which are delicious.  Sun dried tomato, basil, olive oil, lemon, S P, shallot, and garlic is a favorite of mine.  If you'd like some ideas, check out the link below.  It is to a gallery of some my sandwiches.  Mainly meat, but there are a bunch of veggie and vegan in there as well...  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe#106   People that hunt know what is up in the woods.  I would assume by the looks and location of these boys that they have gutted an animal or dozens.   Fucking hell.  I'm out in NM, but if I knew what I was looking for out there, I'd be on the road right now.  How much weight is that?  Edit to add...  That is some damn good money right there if you can unload it.  I hope you can and that your patches yield another round.   Another good way to get the job done your way is to treat your staff well with respect and a decent wage.  However.  If it is the majority of your staff that pushes you, maybe you need to take some management or conflict resolution classes?   Your first statement is exactly why I posted this topic.  I just do it the way I do because it is efficient and profitable.  The whole idea of full hands in, full hands out.  Or pulling a whole speed rack of shit out of the walk-in compared to an armload at a time.  I don't know how much time in my life I've spent beating the idea of a pedometer into peoples heads.  Then they can see for themselves if "the fridge is in the right spot."  It is crazy people don't see these things for themselves.  I just wish I could pinpoint more of these types of ideas/skills/abilities/whatever in how I work to pass onto others.  Hence the question...   If you haven't heard, the SF police are arresting people on State laws and are ignoring city ordinance.   God bless American capitalism!     We all have 'em.  Most of the things that I think should be fairly basic, we all do to a certain extent. However, not every knife in the drawer is sharp.  I've come to realize that common sense really isn't that common and if we are to be successful in our own shops, we need to help our neighbors too.  I'm not talking about that hack "put your cherry tomatoes between cutting boards" type of Suzi Q homemaker BS.  But real things that can make a difference in a professional kitchen.  For example.  Spray bottles are a heathens friend.  In the last bakery I helped out, I watched the OWNER/baker spend an hour daily egg washing and glazing her pastries by hand with a paintbrush.  5 days a week.  She was spending 5 hours a week as the owner running egg wash.  And she was (is still) wondering why she wasn't making money :(  I ran her wash through the immersion blender to puree the chalazae so it wouldn't clog the nozzle of the bottle and handed it to her.  I then fixed her syrup (removed the sugar crystals) and dumped that in a bottle, which was then placed in a warm water bath to keep the syrup fluid.  By taking the 5 minutes to do that, I was able to turn an hours worth of work into 15 minutes.  Turning almost 4 hours of wasted labor weekly into potential profitable hours.  20 hours a month.  That is a lot wasted labor.  Then again, this woman really has no clue about how to do production...  You can also run butter through a bottle, same with honey.  Most people don't know this, you just need to keep the viscosity fluid with a hot water bath.  If you clarify your butter, it won't clog the nozzle.  This trick makes baklava trained monkey easy.  I can make 2 full sheets of properly made baklava, from setting up my mise to wrapping in plastic, in about an hour fifteen.  Mind you, that is about 150 portions of fucking baklava :)  So what do ya'll got?  Can you make my life easier?   Sounds like you got some salt pork, not bacon.   People don't like to be told that they are doing things wrong.  And if it isn't their idea, it is worthless.   Tell her not to.  With some experience, opening a restaurant is a terrible idea.  Simple as that.  But if she is hell bent on losing all of her money and having zero free time, while ruining any kind of relationship she has and becoming bitter and jaded about the general public at large, those of us stupid enough to be in the industry are happy to help.   Without complete information, it is hard for the internet police to give you good advice.  And there are a lot of assholes out there who will just give you a smart ass remark.  Such as "turn the heat down."  That helps nothing.  If you want to fry fritters, 350F.  250F is to low to fry almost anything, aside from potatoes to triple cook.  For a pan fry, medium high heat.  Oil/fat in the pan hot before you put in your patty.  Put a dome/lid over it.  3 minutes, flip.  2 or 3 minutes and you are done.  Also.  This method is called pan fry or saute.  When you say fry, most of us will automatically assume you mean that you submerge it in hot fat.     I commend your faith in humanity.  I have serious doubts however as OP was talking about deep frying a garden burger and burned it.   That might be true, but you are giving half assed advice.  Especially since it was not stated what temp shit was being fried at.  Sounds like OP isn't that well versed in the kitchen, and they might read your comment as "fry it at 250" and next week they come back and bitch about your shitty advice and their oil soaked food.     No.  Fry at the *proper* temperature.   Mayonnaise.  Takes less than 5 minutes if you have a food processor and is all the world the difference.   I grabbed that book yesterday at the library!   Got it.  Not a bad idea.   I don't follow?  Encryption for?   I love this sub because it is like school every day opening up threads.  And I like to think I know a little bit about gourmets.  I was just going to post your second and third point, thanks for beating me to it.    What I learned today is that R. subnigricans are deadly.  I didn't know there was a deadly russula out there.  Thanks.  I've seen those fuckers all over the place in the Jemez Mtns.  As a known russula, they don't get touched by me.  And I always wondered why those were some of the only ones that didn't get touched by the wildlife.  I always figured it was a nasty bug, but now it is confirmed :)   Culinary Artistry, simply for the seasonal food pairings chart.   I absolutely will not utilize that information and there is no way a magnet button was just pushed...  I never would have thought.  Whoever took the time to scan that has too much time on their hands...   If you want to mail me a 36GB of storage via flash drive, I'd be happy to copy the entity of Good Eats for you and mail it off.  Also.  TPB has all of it.   I used to think the same.  Until I bought that roll from the Vietnamese ladies who run the only Banh mi shop in my state.  They told me that when the French first came to the area, they were not consistently able to get crunchy baguettes.  Hence the soft rolls...   Brined and grilled pork  Chile and lime cured crispy lardon  Diakon, carrot, cuke, and cilantro  Roasted jalapeno mayo  Sub roll  I should have made three.      I live in SF.  You'll miss out if you don't go to white sands.     Do you have pictures of your operation?  An equipment/tool list?  A commissary?  How is your storage?  I believe you are onsite and have a basic dedicated clientele in which to pull from.  I think there are several items that you could start making a small fortune on which would be received very well by your clients.  Just got to make smart stuff.  One suggestion would be "Cliff" bars at a $1 or $2 individual sale.  If you have a decent food processor and standing mixer, they are easy and high profit if made efficiently.  Same with jerky in $10 allotments.  Easy sales, product they probably already buy, and things easy to make with good storage life.  The kind of items that you can spend a lazy afternoon making a week or twos worth of product.  Just thoughts...   Man, you got an easy solution in front of you.  It will be more of a question of do you want to do it.  Oil field. Where?  And when you say "in the field" you actually mean you are out on remote location?  Are you cooking most things on location or is the majority prepped before?  Menu please!   My friends office, they paid me to make lunch.  I suggested all you can eat banh mi.  They felt that was a glorious idea.  I agree.  Half the people there had no clue.  I just showed up and started making sandwiches...       Legit.  Boars head is one of the cheapest, US national brands of deli meats and cheeses.  Honestly, it is only one step above bottom shelf IMO.  However, it sadly has become the staple at many delis.  I live in a smallish town.  One place BH cheese start at $5 and meat at $7.  At another it is $8 and $9 respectively.  People price their product at whatever price they feel people will pay for it.   Yes.  One of the best meals of my life.   It depends on the model, but for simply slinging hash, 30%.  You can run a menu at 40% and still operate a highly successful place.  However, you're not selling food at that point.  You are typically selling atmosphere, entertainment, and beverages.  One of the most successful kitchens I've ever seen operate did so at a loss on food.  However, the 70+ taps, 100 whisky book, and naked chicks on stage made up for it.  I believe OP is only selling food.   Can't help without a menu and knowing your logistics.  Like are you renting a commissary? how much product are you actually making?  WTF is your product? Demographic?  Location?  Overhead?  Operating a brick and mortar, if your food cost is at 30% your are doing something wrong and you should just shut your doors.  Depending on what your selling and how you are (or are not) prepping it, you should be able todrive your food cost to below 28%.  But here is the real question.  If you can sell 50 items an hour that is yielding you an on average $5 profit when it is all said and done, do you really give a fuck what your food cost is?   Which part?  I'm just relating my experience.  I've cooked boneless chicken breast, both skin on and off, on a grill at various restaurants around the U.S.  Grill pan, charcoal, gas, and electric.  If you use the method I presented, perfect every time.  I don't know what else to tell you other than that.     Bacon is bacon, unless it is burnt.  We just have a preference in how we cook it.  Next you will be saying that the BaconWave yields bacon that is too flat and crisp.  Well I'm going to have to start a resounding chorus of "fuck you sir", because around here we don't discriminate against bacon of any shape, size, or colour.  STOP SETTING UNREALISTIC STANDARDS FOR MY MEAT OF CHOICE.   This.  And in case anyone was wondering...  http://i.imgur.com/AAt7U0h.jpg      thanks.  The bacon is a labor of love of mine.   My goal is to always have it look like that.  And the key I've found is to bake it on a cookie cooling rack on a sheet pan at 315F for about 30-40 min, depending on thickness.   I know.  Was lazy.   Hey OP - just an FYI that everything everyone said in here about how they think restaurants do their grilled chicken is basically wrong.    Lots of good comments about prepping and all that.    But the people who chime in with the brine and SV techniques as the answer give me a chuckle.  None of this is correct...  This is your answer.  Hot (450+F) grill.  Even piece of salted and lightly oiled  meat.  Toss on grill.  DON'T FUCKING TOUCH IT.  After it is cooked 50%, rotate the meat to get the X grill marks.  Use a spat to "scrape" the meat off the grill, not tongs.  DON'T FUCKING TOUCH IT.  After it is cooked 90%, flip it over to finish.  One of the reasons your chicken gets dried out and nasty is because you tear it when you flip it or it sticks to the grill.  By tearing the fond off or having it stick, you break the seal and let the juices run.  Tongs will tear your chicken 99% of the time.   I would be happy to send some your way as well if you would ship out some stuff upon receipt!      Please man, for your sake do so.  It won't do you any good to try and push through it and fuck up the break even worse down the line by not having it heal right.  I don't know how old you are, but you sound like you're younger.  Take it from us old guys and the veterans in the pit - you'll appreciate taking care of yourself now way more in ten years than you will tomorrow.  On a side note, you can still work.  Just gotta be smart about it.  Talk to chef.  Ask about inventory.  Ordering.  Prep lists.  Can you still write?  Are you a good enough of a cook to help with the spring menu change?  Maybe this is a good time to talk with chef about the 25 things ya'll make that there are no recipes for.  Also.  Talk to workers comp if it was work related.  If it wasn't, talk to unemployment.  If you're eligible on either end, they will help you.  Anything is better than nothing and there isn't anything wrong with asking for help if needed.  Remember, you pay for that shit to be there when you need it ;)   Without knowing your specific city, state, country, etc, nobody can tell you anything.  Other than you must abide by health code.  However, if they want to manufacture ANYTHING for consumption, it will be necessary to make it in a health code kitchen.    Some US cities have regulations which allow for home kitchens to be certified, however the rules are usually stringent.  In my town, you can't have pets and you must be willing at any point in time (even if not in operation) to have a spot visit by the inspector.  A lot of places have commercial kitchens which are certified and that you can rent.  Churches often have large kitchens for their reception halls that they are willing to rent.  It is a good way to go for fairly cheap if you can knock a ton of product out in a short fashion and have the storage for it.    I'm sure it was pretty good, but why would you ruin morels with BS truffle oil?   We bypass the press altogether and use cast iron comals and steak weights that have been sitting on the flame.  Easier to control the melt, crust, and smash.  A lot of people think that our method is more work and ticket times are longer, but it is really negligable. What it comes down to is a superior product (IMO) for maybe a two minute longer fire.  Just something to think about if you have the storage for extra pans and room on your stove/flat...  But if you are adamant on a press, I would suggest something like the one below.  Most importantly, get one with a split lid and separate heating elements for each side like this example.  If you spend $500 on one, you run the risk of hating it.  Spend some real money on a tool you'll love that has the capability to do what you need.  Edit to add... Check my post history.  I'm fucking serious about my sandwiches...  https://www.google.com/shopping/product/14664076670650374086?q=restaurant+grade+panini+press client=safari hl=en biw=1024 bih=672 prds=paur:ClkAsKraXxSQ9jyXOg8CfJsuXMVLpO6s_QfTvODVMlGgiKOHK7xwqsJ4rnVzMuKQslAt36zQrEVQKo9u0ZVXqrll_RM_hugUeYQTQNonEsb0FUd7u7fhgdh0nBIZAFPVH7278y0hsPQjwPYovosAK5Ns5A1ZaA sa=X ei=IrcVVcfeH8HZoATak4CYCQ ved=0CJIBEPMCMAE    Very nice Humbolt!  I'm glad to see your water issues aren't completely destroying the crops...   You will be a public health hazard.  If an employee tried to work with a cast on in my kitchen, they would be sent home.  If they objected, they obviously don't care about quality of product, nor customer satisfaction and overall health, and they would be fired on the spot.  You might need the money now.  However, you will need it more if you don't have a job because you feel like you need to be some bad ass.  Well check it out, you're not a bad ass.  You're a fucking cook, not a martyr.   I will double that sentiment to Santa Fe, NM.  Fucktards here seem to think it is ok to pre shuck oysters and leave them overnight on a sheet pan in the walk in to serve the next day.  They don't even keep shellfish on ice in half the shops here.  But then again, it is not uncommon for raw seafood and raw meat to sit on the top rail of the line...   They exist whenever people show up to eat them.  And if you are sandwich deprived enough to need to steal, it would be my privilege to share mine with you.   Not the typical oyster that you think of, in case you're not familiar with them.  Nice and meaty, you can cut nice finger steaks or bacon size strips to saute or grill.  I prefer them to just regular sauteed button mushrooms as they actually stay on the sandwich and don't fall off in a mess.  https://www.google.com/search?q=king+oyster+musheroom oq=king+oyster+musheroom aqs=chrome..69i57.4210j0j7 sourceid=chrome es_sm=122 ie=UTF-8   All the time.

 Who cares what Twitter says?   If we are going there, youtube says Star Wars won by a mile. Total views for Hunger Games panel was around 312,000 combined and new teasers total 660,000.

It's tried and true.    I am always impressed by her presence on Game of Thrones, she has had some very powerful scenes that are well acted. As for Terminator, I thought she did a great job emulating Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor yet bringing some new features to it. Also, she had a great American accent.    If you are still there, try the Hot Butterbeer, it's the best kind there is   I was born in 1990, Aliens  Alien. Come at me   That's too bad. That's cool that you went though.    Release Order (456123).   Anyone who tells you a different order that they think is best for first time viewing, most likely watched it in release order for their first time. It's tried and true.    If they are well done and pertainent to the story, I have no problem with that   Man Seeking Woman, The Brink, Broad City, Workaholics, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Silicon Valley, Last Man on Earth,    Totally agree, I might have liked it if it weren't for so much hype going into it. I had too high of expectations.    I'm the other way around. I didn't like Royal Tenenbaums or Moonrise Kingdom and thought Life Aquatic was okay but loved Grand Budapest Hotel. To each their own though.    watch season 5 of the show and you will see that, at the very least, Adrian Grenier can act   I never even thought of that! That would be am awesome cameo   Ha, you got me there, edited into one   I loved it. You should watch it. It takes a bit of getting used to but then it's really good. The new characters are great   Peter Capaldi is the best Dr. Who and I can't wait for Season 9!   Still a movie   Well, it is /r/movies, and if a superhero is in a movie, than that movie can be talked about here. So can any other piece considered a movie. If you want to see more about "original films" create a topic about an individual film you enjoyed.   Also, you are writing this while Comic-Con is going on, of course there is going to be a ton of content geared towards superheros and comic book movies this week.  And to say that superhero movies represent everything wrong with the film industry is quite a ridiculous statement. Movies were originally created to entertain, which is exactly what superhero movies do. That's not to say that's all i watch or all i talk about, but there is nothing wrong with them if they entertain me. You don't have to like them but they are very popular today and they fulfill the reason we watch movies for a lot of people.   I loved it, but i could see that happening for others.   You know, im betting every single person who subscribes to this subreddit know's it's Darth. And i am also betting that their phone autocorrected "Darth" to "Dark" by accident.   [Pork Bellies, which is used to make bacon...as in a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich...](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-52653-Trading-Places-Eddie-Murphy-wt-rPuc.gif)   Exactly my thoughts as well   I loved it. Andy Samberg was hilarious and Kit Harrington was surprisingly funny. Great cameos too   It's a movie...   Wait?... Why in the hell would I wait? I'm waiting right now so I can get that out of the way   Leia's costume is wrong, Han's costume and hair style is wrong, Rey doesn't look like that, Chewie doesn't look like he does in the trailer, Kylo Ren is a stormtrooper on the poster, and C3PO's arm is not red.   Fake   Go see both but see Jurassic World first. I personally enjoyed both but I'm a bigger fan of the Jurassic Park Franchise more.    I have enjoyed her work on SNL this season. Especially on Weekend Update   I am you!    Absolutely, she looks great there. I'm still most excited to see Luke's look in the film. There seems to be a reason we have not seen him (other than with R2 in the 2nd trailer)    I don't know if that specifically changed him but he does have a new outlook on Star Wars for sure since this new one started. And yesterday seeing him talk about it with such Enthusiasm was amazing.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fMx670jOnw   "appeals to either dimwits when barely a brain cell to rub together". That was the most dimwitted sentence I've read on reddit, was that even English?   Freaks and Geeks is one of the most beloved Cult comedies in television. And it's comedy. Not every comedy needs to be smart comedy (which I do enjoy as well).   Melissa McCarthy can act and chooses to do comedy which she is good at. Yes, she has been type cast and has done a few shitty movies, but she also has done good movies as well. In fact, Spy (also Paul Feig) had awful marketing that made it look like she was playing the same character that she played in her last 3 few movies. But it wasn't, she was great and the reviews were through the roof.   And no, Bridesmaids is not a work of art, I never even came close to saying that. But it is a very well received and funny comedy that made a lot of money and a lot of people, besides you, laugh. Which is what comedy is for.    Does any of my post point towards that ridiculous type of statement? All I'm saying is that I'm skeptical. I'm am intrigued but skeptical   I'm guessing you haven't seen SNL in the last 10 years or have not watched Freaks and Geeks or Bridesmaids. Or maybe you have and just like to disagree with the general public   456123 I say this all the time but it's true... Most everyone who says a different order than that for the first time, themselves watched it in release order for the first time. Why mess with the order that we all (for the most part) watched for the first time and became huge fans   If she is River, that would have been an terribly awful spoiler.    EW had a source that said there would be no new scenes or trailer screened at Comic Con. Just behind the scenes and special guests and more   Kinda like Facebook or even Reddit? Which both came before Twitter and without stupid hashtags and an overabundance of trolls? I mean, every social network is gonna have some but Twitter is just the worst   Boy, Twitter is just a big bunch of trolls these days huh? Every day I hear about stuff like this and it's always on Twitter. So glad I'm not on that shit.    Well, it is a movie...not a documentary. Great movie though   I still don't know how I feel about this. And it has nothing to do with the all women cast (because I am a big fan of each of them). More so, anyone putting on a Ghostbusters uniform other than Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson kinda doesn't feel right.   But still, it's very well casted and Paul Feig is great so I'll hold judgement until I at least see a trailer.    I'm a big fan of him from his stand up and Broad City. I heard about those comments a little while ago... Still haven't even looked up what he said. That is irrelevant to his fame   Personally, I've like Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi's iteration of The Doctor the most. Capaldi's first season wasn't the greatest story wise but his characterization was very good. Matt Smith Era had some of the best stories in my opinion. I don't even notice the special effects and that has never been nor ever will be the main focus over story for this show. That's just my 2 cents   True, but since we aren't getting any new footage or a trailer at Comic Con, a poster would be nice   Who are you? And why is the answer "a developer of the Star Wars App"?    Oh wow, I just assumed they were out before then. By the way, I may have only been 9 at the time, but I watched the original Star Wars Trilogy when I was 5 for the first time and got the special editions for my 7th birthday.    Ain't no problem with that!    That was so funny. He is great on Broad City and his new show was super funny   Can't help you there, feels like the same show to me and it's been great.    I was only 9 at the time but didn't we have the awesome poster with Anakin and the shadow of Vader at about this time then?    I definitely think you are reading into it too much. There is some rehashing (obviously repilot) but most of what you talked about is character traits. Chang being a villain and wanting to leave that behind has been his entire arc back and forth every season.   Paintball is a staple with Community so bringing it back was not for lack of ideas or for a callback but because it's a natural part of Greendale and the fans wanted it done right again. Same thing with Dungeons and Dragons, that was straight fan service but I loved that episode.    That seems way late. Only 4 months to go? I guess, maybe at least a teaser poster now that's not just the logo   I really hope we at least get the full real poster!   It always was, and hopefully still is (Larry, I'm talking to you, we all want more) a great show. I never thought there was a dull season   Chris Pratt   Love it! What a great trailer, I hope it just actually gives what it promises, a darker season.    Make a sequel to Genisys because it wasn't that bad   I consider myself a conservative and don't find either offensive. But I think It's Always Sunny is funnier personally so I'd go with that.    Well said and I agree with you there.    I watched every bit of it. By the end of the show (which I loved), I was rooting against her. She was entitled, uppity, self-centered, and backstabbing. They had those character traits yet still forced stories trying to make us like her. Peggy was one of my favorite characters, she at times was not great either but she had redeeming qualities and worked to get where she was.    Mac's Tavern on Market Street. It's owned by Rob McElhenney and Kaitlin Olson. It's "Sunny" themed and when they are in town, they hang out there. Pretty cool little bar.    I was just in Philly again last week for a wedding. There is always a ton of great historic sites in Old City, and like someone else said, Geno's Steaks in South Philly. And of course, you can go to a Phillies Game and pick a fight with the Phillies "Phrenetic" (Phanatic)    Yes! I never understood the fascination with her. She played one of the worst characters on Mad Men but they constantly tried to make the viewer like her. Did not work for me.    456123 (release order)   Anyone who tells you to watch them in a different order for the first most likely watched it in the order above so no one can really say that theirs is better for a first time viewer.    Yea, I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that one, the show is hilarious   I was still pissed at Sony about that until they announced that Spider-Man would be rebooted and joining the MCU. Now I'm finally excited to see Spider-Man again. Spider-Man 3 was bad, but that was mostly due to Sony pushing for things to be changed/added.   I boycotted TASM movies because I thought they handled terribly (choosing to reboot the franchise while Spidey 4 was in Pre-production, rushing it into production only 5 years after the last one, choosing a director who was under qualified for the movie, and arrogantly announcing 3 sequels before the 1st one opened).   Now, I also did like Andrew Garfield so I'll probably check them out now that I have no more reason to be pissed.    Yea, I have, great show too   Baconreader   I was at that point but the trailers, casting, etc. I'm really excited and I can't curb my enthusiasm.    Ant Man, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, Trainwreck, Vacation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Hateful Eight, The Revenant, Bridge of Spies, Spectre (How did I forget that one?)   I really honestly don't believe they are doing it just to sell tickets. I mean, it's Star Wars so there is already a huge built in audience. But taking on an Iconic character and recasting as a younger version is very risky. I don't think they would attempt it unless they thought they had a good idea behind it.    I watched that episode of @midnight and he was out of it for sure but then he would chime in and it would be gold. This guy is super funny and everyone should watch his new show and Broad City.    Ocean's Eleven, Casino Royale, Batman Begins, 21 Jump Street,    They got preachy with Global Warming in a kids movie. That's really my biggest beef with it. Other than that, I liked it.    I am excited for any new Star Wars at this point but when the Han Solo solo movie was rumored I wasn't fond of it. But the way that The Force Awakens looks from the trailers, the casting for Rogue One, and the directors choice for this one, I'm now bumped up to cautiously optimistic. No matter what, I'll still see it, but it really depends on who they cast if I'm going to be fully on board. I think they need to get someone who fits the role like Harrison Ford rather than getting someone who does a Harrison Ford impression.    Oh, don't get me wrong, he plays a great bad guy and I can't wait to see this movie, but it would have been a nice change of pace to see him as a hero   Hmm, BBC was late then. They announced it yesterday   Looks like you've been reading yesterday's newspaper, huh?    It still is episode VII and they still refer to it is such. The reason they decided to leave it out of the title is because the first 3 movies (Episodes 4-6) didn't have them in the title while released.   It will still be in the opening crawl as all of the other movies have had.    I'm excited that Ben Mendelsohn is in it but I was kind hoping we'd get to see him as a good guy for once. Either way, this movie is gonna be great!    That's why I said not much rivals it. For me, it's the best show I've ever watched but I have not seen the wire, six feet under, or Battlestar Galactica   I think what Showtime did with Hulu is going to be the new norm. Having it as an add-on channel on already tested and popular streaming services   Netflix will probably push for like FX or AMC   Absolutely agree!    Phew! I'll bear down.    Well, now he's streets ahead.? This is rinkling my brain!    I think there actually is an alternate ending they shot that they didn't use that is similar to that. It's on the final season dvd   Really enjoyed it. I had never seen a Terminator movie until a few weeks ago when I started to watch all of them so coming fresh off the other movies and with an objective opinion on the franchise, I liked it. It wasnt perfect but it was a great sequel to T2 (which it seemed to be as it retconned Rise of the Machines and Salvation)  Kyle Reese was miscast but Jai Courtney did a fine job. I loved Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor and Jason Clarke as John Connor.   Arnold was awesome, got the humor and a little heart well (old. Not obsolete).   The story was convoluted but it all made sense to me. My brother had only seen T2 and Salvation and he followed it perfectly fine. It was an entertaining action movie   Kids being kids isn't an excuse when one of the two knew it shouldn't be on and still they couldn't turn off a simple flashlight for ten minutes.   I didn't say that the 2nd island isn't believable. I meant that they after the park was disserted and all of the dinos were brought to the factory island, they shouldn't have just been left there to thrive. They probably should have been put down.   I don't get what you mean by the parasailing being shoehorned in but it doesn't matter, none of these bother me at all, I'm simply stating that most everything in these movies is due to human error as is JW.    There is a thing called an opinion.    No, Its more to the point that the latency creates time issues and the inputs are low quality unless using MIDI.   T1 was a very slow paced movie, they kept it simple because there was low budget (probably to their favor), and had Kyle Reese hand holding Sarah pretty much the entire movie. T2 had less of that, which you are right, but that's why its the best in the franchise and highly regarded.  Even though i also didnt think it was perfect, it was entertaining and followed the story of the first two well. I thought Arnold was great and Sarah and John both had great screen presence. I thought Jai Courtney did a fine job but i agree he was definitely miscast as Kyle. The writing was fine to me and i enjoyed and followed the plot easily. The score i didnt notice much but it seemed fine. Much better than the 80's electro score of the first two.  I only brought up the film noir point because you said it was insulting to called this "Terminator" and compared it to "shitty Marvel movie" implying that you don't seem to like current popular blockbusters and seem to feel that Terminator is of an entirely different breed. And i have heard others go to the point of thinking T2 is perfection in cinema, which im in agreement with you. So i apologize for assuming.   Another person pretending that the Terminator movies aren't an action blockbuster franchise but film noir. T5 was not a perfect movie, but it was a solid sequel to an action franchise   The fact is, John Connor ends up getting caught and turned into a terminator. So Sarah doesn't want to fall in love with Kyle because he is supposed to die and it would create John (who yes, is the savior but also the eventual downfall of the human race as far as they know). Then you have John trying to kill Kyle, his father. Except, it's not actually John anymore and the timeline where Kyle is his father doesn't exist anymore. John only exists as a terminator now. Therefore it doesn't matter if he kills him and he has the mentality of Skynet so he does want to kill.   You are right, it isn't fully explained but I was able to sniff that out. The only explanation given still works. John is now a terminator and his mission is to kill Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor to prevent the Resistance from ever happening. Meaning the Terminator John no longer cares of his existence because his existence means the end of Skynet which is his allegiance.    Totally agree, critics were very harsh on Terminator Genisys   I don't think it's garbage but definitely disagree with the acclaim. Mad Max: Fury Road   Well, a few issues.   1. Sounds generic 2. No description for the reason for the title makes it seem even more generic.  3. It's the 5th movie so if anything, it would be "Jurassic World: Evolution"    I'm not saying it can't be done, but it shouldn't be. And what you are talking about for live is not recording. It's looping, controllers, and triggers. That I don't have much of a problem with.    Yes, Kick Ass for sure   Because creating and recording music shouldn't be some Shotty program on any tablet. It takes away from the quality of recording and creating music   My bad, I thought I read that it was slightly higher. Maybe that was projections.   	102
 I live in a little village in the Alps and one sunny afternoon, a few weeks ago, I was sitting on the balcony, enjoying the rest of the day. Then I heard a horse-drawn carriage and kids talking and laughing. The sounds came closer and I saw an older man sitting, leading the carriage and that *picture*, with those beautiful horses, the happy kids, that amazing smell of pure nature, just at the beginning of dusk, was so overwhelmingly wonderful, that I must have grinned quite silly, because the man waved and smiled back! Just like that! It was so kind of him, it made my whole week. :))   Not too long; did read - Oh my gosh.. hahaha thank God no one sees my blushing... I wasn't ranting and raving at you anyway. :) I'm really sorry I expressed it so poorly (English is not my native language, unfortunately). I just had the urge to tell him, that what he said was neither nice, nor productive. Obviously. And now that I understand, your reply was actually really funny! :D  You don't have to be sorry, by all means, and please don't call your thoughts 'shenanigans' (I hope you weren't serious about that, as well), I learned something new thanks to you! :)) *googles Kawaiisu*   Doesn't really matter, if he/she missed it or not. This is not a nice way to talk to someone, especially when someone talks about his/her feelings!   If everything was that easy, we could just tell ourselves "to harden the fuck up", but that's not always the case, as we know. If "IamDolos" is in the mood to not take people's feelings seriously, he/she can do that with himself, but definitely not with someone else.  Sorry, no harm meant.   Who do you think you are?  	4
 damn we have a lot of fucking nitwits   Elizabeth would be amazing as Sander's running mate.

 ha thanks for the feedback i'm working on a part 2 that I'll go more in depth on!     whoops!  thanks for that clarification!   ha! well the list wouldn't have been complete without it!      Werewolf's got gnards?   Frighteners, Hellraiser, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, V/H/S 2, REC 1 and 2, The Vanishing, Dream Home (Directed by Pang Ho-Chueng), Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, TrollHunter, The Howling, The Devil's Backbone, Return of the Living Dead, The Fly (1986), Dead Alive (peter jackson), Burning Moon (Olaf Ittenbach) and finally the best movie ever made, HOUSE (Nobuhiko Obayashi).   Here's my impresssion - SQUEALCHSTATICSTATICSQUEALCh one cool segment so far the scientist portal guy SQUEALCHSTATICSQUEALCH   Soul appease soul appease soul appease. Unless it got nerfed soul appease will clear that boss in seconds   Okay this a facepalm but after 400+ hours....the ogre trail before you reach the witches at the very beginning of the game.  Also the hidden wall at sinner's rise with the northern ritual ring.   Vampire Hunter D, Fist of the North Star, Wicked City   Phil the Alien - pretty sure it's a straight up Canadian movie, but It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I never hear anyone talking about it.     No he only says it's a foriegn film?   He thinks it's called 'hatchet' but that's obviously wrong!  He says someone pisses one the zombie that's tied up?  I'll ask about 28 days  thanks!   He says it starts out with a guy in the woods with a zombie tied to a tree and he's experimenting to see what gets a reaction from the zombie.  Says first 1/2 hour has very little dialogue.  Then you find out the plot of the movie is that the government created the zombie virus for population control and now they are going around killing the zombies, but some survivors are also part of the zombie pack being exterminated and now they are fighting for their lives.  Anyone?  Did he dream this movie?  Thanks in advance, it's driving him crazy trying to remember!

 Who steals all this bike shit? Is it other bicyclists or people that sell it to other bicyclists? Do people buy lots of bike accessories second hand off craigstlist?   why do black people wear baggy pants?   great stonework, also- some of your anime friends are hot   you entirely missed the point of my post.....the vast majority of germans are descended from people who came over hundreds of years ago and moved to rural areas. Very few Americans of german descent have any connection to the "old country." Those that do are diluted across the country. This could also be said for the English and Scotts-Irish. Many Italian Americans have a grandparent, or great-grandparent who came over and told people about it. While this is not as true for the Irish, they settled in dense pockets on the east coast, surrounding themselves with people of similar backgrounds...and thus "reinforcing" if you will, their own cultural pride. I also said said there were other smaller groups (ie eastern europeans) that act the same way but have fewer numbers.   my diabetes hurts :(   the funny thing is, liberal americans are jealous of europe   It's because out of white americans, those are about the only two large groups where anyone alive might have known someone in the "old-country." American's with Armenian and Polish heritage act the same way but there are far fewer. Also, because of their arrival after the industrial revolution, they are more concentrated in east-coast cities than other white ethnic groups. http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/02/article-2408591-1B95A350000005DC-125_964x720.jpg   thats nice, so I take it you're anti-choice...but don't want more developmentally disabled children running around   uh...no...it's a bundle of cells      Since when does AMERICA need justification to militarily intervene anywhere? Suck our dick you camel-fucking nerd!   nevermind, that was too mean   No, it's what happens when you allow defeated thugs to withdraw and they return to kill women and children.   Not [always] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege) but there sure are a lot more cameras around these days   so a lot of whining and no answer?   It worked pretty well out at the bundy ranch for a bunch of crazy hicks....black people would rather rob some asian dude's liquor store, maybe they should try something different.   Honest question.....if bush gets elected in 2016, had the military arrest congress, suspended the constitution, quadrupled the pay of police officers and the military, and declared himself dictator for life.....what would you do about it? Hold a sign? Have a sit in? Flee the country? Hold your husband's hand and cry?   Excuse me, it was S.22, if mixed up the names of bills from 2 years ago. It was abandoned because of commentary and republicans introducing bills that would have removed the authority of the BATF to regulate such ammunition. The assault weapons ban was a bill introduced by democrats, voted for by democrats, on an issue he has voiced support for....blame Obama or the democratic party at large, I I don't care.   Can you honestly say, that if we had a strong democratic majority in both houses in 2012 that we wouldn't have more gun control laws than we do today? Of course not, because we 100% surely would. If you deny that you are simply delusional.   As I said earlier....it doesn't have to be one or another...they are certainly a red line.    they haven't....because republicans stopped them   Of course I care about dismantling the surveillance state....but it doesn't have to be one or another....hey if they care about both and use soundbites as their guide they should probably vote for someone else "I'm not here to tell you what to be. I am here to tell you, though, that your rights, especially your right to privacy, are under assault....I believe what you do on your cellphone is none of their damn business" - Rand Paul   He didn't barely try anything....The assault weapons act of 2013, S.629, and his new executive order on m855 were all shut down almost entirely because of republicans. Of course it will be an issue, people said the same shit in the late 2000's and it went out the window overnight with sandyhook. The democrats have earned their rep as gun-grabbers and the either have to make good or deal with the consequences.   What's wrong with Mormons?   and the 4th, 10th, and 14th   Actions speak much loader than words....if you think one soundbite is more important than a long voting record you haven't been paying attention to American politics for very long.   we're not talking about bernie sanders are we? And just because obama FAILED to restrict gunrights doesn't mean he didn't try.   and he loves gun control.....so he will never, ever, get my vote. Just like most democrats.   Yes, and many asians weren't even allowed into the country....or were rounded up and put in camps. The fact is that american blacks speak the language and will be admitted into higher education programs even if their test scores and grades fall well below the average applicant...the OPPOSITE situation asians find themselves in. It is also notable that non-african-american blacks (ie more recent immigrants) don't seem to have many of the same problems. While the crimes against african americans were terrible, encouraging a culture of victimhood only hinders any future change. The inconvenient truths I am referencing are the obvious differences in crime rates/academic achievement/etc. between african-americans and most other american ethnic groups. Today children spend a significant part of K-12 (and then college) being told the message "we are all the same, differences are only skin deep." The problem is, this isn't true, and repeating a lie isn't the way to change people's minds when they can see the truth for themselves.   While I'm sure many of your points are valid, they seem to be largely anecdotal so I shall reply with anecdotes. I went to a school with a lot of kids that were asian and WEREN'T the ones with stinking rich parents. Their parents were mostly Vietnamese, some Chinese and many didn't speak any english at all. Lots of these kids obtained scholarships to competitive universities (despite being double discriminated against for being asian) and went on to successful careers. My girlfriend is Korean. Her parents showed up in the United States speaking no english, they lived on food stamps in public housing. Her dad is now an executive engineer making great money at a local firm. The reason these people succeeded in the face of being an outsider was a little bit of luck and a huge commitment to education and hard work. Parents that taught their kids the value of education even while they were working in nail salon. I don't know who is suggesting that someone is genetically inferior, no I. I do know that a kid who grows up in a home with only one parent who doesn't value education probably isn't going to go that far. You can blame a history of racism and/or social/economic policies that favor such conditions for the present condition of many African American children....but it doesn't change the fact that you can't fix a culture by throwing money at it and you can't educate away inconvenient truths.   they're all funny   did they go?   seems reasonable   how come racism against east asians and indians doesn't result in the same?   neither do I :,-(   ....I'll tell ya another thing, your beer sucks   I think the whole thing is pretty funny. "you treat me like an animal so I'm gonna act like one" - "Hmm, I guess we were right about you all along, get the hose"   they wouldn't like how that turns out   Education isn't really a dollars issue. In Massachusetts we spend more per pupil in some of the shittiest school districts than the best school districts.   Like Great Society in 1965? Then the poverty rate was 17.3 percent, today it is 14.5. Throwing money at the problem isn't going to solve anything.   I doubt it, if she actually contacted people and facilitated their interaction with ISIS, probably. I'm just speculating because this article is short on specifics and might not be true at all. I think it basically ranges from "she broke no laws" to "she could be put to death" depending on specific details.   no it isn't   Or maybe a history of being surrounded by disenfranchised poor people that want to kill you   If she actually recruited people for ISIS you could make the argument she is guilty of treason which is a death-penalty offense.   Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.  If she has actually recruited people for ISIS   yes, but that isn't what you said, I'd also argue that the association is probably overstated, at least to a small degree, due to recall bias.   mesothelioma can occur spontaniously   Maybe that just means the subject matter of traditionally female centered movies is generally more boring to both men and women. Make more hunger games, less steel magnolias.   I don't agree with the point that "men cannot empathize with women as easily as woman can empathize with men" (your words, her point). It seems remarkably presumptive.   309k people   What does this even mean. Only like 20% are locked up for drug offenses, even if we let them all go we still have "mass incarceration."    I as well. Told this specifically by a police officer. He said it is thought to be justified because "insurance will cover it"   I'm gonna guess the PBA wasn't there   there is a lot of diversity among gays, lots of them basically ARE frat bros that like fucking bros         maybe like you, not like me   then they should stop pumping oil   It's probably just that thing you say would "make all of us more comfortable" don't actually hold true for all of us. I have proper healthcare, "labor protections" and "stricter environmental laws" might actually make my life less comfortable.   Or lots of people are no longer necessary. Why pay to keep them around? The grind-bots will take care of that.   great, they don't cause problems anymore   something tells me dr_retardo doesn't either   Foreigners serve in the US Marines. I had a German, a Swede, and a Dane in my unit.   would you...like to...   you won't like what comes after   Totally agree, we should have gassed all the socialists long ago   hah, exactly what I was thinking. When I saw him shoot the hand holds, I was like "maybe not as dumb as he looks." Then he jumped the wall without his rifle and I was like, "wait, no, dumb as he looks."   "If it's fun and I don't enjoy it, it should be illegal"  Apply to gay sex, guns, cigarettes, weed, fireworks etc. as per your political leanings   people with stupid names aren't THAT bad   Oh as it should be. That was the case in our weapons company. The problem is that often times logistic runs or transport missions would go out manned by headquarters platoon guys. That means a few NCOs, a few pogs, and a bunch of boot 0311s no one wanted. Guess who gets  to sit up in the turret for 7 hours and guess who gets stuck "taking care of" the .50.... It was fucking stupid, I'm glad I was in a rifle platoon and didn't directly deal with it.   For one thing, it's a nearly 100 year old design. Another thing, many of the people that get stuck maintaining them (ie some random e-2 boot) haven't been properly trained to operate and maintain them. Finally, in many cases people working in the unit armory are the lowest of the lowly retards in the whole battalion. I'll never forget the time I our armorer didn't know how to install a KAC RAS hand-guard.   Likely trained by US Army SF   or a chinaman   That's a dangerous game he's playing   hey look, it's bulger's actual weapons stash....what's that one over on the right... http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/14/article-2341237-1A4FA8BB000005DC-63_634x752.jpg   Actually a fairly nice, uncommon handgun. I'm gonna guess stolen from some old dude.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_posturing#Decerebrate  likely has a severe brain injury   Heeellllllllll YEaaa! Right ON Mothafucker! *Spits tobacco and shoots gun in air   Hopefully his accomplices get convicted of felony murder   And there has been a similar or greater amount of of islamic violence in the USA since 9/11. The marathon, the dc snipers, fort hood, several beheadings, a shooting at a recruiting center, a shooting at an airport terminal. The only difference is there are far, far fewer muslims than christian men in the US.   their best weapon will always be a plastic jug full of fertilizer   Meh, you're using a outlier to dispute another more significant outlier. While the definition of "terror attack" can widely be disputed, assuming it means politically motivated violence against civilian targets, other than the big two (OKC and 9/11) there is a pretty wide variety of people responsible for the worst terrorism in US history. From puerto rican nationalists, anarchists, left wing activists, anti civil -rights groups, to radical islamists.   This is what people don't fucking get. Real security is virtually impossible if people don't care too much about dying or killing civilians. In afghanistan we sent out ambush patrols, we had 24/7 overwatch from multiple posts, we had night vision, we had thermals. We had a 300 foot tall tower with an automated camera capable of zooming for miles, seeing in the dark, and tracking your heat signature. We had drones with the same capabilities. Illiterate farmers still managed to plant devices that cost 10 dollars that were capable of destroying million dollar vehicles within 300m of our base on multiple occasions without getting caught. People need to just deal with the fact that there is a 1 in 10,000,000 chance that some nutjob will kill them.   Or someone could just slam their car into the line of people waiting to get through a checkpoint. That would probably kill more people than the Tsarneavs.   In my mind the debate is pretty much past now, Davis says. The cats out of the bag.   What a fucking little cocksucking traitor. I think all boston cops should have to wear a camera and gps 24/7 from the day they graduate the academy until the day I they die considering they have expanded authority and privileges during that period.   Well considering the so called "threat" is from people that generally don't mind getting blown up I'd say it is theater in terms of its stated purpose. This is just to keep you and I in line. Besides, it's for your own protection! CLUMP CLUMP CLUMP   Yes, you are over reacting   The whole comment about their kind not being welcome around there made me do a little checking. It looks like Live Oak is about 30% black with most of the black residents concentrated around the town center and a small housing development in the west part of town. This hispanic residents seem to be concentrated in a trailer park in the east of town. The whites seem to mostly inhabit the rural area around the town. The motel appears to be in a very sparsely populated part of this rural area.   Can you prove he was shooting civilians?   Whenever you see an ISIS group hug you know a boom is coming   I agree in principal that the united states should have taken responsibility to provide military personnel sufficient to meet their operational needs, someone decided contractors were more cost effective, I don't pretend to know if they were correct. I see nothing wrong with hiring mercenaries so long as they follow the rules of engagement. Four of the thousands of people blackwater has employed didn't and are now in jail.   and then the guys that did that went to jail   Arrest a religious leader (murderer) Enrage his followers (radical islamist militia) Kill civilians (yea, good thing the Mahdi Army never did that) Fire over their heads (well that's trying) Mow them down (yea, thats what you do in a war)     It's a coping mechanism.    When contractors, Blackwater especially, kill civilians, it's usually always deliberate  source?   "Tens, big maybe" You have absolutely nothing to base that on. "They killed first and got a response" Yes, in life things tend to go back and forth like that and "right" often happens to depend mostly on which side you're on. I strongly encourage you to go live in Iraq with the good guys.   And if you stand next to a guy shooting at someone, don't be surprised if you get shot.   more like "real combat everybody" In real life professional grunts generally don't cry about killing badguys.   And I have no qualms about them shooting insurgents, funny how that works.   When thousands of people are shooting at you and trying to break into the building you are protecting they cease to be "protestors" and get shot....sorry   My point is that because some members of a particular organization did something terrible doesn't make every person who was ever a member of that organization evil. This video was taken during a major offensive by the mahdi army involving thousands of fighters. There is no reason to believe they are shooting at civilians.   well no shit, contracting is a dangerous job http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2011/12/15/2011121511501294734_8.jpg   he's not   This was the first day of Al Sadr's offensive in Najaf and less than a week after the iraqis burned four blackwater guys and hung them from a bridge so it is pretty likely they were engaging insurgents. The incident in the news was different guys over three years later.   5.56  	104
 Why does this say there's 134 comments...http://gyazo.com/7cbb3af22d63e270350b215de138b47b   Gotta say I agree, on the fence because of that.   It's hard to keep a cool head at all. These men have had training, even the cop has been in life threatening situations before, and you can tell they're still visibly shaken by whats going on.   Was the first thing I realized, it looks almost like a painting edited in.   I can't tell if you're baiting or just a college kid who thinks he's morally superior to everyone that's made a big mistake in their life. Either way, you're making some pretty huge assumptions from one video and an article. Then again this is Reddit, we do love making assumptions and judging people based on them.   Thought you were talking about the cop or the nurse since I didn't finish the video...i'm pretty slow.   I'm so confused.   +1 also been noticing bad AA after patch. had to turn on MSAA x2 and lose like 5 fps.   thank you   This is pretty off topic but does anyone know the default hotkey for the Quickplay Action? I've searched an searched but I can't find it in the keybindings.   I'm a power hungry control freak.   This guy http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/member/360madden?headSearch=true was in my online game today teleporting around and killing everyone with rocket launchers. Oh yeah and he was invincible. Just a heads up. Already submitted a ticket to R*.   I'm with simon on this one. He really grew on me by the end.   Anyone know why his account was shadow-banned/deleted?   It's not an unpopular opinion, i'm not sure where you're getting that impression. Even though I did play with a level 6 for one of the heists who could communicate and play alright I still feel like a minimum level would be a good idea.   I played with one friend for all the heists, finding two other randoms and for the majority of it I found people that could communicate or if they couldnt communicate they were usually still pretty alright at the game and could listen to instructions. Got all of the heists done this way. Maybe it's because im playing on the PC though.   Humane labs raid was really really fun too. Also enjoyed the stealth setup. Series A funding was definately the worst, just a bunch of missions.   Any idea how this happened?      Hannibal Buress was only a guest on the show, which runs for 30 minutes, she could have come to watch the rest of it and just not found Hannibal funny. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Howard's_Good_News   Hey,  Need 2 English speaking peeps to do some heists with. Me and my friend are on the last heist, have done the first setup. Much prefer it if you have a microphone and are willing to communicate, but text chat can work as well. 20/20/20/40 split. We would be up for completing the last heist within the next few hours. Cheers      His character is in an NPC corp so i guess he went on an alt? We were bashing a NC. r32/r64 because we didn't want to wait for HERO's leadershit to transfer it, one hour in divinerapier warps 100 off the POS. He burns around for about 30 seconds. 5 minutes later an NPC corp character lights a cyno off the pos and we get hotdropped by the NC. (we had a few dreads on field to speed it up). I remember people in HERO defending him too.    If someone asks just say you're friends with the person. Don't draw attention to yourself and don't give away more information than necessary.   Is DivineRapier confirmed as a spy yet? He's done some extremely shady shit in the past.

Well you might still win the award for most hilarious warning though.   Nice video although I wish people would stop cutting these off right when the enemy team reacts in all chat, that's my favorite part.   The only time my relatively small corp almost killed a Titan...too bad their ishtar fleet was just a few jumps out.   This was posted in an april fools prank thread a year or two ago (2), and someone that worked at a zoo basically replied saying that they get dozens every year, and that it's a huge waste of their limited resources.

I'm curious about the split between machine learning and human intervention, if you could provide some more information on that?

Hey, I just wanted to thank you for posting this, used it in this composition: http://wattsquotes.tumblr.com/post/114543432379/you-are-that-vast-thing-that-you-see-far-far-off, thank you!      I have no words for the ammount of stupidity in your comment. He's made over 20 million dollars for charity, been on the BBC,CNN,WSJ etc.. He visited Liberia to raise awareness and funds for Ebola.

You literally donate directly to save the children, only reason not to is if you don't have the cash.   fuck the haters #2legit2quit   It's obviously fake but it's hilarious. It's even more hilarious watching people trying to 'share the truth', this is what Athene does, anyone that's followed him for long enough knows that. He's raised over 20 million dollars for save the children (http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8157995/k.7191/Athene_and_Gaming_for_Good.htm) You don't have to like how he does it, but you cannot deny that he has a good heart.

I would much rather walk round a fence to get my keys than spend 30 minutes taking off buble wrap and styrofoam.   Can you shed some light on how you don't get into shit for impersonating a cop? Don't some tourists go away thinking that the NYPD cops drink? I'm genuinely interested.

Welcome to reddit, where everyone makes assumptions and then judges you based on them. It's how we caught the Boston bomber.... *cough*.   Yeah it seems really dumb for him to call you something like that...people like drama way too much.   Coming from someone that's English, just don't call someone a child of a chap... or you might get punched...   From one of the top comments 'reasonable people don't like racist douchebags or what they have to say.'   Some people think it's fake on every video like this that is posted. On videos like this though, it dosen't matter, the message stays the same.   Peoples attention spans are getting lower and lower....it's the only way to get them to watch. On the other hand though I agree with you, I would much rather watch the raw footage.   https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2ze70l/if_anyone_got_some_teambiceps_drinks_from_pashas/cpi85u8  A mistake on the manufacturers part is always a lot more likely than some kid having access to a can sealer   label printer at home and putting a bloody worm in it to laugh on stream when he eats it.   Fuck...guess I shouldn't go to any stores or bars anymore before I get to know them.   Why assume that it was intentional/ill-willed? See the comments above, 99% of the time it's an accident on the part of the manufacturer, reddit fucking loves drama and it's stupid how little they examine a situation before discussing it.   I think Pascha calling him a terrorist was just a knee-jerk reaction to someone wearing a headscarf, probably a muslim/sikh or something like that. Reddit fucking loves drama, and they can ignore any and all assumptions just to eat it up.   So sexy.   Thank you for doing this! Will send you one a bit later on.   It might seem like that but we can never really know because we don't have the raw footage availible.

I thought it was common knowledge that you can find 99% of popular tv shows online for free.   What? This isn't its website, it's fan made and probably illegal.

If the online part isn't as active anymore, should I still get it?    I was wondering which of these games would be the most fun for me. I really like animal crossing, which I know is often compared to these two. The reviews are also pretty good for both games. Which do you think is better, or are they different and both good to have?

"To be honest, the way our government operates feels like a legalized version of mob tactics."   Yeah, at least the mob doesn't go out of their way to throw the stupidity of the public in their face!    Right. Why should people have to pay into the system to reap the rewards from those greedy insurance companies? They should just wait until the week before their cancer surgery before they demand their coverage. Everybody wins! Imagine a company expecting prepayment for services.    My deductible wasn't high before ObamaCare came along. This was a treasure we go to unearth after the law went into effect! People aren't exactly upgrading their insurance. It's just the opposite.

"Hurricane Sandy inflicted devastating damage on the East Coast, and Congress appropriately responded with hurricane relief. Unfortunately, cynical politicians in Washington could not resist loading up this relief bill with billions in new spending utterly unrelated to Sandy.  Emergency relief for the families who are suffering from this natural disaster should not be used as a Christmas tree for billions in unrelated spending, including projects such as Smithsonian repairs, upgrades to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration airplanes, and more funding for Head Start.  Two thirds of this spending is not remotely emergency; the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 30% of the authorized funds would be spent in the next 20 months, and over a billion dollars will be spent as late as 2021.  This bill is symptomatic of a larger problem in Washington  an addiction to spending money we do not have. The United States Senate should not be in the business of exploiting victims of natural disasters to fund pork projects that further expand our debt."

 His character/writing has definitely gotten more humorous this season. After all, he has gotten some of the best one liners on the show.   "Spitters are quitters, and you don't look like a quitter to me."  "...waving your vagina around like a loaded gun."   I think Will officially has a more violent relationship with Chiyo than Hannibal. She pushed him off a train and then shot him. And all Hannibal did was a little stabbing...    "And what do we say to the God of death?"   "Not today."   Bedelia channeling her best Arya Stark.    I think there's something wrong with all of us who are enjoying the hell out of this show. Welcome to the club :)    He has been fantastic, especially in tonight's episode. Love his deliveries of his lines (which he has so many great ones.) I was sold on Joe Anderson 1 or 2 episodes ago on the line "good as new" after his surgery. Such snark.    It was so well acted too. There was so much joy in Hannibal at seeing Will again, in the flesh, but they were so restrained with each other. They seemed almost like friends again...   They were so civil with each other that it almost blindsided me when Will pulled that knife out to stab Hannibal later. Though I guess it makes sense,    Every week the level of film making on this show astounds me. Loved the scene where Chiyo and Jack just silently seize each other up. So subtle. But spoke volumes.    It was almost a mirror of the scene when he stabbed Will at the end of season 2 as well.    Mason and Margot raising a child could be a hilarious sitcom titled Two and A Half Vergers.   Spin off anyone?    Best kaleidoscope sex scene I've ever seen.     Welp, at least they didn't noticeably blur out Botticelli's painting this time.    More sassy Bedelia tonight on Hannibal.   *"I have not marinated long enough for your tastes."*   I really expected her to get offed by Hannibal, but it looks like she's gonna pull through alright. I guess she's survived this long because she can go toe to toe with Hannibal any day. Remember that quip about his sister?       So everyone has basically been too busy tripping over themselves to try and kill Hannibal alone that they are all basically thwarting each other. Great teamwork guys.    Damn Alana gets all the best sex scenes.   NBC giving HBO and USA a run for their money.    Noooo.... must savor the remaining episodes.    Seriously right?    This is a good theory except if you go watch or read any of the interviews Bryan has given about his 6-7 season vision of Hannibal.    This trailer music.   Bryan Fuller stop fucking with us.    AGH he just sliced Jack's Achilles's tendon.    FUCK!    Yeah, Hannibal's totally marinating Will right now.    Alanna gets all the great sex scenes.    Or a hilarious sitcom... it could be called Two and A Half Vergers.    10/10 great with rice    Holy shit Will was about to stab Hannibal.    Will is not buying this shit for a minute.    I know right? Giving HBO a run for their money.    I really hope he doesn't find out about Elliot's shady activities. I really like Gideon and I don't want Elliot to have to ruin his life or otherwise set him up for something.    Uh, not to mention the bdsm with a pregnant lady. Or beating up homeless people for money.    I know right? Beating up homeless people for money, gay sex, and bdsm with a pregnant lady. DAMN USA. Giving HBO a run for their money.    Wow this was a crazy episode - beating up homeless people for money, gay sex, and bdsm with a pregnant lady. DAMN USA. Giving HBO a run for their money.    Mullholland Drive is pretty famous street in LA. It's been featured in a bunch of movies, etc.    LOL... I had the exact thought this week. They were being rather subtle about it in the previous weeks and then we just get bludgeoned over the head with it this week.   Also, that just made me remember that creepy photographer guy following Paul who was up to no good.    Haha, at least Sorkin's stuff flows well as spoken dialogue. Some of this dialogue was just painful and awkward to listen to.    Yeah those were definitely the lines where I was like just a tad too much Nic, just a tad too much.    I sort of missed Lera Lynn being in the background of the bar scenes with Ray and Frank this week.    *"It's medicine... for my eyes."*   Lol. Also HBO filling their nudity quota.    TIL that holy crap Vince Vaughn is HUGE. He towered over Taylor Kitsch in that club scene.    *"You can keep your rings on. It won't matter to me."*  That escalated quickly...  Hey, put some feelers out on this guy... I'm gonna rip out your fucking grill.    Did anyone feel like the writing was getting a little too verbose for actual spoken dialogue in this episode? I thought it was especially noticeable and jarring in this week's episode - for example, the scene where Vince Vaughn's wife is trying suck him off or a few of the lines that he says to Ray at the bar.     Loved the opening of tonight's episode, especially with the lights gradually turning bluer and bluer.   I could definitely dig more David Lynch type scenes... would add to the magic realism/trippy mysticism element of this season.     Holy crap - Vince Vaughn is HUGE.

Agreed. I think Ani is one of the best female characters on TV right now. We just don't get very many strong, damaged, imperfect female characters. And especially not ones where their sex appeal was not one of their main characteristics.    More freeway shots!    Ah... riot buck shot. That explains the no blood and aliveness.    Did he get shot with like a pellet gun or something? I feel like he should have died.    Yup it is.    Thank you - you're awesome!    Anyone have a youtube link for this promo? Or another link that I can save?    Confirming that the entire novel was covered by the show.    Mozart's Requiem.    They don't. This was Bryan Fuller's original plan but then he realized they would have to do a few filler episodes to stretch Europe out over an entire season so he opted to do condense two seasons into one. (This was prior to the scripts for this season getting written.)    Hannibal probably catches him and drugs him to keep him there.    Agreed. Pazzi's shortened development was probably a victim of the fact that Fuller folded two seasons into what we are currently watching. Hannibal was originally supposed to spend an entire season on the run in Europe. I'm sure there just wasn't enough time for everything.    Probably the result of a shortened season. They were originally supposed to spend an entire season in Europe with Hannibal on the loose, but Fuller folded the Europe season and Red Dragon into one.    That fruit knife also made the scene SO uncomfortable. It was constantly just in frame, like a warning.    I was a little miffed that Pazzi got offed so soon (since they have 2 more Europe episodes). I mean if the man has really been chasing and obsessing over Hannibal since he was a young man, and was warned by Will, and then caught up on all the gory details (between the news and Jack), and somehow thought meeting Hannibal alone on his turf was a good idea then... I just don't know man. :/    I appreciated the nod/homage to the original but I did think it was just a bit heavy handed in that scene. I remember the bowels in or bowels out line vividly from the Hannibal movie so that's where my mind instantly jumped to. Though I didn't dislike it.    The only thing that jumped out for me was when he was about to kill Pazzi... "Bowels in bowels out" was definitely in the movie/book. Though the set up of that entire scene was very similar how the 2001 Hannibal movie did it - the cart he was strapped to, the crank arm thing, etc   Also nice nod to Hannibal there when Jack removes his shoes and sneaks up behind Hannibal.    The man is a god - James Hawkinson http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370258/   He was probably still riding a bit of the adrenaline high he got from killing Pazzi too.   I mean... *"Bowels in or bowels out?"*   Ok not going to lie - I usually love the musical choices on the show... but that song in the fight was just a little too humorous/upbeat for me. Anyone else feel the same way?    Also loved the look he gave Hannibal when he sees Pazzi hanging out of the window. Just a "so tired of this shit" look.    There are means of influence other than violence *winkwink*   Oh ~~Chiyo~~ Bryan Fuller...    Mason taking sass to a whole another level this ep.   *"Spitters are quitters, and you don't strike me as a quitter."*   *"Toodle loo!"*  And Alanna is not mincing any words.   *"...selling him into torture and death."*  *"Hannibal's going to kill him you know."*   That was some straight up Game of Thrones shit with Chiyo and Will tonight.    *"Ciao, Bella."*  The image of Bella's ashes spreading like gold dust was so beautiful.   Also Jack's ring as it breaks the waters surface - shattering the smooth tension of the water with great cacophony.       There are means of influence other than violence *winkwink*    Ok not going to lie, I usually love the musical choices on the show... but that song in the fight was just a little too humorous/upbeat for me.   WTF??   Favorite place I've ever been to. Was already planning my return trip the first time I went there.     Bryan Fuller and DeLaurentiis Co. have been very candid that it's amazon's to lose.  This. Please Amazon.    That was a fantastic promo - the song in the background is so haunting.    This needs to be upvoted higher.   Felt like that second one was really to kill hope in the viewer. :/    Felt like that second one was really to kill hope in the viewer. :/    They were very pretty shots though.    Guest star?    The scene/dialogue between Ray and Ani in car was great overall.    I'd be ok with this. I'm really digging her character.    Well the guy in next week's promo did sound vague... maybe there's a chance he didn't die... or HBO just being bastards.    Bulletproof vest... maybe? 1% chance?    I thought he was too far gone to gain redemption, but was looking forward to watch him at least try.   EDIT: Apparently according to a screen cap from one of the season trailers, he's still alive. Also, in the next episode promo, the detective only refers to Ray as "one of his detective getting shot"... so I'm guessing he's still alive. Way too much unresolved story arc and wasted character development there otherwise.   Nic Pizzolatto really likes Lera Lynn huh... wonder if she'll be making an appearance every episode. Not that I'm complaining.     There seems like there's some weird sexual dysfunctions with both Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch's characters. Definitely interested in Antigone's past.     Can we take a moment to discuss how good Vince Vaughn was in this episode? Really hope he starts doing more dramatic or villianous roles in the future.      Holy crap, did they really just off Colin Farrell like that? Guess no emmy there :( Also that crow bird man was creepy as fuck.    HOLY SHIT?   The dialogue in this episode was pretty fantastic as well.  *Friendship with Hannibal is blackmail elevated to love.*  *Mutually unspoken pact to ignore the worst in one another to enjoy the best.*        One's Abigail.    I really loved the scene in tonight's episode when Will tells Alana he just wants to be alone and the camera pans over to Abigail and they share a moment together.   Too many onions. :(    I love it, but I fear it does not bode well for her long term health.    Loved his delivery of the line "good as new!"    Loved his delivery of the line "good as new!"    Let's not forget Alana's snark either.   *"I've always enjoyed the word defenestration... now I get to use it in casual conversation."*   Guess who's back? Back again? Chilton's back. Tell a friend.  But seriously, Chilton was back with a vengeance. Faced off with a loony. Snarked about Hannigram. Assembled the team. Copyrighted Hannibal the Cannibal.    I absolutely loved the new confident and vengeful Alanna.    I couldn't help but think of the Lera Lynn song from True Detective - "This is My Least Favorite Life".  Or Community's darkest timeline.  This is the darkest outcomes for everyone. Crippled. Maimed. Seperated. Broken. Dead. :(   Agreed. TIL I would have never made it as a surgeon.    On tonight's episode of Hannibal...

 I've watched that ending a dozen times and his face doesn't change at all. the only thing to give a hint is the sound of boots on pavement   so the woman says she'll go get her jacket and he's waiting there. and then we hear really loud footsteps sounding like running. did she go to the cops?  aquarion, blassreiter, gankutsuou, gad guard, kite, md geist, now and then, shigurui, slayers, xxxholic, 009   it fell less than a foot. I bet he plays soccer   how did you try to do it?   that's because it's rare   when I was in middle school our DARE officer got suspended for using cocaine. I've cheated so many drug tests during high school and i'm sure that cops get more leeway than I did. these guys must be retarded  just tape the synthetic piss it to your thigh because they make you hike up your pants to your knees, and also pee on the outside of the bottle because sometimes they smell it. and make sure to follow the directions to have it at the right temperature.     i'd give her a night. I have no standards   I really want know what she said just after the video ended. "the fact that women have been shut out of dangerous..."        I call bullshit. not that you did this, only that alcohol is solely to blame.    don't get me wrong, fuck republicans and all that. but if this senator was republican this post would be on the front page with 3000 comments   I cant wait to be outraged by the verdict that they're too young to know that stabbing someone causes death   thank you. hope you have a nice day      I live near seattle and i'm pretty sure I've had this beer before. it came in a golden or yellow 24oz can and was really good. too expensive for me though (around $3)   nope, I can't. well actually I can get one but not two   did anyone actually think that putting any kind of smoke in your lungs is healthy?   was he still on dope then? he looks pinnned   the driver is a Saudi so he'll probably beat the worker too   thank you. hope you didn't do that on my account. too bad shroom season is still a few months off   you don't happen to know what episode that was do you?   no, death for yelling and screaming the morning after new years on the train. completely justified in my opinion   "I had to punch you and knock you out because I was concerned for your health because you might have been smoking marijuana"      a handle or a fifth?   because a shaman is a great authority on western culture   a hard reset is always holding down all the buttons at once. usually fixes most problems   well, that's the job he took   no doug Stanhope?  edit: no doug stanhope   actually while I was off on the shoulder, two other crashes occurred. I think a presidential candidate was in town   but is that your way of saying giving a ticket to someone who just crashed their car is justified?   I forget, there was an unlit underpass and traffic was going smooth up until then where traffic stopped. completely my fault as I told the cop. traffic was about 50mph until the unlit overpass where traffic was stopped. my fault    "this guy is making too much sense, better downvote him rather than talk to him"   I gathered that. I also got a ticket after I was in an accident.   don't just ignore an opinion you don't agree with or so you can meet your quota without feeling bad   driver got in an accident, give him a ticket too. and you wonder why people hate cops   thanks      I hope you don't have siblings. i'm kinda in the same boat and Christmas was hell. seriously I have never wanted to kill myself more than during holidays   you know, you're probably right and I can't find where it was mentioned before. probably just a conspiracy theory or something. but i'm sure i'm read something bout it on reddit. anyways thanks for being cool about me being wrong   just look at any of the times it was posted on reddit. usually one of the highest comments explains it. how I heard it was fake was on reddit so i'm sure you can find it if you look   anyone know if this is fake like the American south episode or if it's real this time?   probably empty and in the trash   I didn't make it that far   how many dogs have UPS, FedEx and Postal worker killed combined? FUCKING ZERO. cops are pussies   my problem with feminism is that feminists never focus on actual problems but instead only stuff they think affects them. there are plenty of problems concerning women in the middle east and i'd be 100 percent behind any feminist who addresses them   "police officers don't meet the same consequences that the general public would experience in the same scenario"  how many dogs have UPS or FedEx or USPS drivers killed? zero. cops? too many to count. i was a seasonal driver helper and got bitten by a dog. didn't even report it. there should be a cowardice test along with the other ones  if a post office worker kicked a dog that was biting him, he would lose his job. but a cop shooting a golden retriever? guess   yea, never realized until now how autistic George costanza was   it's not that. just that once hard a was allowed to be sold in grocery stores liquor stores couldn't compete.    I once tried to have a civilized conversation with someone there, but it was like talking with a cop... oh   washington   not that much drinking in either of them. but thank you   I wish my state still had liquor stores. just bought a ten dollar handle of vodka that cost me almost twenty with tax. and had to wait in line with judgmental assholes. I worked an overnight shift you cunts   my buddy was the first legal weed bike dealer in Washington state. his pack consists of weed.    it's because those states have already legalized medical marijuana for awhile now. nobody is going to buy a $40 gram if they can get a $10 gram or $15 dollar (medical) of same shit.   two things I hate about this subreddit - people just can't connect two simple dots. and this post has 200 upvotes but only 10 comments. people think upvoting a post within this little subreddit of people who already smoke weed is helping the cause   it's gotta be English dubbed. and preferably action with cool fight scenes. thanks  on a side note, also looking for action anime with art style similar to afro samurai or redline   pretty much any anime with drug use fits the bill but action is a bonus. i'm looking for something where drinking is more than just a quirk like eating a lot or sleeping a lot and defines the character. or really any anime where drug use is common   4 steps on how to use a dildo   you write really well. write the next game of thrones. George r martin probably gets hella bitches         yeah I've worked UPS driver helper a couple seasons and at the start of a day when the truck is fully loaded, some packages will get stepped on to get to ones in the back. it can't be helped   is the zoo decklist he posted the best one? is there a better zoo deck   lol that's the definition of the word, retard   I was right.  http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/philadelphia/fire.htm  I won't bother to call you a retard, but why do foreigners always care so much about America anyways?   didn't benjamin franklin invent firefighters? what did the rest of the world do before, just watch shit burn?   what does getting shot feel like?   I like the art and the that title "master of disguise" sounds badass  also its just 1 health off from being a yeti but its special is really useful when I get a 8/3 bloodsail raider (which is a 2 drop)   I just got from rank 20 to 16 today with just this deck. I played a few hours today   I don't have those and I really want to enchant my first legendary, but yeah I really want a blade furry   give it a shot man   does the producer have tits?  DN episode 9 next   he broke through the autism spectrum into infrared colors   there's a weakened version of 211? that seems unbelievable because it would be more expensive to dilute the shit than change the label on the cans   the alcohol tax in washingoton state forces me to. i'm not made out of money, cutie. I drink steel reserves like a champ. i'd rather drink whiskey but I can't afford it  	72
 It's bewildering that fat people think they're in a position to give advice on positive body image or health. Dumbstruck is the natural reaction to such a fat logistician.     You definitely don't *need* to lose weight. But you would be sexier if you were a little more toned. You're like a 7 but were an 8.    6/10 - would smash but probably not call again.   This whole story makes me angry. What a piece of shit. I'd have wanted to kick his ass. Did you say something or were you left dumbstruck by the sheer ignorance of what was said to you?   I'll be on the lookout for these come next Olympics.  But still I wonder; what is a "great length"?  According to my gf it's just 7 inches.   Someone told me that whisker length was a sign of intelligence. If true than this must be a very wise cat.   Time to get another girlfriend. I'm not saying that you have to give this one up, just get another. And explain to this one that you need a person in your life to meet your sexual needs.   Ew, I bet she smelled awful. That's ironic though, a church charity organization directly facilitating gluttony.  It's sad that those nuns were put in that situation.   Like wieners.    The one time she's not sticking her tongue out her kid's picking its nose.   This is **SO** sexist!   Guys don't just want curves. And please don't confuse curves for fat - don't go trying to put on weight because you think that's what guys want. Fit is attractive. If you want to be hotter, do squats. Being fit and doing squats are the biggest things girls can do to improve their attractiveness. That said, you're pretty. 7/10   9/10 - You're very pretty but I'm sure you know that. You have really nice lips and eyes.   That sounds like a quote from Bender Bendington Rodriguez.    It is nice having an active and diverse sex life.   Skewed in my favor.   Basic ass bitches.   My bad dude. Work out more. You'll appreciate looking young when you're older.   Brooklyn. And they will.   10/10 - out of my league    You look like a lesbian.     Trying to help my longest friend be anything other than a bigoted scumbag.  If someone doesn't want to change than my help is useless. Dude will probably be homeless in five years but had every change to succeed.  As a white male with two middle/upper middle class parents, free school optional - he's always the 'victim'.   8/10 You're very pretty.  I love your cheeks. The ones on your face. You'd be hotter if you did some squats.    Your face looks asymmetrical.  Your nose and your cheek bones specifically. Maybe it's the angle? Right now you look like a 4.5.  Would not smash.   My lowest recorded was something like 10 pounds 4 ounces.   Yes. It's also sort of judgmental if you think about it. Like, I'm Ok with hookups, but you're not? What, are you too good for casually enjoying some of the better things in life? Are you judging me because I'm more promiscuous. Either way it's bs; girls will always hookup.  That's like some dude selling a car on craiglist saying "no lowballs." Show up with cash in hand and you're taking that car for way less.   Haha yeah, she lost me when she started talking about her 'old soul' and the played out museums in NYC. + no hookups. No hookups = get off Tinder; this isn't an old soul mate search engine.   6.3/10. You're not that pretty but you're good at finding flattering angles. You also wear way too much makeup. I dare you to post a no makeup smiling.      Based on other things I've seen on this site I can conclude two things from this picture: the driver has sex with his trucks' tail pipe and is hung like a baby.   How did you fry this?   Spring rolls are not sushi.   Let me guess; you're a New Jersian?   Sure you were.  	34
 This was one of my favorite features... why did this get removed?   Or a heating system that is 50 years old, and got duped by Integrys/Spark Energy.   I honestly can't tell if you are sarcastic or not.   I live in West Rogers Park and pay $1330 for a 3 bedroom. It's not luxury or fancy either. My gas bill is through the roof in the winter - got over $300 bill in December.   Sounds about right. My 3 bedroom apartment in West Rogers Park costs me about 33% of my wages (after taxes). And it's not a very nice building either. And I make $75k a year and I'm having budget issues - it's rough.    Despite dumping in nearly half a billion dollars, the public is not going to see any return on that investment until the second, or possibly third Superbowl they host, and that could be decades away.  Every Sunday people come from out of town to go to the stadium. Not to mention playoffs - and taxes generated all season long from higher ticket prices (and more seats than before). Not saying it is justified, but the money *does* come back quite quickly.   It's also a function of "don't give us money - and we will go to another city". In that case the city would lose millions without the stadium there.   Saying that you will use force - without actually using it - is diplomacy. What Obama has done is naive and delusional diplomacy to the extreme where it not diplomacy - it is stupidity.      Amex Platinum Business is the card I am using.      Wouldn't have to go to war if the middle east thought he had a backbone of any kind. Not sure if war is the answer, but this 'deal' is a joke.    I live in Chicago. I think I'm ok. NY on the other hand...   "it only cost $.24 cents a mile"  That's nice, except that it's traveling around 8-9 miles per second, so that is a very misleading statistic. It costs $7,500 per hour, or $173,000 grand per day. Also, those costs continue.   Pictures of Pluto are cool, but roughly $100 million per year? There are also lots of other space programs. This is just one of many. The question if we should be spending this money. Also not sure why comparing this to a Vikings stadium built for a private company at no cost to the taxpayer has any comparison to a space program.   RemindMe! 5 years "Too soon to celebrate"   Let's talk in five years when we see the results of this 'deal'.   RemindMe! 5 years "Too soon to celebrate"   Jewish Liberals don't like Bibi? This is not news.   "The only argument you can make against the verification and inspection mechanism that weve put forward is that Iran is so intent on obtaining a nuclear weapon that no inspection regime and no verification mechanism would be sufficient because theyd find some way to get around it because theyre untrustworthy.  This. That is the entire point. They are not even remotely trustworthy. It's a grave mistake that we will all pay for. And the fact that Obama legislated this doesn't matter. If a Republican suggested something similar, I would be as equally opposed.   I would have the same reaction if some Republican made the same 'deal' with Iran. Has nothing to do with Obama.    I would have thought still Obama would be worse. Honestly, that has proven to be true, especially with this Iran deal.   This makes the president look good? News to me.   Who the hell is complaining about super? Really? How?   Also check this list if you can't remember what a genocide is:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll   Also ironic that there has been many *actual* genocides in Africa since the 'genocide' that you are referring to.   And what year did this genocide take place exactly? You do know what a genocide is, right?   Ironically, America is more guilty of genocide of Native Americans than Israel is of Palestinians.    Ah here we go. You've gone all full retard.   Oh I see so we should get rid of all **Jews** from ALL political influence. Sounds familiar...    So we should eliminate anyone who has any religious faith whatsoever from office? Do you *want* to piss off Republicans and moderate Democrats?   comic books. I'm asking about video games.   Surprise!   not.   MK? Are you joking? I hope you are.   Why the hell would someone downvote this?   Great stuff dude   i could care less about VP, so that wasn't a factor for me. They don't really do anything. How useful is Biden? Would have voted for her over Obama though.   Anyway I would't say I agree with all Republicans (many of them are idiots, especially Trump), but I wouldn't call myself a moderate. I agree with Republicans in principle frequently, but I find they don't properly articulate their points, and generally provide shitty solutions. But the ideas of liberals - I disagree with *both* the implementation of their 'solutions', and with most of their fundamental principles.   Seriously does anyone think this movie is not going to suck tremendous ass? C'mon. We all know better. It will be horrendous.   EDIT: For those downvoting me: provide examples of video game to movie successes.    Compensation is best in the country - for now.   I vote for Republicans, and I don't understand this at all. The guy is a whack.   Yea except if you spend $70 billion on these universities, they will turn around and raise tuition - and it will be $140 billion in 5 years.   It's been the Democrat/Republican way, for basically forever.   That's an easy way to dismiss my point. Good job.  Actually to be clear, you weren't being a troll. It's a misuse of the word. I think you were wrong, but that doesn't make you a troll. There is a big difference. A troll just says things to piss people off. I know you weren't doing that    At any rate, the alternative of smart kids being trapped by their financial circumstances, what we have today, is immoral and a national disgrace. Just my two cents.  The real problem is the cost of tuition. It rises 5% a year, regardless of the return on investment (which has gone down), quality of education (better facilities =/= better education). The cost is the real core problem, and this does not address that issue. Bernie offers short-sighted fixes to symptoms, instead of deep fixes of underlying issues.    So what is to prevent schools from raisin tuition?   What I would like:  1. Force all public colleges to reduce current tuition cost by 30%. period. Federal law - you cannot charge more than that.  2. Public colleges can no longer raise tuition for at least 10 years. After that, at a maximum of the current rate of inflation.  3. THEN the federal government will pay 2/3rd, and states will pay 1/3rd  Without 1 and 2, the system will be completely screwed.  And lets not forget you still need to find $70 billion somewhere.   Well maybe your comment "His opinion doesn't matter" is really a stupid statement. It's just as relevant as his opinion on income inequality (which by the way, most people on this subreddit agree he will likely not be able to get what he wants done anyway). If someone said, "This Republican's opinion on gay marriage doesn't matter" - I'm sure you would find a way to explain why it *does* matter, and how it's crucial, and you can never vote for a candidate who doesn't approve gay marriage.  So in short, it's hypocritical, and intellectually dishonest.   1 vote for Japanese Kai   Where is that quote? I don't remember it, so I'm thinking I didn't watch that part in English Dub   I hate #2 people   Sounds like multiverse   Vegeta eating a little of his pride, and deciding to train with Goku - then obviously there is a lot of fighting between the two. Goku wants to rest, and Vegeta wants to keep training. Eventually Vegeta gives in and realized how much better he trains when he rests properly. Vegeta proceeds to surpass Goku.   The fact that 21 was 6 years ago for me   Which means that drop shots nowadays bounce much less than back in the day.   So this has nothing to do with the context of the post - just that pic?   I don't get it.   Make that 4k    Vengeance is pointless and cruel  It's not - and vengeance isn't the point. The only problem is we don't know for sure they are guilty - hence the innocent people put to death. For such serious crimes, there is no rehabilitation at all. So what's the point? There is a point of no return for such people - again, the only problem is practically being able to prove without a doubt that the person is guilty - which takes years, and isn't even 100% accurate.   Should he retire if he wins this one? I think so.   Cool thanks   I don't think it's crazy to think he might not have been born in this country.   I think it's crazy to keep talking about it, because you'll never be able to prove it, and it makes you look really, really petty and pathetic.   In BoG, Goku has mad that he only gained the power of SSJG because of other people. He hated that it had to come from others, and not from himself.  So what happened to that in Resurrection 'F'? I haven't seen it, except for the leaked footage where both he and Vegeta fight Freiza as SSJGSJJ (whatever you call it, the blue hair).   So did I miss something? Or did Goku just stop caring that the power didn't come from him?  Also random question about Buu saga - **why didn't Babidi use Dabura's energy to help revive Buu??**   So I was looking at LIQD just now, and on my Robinhood app, it said the price was $.20, on Yahoo Finance it said $.23. That's a big difference. Which one would be more accurate?   It's poor design, with old technology, with unionized workers, from companies making deals with corrupt politicians...   Ever heard of a poisonous apple? Also I didn't say which country was the apple...   I was being ironic   That was exactly my point.   I think it's time that we ban the United States of America flag. It represents racism and oppression of Native Americans. We should be ashamed to have the flag as our national symbol.   Actually you would still want to file if you have kids, or if you went to school. You will get money back.   Your McLaren example is crazy if you are talking about the F1. No one has 2x of them. No one.   One of the biggest bull markets in our history, and low unemployment/weak recovery. Income inequality didn't cause those things - it is the result of those things.   Why the F should the state be responsible for bailing us out? It's my opinion that every single resident of Illinois needs to feel the pain of our mistakes. *Every single person*.   Or maybe they are simply unhappy with the current Democrats in power, regardless of who is running with a (D) next to their name. Remember all the Democrats running from Obama before the midterm elections?   Tell me about it   What Republican candidate thinks the unemployment rate tells the whole story??? This is what Republicans have been saying for years. Seriously.    No child goes hungry. It's called SNAP.    Yea I really hate the comparisons to a country that is so vastly different to the point where a comparison is like comparing an apple to a Toyota.   Has anyone considered that income inequality is a symptom, not a cause?    This is on top of many other expenditures, including the red line improvement, which was $1 billion. It adds up. It's the mentality - every $50 million we spend - "Oh, it's just a little bit". That's how you go bankrupt. That's how people end up with thousands in credit card debt they cannot pay. You spend a little here, a little there, and all of a sudden you owe $10,000 that you cannot pay back.   Of course, pensions are killer. Not taking away from that.   It's not unusable and 'crumbling'. It's just not efficient - and you know what - if we are so damn broke, then we should consider closing the purple line express if its going to cost so damn much. Priorities.    Yea it's absolutely ridiculous. $200 million? Dear lord. Why is there even a Jarvis stop? It's 3 blocks from Howard. I was once looking for parking for the Howard station, and I realized I was at the Jarvis station.    What the hell happened on May 26th? Subreddit of the day/week or something?   SWEET   That's my point. We are broke. Yet we throw $30 million at a project that saves commuters 5 minutes? This is why we are so damn broke. No one can make responsible decisions.   Used to ride that purple line, and for an 'express' - damn it was slow. But $30 million? Do we even have that money? That's a buttload of money to save commuters 5-7 minutes...   Wasn't this exact same thing posted yesterday?   I would rather have slightly higher-than-normal voices than the terrible and corny voice acting in English.    Huge upset the other day with Gasquet beating Wawrinka, but I can barely find anything about it. Granted this was two days ago, I should be able to find something easy. Scrolled down and clicked on a link only to find the score sheet. All this redesign of the websites just for the sake of trying to be trendy is all at the expensive of good user experience. /r/webdev it's your fault.   I hate this comment karma piggybacking shit. Just make a new post. There is no reason for this to be under another comment. If you are responding directly to the OP, it should be a new comment - not a response to an existing comment. Karma sluts.   Yes Python or C, or C++ should be the first language. NOT Java.      My first two CS classes ever were both Java. I had no idea what I was doing. It was pretty hard. Got a B, but didn't really learn shit.   Self driving cars   This. It's the worst. You tell a story and some ass goes, "Oh yeah? I can do you one better!". Like seriously dude, I didn't know we were at the 7th annual pissing contest. I'm just trying to chat you douche.   You sure about that? Let's check back in 5 years. Also see Greece, France, Spain  RemindMe! 5 years "Other countries seem to be just fine with 'better' wealth distribution"   I think you don't know what you are talking about.   Significantly higher taxes. Like 30% higher than they are now.   They don't contrast each other now??   Sure the future - but not today. He has no chance of winning. None. Get over it Reddit. It's NOT going to happen.   I think people underestimate the recoil of moderate liberals, moderate Republicans, and of course hard-right Republicans. Moderate liberals are much more likely to vote for someone to the right of Obama, not someone vastly to the Left.   What a surprise. Those who receive government benefits don't want to give up government benefits...   Those lenders are filthy pigs.   No   And? So then its OK to have these criminals? Don't marginalize, it doesn't prove your point.   Today, Clinton is pro-Israel. Tomorrow, if the polls show that it is unfavorable to do so - she is anti-Israel.   Yes it's also that colleges have realized the students will take on any debt (which means private as well) in order to get a loan. They keep raising tuition *because they can*. The only thing that can really stop tuition rise is mandated tuition levels, and/or a paradigm shift in how much we value college.      Point me to a poll that actually shows this, and I'll consider your baseless claim to be partly true.    Hillary wants to be President of the United States and Bernie Sanders wants to serve the country.  This. Nailed it!   two extreme examples, I hardly think doctors are 'living in fear'.    This violates rules of /r/askreddit. This does not belong here. Please remove.   Since when does it work everywhere? Spain? Greece? France?   I noticed that. I was waiting for it.   I love the opening. Animations are great, and the music is fantastic. I don't know what it is saying, but I like it. Hopefully it won't be shit when done in English.   Haha ya man   mass adoption of fully electric cars is 10-20 years away at best - and it's very possible that it will never even come close to full adoption at all.   Why don't you quote the times to prove your point? you haven't quoted shit. Oh the one thing you quote, is what? A quote from Leonhardt saying they are 'bias towards work'? Like that means anything in our discussion?   Fox could say, "Were not biased. We just care about American values". But we all know they are biased as hell.  Here is evidence of their anti-israel bias - something you only see from liberals:  [here](http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/11/14/new-york-times-anti-israel-bias-confirmed-in-numbers-says-watchdog/)  And that ridiculous story that even Jon Stewart called out the NYT for - [About Rubio's traffic tickets, and large windows](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/jon-stewart-savages-new-york-times-reporting-on-marco-rubios-finances-118867.html)  From Arthur Brisbane, admitting NYT is progressive [Across the papers many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism  for lack of a better term  that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/success-and-risk-as-the-times-transforms.html?pagewanted=all)  "As a result, developments like the Occupy movement and gay marriage seem almost to erupt in The Times, overloved and undermanaged, more like causes than news subjects."  From an editor of the Times. I think I've proved my point.    Quite stupid to be comparing the 99% vs. the 1%, and then to compare absolute values instead of percentages.   Say that the bottom 20% income earners have their tax increased by 1.5%, while the top 20% have their tax decreased by 1.9%. That is more accurate.   Well you have given no evidence that it is NOT liberal, whereas I have given you evidence that it IS liberal. And considering they themselves admit they are liberal - honestly I'm not sure if you are trolling or not. No one pretends like they are moderate. CNN at least tries. NYT does not.  You're telling me the newspaper that has Krugman as an author is unbiased? Be real. Be intellectually honest.   No but really, what shred of evidence do you have besides "NYT is pro-American" (which doesn't prove your point, nor is it a fact, it's just a purely subjective opinion with no basis). At this point, I'm treating you like a troll.  	113
 I agree. So maybe more real journalists should do more to hold Fox accountable. Is there any kind of codified statement of ethics or set of professional standards for the profession?      The links are documentation, comparable  to footnotes in an academic paper. Do you really not see the difference?         All are white.   Nope --all white.   Actually the article states all three are white.   I'm not seeing how this content is re hosted. It's reported.                     So when did the Democrats propose something like this?               Did you read the article?            In Chicago, election judges got deceptive rob ovals that resulted in many of them not showing up at the polls, resulting in voting delays? Republicans were the culprits.            You're probably right. I'm still glad they're in, though.               So when people cast a vote for Republicans, what were they voting for?            I think one interesting thing about this article is Rich's warning that Hillary Clinton will need to stand for something or she could meet the same fate as 2014's Democrats.            I think you're fine in the 70s. Upper 120s is probably a bit high for a non-diabetic.    I had two aunts who lost a lot of weight with TOPS back in the 1960s -- and they kept it off! I didn't know the organization still existed! That's great!   There are certainly exceptions to this "suggestion." We always regarded our youngest, who was our third, as a gift for the entire family. He brought joy to the whole family. His older siblings adored him, and still do, as do we.    The problem is that the yahoo states elect yahoos to Congress who then obstruct legislation that the country as a whole would benefit from. They drag everyone down.                     It sounds really good. Thanks.                  I don't believe prions are affected by heat.    Congratulations, great job!    I know! Me too!   This is such a helpful thread.   Such good advice, mlloyd. It is going to become my mantra.               Yeah they can be inconvenient. Maybe she could set it to vibrate rather than beep. If she calibrates it though, and is pretty confident in the readings, she can probably do fewer finger prick tests during the day. You do have to confirm with a fingerprick before giving an insulin dose though.  Good luck to you both.      The minimed insertion sets will work with animus pumps. If you're thin the angled silhouettes can work pretty well. See if your doctor has a couple of samples or if you can get a few samples from minimed, just to try them.             Dexcom is a brand of continuous glucose monitor: http://dexcom.com/  A sensor has to be inserted like a pump site, and the sensor sends a glucose reading from the interstitial fluid between your cells, every couple of minutes. You carry around a receiver with a screen that shows you the info. My son has found it helps with control but it is a hassle to deal with a second site, and the receiver is another thing to lug around, so he only uses it sporadically. Plus you have to confirm with a finger stick before doing a correction with insulin, because the interstitial readings can be less accurate than the blood readings you get with a conventional bg monitor with finger sticks. But it is a great tool to fine tune control because it also shows trends, like if you are dropping or rising quickly.  He has used the front part of his thighs. And he uses the angled insertion set, the minimed silhouette, so he can get a shallower insertion. He is very thin, and like I said, he has run into too-quick insulin uptake issues there, so his go-to is still butt/hip.   Hope this helps.   He uses a minimed silhouette angled insertion kit and yes, he does use the inserter. When he was a kid I used to do the insertions for him and I agree, the way that thing shoots in there looks pretty violent. But he has always used the inserter and still does.   When I say hip, I really mean upper butt, towards the outside. So like under the outer side of a back jean pocket. Not on the actual side of the hip, where the pants side seam would be. I would say upper outer quadrant of his butt is probably his most used site over the years. He also uses his thighs, but gets quicker uptake of insulin there so he can potentially have more low bgs with thighs. He uses stomach only for his Dexcom cgm at this point. I know some people use upper outer arm for pump sites, but he does not like the idea of the tubing going up through his shirt.   Hope this helps.    They are not going to regenerate the pancreas beta cells, they are going to transplant new ones in.   They are going to encapsulate the beta cells in a substance that allows the insulin out but protects them from the autoimmune attack.    Same equipment my 23 year old son uses. Agree that it is easier to be in good control now, and this breakthrough makes it easier to be hopeful for the future.    Is your gf using the continuous monitor? That can be helpful if your gf doesn't like to do the finger pricks too much.   NoFussFred, sorry to hear about your diagnosis, I know it is overwhelming at first. There are many tools that can help you keep good control (pumps, continuous glucose monitors) but this breakthrough can also give you real hope of a future where you are making your own insulin again. Be hopeful.   My son's been using butt/hip sites for years.    Hang in there. As the parent of a T1 23-year-old son. I'm excited and hopeful we'll see this in 5-8 years.    Big pharma is not going to shut this down. Doug Melton of Harvard has two T1 kids and is determined to find a cure.    This is not going to happen. The head researcher of the Harvard lab, Doug Melton, has two T1 kids and this is personal for him.   Agreed. Not to mention the insurance companies would save the cost of occasional ER visits and of treating potential complications down the line.    JDRF is also a funder for Dr. Melton's research at Harvard.    Maybe not quite that quick but it will happen. I'd say five years, maybe a bit longer but not much. Dr. Melton of Harvard has two diabetic kids and this is personal for him. I'm sure this will be developed as quickly as is possible, but they have to make sure everything is safe. Hang in there.   While it may be expensive, think of the money saved on treating all the complications type 1 diabetics can be subject to later in life, which can include amputations, kidney and heart disease, nerve damage. And treating type 1 diabetes on a daily basis is expensive too -- insulin, insulin pumps, blood glucose meters, meter test stripsSo even if this treatment is expensive, it can save money in the long run.    I believe data has been shared. These are two teams using two different approaches. The scientific community will see which approach is better.   I doubt that they wonder about that. Just because new ailments appear is no reason not to cure the diseases that people are currently suffering from.    My son is 23 and he was diagnosed at age 10. Hang in there, this is potentially very very good news.    This is a potential cure for type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease and usually strikes children -- type 1 is not brought on by sweets, or your diet or exercise level. The type of diabetes that you get from improper diet, too many sweets, and not enough exercise is type 2 diabetes. This breakthrough will only cure type 1, not type 2.    That's okay, 5 more years is not that long to wait to make sure it's safe.    Hang in there. This is a very promising breakthrough.   Here is another account of the Harvard research:  http://scienceblog.com/74759/harvard-scientists-claim-giant-leap-diabetes-via-stem-cell-production/#q4EGcEtqiPchk5dl.97   Yes, as the parent of a T1 son I agree, this is potentially huge.    Be hopeful. My 23-year-old son has been T1 for 12 years, and this is the first truly hopeful development I've seen. Doug Melton of Harvard has two T1 kids and has devoted the last 15 years to this.   That's great! Congratulations!   Gosh, you look great! Congrats!   Congratulations, that is fantastic! I can't wait for that feeling!   I've been there, though I've never lost that much to begin with. When I signed up for this subreddit, I saw that someone had suggested reading Brain Over Binge by Kathryn Hansen. I found it interesting and it has been helpful to me, I think. I definitely have emotional triggers for eating and this book kind of released me from feeling that I had to solve every potential psychological issue in order to lose weight. The book spells out how many eating issues are habit, and that kind of took the power of that habit away for me, or at least enabled me to see it in less daunting terms and as a more manageable thing that I could control.  That said, I also agree with the practical advice others have given here to track calories. My Fitness Pal will break down what you eat into percentages of carb, protein and fat. That's been helpful to me because I found that upping the percentage of protein and even fat as a percentage of my daily calories has helped me feel fuller longer. Some people have had success with keto too, though I am not going that route. To me, logging is a good way to keep the feeling that, while I may fall off the wagon sometimes and be less than perfect, I can keep control and meet my goal at the next meal, or the next day.   Lastly, maybe you need to up your caloric intake somewhat from 1500 for awhile. That may be contributing to your going off the diet after 3-4 days.    How did you lose the first 65 pounds? That is so impressive!   This is such good advice. As a beginner who has found it hard to stay on track, I would say that logging is key to climbing back on that wagon when I've fallen off. Keep on loggin!   You are cute in both pix but look so much fitter now! Congrats and thank you for sharing your inspiring example!   Great job! The up and down pattern you describe is all too familiar to me. I'm looking forward to the 10 pound flair! You are within ten of your goal! Yay!   You look fantastic! Congratulations, I'm inspired by your example!   Yeah we will!      I know exactly what you're talking about, alexsjaan. I'd love to see sz 10 again! I've been an 18W at points in the past, currently at 16W. I think just getting into the regular Misses sizes from the plus sizes will be a huge milestone for me.    omg, that is so great! I'm so excited for you! And the shopping spree you're going to have, just four pounds from now!   Congratulations! That is wonderful!      Thank you! The encouragment helps!   60 yo female, 5'6", OW 202, GW 150, CW 197. I was almost afraid to post this because I'm afraid I'll slip back. But putting it out here may be one way to help ensure that that doesn't happen. Another way is to keep reading all the inspiring stories here. Thanks to all for sharing their experiences and helping me stay motivated. I'm using MFP and trying to do the treadmill at least five times a week.  It does feel really good to be under 200 for the first time in years.   That's interesting and helpful. Thanks, and sorry to hear about your illness!         Do the gallstones have anything to do with rapid weight loss? I had a friend go on a pretty stringent diet a few years ago and she got them.   Pretty both before and after, but I'm sure you feel much more fit and healthy at your current weight-you are so petite! Congrats!   Did you read the article? The word "punishes" is being used figuratively. Let me paraphrase it for you: "False Confidence Can Lead to Problems When Dealing With Ebola." Is that easier to understand?         Congrats -- talk about a fast start! Thanks for sharing your story.   Congratulations! That is just great! Good luck with your surgery, it will be so much better to go into it having lost the weight! You're an inspiration!   I agree, you are very pretty in your before pix too! And now, you look fantastic! Great job, you are an inspiration!                                         	136
 Thanks for sharing and I can imagine that! Especially when you have overcome all the difficulties on your way with your friends and see the most beautiful scenery on the top of the mountain!    So you are a mother-to-be? Or father-to-be? He must be a very cute little baby. Yeah,  a newly born baby will absolutely bring happiness to a family.    You may have one moment that you feel really happy and satisfied. Come and tell us.    Eating with your nose ;)   How are you?  I'm fine.  But sometimes you are not fine and not happy. It's OK to keep it a secret and don't let others know your bad mood but you should try to get yourself out of it.    I think this cake will be good to your brother but I don't think I would eat it. It''s a little bit horrible. How did you get the idea of the design of this cake?    Angel in City of Angels. When Cage made up his mind to give up being an angel and fall down to embrace the land and his lover.    I haven't got such a problem. I think when you are trying to recommend a movie to someone you first should make sure that he /she has the same interests as you so that they will enjoy the movie you ask them to watch. Otherwise, you may find them don't care much as you.    Definitely!!They end up movies with this kind of scenes, saying that it is the way that they leave a space for us to imagine what will happen next and it makes many scenes followed possible. They think it as good while I think it is very disturbing and annoying.    Final Destination.  When somebody is going to die and when they actually are dead. I can't watch it alone!   A great person died. It's a pity for all of us.    The characters in the animated movie are designed but not real. Most of them can be divided into two groups, one is the optimistic and kind people while the other is the pessimistic and evil people. we can find people to act as evil one easily but to find out who is qualified to play the optimistic and kind one will be a big problem.    Word of mouth effect, which make this movie become more popular.       Just keep going and I believe you can!:)  	15

 also i need a name for the disputed territory because i think im going to make it a country   btw which one is the french name, you're right on all the others   yeah maybe you could feel vibrations from things behind you and around corners   you'd be correct, i love that show   my idea is that the other countries took the land from chaiardi after they did something and nobody can agree on who owns what land   thats a good point about the map perspective but my idea is that chaiardi did something to the other countries took land from them and none of the agree on who owns what land   my thoughts were that the disputed land belonged to chaiardi but then they did something and the other countries took their land, but none of them can agree on what land is whos  im also not very good at naming things   because im not good at borders, or naming things for that matter   as in what? its mean just to be a country border map      Thats the point, its just a county outline map, no trees or mountains on it.   I guess to me that area looks kinda dull, and id like to liven it up a bit.   It's all about the TECHNIQUE.

  They're not going to play nice with Bernie Sanders just because he hasn't been on their radar.  True, but if some Republican idiots try launching anti-Semitic attacks against Bernie Sanders, then this will probably blow up in their own faces! :)   The problem with many Americans' view of socialism is that they tend to confuse socialism with Communism whereas in reality a good image of socialism (with some capitalism as well) would be the Scandinavian countries.   So you were both of these things together during autumn?  Also, I strongly apologize if I sound creepy. In addition to this, though, Yes, I *do* have a fetish for this and had such a fetish as long as I had a sex drive (since age 9 or 10). Indeed, I remember wearing such clothes myself a couple of times when I was 9 or 10 (and before I unfortunately had to deal with body hair and facial hair due to the effects of puberty along with my poor genetics).   Also, for the record, my fetish in regards to this also applies to *my own* body.   Yes, I do have a fetish for this, but I am certainly not interested in any pics of this.   Ausfags?   No, but some of them wear this anyway. :)         OK.       I feel like if I wear short shorts with knee high socks I'm in a life crisis.  Why exactly, though?   Not your style, eh?   Together.       I never wear knee socks at all.  Any particular reason for this?   Together.   I'm sorry if my curiosity in regards to this offended you.   Considering how narrowly Hillary Clinton lost, though, even a little boost might have been enough for her to win the 2008 Democratic nomination.   I am simply curious about this.            Also, off-topic, but out of curiosity, do you think that Hillary Clinton would have won the Democratic nomination and the U.S. Presidency in 2008 without an Iraq War?   Would the Iraqi Shiites have been willing to rebel against Saddam after he slaughtered them for doing this in 1991, though? After all, if I recall, in real life, the Iraqi Shiites were hesitant to rebel against Saddam even in 2003, *after* a massive number of U.S. troops was already in Iraq.       and the Arab Spring might not have happened.  Why not, though?   Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?   How exactly would European imperialism in the late 19th and 20th centuries look without a unified Germany? Which countries would acquire the colonies which Germany acquired in real life? Also, how exactly, if at all, would the lack of a united Germany have affected the colonial and imperial policies of other European countries? (For instance, I have previously heard that France might have pursued more aggressive imperialist policies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to its defeat by Prussia in 1871 and its resulting loss of Alsace-Lorraine; however, I am unsure as to exactly how accurate this information is.)  A good way to prevent (or at least, delay for a very long time) German unification might be to have Austria defeat Prussia at Koniggratz (Sadowa) and win the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.  Thoughts on this?   If you don't mind me asking, are you yourself a Kiwi?   Yeah, Trump isn't someone who is particularly qualified to talk about John McCain's Vietnam War service.  As for what happened to Kerry, I still find it amazing that the Republicans managed to portray Kerry as the traitor and Bush as the war hero whereas the opposite is much closer to the truth.   Yes, I certainly agree with that.  Of course, I do find it interesting that McCain graduated in the *bottom 1%* of his class at the military academy that he went to.   Donald Trump is a drama queen and nothing more. Enough said.   It *is* heroic, though. :)   Fucking Commies! :(   Hallelujah! That scary Mussolini face is no longer there! :)      How exactly would European imperialism in the late 19th and 20th centuries look without a unified Germany?

A good way to prevent (or at least, delay for a very long time) German unification might be to have Austria defeat Prussia at Koniggratz (Sadowa) and win the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.  Thoughts on this?   Oh, and to clarify--I am certainly not endorsing any ethnic cleansing here.    Possibly on both, though again with some reservations. A shorter out flanking maneuver would have brought the Israelis into direct confrontation with Egyptians dug into Gaza, meaning higher casualties and slower progress. Much easier to attack where the enemy is weak and from a direction they don't expect you to take.  Good point; however, this also made it politically harder for Israel to capture the Gaza Strip due to British pressure.   Regarding hypothetical expulsion of 200,000 hypothetically conquered civilians - yes, it could probably be done. The cost to Israel's international reputation would have been very high even then. The UN had already started to call for the return of Palestinian refugees to Israeli lands. Israel today can flout international public opinion due to its comfortable regional military superiority and close ties to the US. That was not the case in 1949. I doubt Britain would have taken kindly to their Egyptian allies being flooded with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Note also that Israel claimed that many if not most Palestinians left willingly; hard to argue that while simultaneously ethnically cleansing an area as large and dense as Gaza.  Did most people in the West in 1949 in real life actually believe Israel's claim that most of these Palestinians left willingly, though? Also, if the West was able to tolerate Israel's expulsion of Ashkelon's and Lod's/Lydda's Arab population, then why exactly would the West (other than perhaps Great Britain) be unwilling to likewise tolerate Israel's expulsion of the Gaza Strip's Arab population?

A good way to prevent (or at least, delay for a very long time) German unification might be to have Austria defeat Prussia at Koniggratz (Sadowa) and win the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.  Thoughts on this?   Yep. :)   Jambi?   Such as a Hindu enjoying something made from cow meat.  Any thoughts on this?   Where exactly?   I remember that clip! :)   Yep. :)   Thanks. ;)   Yep. :)    Two points to make here. One is that the bulk of the Egyptian Army's expedition force was concentrated in Gaza, from which they had tried and failed to conquer Israel's coastal plain. Israel's counterattack, Operation Horev, aimed at encircling and trapping the Egyptian Army in the Gaza Strip via invading Sinai. Israeli forces reached El Arish on the northern Sinai coast before heavy political pressure from Britain, which had a treaty agreement to defend Egypt from invasion and already was engaged in air skirmishes with the IDF, forced an Armistice. It's pretty safe to think of Egypt as a client state of the British Empire during this period and indeed up to the Suez Crisis.   Without foreign intervention, it's quite probable that the Egyptian Army would have been trapped and forced to surrender.  I've got a question, though--could Israel have encircled these Egyptian Armies *without* ever entering Egypt itself, though?   Point 2 to keep in mind is that the Gaza Strip at the time was already home to 200,000 Arabs, many of whom were refugees from areas already taken by the IDF. Conquering them would have more than doubled the Arab population of the new state of Israel, which in 1949 was approximately 160,000. Many of these refugees would have ubdoubtedly wanted to return to their old homes in the rest of what became Israel. This is perhaps a moot point since Israel never did conquer Gaza but is something to keep in mind when you contemplate how fortunate Israel might have been to take Gaza.  Couldn't Israel have simply expelled most or all of these Arabs if/after it would have conquered the Gaza Strip, though?    One of the potential successes of the Iraq war (though it is hard to say that much about it was a success, especially in retrospect) was the strong message it sent to the rest of the ME that there'd be little to no tolerance for this type of weapons deevelopment. Literally, this is probably the only thing that even moderates would acknowledge as potentially beneficial.  Yes, I agree with this (though, interestingly enough, North Korea learned the opposite lesson even back in 2003).   Whether or not NATO would have been willing... that is another question. I am guessing that if the right information were ot have come to light we could contemplate massive embargoes and a tactical bombing campaign, and with the way that the Libyan regime collapsed recently one could imagine that Ghaddafi was aware that he might have been on unstable ground.  Couldn't NATO tactical bombing of Libya have resulted in Libyan retaliation against NATO member countries in Europe, though?   NATO would probably have been on to do just enough to insure a massive mess for Ghaddafi, and I am guessing that combined US   European intelligence would have been enough to give the grounds and certainty to execute.  To give the ground and certainty to execute what exactly?   Really? Frankly, this image and link appear to work for me.   Ya. ;)         Is this post of mine now restored?   Actually, I myself have also previously heard about this being the reason as to why exactly North Korea was included in the Axis of Evil. Frankly, this makes sense considering that Bush didn't want to piss off Muslims too much, especially after he referred to the "War on Terror" as being a "crusade" several days after 9/11 (and thus offended a lot of Muslims).  Of course, Bush could have replaced Iran with Libya on his Axis of Evil.         Yep. ;)   You're welcome! ;)    Well again, it's one of those issues where it would solve itself before it was a problem.  Not if Libya would have secretly bought some Iranian and/or North Korean missiles, though.   If Libya started developing missiles that could reach Europe, a conflict would have flared during that ramp-up process.  Not if Libya already has these missiles, though.   But if they did have that ability, I still think they would have gone ahead and taken the chance that the command and control chaos caused by the revolution would have made long range retaliation less likely.  Just how much of a command and control chaos did Libya experience as a result of its 2011 civil war, though?   I think so. Libya has been one of the closest watched antagonists to the U.S. for decades. Gaddafi was the OG of state-sponsored terrorism.  And yet the U.S. was apparently surprised at how much nuclear equipment Libya had in 2003.   But we did learn it, didn't we.  That was only *after* Gaddafi allowed the U.S. and U.K. to visit Libya's nuclear sites in 2003, though.   Well we bombed him anyways after started warming up to us and didn't threaten us with WMD's  Yes, but we didn't have to worry about Libyan retaliation in real life.   so again, hypothetical WMD's would only have made us pull the trigger faster.  Maybe ... maybe. In this scenario, though, there would have actually been a risk of Libyan retaliation (unlike in real life). Thus, this is something that should be considered here as well.   Maybe? It still seems like acquiring heavy arms is hard to get away with.  Maybe, but then again, what exactly do countries such as North Korea have to lose by doing this? After all, they are already sanctioned like crazy and their economy is already in the toilet.   Yeah--it's kind of sad that even if one was born in 1895 and lived to be a supercentenarian, one would still certainly be dead right now. :(   Good. :)  Also, though, it is a bit eerie that every single person who was alive in 1895 (which is approximately when this photo was taken) is already dead right now. :(   This photo is certainly interesting, though; I first saw it on Wikipedia and was intrigued at getting a window into an ordinary family's life 120 years ago.   Frankly, I think that she was just tired or sleepy when this photo was taken.   OK; that said, though, do you have a better map for this?   So you think that ISIS wants to create a permanent (and new) country of its own in the Sunni-majority areas of Iraq and Syria?   Also, I just read about the practice of post-mortem photos and it scared the living daylights out of me. :(   Yeah, I made sure that this photo of mine was legit before I posted it here. :)  Perhaps I should have posted the original source of this photo here immediately, though.    Difficult questions. I think federalisation is definitely the best course of action, it should help to soften ethnic tension.  Agreed.   Afghan democracy is a joke, elections have always been fraudulent; ballot boxes being stuffed to the brim is a huge problem. In the last election Abdullah should've won, but Ghani instead won through fraud.  Source for this claim of yours, please? Also, in regards to Ghani, while I am unsure whether or not he won fairly, it is worth noting that having him as President might be better for Afghanistan than having Abdullah as President would have been. After all, Afghanistan needs more technocrats in power.   I think the economy is going to get worse and worse, we have minerals but not enough mining is going on and there's a lot of fraud. We rely on western aid, afghanistan unfortunately always relied on aid, from Soviet Union to now the west.  How about having China help extract this mineral wealth in Afghanistan, though?   Education is definitely improving, and that's afghansitan only hope really, ont education can turn this country around. There's also the problem of tribal backward culture which has been holding this country back for decades.  Agreed.   Over the last ten years the country has of course improved for the better, the Taliban was in power before.  Agreed.   However security has been deteriorating and attacks are still frequent.  Well, maybe the peace talks with the Taliban will eventually be successful. :)   Thank you very much. :)   "Too," not "to." :)   Actually, you appear to be incorrect in regards to this specific photo:  http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv GRid=7604285 PIpi=567719   Yep. :)                      Yes, there would have been significant incentive for Europe and the U.S. to take out Libya's WMD's as part of the military strike.  Would there have even been a NATO military strike if Libyan missiles could hit Europe, though?   If the Arab spring didn't happen but they seemed on their way to building a nuclear weapon I think it's likely the U.S. would have bombed them.  Good point; that said, though, would the U.S. have known about Libya's nuclear weapons building progress in time? After all, as far as I know, the U.S. was surprised as how much nuclear equipment Libya acquired from the A.Q. Khan network.   All that said, Gaddaffi was orienting towards a more pro-western (or at least not explicitly anti-western) foreign policy at the time.  Yes; thus, let's assume that Gaddafi still accepts responsibility for Lockerbie and agrees to pay financial compensations to the families of the Lockerbie victims but nonetheless insists on keeping his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program in this scenario.   I don't think they ever had the capability to accurately launch missiles at Europe though I could be wrong.  Couldn't Libya have bought some great missiles from North Korea and/or from Iran, though?   Yes, unfortunately.  Thanks for that, Al-Qaeda (obvious sarcasm)! :(   Huh?   Any thoughts on this statement?      Thanks for this info. :)  Thus, should I delete this photo, or what?   You're talking about my second photo here rather than about my original photo here, correct?    It would likely have motivated them to invade even faster.   In order to secure Libya's chemical weapon and nuclear weapon stockpiles, you mean?   Libya was an air campaign, we didn't put soldiers on the ground, so we weren't facing much threat from chemical weapons.  Couldn't Gaddafi have launched chemical weapons at Europe if he would have had good enough missiles, though?   If he had somehow managed to build several functioning nuclear missiles before then that would have worked as deterrence, but any program on that track would have been already bombed.  By whom exactly? By Israel?   What about this photo, though? :  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Rue-de-Rivoli-1855.jpg      Agreed.   Agreed. :)  For the record, though, I do think that the aftermath of the Libya intervention was bungled.       This is actually one of the complaints people have with Hillary. By intervening in Libya after they had given up their weapons program, that made other countries much more reluctant to give up theirs.  Possibly; however, Hillary can respond to this by saying that dictators shouldn't worry about the U.S. and NATO overthrowing them if they are not going to be excessively brutal.   As the former Secretary of State, she should definitely answer for this.  Yes, she should, but I might already have an answer that she can use for this. :)            In other words, would NATO have been willing to risk having Britain, France, and/or Italy be targets of Libyan WMD attacks or even of Libyan nuclear attacks?  Any thoughts on this?   It might very well be possible, but please keep in mind that allowing this when one can prevent this using medical intervention would probably be utterly idiotic due to the fact that being 9 feet tall can possibly have negative health consequences for human beings.   I'm not sure if I (at 1.83-1.84 meters, or about exactly 6 feet) would count for this, but I absolutely *love* being taller than 98% or 99% of all women! :) Seriously.    Not historically Israel.  If you are referring to this map here:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Kingdom_of_Israel_1020_map.svg  --then I would like to point out that Israel annexed Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Eilat in spite of the fact that there were not a part of historical Israel.   Loaded with Palestinians.  While I would certainly have not endorsed this, couldn't Israel have simply expelled most of these Palestinians if they would have been unwilling to leave the Gaza Strip voluntarily? After all, as far as I know, Israel did expel some Palestinians in 1948-1949.   An assumption was made that Egypt or Jordan would take over the space as a bargaining chip even though neither did.  Didn't Egypt occupy the Gaza Strip after 1949, though?      I am always curious about this considering that the Gaza Strip could have already been an incredibly nice beachfront property if it would have been conquered by Israel in 1948-1949.  Anyway, any thoughts on this?

Anyway, any thoughts on this?             This board sees a lot of discussion from people outside the board on the subject of child support, and I'd like to gently inform you that it's not terribly welcome.  OK.   Here is a previous large thread on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/prochoice/comments/2e0i23/question_for_prochoicers/  OK; I'll make sure to check out this thread later on.   It's the general consensus here that the issue of child support is tangential at best to the issue of reproductive freedom.  I don't entirely agree with this, though; after all, as I said before, a lot of the arguments which pro-choicers use in favor of legalized abortion can likewise be used in favor of giving males an opt-out from paying child support.  Also, for the record, the bodily autonomy argument has never been entirely convincing to me. Heck, I'm pro-choice, but even I don't view bodily autonomy as being a holy cow.   If you are interested in discussing child support further, you would probably get some rousing support at /r/mensrights.  Yes, I suppose. Of course, couldn't that Reddit group simply be an Echo chamber in regards to this?   If you specifically want to discuss it with somebody who is pro-choice, you're welcome to PM me.  OK; will do! :)   Thanks for sharing this info. :)   Thanks for clarifying this part. :)   The thing is, though, that bodily autonomy isn't the only argument which is used to justify legalized abortion; indeed, some of the other arguments which are used to justify legalized abortion can also be used to justify giving males an opt-out from paying child support.  Also, do you think that men whose vasectomies failed and whose female sexual partners lied or changed their minds in regards to abortion or adoption should be forced to pay child support? Serious question, for the record.   Yes, I am certainly aware of that. However, what about if an extremely feminine genderqueer eunuch with a penis and a lesbian have sex? Would it still be considered lesbian sex in such a case? Serious question, for the record.   Thanks for this information! :)   Looks totally awesome based on what I have seen! :) Thanks for sharing. :)   A Hitachi?   Thanks for clarifying this part. :)  Good God--after looking that up, I *strongly* wish that I was a binary (trans-)woman rather than "merely" genderqueer. :( My God--that looks totally awesome! :) Seriously. :)   Of course, I do have a younger (almost 15 year old) sister who also lives in the same house that I live in, so ...   I wish. ;)   What exactly is tribulation?   Out of curiosity, if you don't mind me asking, did you ever use a dildo when you had lesbian sex?   No, but I will look it up now that you mentioned it. :)   Internet porn appears to be blocked at my house, though.   I don't think that I am that confused about my gender identity, but if I will discover that I am a transbian, then this certainly wouldn't be bad. However, again, I don't think that I am a transbian.   I mean, I did previously do some reading about this, but this pales in comparison to hearing personal experiences.   For the record, though, my initial post in this thread might have been too brash, and for that, I apologize.   I apologize for asking this, but I am genuinely extremely curious about this. Also, bisexual women who are or who have previously been in a lesbian relationship or even a lesbian one-night stand can also answer this question.  Basically, I myself am a genderqueer person who was born with a male body but who often cross-dreams about the idea of being a woman (with a female brain/mind and everything). While my cross-dreaming is primarily non-sexual, there is at least a little bit of a sexual component to it.  Anyway, any thoughts on this?   Beautifully said, temporius! :)    For many people, love is a very important part in marriage, which is a strong motivational factor in their support of the marriage equality cause.  Yes, I get that. I am just saying that legally speaking, I don't think that love means anything in regards to marriage.   There is no single argument that the lack of acceptance currently hinges on. There are probably many arguments, and they'll all need to be addressed, including the wider effects that a complete removal of the incest taboo would have on society. This isn't just about the nice couple who fell in love and discovered after years of romance that they're actually related.  Fair enough, I suppose.   It's not every day that a Family Guy episode gets removed.      Wow! He certainly appears to be an extremely lucky guy! :) Thus, my congratulations go to him! :)    Nah, to balance out all that luck he will probably die crushed by an old satellite that hits him  Only him  In the middle of a city street  You appear to be guilty of the Gambler's fallacy here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy    Sure there are (also) better arguments. They all add up to our case for equal marriage.  Fair enough, I suppose.   It's a nice slogan and it probably convinces a big number of people. Other people are more responsive to other arguments.  OK; fair enough. Basically, this argument might help change some people's minds, though from an intellectual perspective, it appears to be a weak argument. After all, legally speaking, marriage isn't about love--rather, it is about various benefits and whatnot.   That's not how rights are given or recognized. The "incest community" would need to make their own case, and address all objections and counter-arguments that people generally have, fight for acceptance etc, similar to what same-sex marriage proponents have achieved.  Yes, you are correct about this in the legal sense. However, I was trying to give the "incest community" a way to win this argument in the intellectual sense which might perhaps eventually help them win this argument in the legal sense as well.   Why exactly shouldn't, say, two lifelong friends be able to get married if they so choose?    Equal love is one of many arguments in favor of same-sex marriage.  OK, but wouldn't a better argument in favor of same-sex marriage be equal marriage (as in, opposite-sex marriages are no better than same-sex marriages)?   Love as an argument in favor does neither mean that it's the argument nor that it's a prerequisite for all cases.  True, but the love argument does appear to be overused, in my honest opinion.   Those who want incestuous marriage will need to make their own case and successfully deal with all additional objections and counter-arguments, before it will even be considered.  OK--thus, what about this argument:  Consenting adults should be able to enter into legal contracts (including marriage) with other legal adults. As for the risk of genetic defects, what exactly is the magic number for this--10%? 5%? 1%? 0.1%? 0.01%? Unless you can provide such a magic number, I don't think that the state should be able to ban incestuous marriage. Plus, as far as I know, women above the age of 35 are also more likely to give birth to children with conditions such as Down's syndrome; however, such women are still (rightfully) allowed to marry and to reproduce.  There--how exactly was that argument in favor of legalizing incestuous marriage between two consenting adults?         Hang on--so if I will become a eunuch and take female hormones and will begin fapping less, then I am going to gradually go blind? Completely serious question, for the record.   I think that my record is fapping 4 times per day; however, I don't necessary see anything wrong with fapping 6 times per day.      Any thoughts on this?   OK; that said, though, would Germany have lost as much territory as it actually did in this scenario? Also, would Germany have still been divided/partitioned after the end of World War II in this scenario? In addition, would there have been a Stab-in-the-Back Myth 2.0 in this scenario?            I was obviously joking here.    I think Clinton handled Oslo well. He almost got an agreement. At the time, Arafat seemed for real to many, compared to what else was out there. If he helped Ehud, that's why.  Yes, many people did unfortunately believe in Arafat up to 2000; of course, there were some people, such as Netanyahu, who were skeptical of Arafat even before 2000.   No one thought Arafat would unleash the second intifada between 1993 and late 2000.  The scale of the Second Intifada might have been unforeseen; however, even before 2000, there were some people (such as Netanyahu) who were skeptical of Arafat and his intentions.   Clinton didn't put his feet on his desk talking to Netanyahu. He also didn't start the kind of public spats with him Obama has, calling out the Likud party like Obama has, even if he supported Labor.  True, though again, I think that Obama's spats with Netanyahu are more style than substance. For instance, I don't think that Obama has ever threatened to cut U.S. aid to Israel.   Nor did he talk to Iran directly as Obama has  Do you have a better way of regulating Iran's nuclear program, though?   or treat rogue leaders like Chavez and Castro better than Netanyahu.  Fair enough, I suppose.   Plus, Clinton was/is much more popular in Israel than Obama has been.  That's because many Israelis unfortunately care more for style than for substance; in regards to substance, Obama actually hasn't been particularly bad for Israel.   Obama's actions have been anti-Netanyahu much more than anyone; his actions are deliberately done to be used by Bibi's opponents against him, and they are.  Actually, if anything, I have the impression that Netanyahu's public spats with Obama actually *help* Netanyahu due to the fact that many Israelis (unfairly, in my honest opinion) dislike Obama. Yes, Netanyahu's political opponents have tried using these spats to weaken him, but they don't appear to have succeed in this (not yet, at least).   Obama hasn't visited Israel while Netanyahu has been in office; Clinton did.  Actually, you appear to be incorrect in regards to this:  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/2013/03/obama-visits-israel-and-west-bank/  "President Barack Obama is in Israel this week, marking his first presidential trip to the country since taking office five years ago."  Also, in regards to Bill Clinton, I also have some other problems with his foreign policy (and that's not getting into his domestic policy):  1. He didn't do anything to stop the Rwandan Genocide (though admittedly neither did the leaders of, say, Britain, France, and other European countries).  2. His administration didn't take up Muammar Gaddafi on his offer(s) to give up his WMDs and/or his nuclear weapons program  3. His administration, while tougher on Al-Qaeda than Bush Jr.'s was before 9/11, wasn't tough enough on Al-Qaeda. For instance, Clinton's response to the 1998 African embassy bombings was too small, in my honest opinion.  4. A stylistic difference, but Clinton and his administration was too soft in their language towards rogue states; indeed, Madeleine Albright even stopped calling them rogue states in 2000 and preferred to sue the term "states of concern" instead.  5. His administration screwed up with that Somalia intervention in 1993.    By far the most overstated meme out there. There is little in data out there that shows Hillary to be more polarizing nationally than Jeb or anyone recent favorable/unfavorable.  Fair enough, I suppose. Of course, my concern is that, with the exception of her time as U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton's favorable-unfavorable ratings were often not that good.   And before the recent negative coverage, her numbers were much higher.  Yes, but this is my concern--the more that Hillary is a candidate, the more that she might be exposed to negative media coverage.  (Also, for what it's worth, I still support Hillary Clinton in 2016 because she's probably the best candidate that the Democrats have in this election; however, it certainly doesn't hurt to ask questions.)   Thing is that this "polarizing" bit started after Clinton took office. Clinton was the first Boomer president, and thus boomer press corp took gloves off they kept on for the "greatest generation." GG press guys moved out. Boomers were also more shaped by Watergate and making careers like Woodward/Bernstein, hence why press is so much worse today than 30 years ago, plus the fairness doctrine issue. If the Clintons were so polarizing, why does Bill still have high ratings? Why did Bill blow his opponents out in states like Missouri, West Virginia, and even in LA (he beat Dole 52-37 there in 1996), states which no Dem has won since? Or why was Bill able to take NJ, CT, MI, VT, PA, CA, ME, MD, and DE away from Republicans permanently (NH almost perm)? He did leave office with high approvals and still has a high retrospective job approval, while he's alive, not dead like Reagan/Kennedy/etc.?  Actually, the impression that I got is that Hillary Clinton is the polarizing Clinton. As you said, Bill Clinton still appears to be pretty popular (if not *very* popular); however, for some reason, his popularity might not have rubbed onto Hillary that much.  	152
 So far we have barren desert and lush jungle. It would be amazing to have a windswept mountainous snow map. I don't know how many maps there are supposed to be in the final game, but at least one more doesn't seem unrealistic, and that'd give us the widest variety of terrains for missions.   I'm pretty sure it's just gonna be that little mini metal gear thing we've seen    What two colours did you use?    This is like the twentieth time this has been posted this week    They also kill Blofield which would be such a waste    Mountains of Madness obviously    I thought the first hour of that movie was brilliant but then it went downhill real fast    Rescue Dawn or American Psycho   Still pretty funny   Shsuke Kaneko directed GMK: Giant Monsters All Out Attack, which is my all time favorite Godzilla film tied with the first. And he also directed the absolutely incredible Gamera trilogy.   I think this guy balances campy B-movie fun and legitimately awesome action in a really fantastic way, and I've never seen any director make dudes in rubber suits look as cool and epic as he can.       Would have been funnier if you could still faintly hear Eminem's muffled rapping through the phone   Mark Millar is so terrible    They may    I put in Horror, Sci-Fi, and Thriller as genre, anything between 1980 and 2014, and with a rating of 6 and up.   It gave me Slumdog Millionaire and some movie called Udaan, and just kept alternating between those two no matter what.  So great   I love having fun in my movies and i love cheesy Godzilla movies but Final Wars had like 3 good action scenes separated by long stretches of very boring, very not fun stuff. Unfortunately about two third of Godzilla movies are like that, including the 2014 American one.  GMK Giant Monsters All Out Attack is my favorite Godzilla movie.   My PS3 and regular Sony bluray player are still a better media centres than my PS4. Were the stories of these features being worked on true, or am I just never going to be able to properly use my PS4 to watch movies   My PS3 and regular Sony bluray player are still a better media centres than my PS4. Were the stories of these features being worked on true, or am I just never going to be able to properly use my PS4 to watch movies   You mean The Raid 2. Redemption was the first one    Those are more revenge movies than vigilantism. Vigilantism movies tend to be positive towards the violence portrayed by the protagonists, whereas revenge movies tend to be more anti-violence. They are very very similar tropes and there is a lot of overlap  *GOOD* revenge movies tend to show that revenge is ultimately futile. Violence ends in heartbreak and destruction and corruption, the the protagonist is usually worse off in the end. A good revenge movie shows how letting emotions and rage and violence control you is the ultimate evil. Much like the movies you listed.  Bad revenge movies (and most vigilantism movies) are about how cool and fun it is to kill everyone you want and how it solves all your problems and the protagonist wins in the end. Like in Boondock Saints.   I'm pretty sure Mission Impossible 6 has been shooting in both Austria and Morocco earlier this year.    Took me a while to realize this was in the style of the original octopus logo   I'm new to the whole figures and statues thing, so I don't know anything about who makes the best/most affordable/which series/collection is best. Is there a specific website or company I should buy from if I want a nice consistent set   Now that the Blista Compact everyone loves is back, how does everyone feel it compares to the Futo? I think the Futo looks a lot cooler, but the Blista was always one of my favorites in previous GTAs. Which one do you think is better in terms of speed or handling or even customization?   I remember it being incredibly popular at the time    I picked up the hitchhiker who told me to invest in Tinkle, so I put all my characters money into Tinkle stick on BAWSAQ, but the stocks never rose. Do they go up immediately after I drop him off or should I sleep for a couple hours or days or what?   Im connected to the Internet, and I believe that's required for BAWSAQ, plus I have multiple saves so I can just reload and pick him up again.    He looks a lot whiter. When playing Just Cause 1 and 2 I felt like I was pretty obviously playing as fake Antonio Banderas, and I loved his black stylized Desperado inspired uniform. This looks a little more like generic white video game tough guy. But it is just concept art and it's hard to tell without seeing him in game and hearing him talk.    This sums up pretty well why I'm not super keen on Jurassic World. The first movie took a crazy idea, and made it seem realistic and grounded and possible, which made the dinosaurs all the more amazing. Jurassic World just looks like a ridiculous cartoon fantasy world.   Oh man... That looks ridiculous    The CGI gate was one thing, but the unescorted children in a glass hamster ball inside a dinosaur enclosure mere feet away from an animal that could easily crush them was especially silly and ridiculous.    I just finished the campaign, but 3 of the story progress trophies did not unlock. The Bureau Raid, the Submarine heist, and the big final score. I have never used any cheats and as far as I know I didn't skip anything or miss anything. I went back and replayed the missions, but still no trophy.  Has this happened to anyone else?   I just finished the campaign, but about 3 of the story progress trophies did not unlock. I have never used any cheats and as far as I know I didn't skip anything or miss anything. Has this happened to anyone else?   If James Gunn didn't cast him then he is an IDIOT AND A SAVAGE    Chopper   Just some good natured ribbing    Does it automatically use your Social Club account, or does it make you log in to do it? Basically, if someone gives me permission, can I use someone else's Social Club account for the transfer so I can import their character to my save?   Probably would have been a lot more high pitched screeching    Wait until it's out   What's a man gotta do to get some damn chicken in Los Santos  Also I miss shooting up the hospitals in GTA 4   That sounds awesome. It'd be cool if the title is revealed to be Icebreaker some time soon   The part where he followed a woman home and then impersonated her boyfriend so he could have sex with her was pretty fucked up   I remember Robert Rodriguez saying Antonio Banderas did the same thing during Desperado    There's an article on Gameinformer conforming this to be in the game.    I just hope it means that there'll still be enemies and compounds and stuff to destroy once you own all the bases    Speed. For a fast paced non stop action thrill ride literally called SPEED the opening titles are a really long tedious pan up a boring elevator shaft with ugly blue WordArt.   Alex Hutchinson has said that it's the best one yet, but there haven't been any official announcements or trailers    Character Transfer  You will need a Rockstar Games Social Club account linked to the console accounts used when previously playing GTA Online.  When entering GTA Online, you will be given the option to transfer your previous GTA Online character and progression data. Once you have chosen to transfer your previous character and progression data, the transferable in-game money, RP and Rank of all previous characters will be displayed. These are the characters that will be transferred to the PlayStation4 or Xbox One. Once the transfer has completed, you will be prompted to choose a character and enter GTA Online.  You will still be able to play your existing characters on PlayStation3 and/or Xbox 360, however any progress made with versions of the characters on those systems after a transfer will remain on those systems only. Any existing PlayStation4 or Xbox One GTA Online character and progression data will be replaced by the previous character and progression data during the transfer, except for any existing in-game money, which will be combined with your transferred balance.  All earned in-game money will transfer. Purchased in-game money that has not yet been spent will only transfer within a console family (e.g. PlayStation3 to PlayStation4).  So next gen and last gen characters will now be separate across both platforms. So would someone on last gen who does not wish to purchase the new version of the game be able to essentially 'give' a next gen player their GTA Online account? The last gen version will remain, so as long as that person isn't planning on upgrading, they won't lose anything and can keep playing, and then a next gen player would be able to start with a GTA Online character that's already leveled up and wouldn't have to worry about grinding to unlock stuff.  Basically, if a friend A has the game on last gen and doesn't want to buy the new version, and friend B buys the next gen version but doesn't want to have to start from nothing, would friend B be able to use friend A's Rockstar account once to log in and get their character, or is it locked to the Rockstar account you already have   Handling and physics still need some serious tweaking.  The UI is really overbearing and messy  The rubber banding is very frustrating  Too many long loading screens and cutscenes and other screens and pop ups to click through stopping me from getting back into the game.    I really think this game is super cool and has amazing ideas and has the potential to be an incredibly fun and massive experience. Ivory Tower has certainly worked really hard to make such an ambitious game come together and I so badly want it to work. But I just don't think it's quite there yet.    You can only do free roam stuff with a friend, side missions, outposts and fortresses, activities, anything in the open world map. The campaign missions are single player only. I don't think there's split screen at all.   It's certainly a really really cool game conceptually, and I really love pretty much all the ideas and features, but the execution isn't quite there yet and it still feels like it needs some serious fine tuning   Ray Wise was in Xmen: First Class? I might need to watch that movie again   Don't forget Tony Jaa at 51 seconds in   Is this game really 1080p at 60fps or is that just what this was recorded at   This movie looks great but this trailer is absolutely terrible   That certainly sounds wacky    I was happy to see a video that wasn't just a clip of a children's cartoon or some loud rap music being played over something random   COMINAYYEEAAAHHAAAAA   Bright green, bright yellow or bright orange. Otherwise it just ain't right.    What a great spoof and a goof   I don't remember that quote at all! That's alone from Boogie Nights   Both are produced by Legendary Pictures    Especially because all these trailers have showed pretty much no story and actually very little content    Alex Hutchinson specifically said it would [not be back](https://twitter.com/BangBangClick/status/501757393190285312)    This is incredibly poorly choreographed and shot. I have no idea what OP is talking about. This is literally the exact opposite of everything that made the Heat shoot out great.   This is just like every shitty derivative action movie shootout that came out in the early 2000s. Terrible music, nonsense choreography, amateur editing. Trying way too hard to be cool poorly crafted mindless killing in the style of a cheesy music video.   Alex Hutchinson specifically said there would be [no weapon degradation](https://twitter.com/BangBangClick/status/501757393190285312)    You guys should go on Elimidate    The correct title is the Age of Cage   Hopefully some Audi and Toyota and Subaru    But if you could say...    David Fincher maybe? Crazy obsessive perfectionist who makes a wide variety of dark heavy risky mature films that are artistically daring and complex, absolutely meticulously beautiful, and all seem to achieve fairly wide mainstream critical and financial success without ever feeling dumbed down for the summer superhero market.  That's just my opinion anyway.    Awesome, thanks!    Question for those of you who have played the betas, are there radio stations in this game? Are there multiple kinds with different genres of music like Forza Horizon? Or is it just a general game soundtrack like Need for Speed?    I've always liked Rosamund Pike, but I never knew she was capable of a performance as incredible as this   I'm not trying to be a troll or a hater or anything so sorry if this seems harsh, I'm just a disillusioned Sony/driving game fan.  Servers still aren't working so I can't really comment on the social club aspects, but after playing it all day I'm incredibly disappointed. Firstly, the graphics are amazing, so that's a plus. I also think the driving physics are fine. But it's so depressingly bare bones. And I don't just mean the PS Plus version.  Now, I wasn't expecting a big Forza Horizon style game at all, and I'm certainly not a Forza or Xbox fanboy just trying to bash the game. I knew this was a simple, small game with a clear direction. I was very excited for this game and was really hoping it'd be fun. Unfortunately after about five minutes of playing there's absolutely nothing new or fun to see.  The full game doesn't have a very big or varied car selection at all, no American or Japanese cars of any kind, only three game modes, only one of which is worth playing, no customization, no tuning, no worthwhile options or replayability to be found. You can't even go slightly off the road without a big timer threatening to reset you for some reason, the game slows down your car as a penalty if you so much as slightly cut a corner or hit the AI too many times, and the AI is pretty oblivious and sketchy so this happens a lot. The game just feels so small and restrictive and aggressively mediocre and boring. Just seems like a really basic stripped down simple game with nothing at all going for it aside from having nice visuals and the fact that Forza isn't on Playstation. Plus even the social stuff I don't yet have access to isn't exactly super exciting either.  Obviously going into this game I knew it wasn't going to have tonnes of depth or any customization or anything. I wasn't expecting a massive game and I don't want to put bodykits or anything on my car, but you can't even play around with ABS or traction control or even change the color of the stock car. The game is constantly restricting you and denying you and penalizing you. It's hard to believe a big budget retail game released in 2014, after a year long delay, could be this empty and pointless.  I know there's some updates coming after launch (after a whole goddamn year long delay) but I can't imagine I'd still be playing this game by then.  The game is very very pretty, and I do actually think the driving physics are okay, it could have and should have been good, but it's so incredibly boring and shallow and empty and lifeless. Even if the full version was free I don't know if I'd keep playing it. This game just brings absolutely nothing new or interesting or fun to the table. There are a million driving games on the market already and this game seems like a huge step down compared to pretty much all of them.   I'm not s die hard Xbox fanboy at all and I think the game sucks. I was really hoping it'd be great and I was really looking forward to it but it's so boring and bland and lifeless and devoid of any fun features or replayability at all    Graphics are amazing. But it seems super bare bones. And I don't just mean the PS Plus version.  The full game doesn't have a very big or varied car selection, no American or Japanese cars of any kind, not a lot of game modes, no real customization, no real interesting options or replayability, just seems like a really basic stripped down simple game with not a whole lot going for it aside from having fantastic visuals and the fact that Forza isn't on Playstation. Plus the social stuff isn't exactly super exciting.  Still seems like it might be fun for a little while though so I'll definitely be playing the free version. Sure is pretty at least.   Yeah but DDL is praised because he gives incredible performances. Unlike Shia.   I have never seen him give an especially good performance. He was kind of okay in Lawless but still couldn't make me sympathize with his character at all.    Yeah and for show would still be at least once per weekday in a heavily populated theme park   Yeah but surely it's not legal or cost-efficient to feed giant sharks to dinosaurs every day   I'm super excited for this movie but this description sounded really crazy and dumb.   For a movie about dinosaurs on the loose in modern day, Jurassic Park was all fairly grounded and realistic. The park and the way it operated and the science behind it made it feel real. This just sounds like really over the top crazy fantastical sci fi nonsense that is way too far removed from reality for me to care about.   Muzzled raptors, kids in gyrospheres in an enclosure with giant theropods, feeding great white sharks to dinosaurs, genetically engineered super-dinosaur monsters. I really hope it doesn't end up being as ridiculous and unbelievable as it sounds.   I seem to remember he was actually going to play Micky Wolfman   I really hope so. The cars that are in the game are all very nice, but it's such a small line up with very very little variety.    In terms of sexual themes it was definitely more disturbing to me personally.  Fight Club and Se7en had more violence and just dark themes throughout the whole film though. Although I haven't seen Girl With the Dragon Tattoo so I don't know how it compares to that.    There's like two fairly quick but slightly graphic-ish sex scenes, and then one reeeeeal messed up graphic horrible thing    This is the only scene in the entire movie I didn't like. After how fucked up everything got everyone seemed way too okay with it.   Definitely sounds like raptors attacking a woman on a tennis court. Sounds pretty darn graphic and dark for a Jurassic Park movie. Do we have any idea where this audio is coming from? If it's from a reliable source who was on location then that's interesting, and it's pretty common for sound effects to be played on set for people to react to since they'd be using CGI, but realistically anyone could make these sounds at home pretty easily.    Alex Hutchinson said [no](https://twitter.com/BangBangClick/status/501757393190285312)   There is no weapon degradation    You won't regret it. Their premium videos became the highlight of my week    I am! One of my all time favorite giantbomb features!    That really doesn't look like Clooney    This makes me feel a lot better as a short man child   Which episode?    I've yet to start the Batman Incorporated storyline, although I have read all of Morrison's work leading up to it. I am planning to purchase the Pre-New 52 Batman Incorporated paperback, and then both Volume 1 and 2 of the New 52 Batman Incorporated.   I'm kinda confused by the fact that the new 52 paperbacks are titled Volume 1: Demon Star and Volume 2: Gotham's Most Wanted. When I look up the storyline on Wiki it says pre-52 was Volume 1, and New 52 is Volume 2. I just want to make sure I'm buying the right books and reading them in the right order without missing anything or making any redundant purchases. So is pre-52 part 1, and then New 52 is part 2, but then part 2 is split into Volumes 1 and 2?  I'm so confused. Is there a paperback that collected Demon Star and Gotham's Most Wanted into one book?    Some of the ideas seem potentially interesting. Playing as a Triad enforcer and doing all sorta of open world crime side quests looks interesting, but not as a whole game.  Online only and no story is the exact opposite of what I wanted from a sequel. I have lost pretty much all interest at this point.   The fight scenes in The Raid are incredible and brutal and amazing and superbly well choreographed but they are not realistic at all   Okay. Wow. I feel like I should read some Spawn. Where should I start?   What I especially love and find super impressive about the long takes in the cutscenes that they also transition seamlessly into gameplay. So not only are the cutscenes one long take, when they switch seamlessly to gameplay it's like there aren't even any cutscenes or edits of any kind at all! Makes it feel like one big long single epic scene. It's amazing!   He's always talking about his twins    Christ he is trying SO hard    I didn't like either VHS movie but I looooved this particular little story. Plus it's from the director of The Raid films   Well that looks insanely cool. I don't like any of the Killzone games at all but I'll check out a Viking vs robo-dinosaurs game any day   His head is gigantic    I really like this one. It's basically a remake of the film Man Bits Dog, which I really enjoyed. Ryan Kwanten does surprisingly well and is really funny and likable, yet still believably insane.    Oh wow that's awesome! I've never seen that before. This game has so much cool hidden stuff   Alien under ice?

The price is planned to come down when the plane actually enters full production.    but you already know thats not true by the number of rats used. why do you misinform people so much while claiming to be a champion of science?    It was neither a chronic toxicity study due to the duration and number of rats that where used. His study differed more from a chronic toxicity study then it did for a carcinogencity study.     again, you already know he modelled the test after monsantos.     No he didn't, duration was way too long and sample size was way to small to be able to gain any meaningful data. Monsanto looked at sub chronic toxicity and Seralini just through shit at the wall and hoped something stuck.     if he use wistar rats like many other carcinogenity studies amd presented tumors as evidence you might    Wistar and SD rats are both commonly used for testing either toxicity or carcinogencity.     And he did in fact present his findings on tumor prevalence as evidence against both glyphosate and GMO feed [despite not running any statistical analysis](http://i.imgur.com/F3MtjXB.png), maybe you should actually read the paper?    Suffering inducing euthanasia and deaths corresponded mostly in females to the development of large mammary tumors. These appeared to be clearly related to the various treatments when compared to the control groups. These tumors are generally known to be mostly estrogen-dependent (Harvell et al., 2000). We observed a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors by R alone, a major formulated pesticide, even at the very lowest dose administered    ...       Interestingly, in the groups of animals fed with the NK603 without R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor incidence and mortality rates were observed.         Tumor prevalence was a major finding of his study and any toxicologist worth his shit would be aware of the rate of spontaneous tumors in SD rats when taken out to 18+ months. Again, there is little reason anyone would run a rat study with SD rats out to 2 years unless you were looking for carcinogencity. Chronic toxicity is usually 1 year at 20 rats per sex per group (OECD 452). Seralini didn't not follow protocol for any international recognized toxicity study, his protocol and how he reported his findings most matched a carcinogencity trial.     The only person misinformed is you and your pestering that Seralini's study actually means anything in terms of GMO safety. There is a reason why the study was retracted and many health and safety boards published their own independent reviews citing faults and errors in it.

The planned cost of the F35 is suspected to be 85million in 2020.

Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer.

Many famous fruits such as the Honey Crisp apple the the Haas Avocado have either been granted patents or plant variety protection certificates.    GMOs are not actually clones like the say banana are. For GE crops the original GE trait such as insect resistance or herbicide tolerance is crossed back into conventional plant varieties.    They've gotten bigger rounder, and redder, sure, but they're also watery and less sweet.    There currently are not genetically engineered tomatoes on the market.

 Voltaire   Atheist here.   No. No I do not. (Assuming you're talking about extraterrestrial spacecraft)  Next question?  Kinda funny that the second part of your question was loaded by the belief that atheists tend to believe in UFO's. Don't believe everything Ray Comfort tells you.  Edit: Clarification.   Plumb to prune   The little flex at the end was the best.   You're literally too stupid to argue with.   I hope for your sake you're either trolling or very young and will one day grow out of it.   Google Fiber.   It's a word that's been hijacked by so many entirely different people with entirely different ideologies ranging from progressive to absolutely mad, and all of them will say "If you don't believe exactly as I do you're not a real feminist."  So, basically, it has no meaning anymore.   Because many videos are not available on mobile devices.   Beer pong for general drinking games.   Circle of death for cards.   It's sort of in place of where in real life I might say something along the lines of "Right on!" or "Couldn't have said it better myself!" or some other such means of conveying vigorous agreement. Guess it feels more appropriate than commenting one of those things but an upvote doesn't quite cut it.   Either that or it's (to me) original and genuinely made me laugh, or feel other strong emotions that don't enrage or disturb me.  Edit for grammar and punctuation.   There are reserve bases and training bases all over the fuckin place. It's extremely likely they're on their way to or from said base.   A used condom after a party that clearly had poop/blood on it as well as semen in it.   That's.... weird man. Cats are terrifying when they puke.   Nah she'd think it's cute.   Nicotine.   I've tried quitting cold turkey.  I've tried switching to chew figuring at least I'd be eliminating second hand smoke.   I've tried the patch.   I've tried gum.   I've tried vaping.   I've tried 3 different prescription medications to aid with quitting smoking.   The worst part is that my life only gets more stressful which only worsens my smoking habit.   One day I will successfully quit.  Edit: I've also tried to pinpoint stressors in my life to avoid to help control cravings during attempts, and finding healthy things to get "addicted" to that I can do during nasty cravings.   Also, yes reddit, I know, I should never have started smoking in the first place. Thank you, hindsight is 20/20, unfortunately it's also 100% useless.   No, I don't recall precisely why I started smoking. Boredom and wanting to feel more grown up I suppose.   I'm pretty sure the majority (well over 50%) of the world still believes in some sort of higher power(s) and or supernatural reasons for the way things are etc.   That could work. I'm picturing low-cut short shorts (they probably have a name but it eludes me) and a well fitting white T-shirt or tank top.   Live with my girlfriend.   Moving in on the 1st!

 This is Amy.  I have launched a couple of new ventures and it often takes longer than you expect to secure revenue. It is obviously best to be revenue positive from day one!!  Some ventures do start that way.  Through my research I can say that the vast majority of successful entrepreneurs test their new businesses as "side-projects" while holding down a full time job.  They experiment in low risk ways before quitting a job or investing significant time or capital.  Good luck!     This is Amy.  To the question of textiles, there are great examples in The Creator's Code of retailers who are making products in the United States.  Under Armour founder Kevin Plank, for example, wants to bring all UA jobs back into Baltimore where his company is based.  Spanx founder Sara Blakely launched her company in the southeast by going door-to-door to get a manufacturer to make her product.     I do see this industry growing in the US through new fabrics as well as wearable technologies.    In terms of smaller businesses partnering with larger companies, this is one of the best ways to scale a startup.  Any time an entrepreneur can find a larger partner who will be a collaborative customer, the odds of success improve dramatically!      This is Amy.  On your first question 1) I would recommend reading Zero to One by Peter Thiel.  It is a solid entrepreneurship book written by one of the great Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.  There is also solid research around curiosity by George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon that I would recommend!     On your second question 2) I would say that love of people and ideas is what fuels my research.  Curiosity is also a big part of it for me - and for the 200 entrepreneurs I interviewed for my book.  When you love your work, it is easier to stay motivated and to take the setbacks that inevitably arise along the path to success.  Good luck!        This is Amy.

 Oh brother..   White People   I literally can't believe you would say that. Chris Traeger would be disappointed.   Holy shit. It happened. It FUCKING HAPPENED      The sweetest post of all time.    Stress relief part 1   2 were possibly two of the best episodes of The Office.    I was at Disney World when I was six years old. We were riding the bus back to our hotel when my mom gave her seat up to a girl about the same age as me. We kept looking at each other and just smiled and laughed. It was so innocent and for my six year old self it was the best thing ever.    I've always wanted to have a day like this, but it hasn't happened yet. Sorry to hear about the bitter ending!   	9
 I'm still waiting on Dance Mums...   Omg, I love that movie. So much. I wanted to meet Max and fly around on that awesome spacecraft.   Something like this happened to my sister. She was sitting next to her friend late one night and called his phone from hers. When she called, his phone didn't ring but her end did. A woman answered the phone and said my sister had woken her up. My sister, very confused, recited the number and the woman said it was her number, had been for years. When she hung up she asked her friend who the woman was but he was just as confused. So my sister thinks it must be a hiccup in the service and calls the number again. Once again her friend sitting right next to her with phone in hand, his phone doesn't ring. But it rang, again, on her end. The same woman answered and asked her to stop calling.  My sister said she felt bad for waking up someone who was asleep, but it bugged the crap out of her and her friend.   I know that there was a great deal of spying at BYU-I and it is reported at the other  BYU's. There is a lot of gossip among members at local levels, too. But I've been reading many threads on here as well as fb and it seems other members claim this to be real. People claim to be victims. I'm not saying it is totally true but it isn't outside the realm of possibility. Scientology does it, so why not the LDS church?   And yet, it appears to be happening. Oh well, I am not practicing anymore and have no fucks to give about what the church thinks of me.   I was hoping, so hard....      Am I supposed to be surprised by this news? Because I'm not.   I will tell you, it isn't all it's cracked up to be. Yes, losing over 50lbs is awesome. I went from obese to a healthy 120lbs at 5'3. There are some downsides to it. If I'm hungry, I will smoke and that will drive away my hunger. Some days I smoke all day and clean my house, but totally forget to eat. I actually drink protein shakes to curb the cotton mouth and to ensure a decent caloric intake in a healthy manner. My boyfriend actually has to remind me to eat! Or at least to finish my plate, which is hard because I'm simply not hungry. I have thought about quitting, but bud does help with migraines, my nausea from said migraines, and my monthly aches and pains. As a child I suffered from upset stomachs all the time(almost daily), as an adult I still do. Bud is the only means I've found to help overcome this problem. The struggle is real, my friend.    I'm a long time smoker. If I smoke, I can't eat. Food looks meh and if I'm hungry before I smoke, I lose my appetite. I have lost weight because of this but I love my weight now, so I guess it all worked out.   Given their history, I'd be surprised if they weren't all over this.   That's awesome! I truly wish I could watch stateside!   If you have a sibling getting married in the temple, you won't be able to attend if you don't pay tithing. That'd be the only real loss I see in that.   I think they care because of empathy, compassion, and the idea that if these things can happen in NY or Ferguson, they can happen in their city, too. After all, police brutality isn't localized to one city, it is nationwide.   Do you really think Bethesda would run the same trick twice?   I remember this, too. Lots of sites were blocked. Proxy servers were awesome.   I remember doing something like that in YW. They closed off the cultural hall and had you make choices of how to get to heaven. I thought it was silly.   3rd now   Any child can choose to do stupid shit, regardless of how they are raised. Of course good parenting helps, but it isn't foolproof. Kids do stupid, dangerous, violent things sometimes. It is their choices they make. Not everyone makes good choices.   It is trending 4th on Twitter right now and rising. If one child gets hurt by those protesters, well, it will turn ugly, real fast. I get these people are angry, but stopping a parade is moronic. They won't get far, the NYPD aren't going to let it go through. I, too, look forward to the arrests about to be made.   If you smash it, you can grab it good sir.   Can we riot, I mean protest, about this?   Good, they can redonate that money to a charity for kids. Like, kids with seizures, or kids with leukemia, etc.    Saw it on ustream and Twitter last night   Oakland is starting to go nuts. Power to two city blocks has been shut off, and fires are being set.   Well, I'm ready with popcorn in hand waiting for the fallout of this.   I saw something similar and posted about it. It was very in my face, less than 30ft.   I can't play, TSTO isn't available on my new 7" Kindle Fire, but works on the old ones. Such bull.   I tried that, didn't work. This is actually the first time I've run into real issues with TSTO on Kindle.   Editing?   We shall see. I'm not going to completely doubt it. Also, seeing as how neither of us are there or were part of past excavations, it's really hard to know what's truly going on there until concrete evidence comes up. I hope it is something, not holding my breath, but I do kinda hope.   I recently got a brand new Kindle Fire 7, and promptly downloaded TSTO but it is continually crashing during the update. I get a message saying an update needs to be made, click ok, and it takes me back to the Amazon App store to download the game. Anyone else run into this issue?   Yeah, actually. The finding of coins and tools so far down. I admit, what you say is very reasonable. I just think there is more to the island than meets the eye. Whatever the secret is, it might not be down the Money Pit. But then, we won't really know til further excavations are made. I could be wrong, but it's a neat story. Also, it isn't my money on the line. I enjoy a good hunt, hopefully something comes out of it. If not, then lessons will be learned.   Imagine Disney all bombed out. You could hole up in Magic Mountain, see the charred remains of Mickey. Find loot in the teacup rides. Deathclaws could be hiding in Tomorrowland, and Animal Kingdom could have strange beasts that evolved through radiation. Former employees and guests turned ghouls could roam the park wearing Mickey hats. Giant mutant gators and pythons could roam the dilapidated town of Orlando. Pockets of civilization hiding in old apartment complexes. Universal Studios is now Brotherhood territory. And junkies, so many junkies and jet. Jet would be everywhere.  I've thought too much about this, lol.   Hey OP! If you would like answers, go ask them at r/exmormon. They will use critical thinking and logic to help answer questions you are having. Might sound crazy to ask people who have left, but they are quite nice and you will find that you aren't alone. When someone tells you to just rely on the church for answers when many things the church asks you to rely upon can be proven false, then is the time to think critically. Any church can bring a burning of the bosom, but facts lead to actual truth.    I did that a lot growing up. Last year I realized what an awful child I was being. I planned a trip with my family (even got my sister to fly up) as a surprise for my Mom. Then we doubly surprised her by taking her to a renaissance festival. She cried. She was so happy. Chin up, my friend! One day they may just surprise you, too.    I don't think it is all bs. I think that laws and regulations do slow the process. If they just went in and did what they want without permission it would cause a lot of issues. I agree that the show devotes a lot to back story repeatedly, but this season has been good so far. I'm always up for a good mystery! And trust me, I want answers.  In regards to the ama, I see lots of downvoted to his answers. This is unfortunate as this guy seems like a good guy, and seems to answer honestly. People might not like his answers, but he seems courteous and positive. I give a lot of credit to that. Reddit can be harsh, and he took it all in stride, graciously.    It's simple math. Just look at the board and count, you will find it =)   Cynicism aside, what has been discovered there actually is interesting. I think there is something there, even if they don't find it. There have been some odd things found there, structures underground that are made of non-local materials. To simply scoff at the whole venture is idiotic. If this kind of find was discovered in, Egypt, for example, no one would be scoffing at it.  In any case, treasure hunting is fun. There is mystery and myth. One day we might find something, or not. Heck, it could be originally a floating island and all those layers at the money pit could simply be the construction of the island itself. Who knows?    At a young age I figured out a trick to winning Battleship. No one ever figured out what I was doing, they just thought I was really good. And no, I wasn't peeking.    My boyfriend just got it and they took KoolAid man out of his inventory. He legitimately gained this character. :/   But fwwm was supposed to happen before everything else. She needs to be in the Red Room, she promised.   I'm sure it makes for interesting conversation with her gyno.   You gonna die. RIP   Been wondering about that myself.   I did, and I noticed it too.   And lots of black ops!   RIP drummah's sis   She is probably sick to death of all the damn calls lol   Spill over from r/nosleep.  OP is gonna die   Link?   OP won't return.   I checked. Saw nothing   A lot more than 6   Which chan is doing this?   You're gonna die, OP   Hmmm...   Has anyone checked the chan's to see if this is b? Or x?   Probably not related. Get on a bus and check it out!   I saw that too. Apparently the town is basically a no fly zone now.   You're probably already infected.    Get a life. It's over.   He wrote to me. It's a hoax. Lol   Lol!   So... talk   Seriously now, post a pic of your gf's teeth.if her hair starts falling out, post that too.    You should name the town. No one will bite otherwise...   Post tomorrow about your recovery...or the lack of it...   Can you give proof?   And what could they do?    Text! Find out! Post here with what you find, even if you find out its a hoax!   Drive man, Drive!   What did your friend text you?   Seriously? They followed you...   Why wait? Do it now.   Post a reply, man. We want to know.   Story from an older user... this is getting interesting. Are you posting for added hype or are you serious?   If you are serious, go to his house and see if he is ok. Take photos of the rash. Report, with photos, back here.   Haha, some people! Go Clyde for calling him out!   We will miss ya   It almost reminds me of the pit to hell. Old Art Bell stuff. Creepy.   I'm not sure if this is a hoax or some really serious issue. I'm torn.   Came here to say it was deleted, too. Repost?   Do it! If you spot anything, take pics and post them!   I would like to see the blogs, too. If real, this is some scary shit.   You are probably right. Also, drugs. =(   Is this really happening?   Omg, what the literal fuck is going on? Three stories... all similar in nature. If I close my eyes really tight and then open them, will it be a dream? This is really scary.   No, ebola works slower than this, right? Right?!   That is crazy. Those cold mountains and oceans definitely harbor secrets.    I am so scared for this kid. I wish he posted his state so someone here could take him for a few days and get his ass to a lawyer. He needs emancipation from his parents. No one deserves to go to a brainwashing camp. Hope he stays safe tonight, and not in the tree house. That is so cliche and one of the worst places to hide. Once they locate him there, and they easily will (whether or not his friend rats him out) he will be trapped. There will be no where to go but down into waiting restraints of goons and a long drive to Utah or Idaho *shudders*   They will put him out with meds, so he won't struggle. He needs to leave before they show up. As for taking a plane? They will drive him to their facility.   I agree, sleeping in a tree house will be the first place they'll think to look. You really need to find an adult who can harbor you for a while. Have them take you to a lawyer asap. This is no joking matter and shouldn't be taken lightly. Omg if I knew you, I'd help you. What your folks are doing is criminal and abuse. But don't stay at the tree house, you will be found.      Or street sweeping?   Thanks. I haven't started yet, but I do own a wonderful SW, SSB, Longwave, AM/FM radio. Something about being able to listen to the world has always fascinated me since I was little. The waves just floating through the air, needing an ear to listen. One day I decided I wanted to put out my own waves for others to hear. Someday that will be a reality for me. Thinking about it makes me smile. Maybe that sounds corny but it is so neat. It's wonderful to know it isn't dying out. So no, I won't let that guy get me down! I know one day when I am older someone will look to me for knowledge and support. I will recall that some won't help because they are crotchety and grumpy. I will take my time and help them.     I have to agree. I am interested in ham radio but not if people are going to judge me for it. Everyone has to begin somewhere and seeing that I have the potential to get hate instead of help, that's a big turn off.     	98

 I'm getting hives all around the area (underside of my forearm), up to my armpit and down across my stomach. I didn't see any caterpillar, so it's still undetermined exactly what it is.   I brushed up against a canvas car top carrier and got a bunch of like little black hairs stuck in my skin that started to burn two nights ago. I'm guessing it's from a caterpillar since I've had reactions from them before, but never have from poison ivy.     	3

So fuck you NBC Universal, If I can't see your fucking youtube video then I don't need to pay you for the fucking movie.    The main problem is when people have wood houses in tornado areas. The house turns into a mass of 200mph javelins with nails as the shrapnel. Doctors who have treated in tornado and hurricane disaster zones say building material impalements cause the most injuries and the worst injuries.   Here is the tin hat theory that actually makes sense:   The 1%'rs plan is to make billion$ by denying the problem- letting global warming naturally eradicate billions (worthless eaters) before the biosphere completely crashes. When the world population drops, the CO2 drops, the 1%'rs progeny can live as kings in their little paradise.  This would explain:  1. Sudden, strict 'austerity' measures in the EU.  2. The insane rush to drill baby drill.  3. 1st world police suddenly becoming militant and militarized.   4. Zero action being taken for mitigation of future known disasters, (sea levies   walls, desalination plants, etc.)  5. Politicians becoming much more corporate/elitist friendly (as a future survival tactic).  And a host of others.   If we get [to 5.6F \(3C\),](http://americablog.com/2012/12/world-temperature-increase-climate-change.html) theres no stopping the rest of the increase, since we will have lost control of the process. The process will end when human numbers and human industrial activity are so low that no further increase is possible.  6C is a global mass extinction event.    What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow    Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,     You cannot say, or guess, for you know only    A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,    And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,    And the dry stone no sound of water. Only    There is shadow under this red rock,     (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),    And I will show you something different from either    Your shadow at morning striding behind you    Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;    I will show you fear in a handful of dust.    Some have tried. And have gotten hacked, had death threats, harassment, threats of imprisonment, lost their positions, etc etc   Georgia suffered (along with the rest of the midwest-midsouth) from a stalled weather system last winter. Reason for the stalled weather systems happening everywhere now? Right here:  https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU  These stalled systems are responsible for most of the disastrous weather we have been seeing since 2010 or so, including the Russian - Northern EU heat wave and the CA Drought.   [Recall your winter.](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/29/22492664-thousands-still-stranded-on-atlanta-highways-after-snow-catches-south-unprepared?lite)   Why do you think they have been militarizing the police?   That's only for the people who can afford limo's. The rest of us, 1st world or no, are still hosed.   There are scientists moving their families to Amsterdam and buying houses in Greenland. I would say so.    One of these days all of these fucks will be in prison.       I don't understand this sentence  all the things he lived with gacy left me impressed    http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6904428  They lied to me.   By the time you pull it out it won't be a net any more.   30gal Breeders used to be easy to find years and years ago. Not anymore.    First time I ever used an artificial decoration in a tank. Daughters insisted so I did the best I could :D Thanks!   I always blame greedy people for everything. Greed has no creed or race.   sure ..uh.. secretp.   Having issues with this myself. Wanting to upgrade a gun but the rng on the weapons I have gotten is total shit for a bm hunter. I wish to god we had reforging back.    Note that's a large tank. Also note that he has a lot of tanks on there and there are other sellers, maybe one in your area. Main thing is I was directing you to some people who do tank building for you to work with.    I like this idea. And quest leveling should be more difficult to encourage teaming up with others as well as seeing more of the world. I like the idea of horizontal branching expansions- Lets get the Emerald Dream fulfilled ffs.   We don't need to level more by numbers- If you think about it gaining more levels is unnecessary. 100 could stay the peak, while gaining more in gear, rep and achieves.   I definitely prefer 40 Gallon Breeders for planted tanks. [So much room for activities!](http://imgur.com/a/oDOUG)   There is a 29 Bowfront Walstad in that album too.    Get a Frag Tank- like this one. Seller will set up dividers and drill where you want. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Frag-Tanks-coral-aquarium-saltwater-fish-reef-gallons-/161745110910   Algae need on average about 5 solid hours of light for a full photosynthesis. A longer time period than regular aquarium plants. If he only had them on for a couple of hours in the evenings it would not be too bad.    Very welcome. You also might look into LED strip lights for energy saving instead of flourescents.    And you never grew up with a great-grandmother and her friends talking about Germany- right before they fled in the late 1930's. Or her Russian friend who escaped Russia talking about the restrictions on freedom that came just prior to the curtain dropping.   Meanwhile we had hundreds of citizens get pulled over for no reason- cell phone contents downloaded and ZERO DUI arrests.  And over two counties we had one single death (driver) rollover and a head on with injuries - one driver drunk. The 'dui' checkpoint didn't prevent either.    Actually we have been at a nil El Nino for some time- it is just now growing. We have a stalled high pressure system because of an anomalously looping Jet Stream that is just sitting there.   Here is the reason for the stalled weather patterns that have been generating long term, horrific droughts in some places and floods in others:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAiA-_iQjdU   Sure. Fred Koch assisted the Russians under Stalin. He also set up oil refineries in Nazi Germany. He decided he hated communists and then went on to Mussolini.   We can start with the Nazis.   https://unknownjournal.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/-report-the-kochs-their-nazi-past-american-oil-the-foundation-of-republican-ideology/  http://www.democraticunderground.com/?com=view_post forum=1002 pid=2898599  I will have to say it is harder to find info on this than there was 8 years ago. A lot of articles that do exist kind of skip over the time period after he left Russia and jump right into the late 40's -50's.   The John Birch Society was formed to bring Mussolini style Corporo Fascism to the US by killing the Labor movement, unions, human rights, health care, welfare, etc. It now appears to be turning into a world-wide movement. In Europe it is called 'Austerity' programs.    actually does cost to put on event?  Not sure what you are talking about with Pagans and events. I am guessing the 'sockeye one' was a fire? Do you have a link to it- and your community center? I am very interested.   That would have been /r/StormComing.      If you don't care what's happening in India- just think about all of the MD's they export worldwide after graduation.    Here you go OP http://i.imgur.com/9crJxP6.jpg   Same way the Aliens think about us!    So all of the little bugs I have tossed outside instead of squishing are grateful? Awesome.   Which is why I can't post a story about Fukushima on /r/StormComing without an almost instant d/v.  Most recent? https://www.np.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/3c7fej/update_in_depth_fukushima_news_highest_levels_of/?     This is Mussolini's brand of Corporo-Fascism taken worldwide. Not surprising. The Koch Bros Dad, Fred, helped Mussolini design it, then came here to found it via the John Birch Society.            Side effect of the masses of hippies that used to have to go to the woods to smoke out. Second hand smoke chill. Why do you think bears were always begging snacks?   Puppies!!   Same as in the UK and northern Europe http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/11719200/Second-British-heatwave-could-bring-hottest-ever-temperature.html   Here is a good video tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsbB7FWJEoE         Do you guys even have AC up there?

They are under a high pressure system that has been sitting in place for weeks under a super high loop in the Jet Stream. The rains are following that loop north over the west- then dropping down past your area and drowning the midwest.  This is the underlying cause: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU   You are getting their rains. The rains are moving up over super high loop up over their region- then when it plunges down over your area, hitting warm air- you are getting dumped on.    This is the underlying cause: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU   It's not the 'blob'. It's *what* is causing the blob and the high pressure system that has been sitting in place for weeks under a super high loop in the Jet Stream. The rains are following that loop north.   This is the underlying cause: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU   The smoke has been as far south as Missouri.   I have been posting updates to /r/StormComing - including the fact that Alaska is burning.   http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/winds-blow-smoke-from-forest-fires-in-canada-into-midwest/article_3d3172d7-e6c8-5f32-8670-3db25c1a9734.html   There are over 2 million acres burning in Alaska as well. A record for 'wild fire season' and the season hasn't even started yet.   https://www.np.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/3c69ai/alaska_wildfires_have_burned_over_two_million/   I swear. The only stories on this sub that get instantly D/V- or DV at all, are stories on Fukushima. Every single time. You would think that the Nuclear Power Industry PR folks wrote a bot or something.    That is something I will look into. An interesting concept.    Wildfires are judged by how many acres- and so far with the season barely even underway this has been the worse, acreage wise.   I don't write 'em, I just post 'em.   This is one thing that Stephen King absolutely excels at. People and surroundings are clear - always.   Mexico has had horrible problems with Rabies- generally due to poverty (people not able to spay or immunize pets). They finally started a national immunization program. I am wondering what the issue is in Nebraska/Kansas.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18634477         Incline Villagers are new money people who supposedly come here to be closer to nature. Especially since, with climate change, it's so hot in the CA or NV Valleys.  These people are so arrogant that they literally have made a patrol organization at Incline Village that uses dogs and flash bangs to eradicate their beach of the Canadian Geese who have been using Tahoe Lake as a migratory resting layover for thousands of years. The shallow beach waters also provide a critical food source, especially now that most of the other waterways are dried up.  I have never been bothered by their occasional droppings on any other beach in Tahoe. We look forward to seeing them every year and it's an expected part of actually *being in* nature. But Incline Village residents think they are so special that they are willing to disrupt part of a life cycle of an incredibly important wildlife element so they don't have to see a little bird poo on the beach.   Worse, they are using the Park Service (taxpayer money) to do this on beaches they have privatized by residential / fee.  I know this is a small element to a much larger problem- but I just found out about this and it really irritates me.   https://www.yourtahoeplace.com/parks-recreation/outdoor-recreation/beaches/geese-patrol   TIL I'm not the only one who does this.

Samples: Banks foreclosing then taking over properties and using them for vacation or long term rentals instead of established owners.  Banks foreclosing or buying out owners of retail properties that were renting to local owned businesses at a normal price- then jacking the rent to ridiculous corporate rates and killing all of the cool little small businesses in favor of multinational/corporate establishment invaders.  These same corporate moneyed interests (starts with V, H and W in SLT) changing plans to widen 50 so that it doesn't touch their hotels but instead will run right through at least 6 small family owned hotels, effectively killing their businesses.  What this means is that most of this 'tax revenue' is going to leave the local area to corporate banks and tax shelters instead of being recycled through the community economy. And it will fuck an economy.   He is right- there is a 16% rise in tourists. Unfortunately they are all staying down in the Heavenly area in SLT and most of the local businesses are closed because of the banks (who I am sure are facilitating Vail) have raised rents on retail properties to astronomical rates on top of bad snow seasons couple years in a row.   Of course this means the tourists will be dropping money on a company that will immediately take it outside of the area.    A trend of moneyed interests have moved in and are screwing things up.

Whats really cool about the article is the video of the event taken from space- then a map of callers reporting it from earth.    Yeah there's a lot of awesome things and lot of shitty things that happen every expansion  Point being- at least there are normally a *lot of things* and not a lot of things taken away.  If I had known WoD was going to be this much of a contraction of the game I would never have bought it.    Did something happen with the WoW team? Did they move them all to Overwatch?  Or maybe moved to some indian or thai code sweatshop?   I cannot agree with you more. Subs that are too quick to down vote posts due to silly or inexplicable reasons will start losing folks faster than they gain them. Not only that but they end up being seen as hostile territory.   Quick example, I found this article that included a very interesting video by Nasa that showed, from space, burning space junk that lit up areas of Tennessee and other parts of the mid southern US. The video was gorgeous and the American Meteorological Society provided a map of incoming calls/reports on the flashes of light.  I submitted it to /r/space and within just a minute it was down-voted. Why? No clue. It was very off-putting though and I would probably never submit to /r/space again. That's pretty bad because I have been linked to them from my sub for over a year.    Too soon?   Very welcome. I'll try to keep up with them.

[12-year-old boy from Pleasant Grove was](http://fox13now.com/2015/07/01/12-year-old-boy-from-utah-bitten-by-shark-in-south-carolina/) bitten by a shark while swimming in South Carolina Tuesday.  ----------------------------------------   That's a reverse google translate for "But you are cooler now than the UK."  Maybe it is too early for comedy. :D   Il est trop putain de chaud! Mais vous tes plus basses aujourd'hui au Royaume-Uni   Nope. 6/2/15 was the first 80 degree flush of warm surface waters up into that region. And then just at northern border is this upwelling of very hot water from below the surface (the anomaly pic) that has been sort of 'wrapping' down in sort of a semi circle around the NC coast. That's been there for a while. So I am not sure if the guy is referring to surface temps or subsurface temps.  I just know the whole thing is around +5 degrees warmer than usual, generating a sort of shark cafe that young Bullsharks would flock to.  I lived near a pier that went out into very shallow water right next to a warm water ejection flow from a power generation station. I would take the kids to the pier to crab at low tide. The guys at the end of the pier would catch Bullsharks all night. Dozens of them. Of all of the fishing piers I hung out on this is the only one where I saw this level of shark activity.  That was what made me go look for warm water up-welling or currents when we got to our third attack.   you find out that 80 degree water (26.6 C) did not show up in lower NC until June.  June is when these attacks started, right about the time the heat anomaly began:   http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif   See the dark red spot off the east coast? That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the edges of the warm Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more shark attacks (normally) in Florida than NC.   Fishermen on the original post I made on this sub (at attack 7) are in agreement.    Definitely more than normal.    Please see my post at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/3bilr3/7th_shark_attack_off_north_carolina_2_more_over/  I'll show you what is most likely the issue right here:   http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomw.6.22.2015.gif  See the dark red spot off the east coast?  That heat anomaly has been there for a month now. Bull sharks (and their prey) typically love warmer water and normally hang around the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is closer to the coastline around Florida   farther off the coast on the eastern seaboard. Hence more shark attacks (normally) in Florida.  Right now I am sure they are coming up to that area of heat and playing / massing around the southern edge of it, which would be the N Carolina coastline.      And now we are up to 8. http://www.wbtv.com/story/29453751/report-another-shark-incident-in-outer-banks-3rd-in-week   That's the 8th Victim in less than a month. I was kind of confused by the Title as it attempts to seem as if there have only been 3 attacks. I suppose NC is probably worried about those holiday tourist dollars.  Did you see this post I made on a probable cause?   https://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/3bikes/recent_shark_attacks_now_up_to_7_in_carolinas/  And now we [are up to 7 attacks](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/29/three-new-shark-attacks-in-carolinas-puzzle-experts-and-scare-beachgoers/).

And they can't argue it.  God gave humans two gifts- Life and Free Will.  Without free will there is no sin because people lose the choice to sin or not.  When you legislate morality you are taking away that free will. You are taking away a gift that God gave human-kind. You are sinning then, by doing so.    Oui   You completely missed my point. Whoosh.   Casual play has always been a part of the game. I am more casual now. Nothing wrong with that. Point being that the game should not be focused 99% of the casuals and it needs enriched by giving people some choice back instead of running people through these stockyard fences like they are all idiots and need to be hand-held through out the game.   It's dumbed down to the point that it is boring.    I started playing when I was 40. Became GL when I was 41. It's 10 yrs later. Still playing.   Gotcha.   See this [chart of subscription numbers](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)?   Note how they start dropping in 2010. This is when Blizzard started catering to 'casual players' by introducing LFD/LFR.  'Casual players' are going to be the death of this game. You play Massive *Multiplayer* games in order to play with other people. Otherwise it could be called a 'Casual Solo game'.   Now - what is your definition of 'Casual'? Is it time based? Because our guild ran attunement quest and dungeon runs for incoming players several times a week, according to peoples needs and did 2 raids a week, split between 2, 40 man raid groups . If you don't have time to play 2-3 times a week- find another game.   Or is your definition of 'Casual' meaning you lack of motivation to gain basic skills?  Or maybe it's that you like to play solo. That's simply a personal choice on your part and shouldn't impact how the game is designed for the rest of us. Skyrim is waiting for you.   The thing about 'Casual' gamers is that they make no associations in the game- no friends to speak of and therefore will jump ship without even thinking about it once they become a little bored.  Serious MMO players have long term associations and friends and won't unsub out of boredom or temporary set backs.   Why has Wod dropped millions of subs? Because the casual players are bored. It's that simple. I can guarantee that the people still playing are those with associations in the game or old timers hoping blizz will get a clue and get the game back on track.  Yes, let's get back to the way things were- back when there were 12 million people happily playing the game and re-subbing every month. You have a problem with that? Because I don't.     Encore un coups de l'immigration.  Not sure what you mean by this.    For everyone who would think the 90's 'isn't too bad'- people in the UK don't have (or generally need) air conditioners. And they are definitely not physically attuned for this level of heat.      Everything in vanilla was behind extensive gear and consumable grinds. Ever done the Onyxia quest chain? The gating in vanilla is unsurpassed for the most part.  We weren't doing simple, mind numbing repeatable grinds in Vanilla.   Huge, huge difference.   We would go on difficult missions and epic quests to get, for example,  the Key (Seal of Ascension) for UBRS. And it made sense, because in doing BRD for the Gems to make the Seal you would be getting Fire Resist gear and patterns that you needed eventually for MC. In addition, you were skilling up your toon and getting raid ready.  For us players it was like getting in shape for a marathon run, but a lot more exciting. We never saw it as gating- it was a series of adventures that you did *on your own timetable*. Best of all, they made perfect sense in leading through progression.   I read an article not long ago that was attempting to explain the reasons behind the drop off of wow players starting in 2010. The main conclusion of 'Professional Game Advisors' is that was when Facebook style games on handhelds became popular.  Seems like blizzard/activision honchos drank that koolaid instead of asking the players what the problem was - or actually checking their own forums. Of course it's an 'easy out' to think that your customers are just playing these UI games now rather than accept you fucked your game up, admit to it and make corrections.   Instead they thought that they could make Wow a big Facebook game and everyone would flock back. This just tells me that people in positions of power can be really, really stupid.      I dont agree with them scaling back anything once it's introduced, for anyone. But if they are worried about gold farmers running hundreds of garrisoned alts- then what I recommended above is what they should do.   Since /u/gereth is a helluva mod -it can certainly pass. We do post storm warnings and other types of warnings- and have helped people; from some of the messages I have received, so no biggie. We are pretty relaxed 'round here. Main pet peeves being posted in the sticky.                      Exactly what I came in to say. Dump the circle.    This is gorgeous work. I really feel that people are becoming sick and tired of the 'minimalist' trend and want to see something more rich, touchable and layered in their environment. Architecture firms and interior designers are still pushing minimalism because it's inexpensive and done so much the plans are just re-used.  But I was just recently contracted for [some work](http://i.imgur.com/PzpAK9t.jpg) and I see more of this on the horizon. I say go for it.    How hard would it to be to scale back the amount of G per mission in accordance with the number of active garrisoned alts per account? It's math. Math translates to code. It's not that hard.  Instead of whacking everyone- including those of us with just a few alts- go after the gold hoarders.   And as soon as an element such as shipyards starts looking like a gold / time sink via gating- I'm done.  Edit- you should post this to bliz forum.   Thank you very much. The Joplin Globe reporters and employees are real heroes in my eyes. I read quite a bit about how reporters stayed at their posts, not even knowing if their homes were destroyed- and the follow up work you did was amazing.    That's a great video. Where were you when it was happening?  edit: just finished it- I take that back. That is a fucking amazing video. The bravery of those involved- firefighters and videographer - was just amazing.     1  Instead of just saying "It's a propaganda outlet." PROVE the stories linked are wrong. Otherwise your statement has no meaning whatsoever.   If you had public utilities still, you could have voted the guy out. Once privatized- you can't touch them. And you will never be able to vote on a rate hike again, or see their budgets, or internal safety reports. You lost infrastructure that your grandparents and great grandparents built for you to some slimy little corporate ceo to make millions from.    Then it should have been happening since fishermen used the pier the first time- decades ago.    At the bottom of this article http://maptd.com/joplin-tornado-before-and-after/   is a link to a KML file to use with Google Earth to see Joplin immediately after the tornado and compare it to 'before'. This is probably the best mapped area that I have seen. You can then use the 'calendar' tool on Google Earth to see it in 2015.   One striking thing, and I think a constant, painful reminder for residents, is the tree destruction. I am wondering about the psychological impact of this.    As we go into the 'new' fire season (used to be in late summer to fall) and things are heightening, here is an active fire map that is constantly updated. Please bookmark for use- especially if you live in the West.   Link: http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us                  I have been curious and using Google Earth extensively, to look at areas before and after extreme tornado disasters.  In most cases I have seen a lot of empty lots, driveways that go nowhere being overcome with grass, dead tree stalks, empty parking lots with bits of rubble around the edges.  For all of the 'Rebuild- its the American way!' and "Coming back Strong!" that starts shortly after the dead have been counted, it seems that these places either take a long, long time to come back or perhaps never really do.   Is anyone familiar with any studies that have been done on this? What are your thoughts on it?  http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/church-rebuilt-after-being-destroyed-by-tornado-has-closed/article_dd414571-6781-59c6-bbd1-6123ceb47be1.html               Great explanation - thank you!  And I just saw that N.Carolina is offering free fishing in all public inland and coastal waters on the 4th of July.

Hope this doesn't turn into one of those "What were they thinking?!" moments.        Holding my breath through the entire thing. If this were a tornado it would be an EF6.       And as humans are the next 'dinosaurs' we have a clue as to the future without us.   Interesting that another person (in comments) got video the same thing. No clue what it could be.   That's a dream team right there.   Imagine if old horse and buggy makers had a massive lobby power back when cars started becoming popular.   They would have been passing laws left and right: No driving cars on Sunday, only 2 gallons of gas allowed per week, stipend taxes paid to the Buggy Industry, etc.  These Utilities are going the way of the Dinosaur- passing laws right and left to keep you on the teat as long as they can. Too damn bad we privatized them and made this a for-profit industry. In places that the public still owns their own utility you don't see crap like this, because the public decides these things.  Hopefully in a generation people will be running their own personal power locally off of locally manufactured renewables (jobs and energy) and can tell these guys to take a hike.   I hope to hell NC is able to stop more US dollars from going offshore via this whack ass plan. That money needs to stay in NC and the US to help bolster local economies- not the bank accounts of spanish fat cats.  Have NC politicians completely lost their minds? At the very least this is a violation of their oath of office to be loyal to the State and the People of the State.    Me too.

Just stay away from women on their periods or children with cuts on their knees (99.9% of the child population on earth) and you will be just fine.   Corporate can pressure their franchise owners to change their business practices- especially if they are making the whole franchise look bad- which this is.

That hot mass shows no sign of dissipating, it seems to be getting larger. I'll be keeping an eye on it.      Armageddon? Not sure, kind of looking like it though. Check /r/StormComing for the list.       The reason for the existence of this sub is the fact that starting about 6 years ago I witnessed the Jet Stream and resulting weather patterns perform more anomalous feats than in my previous 40 years of extreme weather studies. Others were noticing too, and the data was verifying it. Not only that, but the [massive increase in damage to people and infrastructure started being noted.](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/docs/smith-and-katz-2013.pdf)   Then in 2012 Rutgers and University of Japan did a study as to why was the Jet Stream running in these anomalous patterns, slowing, stalling, generating long term droughts and record rainfalls, etc.   Here is a [small video explaining the results.](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU) The published paper has stood the test of time and become even more recognized.

Right now I am sure they are coming up to that area of heat and feeding / massing around the southern edge of it, which would be the N Carolina coastline. Y'all are collateral damage.

 wtf Hull are in the premiership   I snotted   Cheers. I was interested in seeing the whole game to look at tactics and the like. Will check out the goals here anyway!   ok thanks for the heads up   Rights that it I'm reporting you   Progress breeds progress?      Every day, chip away   Dart is awesome because the games are so short. And they're so talented it's crazy. The crowd go mental the whole time wearing funny hats and getting pissed and the players are just *ftt ftt ftt*   Mmmmicchaaellllll!!!!   St Stephen's Tower   wikihow   Nice Porsche Engineering sticker!   This is terrifying   Any examples to further explain this?    For some reason I'm annoyed that the girl doesn't say thanks. The mother does, I feel like she should have asked her child to say thank you.    does she break her left arm?   yay lets bomb insurgents    hope op comes through   Haha looks thick as pig shit, she's a cutie though   Haha there's a running joke in my family that True Lies is on tv EVERY new year's eve and EVERY easter sunday. But it's not really a joke because that's the only time it's on tv.   When my sister was 4 she insulted a family friend by saying, "YOU APPLE-HEAD!"   Iniesta ran the wrong side of the ref, he would have been able to cut that out if he ran to the right of him.    I watched that about 30 times    Dude me too, my dream is to be a house-husband   Your comment made me go "hur-hur!" like a caveman but I'm on my own so it's ok.    Song Cry is a masterpiece. The emotion Hov generates make this one of those songs you listen to on a rainy walk through the city thinking about old friends and girls gone past.    -  "We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather, now we fly first class to change the forecast."  - "We was on the block since free lunch, we shoulda been together eatin' Four Seasons brunch"  - "They say you can't turn a bad girl good, but once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever, I mourn forever, shit I've gotta live the fact I did you wrong forever."  U Don't Know is a masterpiece. His braggadocious lyrics walk us through his gang-banging beginnings and his rise to the top. I get so pumped listening to this track, makes me want to put on a tux and sell crack in a police station.  - "One million, two million, three million, four, five years later, forty million more."   - "Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I triple my worth"  - "I'm rapin' Def Jam till I'm the hundred million man."  - "I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell, I am a hustler baby, I sell water to a well."  Heart Of The City is a night-time driving song, a street-beating, atmosphere -soaking, big-pimping classic. The instrumental on its own is a classic.   - "Young fucks spitting at me, young rappers getting at me, my nigga Big predicted the shit exactly, mo money, mo problems gotta move carefully, cos faggots hate when you getting money like athletes."  - "But the only thing running is numbers fam, Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?"  - "Ain't no love in the heart of the city, ain't no love in the heart of town"  Shit this album is straight bangers all the way through and Hov's lyrics and flow really take you on a journey. It gets me so excited for... I don't know. The future? The past? You'll be rapping to this for months afterwards without even realising. The Blueprint is what made me fall in love with Jay-Z.    Im the foot fuckin' Masta!    Thanks!   Thanks OP, any links?   Say What's Real and Ignant Shit are played endlessly   Not quite the same but recently I met some guys from England and there were lots of foreign people there too. They would occassionally slip into a high-pitched Geordie (Newcastle, England) accent so they couldn't be understood by non-native English speakers.   There was an American girl there who said she couldn't understand them when they spoke like that. One of the guys turned to the other and said in high-pitched Geordie, "She's got a right set of bangers on her!".   She totally understood that time.    On my days off I love going to a cafe and having breakfast and coffee.    Dude this is the kind of stuff dreams are made of   *Wily   anyone got the tape   BALD STEEL!   Yeah it's great, mental too  	38
                               Your pet is 14 years old? Please don't make me be the one to break it to you about animal lifespans.         That would actually be a brilliant scam.         An article about the man, great read: http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/09/jackson-c-frank-tragic-tale-forgotten-60s-legend   I don't even doubt she was successful in a few shops. We probably won't hear about that!      I've always been curious about why Flash is so bad. Is it that they have really bad engineers? Or do they legitimately face problems that other platforms don't due to their popularity?   I can't imagine Flash is going to survive this. Has there ever been a time when it worked?   A couple more links about reddit's changing direction:  [FW: reddit cofounder consulting for Stratfor to bring in the social media dollars ](https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=282044)  [Reddits troubles mount as chief engineer Bethanye Blount quits](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/07/14/reddits-troubles-mount-as-chief-engineer-bethanye-blount-quits/)         Thanks. The guy's life story was so heart breaking and his music was so beautiful that he really deserves more recognition.   Blood Meridian was a great book. Here's a good one that basically reads like something Cormac McCarthy might write only it's non-fiction: [The Halliburton Agenda](http://down.cenet.org.cn/upfile/29/200712222445129.pdf). A great read, it really shows how dirty Texas politics/business can get.         Thanks. That's quite a trove.   [Alexis and Stratfor](https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=282044)   I think it's loosely based on MKULTRA. Not sure what angle they're playing, if it's a spoof or if it's informative. Would like to see it.   I totally agree. I think there's zero chance they abandoned this research. The video isn't disinfo per se, the people piecing together the story of MKULTRA back then were working with what they had, and I regard this as an interesting timepiece because it shows that the press was interested in these issues in the late 70s. Proof that they didn't get rid of their programs is the Army's [SERE program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape) which has an "anti-torture" manual that teaches soldiers how to resist torture. It has the consequent effect however of teaching people what to do if they actually want to torture. A lot of SERE and modern interrogation programs come out of the MKULTRA era.      That's the thing, a lot of people don't realize that the same people go back to Vietnam, pulling the same tricks.   Sandwich! I think I was just thinking about eating some soup...   Joe Rogan tried to make a case for DMT. I wouldn't put him in their league, and I don't think he's trying to be them, but DMT: the Spirit Molecule was interesting if you haven't seen it. Other than that, I'm starting to see a resurgence of research into using  MDMA and even LSD in helping people suffering from PTSD. I doubt that there will ever be the same kind of psychedelic free for all that people witnessed in the sixties, but I do think that these things will make their way back in therapeutic settings. There is a sizeable community of people discussing psilocybin, not only how to cultivate it but also swapping experiences with it. Terrence McKenna's brother Dennis is still active and in fact writes for Reality Soup. Reality Soup isn't a bad forum for these things if you don't know about it. As far as a new Tim Leary, do we need that?   I don't think psychedelic research will ever go away. It's too weird and fascinating to get buried. Terrence McKenna was great. I have a lot of time for people who got into that kind of exploration but at the same time I'm skeptical of the context that surrounded their research. Another person to read, if you're interested in stories set in sensory depravation tanks, is Stanislaw Lem. He wrote a Polish psychedelic sci fi masterpiece called Solaris, but his short fiction is also incredible.         Then you might enjoy reading about John Lilly if you haven't already: [John Lilly](http://realitysandwich.com/219385/the-unlimited-mind-of-doctor-john-c-lilly/)    I only know what is in the video... I assume you're talking about the guy in Michigan. There's been a discussion about him on /conspiracy the last couple of days. I don't know the facts of his case beyond what he is claiming, but he definitely seems to be making choices that are not coming from a calm, rational place.    No, I totally agree. I just think his irrational mindset was down to the pressure he was feeling. It's unfolding right at this moment with this man in Michigan: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20aPHGXJk4E feature=youtu.be). No question that the best solution in this current case would be to fight back non-violently using the press, legal appeals, and other means. But we've all been in the position at some point in our lives where we felt so much pressure we couldn't think straight.   Thanks for your post. I agree with all that. It's just that I have no idea what I'd personally be capable of if I felt my family was threatened. So I don't mean to exonerate Randy Weaver for doing something a bit boneheaded, but it just seems to me that his crime was a small one compared to the pre-meditated decision by the authorities to manufacture the scenario where he would be tempted to commit that crime.          I read about that case before. That was horrible. Seriously though, don't underestimate how intimidating it can be when these people in law enforcement decide to put pressure on you to act how they want you to act. They have a lot of tools, and even smart people get sucked into their schemes.   Someone posted this yesterday about the use of scopolamine in Columbia. This actually happened to a friend of mine in another country: (http://www.vice.com/video/colombian-devil-s-breath-1-of-2)   Bingo. Now you've got it. Which means a lot of teachers are smart enough to be aware of the nightmare they're trapped in, perpetuating lies and distortions.   I would say it all comes down to individual lazymindedness. But that is very likely going to describe the individuals who constitute the majority of the population at any given time. Reason and rationalism are the path out of sleep. The path in is unreason. Which is not to say the forces of unreason are unreal. Sports mania and crowd psychology in sports stadiums is a great example of this. A crowd cheering has a demonstrable effect on the performance on the field by the players. This is down to belief, which is effectively a psychological state. But I would be careful in calling psychological states or beliefs unreal. Like Robert Anton Wilson said: reality is a set of beliefs waiting to be replaced by another set of beliefs.   They're under a spell. The truth is magic is real, always has been. Talismans work. Flags are talismans. The American flag is an especially powerful talisman. The Pentagon is a very powerful symbol that exerts control over large groups, not just Americans, others as well. The building projects a sense of power and durability. We live in a world largely controlled by magic. People who don't know this fact are actually experiencing the effects of the magic being used against them. But then again, this is crazy talk.   Johnson had a very violent history in Texas, he murdered his way to the top. Texas has always been a very nasty place politically and the oil and gas industry on the one hand and construction industry on the other (Halliburton and KBR) are rumored to have  histories full of murder and intimidation. Here is a posting about an early Johnson linked murder, not the only one: (http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=6005)  An earlier incarnation of KBR built all the roads, buildings, bases, and airstrips as well as supplying most of the supplies for the entire Vietnam conflict. Johnson had been their boy since the 40s, and the company's shady history reads like the Godfather.   Will the new movie show ISIS re-destroying the ancient archaeological sites that the US army already destroyed? Could be a winning plot angle. Along with Sylvester Stalone trying to pronounce Nebuchadnezzar.   Let me echo what TheSkwamatConnection said about Evidence of Revision. If you have a spare ten hours, it could change your life. Incredible documentary that basically argues that Johnson was deep in the conspiracy: [Evidence of Revision full documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHb5X3fFhPw)   I used to teach. In my experience, there are a lot of good people who will try to buck the system, but they tend to get weeded out or worn down over time.   He went to one or two of their meetings because they were his neighbors and he wanted to have good relations with them. He didn't buy into their belief system and decided to stop going. That was the point when the government targeted him as a potentially useful informant. They set up an innocent guy. It was entrapment.   And on an individual level, I think you're right. But brainwashing and propaganda are linked, and they both are effective when they create a context. Certain individuals will always be able to think their way past the traps that get set up by the powers that be, but a large chunk of the population will get sucked in. That's useful to those in power. I don't think they necessarily care that much about individuals, they try to manipulate groups.   I feel like there's a real distinction between natural substances like psilocybin and synthetic ones like LSD. I'm not judging people who like LSD, and I've taken it myself in the past, but it seems very possible that it manipulates mass behavior in more or less predictable ways. A great example of this -and I'm really not saying this was a conspiracy or that it was even a bad thing - was the use of ecstacy in England in the rave scene in the late 80's. The drug became popular with football fans and basically wiped out hooliganism and violence between supporters. As for hypnosis, it's like propaganda, it doesn't work as well on individuals as on groups. However MKULTRA was trying to target individuals. They only ended up destroying people's minds.   Someone posted this a few days ago in case you haven't seen it yet: [Jon Ronson on the Joe Rogan podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUuFMjhRkmU). He's not only a great journalist, he's also very funny.   Thanks, I'll look at that. I'm very interested in this subject. People don't realize but it was actually something that was discussed back in the sixties by young people involved in radical politics. They were very suspicious of the hippy movement and what was driving it.   I can't imagine what they were up to with LSD, but I feel like it had a lot to do with taking the energy out of the anti-war movement. The hippies became very inward looking and narcissistic. A lot of them moved to the country and disengaged from protests. I wonder if that wasn't the plan all along?      I think that was because the landlord that owns the buildings around Zuccotti Park had to sign a lease on the park allowing people to use it 24/7 which wasn't the case anywhere else. That was a loophole that delayed eviction for a few weeks, where the police had power to remove protestors from other parks including Washington Square. In fact, they did remove people from Washington Square whenever the police decided they might be trying to set up shop. There was a lot of discussion about moving to Washington Square park but most people were scared of the police reaction. There was at least one general assembly there which I went to.  Also, one funny fact, almost nobody at Zuccotti Park knew that Adbusters started the protest!   Well here's one example from about 1955: [Life magazine article about Gordon Wasson's hunt for psilocybin in Mexican highlands](http://www.imaginaria.org/wasson/life.htm). Henry Luce controlled a lot of media back then including Time and Life magazines and he LOVED LSD. Luce publications were the same ones declaring that 1967 was going to be the  "Summer of Love" and encouraging young people to go to San Francisco. The underground press thought that was insane and realized it would be a public health catastrophe. As for television and movies, lots of them began to adopt psychedelic themes, especially Star Trek. And Timothy Leary was after all something like a televangelist.   Thanks.   Amazing story. Teachers should be encouraging students to learn about this stuff, not discouraging it.      Will do.   It's part of a series of docs Jon Ronson did called "Secret Rulers of the World". One part was on the Bilderbergers and is great because he gets into a low speed car chase. Here's a link to one of them: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQKTMjApnkI)    Burundanga, aka Colombian Devils breath  Something exactly like this happened to my friend in Nigeria. She "donated" all her family's possessions and cars to two thieves after they'd rubbed some powder on her skin. Scary shit!   That's no joke. Check out this article by sportswriter Dave Zirin who learned through a FOIA release that his anti-death penalty group in suburban Maryland had an undercover FBI agent going to the meetings even though it was a small group (apologies for the Huffpost link, usually try to avoid it) (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-zirin/cointelpro-comes-to-my-to_b_113930.html)   Thanks!   I have a lot of time for Jon Ronson, who happens to be good friends with another great documentary maker, Adam Curtis. Ronson was actually there. This doc got me to get off my high horse thinking people in the militia movement were "nuts". I disagree with them about a lot of stuff, but they're far from nuts. If I'd been at the roadblock to Ruby Ridge while the authorities were shooting at this poor family, I might have woken up sooner.      This goes deep. Montreal was a center of CIA activity and research since they felt secure being outside of the reach of the US legal system. A lot of Canadians had their lives taken away from them. Cameron wasn't some run of the mill quack either. He was head of  both the Canadian and World Psychiatric Associations in the 1950s and 60s.   Good for you. I admire that. Personally, I'd be concerned about the police using asset seizure against people who deal in cash though.      This video really shows how bad it is. I mean, the guy didn't even seem to be busking. He just wanted to give his show on the 4th of July. He was getting set to move along, but the cops couldn't stand having something happening that they didn't get to control. I mean, what kind of people are against a dude playing the Star Spangled Banner on his guitar? They're like cyborgs.   For years there was a thriving houseboat community in Sausalito but I think it's been squeezed out by developers using different ploys: (http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2013/05/21/the-story-of-a-sausalito-anchor-out)   Thanks for that. I mean, I'm all for paying taxes, but if it is impossible to ever have a lifestyle where you can't avoid taxes, then that means you're being taxed by the very act of your being born. We should have some possibility of opting out if we don't use services taxes pay for.   I absolutely agree with that.    Investigators are still out there, but look at what happened to Michael Hastings. It really feels like information is being micro-managed now in a way it wasn't even a few years ago. We rely too much on information dumps that may or may not be real.   The Danny Casolaro story, like Gary Webb's,  is simultaneously inspiring and frightening. It also gets to the heart of why it's hard to expose so many of these conspiracies. They get so convoluted and expansive that it can be insanely hard to comprehend let alone explain to other people. I think I'll post some of this stuff later. Know any good Mae Brussell shows dealing with reservations?   Oh she is just fucking awful. The worst. I used to read the Guardian years ago in print form when it was an outstanding paper. It's saddening how downhill it has gone. Their support of Pao is just weird.   Wounded Knee was messed up. It's also confusing because in addition to the FBI, wasn't there also a problem with local organized crime that had hijacked the reservation? Reservations are exploited in a lot of ways by the federal government. The Cabazon reservation  in California was used by the US for bio-chemical weapons research well into the 80's since federal mandates prohibiting such research don't apply on reservations. Probably still is used for that. In exchange, they were given a casino.   I've actually become interested in this recently because I'm seeing a neighborhood near me undergo gentrification. Right now, it's in the happy early stage where drug dealers are being evicted. Pretty soon however, it's inevitable that lower crime and new residents with better education and salaries will cause property taxes to rise. This is going to force out most of the decent working people who've had to put up with the criminality for years. I'd like to discover some workaround to help those families from inevitably being moved out of their old neighborhoods.   Is this the only way someone could avoid owing property tax? The Amish sometimes donate their land to their church to avoid it, but most people would seem stuck with paying it whether they use services or not.   Aren't they technically considered outside of the US?            It's almost as if they concocted the plan with the assistance of [these guys](https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=282044).     	92
 You can't use posts on a forum as an unbiased sample. People go on forums for two reasons - to connect with other enthusiasts and to bitch.  The majority of people who own any particular vehicle aren't even going to be online.  Of the more than 10 Twins in my immediate area only three are on the forums with any regularity.   Stuh...dee?  Does not compute.   Googled this, found an interesting article.  http://www.tahosy.dk/handleplaner%20forankringssteder/tinnitus/j.1365-2273.2001.00490.pdf   I haven't used the Diz on the 6+ but I've had four on various other phones.  The only reason I didn't get one is that it's got a square(er) edge so you lose the shape of the phone.  The NGP is rounded.   I started with a Tech 21 but actually ended up with the NGP.  I think you'll like it.   It's about damn time!   Best Buy TPU or Diztronic for real cheap.  For not quite as cheap, Incipio NGP.   What kind of a degree is she getting?  Make it something representative but stylized (this is sort of a takeoff on the idea of her standing on a skyscraper that /u/Rosetti had).  For example - architect?  Draw her directing the building of the pyramids.  Physicist?  Facing into the page wearing a lab coat, shading her eyes against a distant nuke blast.     Yeah, I mean, for me it's the high frequencies where I go into severe territory so anything I can do to get some clarity, I'll do.  Drives my girlfriend nuts (I think) though.   Smaller car.  ;)  Surprisingly roomy though.   What leads you to believe this is a 2016 and not representative of the very limited edition 2015 MY?   Yeah, I didn't figure as much.  I've just never seen that type of plate before (only lived in the area not quite two years) and the interior looked suitably ancient.  Obviously the Mustang wheels are a hint but anyone can change wheels.   So funny story...I actually ordered six of them.  They go half price when you order more than 5 so I figured why not.  I might do one front, one back, and have some spares.   It's my b-day 5/12.  Been my screenname for well over 20 years now.  if you run into a train_subject5569 on the internet, it's me.  That does cause some problems with anonymity though.  And yes, I do.  Winter is coming.  But I know nothing, so...Actually though she's Ghost because she's white.  She also screams.  I guess I could have called her Banshee too.  But I like Ghost and so does my girlfriend, so it's stuck.   http://i.imgur.com/EWFzV.gif  I love love love to feel the beat.  But I have to also crank the heck out of the treble to be able to understand anything.  :D   Moderate to severe; seems to be growing worse over time.  Bad tinnitus.  Was hit by a car as a child and suffered head trauma so that's the suspected cause.  I've got Bachelor's (Electrical) and Master's (Systems) degrees in Engineering and work for the US Government.   NF2?   My phone keeps changing the number 2 to "to" for some damn reason...   And how will you feel two years down the line when you've moved that card into the HTCP in your bedroom because you couldn't even sell it for $100 on eBay?  Yeah, that's called technology.  :D   There is a reason I have a meme pic of Grumpy Cat saying "I AM smiling" above my desk.  Also, diagnosed?  INTJ isn't a condition, internet person.  It is a part of who you (and some of us) are.  It's not a bad thing.  It's not a good thing.  it's just A thing.  People will not always understand you.  That's their problem.      Also the vents on either side of the rear glass have partial covers to help direct air in (at least on the Z07).   Uh, there are plenty of skinny people who are not fast, strong or healthy.  Just saying.  ;)  That said, yes, it is generally a good idea to lose weight.  And an even better one if you have a motorcycle too.         No, but worse mileage and sluggish throttle response will result from having disconnected the battery.  This will go away as the ECU relearns the car and your driving style  (20 - 50 miles).  It also happens when you reprogram the car with updated tunes (but you didn't mention anything about that).   Did you disconnect the battery while you were doing the change?   Yes, it is.  Saw it there after Boxerfest two weekends ago.  Didn't have a transmission yet.   Sell the phone on eBay and use it to pay off the contract?   The camo pattern and the bar are so close together it was hard for me to initially tell.  I'm still not 100% sure either way.      Agree.  Reflections don't match and while the other pipes cast shadows on the ceiling, the ones holding the tanks don't.   Good luck...I've had an absolute hell of a time trying to sell mine.  Between people trying to low ball and getting jerked around by scammers who don't show up to prearranged meetings, I'm about ready to just donate them and write them off.   Sounds pretty meaty.  I like it.  Are you all stock ahead of the overpipe (header, intake, etc.)?   To whomever downvoted me - it's nice that you are either pro-LGBT or antigun.  You have that right.  But you have to look at the whole picture.  Increased funding for schools (taxes).  Increased welfare (taxes).  Against immigration reform.  The only thing the guy has going for him is that he's pro-LGBT and pro-choice.  Why can't we have a candidate who'll just live and let live, so to speak?  You know, a Libertarian.   You almost had me, but he's totally for gun control.  This is why you can't be a single issue voter.  Also, the guy is a lifelong politician.  First campaign in 1972?  He's 73!     Holy hell that's fast.  Best I've ever done was 38 and that was pretty awesome.   It's Lake Bled in Slovenia.  I've been there :)   Yes, because more than half of all marriages don't end in divorce *rolls eyes*   Oh come now, shouldn't it be Hamsters and Wolverines?   So that car we saw at Boxerfest and then later it showed up to the afterparty/dyno day at Pure Auto.  The louvers look really good on the car in motion.  Stupid, stupid expensive though.     The LS2 is in a different vehicle now.  I had some pics of it too but just the engine bay.  When I dropped my car off for springs I go to hear it running.  Reminded me of my former GTO *sniff*.   It didn't have a transmission installed in it yet.  So, no.  The other car with the dyno sheet taped to the front made 588rwhp though; that was an FA20 with a Full Blown turbo kit.  There were several people joking though that the turbo wasn't big enough because folks could fit their hands between it and the fuse box.  In addition to the green one there were actually three 2JZ Supras, an old Cressida with a 2JZ swap and a 240SX with an SR20DETT (I think; I'm not as familiar with Nissans).  And an R32 Skyline GTR.  And a new GTR, a ZR1, a C6 Z06...   The 86 platform vehicles come either as a manual or a traditional automatic (torque converter).  Having paddles does not make them "semi-automatic" or a DCT/MCT.  Many automatic transmission vehicles come with paddles these days.  That's not to say the transmission isn't good, though.  You will however notice a significant difference due to the lower gearing of the automatic and the rear end used in the automatic cars (which is why they also get substantially better gas mileage than the manual).    I used to be.  I got rid of Facebook a few months ago.   Lem: Oh, my God. Maybe we're evil scientists. Phil: (laughing manically) I'm sorry. I laugh like that when faced with an unpleasant truth. That's why I got thrown out of that Al Gore movie.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCobLOb7UTQ   So these are just some pictures I took yesterday at the Mid-Atlantic Boxerfest at FedEx Field in Landover, MD.        Dip dip potato chip.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQEzGSnzi5I   Some say that a supervolcano might look something like this...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzk1uqxpfoY   If we weren't talking about something that only happened a few years ago, I'd agree with you.  But we're talking about 18 year olds who bullied/were bullied earlier in their teen years.  Class reunion time another 10 years down the line is the time for reconciliations.  Right now, they've both still got an absolute ton of growing up to do.  Not that I disagree with OP's sentiment in any way.      Ah hahahahahahahahahaha.  Live your life for a bit and then get back to us.    p.s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrxI_euTX4A   Find an old Thrustmaster kicking around and pick up Flying Nightmares.  AV-8B sim.  http://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=2722   Love that the first comment to the post is a CF'er.       Easy.  Pilot ID becomes RFID enabled and the lock is no longer controlled by a person.   I've always enjoyed Carcassonne.   Have one also, grey tinted Classic Check.   Good news everyone!  I mean, good luck!   Yep, I have a turn I take coming home that is a greater than 90 degree right hander - not quite a U-turn but nearly.  Nannies normal on stock tires they cut in hard but VSC in Sport I can execute a very graceful drift (under the speed limit with a green light and no pedestrians or cross traffic to yield to, of course).   Been watching this on wunderground all week.  Forecast kept going back and forth between snow and rain here in MD but settled on rain.   No.   No.   That's because a 225/40-18 is half an inch bigger in diameter than the stock 215/45-17.  A 225/35 would've been .4 inches smaller.  OP did about the best he could do, but I'd have gone smaller personally.  That combo probably weighs a ton more than stock given XXRs and Chinese tires.   You didn't get enough baggies.  I only see two boxes.   Did you take the stickers off your side windows or were they rolled down?  Can't tell with the beer goggles on the camera haha.  You are the guy from Bakersfield right?   No, no they don't.  But yes, it was.  Back when there was precipitation that regularly fell from the sky, anyway.   I had a salesman tell me the BRZ was a turbo and had AWD while he was showing to to me.  This was in Annapolis if anyone is wondering.  It doesn't matter the brand - there are know-nothings just trying to put money in the bank in every showroom.   Cb is a special edition only, supposed to appeal to women or some such BS; it's not a facelift.    And I see no one actually answered your question, so I will.  The Monogram was a 2014 only deal and they were "limited" production.  Plenty to be found on lots still but they are all leftovers at this point.  However, Scion being Scion you can look forward to a new special edition each model year with pretty good certainty.  2013 - Sc10n Series ///  2014 - Monogram ///  2015 - Release Series 1.0 (FR-S) / Series.Blue (BRZ) ///  2016 - ...?  Whatever it is I can assure you it won't be a convertible or have a turbo contrary to what blogs you may read.   Ok, well, go have a seat over there and think about what you've done and how you'll make it up to her.   Are you wiring up the rear fog as a brake light, is that the idea (the central red reflector in the bumper on US vehicles is the rear fog in other countries)?   And they've done the same on the new GT3 RS.  It also is the first serial production car with a magnesium roof - even lighter than carbon fiber.   Between LWCP, LWFW and DS you're taking about 25 lbs out of the car.  Look at it that way.   I looked at it from the perspective of taking four pounds (I have the Raceseng) off the very front of the car - not so much for the rotating mass benefit but the improvement to the polar moment of inertia and CG of the vehicle (between the stock muffler-single delete and spare/tool removal that's almost 60 lbs off the extreme rear of the car).  Balancing that in the engine bay is harder and more expensive but every little bit helps.  Up front I did the pulley for -4 lbs and LiFePO4 batt for -26 lbs but I also did Grimmspeed MC brace, STB and intake for a gain of around 4-5 lbs.  Net change up front then is -25 lbs give or take.   Carbon DS is actually smaller diameter so it has less chance of interference with whatever exhaust you might run.  But they cost basically 2x as much.  Both AL and CF are significantly lighter than stock though.   I can totally appreciate being away and wanting to get right in it but dude, let her warm up first.  Foreplay before the main event.  Revving a cold engine is about the worst thing you can possibly do...   On this platform that's called a front pipe.  Header - overpipe - front pipe - catback (midpipe - axleback)  Do you have the single or dual Berk?  I have a single but exhaust is otherwise stock so far.   Understand.  Many car companies do though.  They care a lot.  They don't want to be fined or forced to leave the marketplace.   All eggs smell sulfur-y to me.  To this day I can only eat scrambled.  My girlfriend is a big time foodie and thinks I'm nuts.  *sigh*    Try almost 800 lbs heavier...  http://automobiles.honda.com/accord-coupe/specifications.aspx   Also, a loaded Accord V6 MT coupe weighs 3528 lbs.  So carting around an extra 800 lbs it needs the torque.  http://automobiles.honda.com/accord-coupe/specifications.aspx   At which point you install winter tires and continue about your business.  Which you should do for FWD, RWD, or AWD anyway.   No.  And a TSB is not a recall - a TSB basically is, if the customer complains about X, do this.  There've actually been 3 or 4 different TSBs for the HPFP.  However, this guy is really making a much bigger deal of it than it is.   Humanity made it to where we are today just fine without all that crap.  Don't let Fisher Price define your lifestyle dude.   Have you ever driven a V6 Mustang, same year as yours?  Ford heavily touted performance with that first ever 300 HP V6 marketing nonsense, but transmission and gearing were setup to be all about that em pee gee.   To your point, it's also not the place for people who don't own one.   I dunno, crashing through a k-rail off an overpass and falling to the ground 20 feet below would probably be kind of a little worse than ending up in a ditch...   A sleeper that sounds like a NASCAR is only a sleeper to a deaf person.  There should basically be no way to tell until you scream away from a starting line (you'll note I didn't say stoplight).   In the dipyourcar.com vids they always recommend spraying pretty thick out onto the tire to allow it to peel cleanly.  If it won't, you might not be spraying thick enough or uniform coats over the wheel.   Good on ya.  Also, digging the red flaps.  I run the same on my white FR-S.   I disagree.  Yes, better traction makes the rear step out less, but as you grow in competence as a driver it means the limits are being raised.  Which allows for further improvement.  Driving at the limit on a closed course can be more fun than drifting at 15MPH, believe me.   Stahlbus drain plug.  Don't need to prop your bike up that way.   Surely you mean ex-friend; alternatively, frenemy or nemesis?   Looks like setting to allow disabling was merged today.  Should be in nightlies tomorrow or the next day I'd guess...  http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/91044/   Haha yeah that also works, ye olde Dee Em Vee.  Enjoy the new ride, and make sure you keep an eye out for stray lightposts when you're drifting through your parking lots.  They'll jump right out at you when you least expect it.   Honestly, no.  BUT, previous to the intake I was already OFT tuned Stage 1 93 octane, running an aFe panel filter and Mishimoto intake hose, LWCP, LiFePO4 battery, no spare, Berk single exit muffler delete, so the gain from the new full intake and revised OFT tune are probably lost in the noise.   Ah, see here on the mainland we refer to that as the Eastern Shore no matter how far north/south you are to avoid that sort of confusion ;)    SoMD?  Check this out:  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=67480   I've got the Grimmspeed.  I don't really notice any specific sounds from it.  I'm not the best judge though, as I have no muffler, no hood mat among other things.   When you're first learning, you complete braking before turn in and then accelerate once you reach the apex.  As you get on in experience, you will brake to the apex and accelerate at the apex/out of the turn.  You want to brake smoothly so that you settle the suspension going into the turn.  The braking forces will give the wheels turning - the front - slightly more traction, which is good for turn in.  The stock suspension setup is biased such that the rear will be loose in turns - hence those big drifts.  This is on any of the three 86s, but the FR-S is setup the most that way.  The BRZ and GT86 less so.  	102
 well of course if youve seen the movie, you remember other stuff, but the majority of people remember the dancing scene the most, dont get me wrong its an excellent movie, but like i said its a one scene wonder   99%- the underwear dancing scene  1%- everything else  risky business is a one scene wonder   the one that looks like a WWII bomber   but heres the thing though, i care more for the eventually to be 9 saga movies, than the anthology films. when i think the saga movies i think bacardi rum, when i think the anthology films i think cheap champagne. im not saying the anthology films will be BAD, its just that i dont feel theyll be neccessary for like a viewing party or something.   i thought they said there would be like 4 or 5   i mean i probably WILL see them, and buy the blu rays, but if i have a marathon of star wars ill probably just watch the saga films, and leave the spinoff films out.   and the saga will be a trilogy of trilogies, on a side note star wars is all about trilogies.   You don't wanna be a type A fan like me? We could've been friends, if you're a type A fan you have 6 count em 6! (And more) movies to watch! :D a marathon can last a week a WEEK I say! But that's just the upside, and im a glass half full person.   You don't wanna be a type A fan like me? We could've been friends, if you're a type A fan you have 6 count em 6! (And more) movies to watch! :D a marathon can last a week a WEEK I say! But that's just the upside, and im a glass half full person.   oh the feels, THE FEELS!   what makes you say that? i ask because liam neeson as that character is like burned into my brain so im curious.   "This is why i hate flying" - obi wan episode 2   i hope some actor out there looks like a young christopher lee (i think thats who played dooku)   a vader movie set between III and IV you say? that would be cool, they could probably show vader looking at photos. but i dont know im a little overwhelmed with how much spinoff films theyre making, but we'll see   My reaction was "alright now I don't have to watch just 6 Star Wars movies!!" But then it hit me, the sequel trilogy will divide the Star Wars fan base in the same way the prequel trilogy did. And if and when it does, I'll be ready   the as yet to be named human badguys are defeated and are somehow put on a meteorite, while the heroes are celebrating, the meteorite lands on earth killing the dinosaurs and the badguys decide they should populate the planet   well, i USED to figure, since the series takes place in a galaxy far far away like the intro says, i thought they were humanoid aliens, as opposed to humans like you and me, so NOW my question is, since they are human, what did they evolve from?, since there's no primates in that part of the galaxy and earth is too far away.      i see   a zabrak you say? ive never heard of that race until you brought it up (i only follow the movies, because i think following the movies is easier, what can i say, im a simple guy), i just thought darth maul was a crazy looking freak of nature. when theyre being born do they damage the birth canal with the horns? yeah im such a noob i know   Maul was never a Jedi...  ok bad example, if he were like an accountant (theres currency in star wars, right?) before he was a sith, id be surprised   with the horns and face pattern, because man if he used to be a jedi knight himself id be surprised, but then again jedi knights are (more or less) good judges of character. i mean when sidious approached him was he like, "join the dark side, and give you horn implants and a face tattoo." i dont know, i ask only because a character like darth maul just looks like he can only be a sith lord, and nothing else   whats the copyright date on it?   i mean in episode 1 they mention the entire planet is one big city, and then i wondered what they do for oxygen and water, then someone else mentioned that they import oxygen and water, and NOW im wondering about the pollution, like how do they manage it?   dont base your room for error around how often you think people will look in certain spot, because there will be times where people will find them and thats all theyll notice whenever they walk into a room. MY advice for room for error should be based on how too big a piece of material is, its better to have too big a piece than too little a piece because you can trim a too big piece, whereas a too little piece is wasting money and material   i think it could go either way   http://imgur.com/gallery/h8A09QY  https://youtu.be/qMVJnWd4idE   well i wouldnt say DEFENSIVE about any one mcu movie necessarily, but there was this on youtube troll whod make fun of people who enjoyed iron man 3, which was mildly displeasing, they got banned. but i digress, i thought age of ultron was GOOD, its just the plot was a little weaker than the first avengers movie. if the first avengers is casino royale, and age of ultron was quantum of solace, i hope infinity war part 1 is skyfall   when we see some i cant say, but actual size ant man figures will be a major choking hazard   is he william h macy's character from 'mystery men'?   (note: some halloween costume ideas in this post may have been in my past submissions)  homestar runner- eric roberts as the master  coach z - powerline (from 'a goofy movie')  the cheat - the midget from men without hats safety dance video  strong bad - max headroom  marzipan - jack in the box homer simpson  pom pom - jiminy glick  strong sad - garth algar  bubs - buzz lightyear  strong mad - donkey kong  the poopsmith - derek zoolander  the KOT - don king  homsar - 'yip yip yip' alien from sesame street     I'm saying that I can't watch the first 6 until episode 7 is nearly in theaters, because if I watch them now, an wait until episode 7 I won't have the story fresh in my mind because of the huge time I've been waiting   ive been so ready to watch the first 6 star wars movies so bad i probably need to go to rehab, star wars is like crack to me. However, episode 7 doesnt come out until december, and seeing as how i like to have a story fresh in my mind i wouldnt be able to watch the first 6 movies out of morality, and that is a situation what i affectionately refer to as 'fucking bullshit', any questions?   Woah scary :0   He's played by John cusack, he's a puppeteer, but my first look at him gave me the impression that his passion was writing accordion based song parodies, amirite?      like on imdb there are like these 2 users who like insulted this fanbase that im part of (which i wont say). one said "intelligent moviegoers didnt see that movie" and "theyre (franchise) fans of course theyll eat it up theyre like sheep" and the other was like "oh man if they do a (franchise) then im done with this series" and it really hurt me so, and now im bashing my head against a wall over having read such nasty things   nimoy approved quinto, END OF DISCUSSION, but then again youre a reboot hater, and they never want to listen to reason.   are you saying jj abrams works for al qaeda?   i like how theyre doing this as a continuation, kinda like that shaft movie from 2000   star wars episode IV a new hope   i give it a 7.9 out of 10, i wanted to give it a higher score, but the plot seemed like it caught the quantum of solace virus      steve martin- that looney toons movie, leap of faith, the prince of egypt   I don't doubt Abrams 1 percent, its just that I'm emotionally prepared for the same bullshit that I've been hearing for 16 years and I'm sick of it! There's gonna be a third trilogy and the fanbase will be divided even further!   and i was like "how come (jerrys girlfriend) is making such a huge stink over that?" and my parents are like, "because she thought he picked his nose, but he didnt" and then i asked "yeah but even if he DID pick his nose, why would she freak out over it anyway?" and then theyre like "BECAUSE PICKING NOSES IS GROSS!! THATS WHY!" and then i shrugged "fair enough"   me myself and irene   youre missing my point, when was the last time YOU did someone a kindness?   he did them a kindness  	49

 Pretty sure it's going to happen to me when I go for red...Lol   You were never meant to be a member of the one pure race.   It saddens me that you try to justify your sinful behavior.  You purples are all the same.   Sinner   Typical self-centered, narcissistic purple. Think you're better than everyone.   Purples are just bitter because they can't read. They see something shiny and get distracted. They see a button and push it without any care for the repercussions. You're just upset that you didn't become a blue our have the willpower to use your press for good...  You disgust me... *spits at ground*   Real hero's don't seek the glory. They perform their heroic deeds without any recognition.   When the time comes, I will end my greyness and fall on my sword to defend the button. Long live the button.    Grey pride!

 Or 100 000 words less than Crime and Punishment.    Need perspective for a writing project. Any input is appreciated. Preferably books which structured our current society. Contemporary works would also be useful.  Edit 1:Thanks for all the responses. A lot of books I didn't consider.          Its nice and truthful. It doesn't really leave too much of an impression though. I think if you wanted you could expand the concept, but its fine how it is. I like the tone, its almost written in the way of someone trying to hold back tears. It reminds me of something you would find on a napkin in bar.  	5
    Yep. I have it installed on my PC and it runs every time I turn it on. It's very unobtrusive and you don't have to do anything. I'm just glad my spare processing power is going to contribute to making a difference instead of going to waste.  	2
 Never hurts to try man, we can dream, right?   All is good my friend, I figured, wasn't sure why you were getting downvoted. You could still throw a signature on this petition, help a MK brotha out. lol   There is so much more art and lore that only the creators have that cannot be seen on the wiki though! It'd be amazing to have the entire lore put together in a nice looking encyclopedia!     Fans have been creating videos for us!!

Shawn Kittelsen has already said he'd love to author it, and with 20+ years and around 70 characters, us MK fans would love to have an at-hand hardback type book with everything based on the MK Lore at our hands! Signing this petition will let those up above (DC Comics, Shawn Kittelsen, Ed Boon, Netherrealm Studios, Etc) know that YOU want an MK Encyclopedia!      Time for some venn diagrams!

 Christeene is a god.    Pretty terrible list.    The closet is strong with this one.    Body of Cage.    No feat is impossible for our One True God.    I mean... If he's known in town as a pussy goth bitch those kids probably wouldn't fear him and enjoy making fun of him. I was dying with laughter... But the end seemed a little staged. :(   I thought it was real until the end. Is it fake? Please for the love of god let it be real.    TL;DR?   *Godnado   My teeth started turning yellow.    I now love India because one of her favorite movies is Spider-Man. That is all. And how old is this bitch?    not me. i love to say what i really think. I'm not a troll, but I'm nobody's bitch either.    Just another miracle of our blessed lord and savior.    Is that Purple Tinker?   She said she asked for forgiveness. She didn't say she has been forgiven.    Really? For season 5 the episodes were available the day after they aired. I don't know if the premiere is going to be available before it plays on Logo but it's possible. You'll probably be able to pre-order 1 - 2 weeks before the premiere.    Is this real??   the f u seemed really fake to me   Hmmm....   I have never contemplated suicide but now that I've seen this...   Oh, thank god.    Y NO MAC?!   Why did I watch for almost 3 minutes?   um.... no, hunny.   Not even Jinkx could save this. Why did she do this? Crush on Manilla? Utter shite.    Do people ever say you remind them of Divine?   Yeah.. I thought it was cute till the end then that actually made me laugh. Hilarious.    Mrs. Pubkin.    I KNOW! I secretly love itttt.    I miss NYC so much.   Masterpiece.    I didn't see that but I can see it....    blahblahbalahbalxnuybusbfc89paxwkucbaux   Leor could be the spelling too.    Um.... Death Proof is amazing. Django is his worst.    This gets posted here like every other day.... I usually don't scream out repost but I feel like this is probably the thing I've seen the most. I've literally seen this at least 10 times in the past year.    That was pure genius. Subscribed.    Gravity... Duh.   is this some nyu bullshit?   Vicky looks busted. Ratchet.    I wish I was a billionaire so I could give this kid all my money. One of the saddest things I've ever seen.    Gurgon was terrifying.   This song is pretty awesome.   WTF did I just watch?   That guy is stoned as fuck. Love it.   The NCC shall be protesting his funeral surely.    Amazing   suddenly everything is so quiet. :(    Kinda love the WTFness of this.. Kinda would like to see a SFW WTF sub for just not gross out shit that makes you go WTF...    This really is a beautiful song. Even though Adele is mainstream she's one of those rare exceptions. Her voice gives me the chills.    *dicks   For some reason I find it doubtful many will find this triggering but if they do I'd like to know      Sadly, I think those final evolutions are cooler than what we actually got, even though I still love what we got..    How does this relate to NoFap? Fapping is not a mental illness    I feel like I'm more successful not fapping when I don't think about it and when I'm not thinking about it I'm not on this site. I come here when I relapse, need a reminder of how many days I have (don't count. it makes it too obsessive like the only thing that matters), or when I need a reminder why I shouldn't fap    Everybody faps I'm sorry The only people who don't fap are people in sexually gratifying relationships (and still many if not most of those people fap) and people on this forum. Oh, and certain religious types Also, eunichs.    I fap because I'm a guy and I want to have sex 24/7. Not because I'm an insecure person who has gone through the some mental shit. Come on This isn't a drug addiction It's a physiological drive.   (Sorry for being a douche cause i know you spent a long ass time writing that, but I think you're maybe missing the point If you were super happy and stuff, maybe WITH a partner to have sex with all the time, you'd probably have the same drive. NoFap to me is about transmuting this intense sexual desire to creating a more amazing life.)    Not sure if racist or attempt at anti-racism...   Yeah... Deep fried oreos are heaven sent.    Sorry, but if she got those off ebay, the gba games that is, I don't want to douche on your Christmas, but theres a really high chance they are bootlegs. I didn't realize till early this year that all my gba games except one copy of FireRed wasn't bootlegged. Sorry, but yours look like some are probably bootleg.   Yeah, I didn't laugh at the comment, if you really need clarification.    I find Hugh Jackman with hanging balls from under his chin eating at a fancy NYC restaurant with Kate Winslet hilarious.    I find this hilarious. Most people I know who have seen it actually love it. I haven't met anybody who has seen it who doesn't like it. I can see why people hate it, but I thought it was hilarious. Especially the dare date one... Great movie in the vein of Kuntucky Fried Movie.    You are tearing me apart, Aimee!   I love while he's getting tased he goes "This is the most beautiful thing!"   Didn't read any of that but edging leads to ejaculating. Nuff said.   Best post on this reddit EVER   Girl... PG-13.   FUCK YA   EDIT: almost 2 years (20 months)   I'm gagging.    Just commit to not letting the chaser effect win. Just don't fap. When the chaser affect happens you'll know it's happening and just say fuck you chaser and go listen to music or something to get your mind off it.    trust me, it was the right choice.    Chill   /r/EAF   Hashtag TeamAlaska   You've lost hope in life? Take a chill pill. Yeeesh.    blahblahblah   Just don't fap. Don't edge. Enjoy the arousal.    Piper could be a repressed lesbian. It's not certain that she is Bi.   Yeah, tell me how it affects my reboot and stuff. It's really kind of annoying since I was doing hard mode and I can feel a minor loss of energy, and I was super energetic and going to the gym everyday. Not a huge set back but I'm kinda like: Hey, less fuel down in the cannons.   EDIT: Also, I've never had a wet dream with ejaculation. Only sex dreams where I never got to finish.    PUNCH THAT BITCH!!!! (instead of just standing there and saying "she's biting his lip eyyyyyy")   Oh god... Oh god... Must have...    my thoughts exactly   The acapella version was quite beautiful.    That.... was.... amazing.....   That's just a link to a forum.. :(   Fuck you. I'm not gonna fail you pessimistic dipshit.       I kind of like them. Their humor is so lame it's kind of endearing.    Photoshop is not your friend, honey.

Also, cold showers are great if you're trying to get in shape. They force your body to burn more calories for the rest of the day because it has to raise your body temperature to combat the coldness.    I wonder what she's going to eat today.       Why would they go for the fast and the cutest? Why not The Fast and The Furriest... Just seems pretty obvious to me.    How did you find this?!   They do.      I think the show The Biggest Loser is psychologically damaging and super fucked up, yet everyone on the show and everyone who watches it parades around saying THEY'RE SAVING THEIR LIVES. As somebody who used to be obese, I know how hard it is to get in shape, and when I watch shows and read articles about Fat Shaming I can't believe I even lost the weight. People would lose the weight easier if they weren't constantly being told how inferior they are because they aren't a certain weight. Let people make their own decisions. 99% of people who are overweight know it's not healthy. You don't need to make them feel bad about it. It's only going to make it worse.    I'm talking about mega Charizard Y's left wing. It appears to me to be coming out of his tail, not his back.    Why is Mega Charizard Y's wing coming out of his tail?   What were those hand movements that guy did? I really enjoyed them.      That was depressing. It was like watching the end of a Todd Solondz movie.   Bill Mahar isn't a coward.    Did anybody else scroll long enough to see the fairy men fucking the dick? Yeah...    Bets cringe yet.    Thanks... I think this might be it...I just ordered it off amazon for 15 bucks so I'll let you know once I play it.    So, I only got to play this game once when I was a little kid and I remember thinking it was ridiculously fun. I always thought it was called Quest, but I've searched online and I can't find any information about any SNES game being called just Quest, theres Mystic Quest and Palladin's Quest but I kind of doubt that either are the game I'm thinking of. The only thing I can tell you to remember what it was was that it was a kind of fantasy game where near the begining of the game you have to figure out a sort of card trick. My older brother kept playing it and I think there was a part where he got a special flute that he played to summon something inside a castle. I wish I could tell you more, but it looked like a zelda / pokemon game Where you have a small character, move up/down/left/right and you talk to people and you read what they say. If this sounds like any game you know of I would love to know cause I want to buy it. I always think about it randomly and how badly I wanted to play it when I was a little kid. Thanks in advanced.    E.A.F.   What are your fetishes?    Jinkx... Just STUNNING.    That guys like.. Okay.. Can I take it home and play it please.    I mean... He's a bronie. I doubt it's much of a joke.    /r/eaf      Question: Is Courtney Act a full male? Or is she any part Trans?   If only this was a Lars Von Trier film and not a disney pic.

 Actually, Near guessed, acted stupid, got lucky with his guess (about 10x), got lucky with his stupidity, and then won.  We can argue all day over how legit Near's guesses were up till Episode 36/37, but then they're clearly BS.  Let's assume Near guessed everything up till this point. Let's not worry about how he did it, maybe he got lucky, maybe he had more info that we the viewer didn't see, but just assume he did.  Therefore, he knows Mikami is X-Kira, Light is L-Kira, Mikami has a notebook, Light likely has pieces of a notebook, and he knows that Light has guessed that he's found out about Mikami.  So he does his whole make-a-fake thing, plants it with Mikami, then breaks into the bank and makes another fake. Plan set.  But it's a stupid plan. Near STAKES HIS LIFE on the fact that Mikami would come back in after writing the names. Why would he do this??? Near knows that Light has figured out most of his plan. He HAS to know that there's extra pieces of the notebook scattered around. There is NO REASON for Near to assume that Mikami will even have the notebook with him. Mikami could easily look in, snap a picture with his phone, then take off.  What now? Are you telling me Near hadn't thought of this very obvious possibility?  Also, what if Mikami had just brought a gun and come in blazing? What if he brought backup? NO WAY COULD NEAR NOT THINK OF THIS.  tl;dr- Near's guesses are just lazy writing.   You will never be alone. If you ever want to talk confidentially, feel free to PM me. There are many people out there willing to help. There are many people who have gone through what you have.    My N mother always asked me to explain myself, my reasoning, then yelled at me for arguing.  Eventually I just gave up, stated my opinion as obviously as I could, and when she questioned it I just repeated it word-for-word. No matter what she said.  It worked pretty well, I'm happy to say.   Good for you.  Thank God for your aunt, things could have gotten much worse if not for her.  Hope things get better for you, breaking up with your family is difficult, especially when they later try to pull the excuse "But we're FAMILY!"  	4
 Don't own Ghosts, but it bares a resemblance. I was inspired by Mw3 Dome more :)   You were clear about one screenshot from one map that I shown that isn't even released yet. However, it's pretty stupid to judge someone's mapping skills by one screenshot, don't you think? I've done a LOT of work in the past, and I was just testing the waters. Apparently Reddit didn't like it, so I scrapped the map and turned it into a humorous gag.  Here's some of my work: [Example 1](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34115979016804076/7FAA6125BCEF7B5BB45DFF6EE9AAF9107E6BBD54/) [Example 2](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34113070265576771/90A117932CA5ECBB232624153CE3FE6C67629BE9/) [Example 3](http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34114798216970247/2EE3EE18986D966221D45B5CEA9BBAB7726856A8/) [Example 4](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34112262285228426/DE20B2E78E41A43FA98587544F48FCB9AA806AE2/) [Example 5](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34111542962174107/A448F2491A5E15FA4A4900A291109F12E2387E13/)    oh, so youre saying my map has already been done? with the boilers? damn.. i need to make a new map with boiler as a skybox... hopefully that'll work..   do you like sea salt or normal salt? i like cooking salt   i am a mad map maker. like a mad scientist. one day me and my chikens will take over the world, and hopefuly that day will be soon   no, i am completely fine with criticism. pros told me to add chikens, so i did   then i hope lens flares wont be a problem   i agree   it lacked boilers, it shouldnt be a problem anymore   this map is epidomy of all the best maps combined, its like a frankenstein. i have teamed up with fnatic to add some boost spots for the next major     oh crap i must add more boilers and lens flares then, thanks   im not mad at all, this new map is actually going to be amazing   no, im reeking that sweet Reddit karma. you were wrong all along   i am completely serious   i know right? i will be adding more lens flares and making bombsites on top of eachother. i will also make the ct and t spawns directly in front of each other as well. overpass is going to be left in shadows after this map is finished   it is very functional, it has Advanced Chiken and Fish AI. i have also added next-gen skybox for the best experience. angles shouldnt be a problem, pros told me that having ct spawn directly in front of t spawn would help the gameplay and balance, early gunfights would be interesting and engaging   yes i am trying my best      Okay I agree with you. Anyone who will want to play the map will be able to play it from Steam workshop.   Can you show some examples of your work? Also, it doesn't have to be special. It has to be simple and it has to work, which in this case it does   Map maker =/= artist  You can make maps but have someone else make the assets for you. I made my own assets for this map either way, and taking a theme is not stealing. It's the same as saying Dust2 stole every other games Arabic/Dusty environment.   Will be fixed   It'll be fixed   You say it looks terrible, but you don't provide feedback why? If you could change it up so it looks better, what would you change?   I'll try fixing some angles. The round areas are only in the middle.   Noone said it's going to be added to an Operation. The map isn't even released yet.  Also, I'm not aiming for an operation.   Please come back to me when you make ANY map and tell me how easy it is just to recreate this ONE scene from the screenshot. Like I said before, every credit will be given.   It will be in the game automatically once I add it to the workshop. It might not be in operation, is what you are saying. And thats perfectly fine. I am not making it just so it gets into operation, I am making so it can be added to servers and me and my friends would enjoy it.    Cant change the title either way. Credits will be in the workshop page, just like I do with my other maps. People in general are very unacceptive to change, which is quite disappointing from mappers point of view.   Who said I won't give credit? It's just a preview screenshot   AKA RIP warehouse maps?   I can use brick textures any time lol   Okay, I'll see you when I get sued.   Yup, the fishes do have Advanced Next Gen Fish AI   It's a custom map that is work in progress.   ^   I wont use that ridiculous layout, that's the difference.   I remember CS:GO Beta when everyone said that Dust2 looked like COD haha   What looks hidious? Elaborate pls   A map   Yeah, except I'll use my own layout and implement theme and design choices that fit CS:GO. It's going to be up on workshop, if you won't like it you won' need to play it. I'm sure some casual servers will find use of it.   What exactly looks bad? Give me feedback so I can improve it, just saying it's bad doesn't help it.   I will try adding variation. Thank you for your opinion.    It's just not interesting to work on warehouse themes anymore. Compare the original Mirage and the current one.   They haven't copyrighted the theme. I'm using my own assets and I'l try to change the map so it isn't exactly the same. Layout is completely different. And yes, I have done many original maps of my own.    Theme - yes, layout - no.   Yes, it's inspired by COD AW greenband. But the layout is not even close to be the same, it's just the theme of the map only. I thought it would look interesting in CS:GO and steer away from the usual "warehouse" style. There are many COD inspired maps in CS:GO, however, it would be stupid to use COD's layouts. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know. I am working on quite a bunch of maps that don't employ "COD maps" style, so if people don't like this map I can just scrap it any time.         [All that sweet money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNFCb1ZZ1_g)   What did you say? More music kits?

It would be stupid to add these maps over custom maps like de_zoo, de_resort as there is a monetary incentive and people actually put a lot of effort into making custom maps.    [Pfft, I've done it better](https://gfycat.com/DelayedArtisticGuppy)      Indeed, Westwood could work with addition of a second bombsite.   I am looking for classic mode maps that could potentially be played in competitive environment (de, cs).   I would love it too, however, I do not know how to code such gamemode. On the other hand, I can make old maps see the light again!   The map had horrible choke points. Please.  EDIT: I can change layouts to be more competitive, but not if the map needs complete overhaul.   Hello! I'm a map maker, and I've done some original layouts myself in the past. However, this time I'm quite stuck.  I remember playing 1.6, but most of my experience was public and surf servers and I never used to care on what maps I was playing on, it was plain fun that I cared about.  Which 1.6/css maps would you like to see remade in CS:GO that have not yet been remade? I am looking for layout specific feedback, and not "nostalgia" driven maps. Maps that had very good/competitive layouts but haven't made to CS:GO yet.  Here are some screenshots of my work - http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34114798221165408/F8F760662B91517CE41830297A35921AD41414C9/  http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/34115979016804076/7FAA6125BCEF7B5BB45DFF6EE9AAF9107E6BBD54/   Thank you for any of your feedback!   Holy crap that's a cool HUD! How do you do it?   EXITING APPS EXITING APPS! Don't kill me...   As a mapper, there are many common mistakes. There are a lot of floaters (floating props, not aligned with the floor). Nodraw textures visible without boosts. Clipping is also bad, especially when you are 1 meter away from an obstacle and get magically blocked by the air. Clipping is basically adding invisible brushes (walls for nonmappers) so players can't access certain areas. The custom textures are terrible. With today's standards, it's not that hard to add reflectivity (normal maps) to the textures and $detail annotation. For that you would need to import texture to VTFEdit and export it as ENV file with normal maps generated, as easy as that. The rest is editing VMT file with notepad. He could also just simply add a line $detail wood and it would instantly make all his textures look 10x better. Lastly, the map could be simplified. In CS:GO, maps don't look better if you spam trash props (clutter) over the map to make it better. It doesn't make it better by adding more window frames and pipes either. What makes a map good is the general simplicity of it, take an example of DE_SEASON. It is simple, utilizes reflective materials. Tuscan is very sharp as a map, more rounded edges would seperate it from CSS and CS 1.6. Take Toscan for example, noticed how it's more "round" than Tuscan? It allows for better smooth lighting. He could also use vertigoblue_hdr or one of the default skyboxes instead of the one he uses right now, he just adds additional materials to pack to the file size.  "Engine capacity" is an old excuse, maps can look good and work well.    Although I agree with you myself as a mapper, Tuscan theme is a classic and I doubt it should be changed.  The name Tuscan wouldn't make much sense in a map set in underground tunnels for example, would it? ;)   It's not just because of the map visuals, from the first looks I can already tell the map is untidy. Especially from the mapping standpoint. Many common mapping mistakes are also abundant.   Wasn't it released like 5 times or something..?          https://gfycat.com/DelayedArtisticGuppy   Hey guys, can I join the par....  	70
 This is the answer. His crew had to have "acquired" blueprints to be that accurate. And people were "convinced" to keep their mouths shut about what was going on. The convincing probably ranged from payments, to showing a guard a picture of his kid playing in his back yard - - you talk and you know what happens.   Good! He should be charged. He sounds like a truly awful person.    An Ohio man was charged on Wednesday for entering a vehicle after an accident where he filmed two injured teenagers, one of whom later died, while calling them idiots and making no effort to help them, police said. Paul Pelton, 41, was charged with vehicular trespass after he opened a back door and leaned into the vehicle to capture video on his cellphone  Edit: Why the down votes? He didn't try to help, didn't even call 911, recorded people dying by entering their car, and tried to sell the video. Sounds like a horrible human to me.   Prior to 1970, votes in Congress were anonymous (like citizens votes are) both in committees and on the floor. When legislation passed making all votes public, the transparency was seen as a great benefit to constituents. An unintended consequence is that it allowed lobbyists to track votes, and to directly tie donations to votes. In my opinion, this is why lobbying became so powerful in the late '70s and has controlled American politics ever since.    "Goose pulling (also called gander pulling, goose riding or pulling the goose) was a blood sport practiced in parts of the Netherlands, Belgium, England and North America from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The sport involved fastening a live goose with a well-greased head to a rope or pole that was stretched across a road. A man riding on horseback at a full gallop would attempt to grab the bird by the neck in order to pull the head off."  "Goose pulling continues to this day as part of traditional Shrove Tuesday celebrations in Grevenbicht in the Netherlands and in parts of Belgium and Germany, **using a dead goose that has been humanely killed** by a veterinarian."

The flap came after Bush proposed increasing economic output by increasing worker participation, helping part-time workers get full-time work and helping Americans who have dropped out of the workforce find jobs.

I attended 2 chiropractors (first time in my life) that really helped me recover. The second one had me do these tests of "lift your hand against mine - oh, good pressure.

Your offer of EXP is wonderful, and I would really appreciate it if I had any idea what any of this means. Cheers!   \\\__/ . . . what else would you expect?   I'm drunk and just reading this LPT made me throw up in my mouth.    No. I hear that "Chapo" Guzmn is in contract to produce a reality show with the *Don*.

It's called "*Brown is the new Orange*" ^Too ^soon? ^^Too ^^Racist?    So I suggested the fix is "One that respects the constitution, but also addresses the fact that we have a weapons crisis in many poor urban areas."  I will be shocked if more than a couple candidates try to be specific prior to the election.  We still have a long way to go, so maybe some candidates will step up.     So what's the fix?  One that respects the constitution, but also addresses the fact that we have a weapons crisis in many poor urban areas.   There are already many targeted laws. I think we can continue to refine those to address issues, while respecting the constitution.    After some research it appears that elephants noses typically only bleed if they are injured. There are a variety of reasons why their nose would be injured, but the primary reason would be an encounter with a predator - - often human.

Bernie Sanders position on gun rights and gun safety is nuanced and well thought out (in true Bernie style).   "*I come from a state where there is virtually no gun control. But the people of my state understand, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or Los Angeles. In our state, guns are used for hunting. In Chicago they are used for kids killing other kids or gang members shooting at police officers, shooting down innocent people. We need a sensible debate about gun control, which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this.*"  If you try to paint him with a broad brush on this issue, you can piss off.

Can you imagine a mechanic EVER having to tell a customer:  "Yes I know the problem only occurs when cornering quickly, but I can't test it in my 'agreed with the insurance company' route"  "Only occurs over larges bumps - no I can't test that"  "On steep grades? Sorry mate - not allowed by my insurer."   Would like to hear from mechanics/shop owners, but I seriously doubt it.

Sorry mate - not allowed by my insurer."   Very true. Similar to Trump getting dumped by Macy's. They may have thought "His sales have been awful, but we're committed for another 2 years. Thank God for that morals (or whatever) clause!"   Bernie Sanders has a similar message - we'll take our country back from the top 1%, the corporations, and the lobbyists. (Hey Donald - he's talking about you.)   "Pray for resurrection in the sequel!"   Of my very large family none are in the military, and my military friends did not see much combat action.

[THE BLOOD BROKERS - HOW BLOOD, THE 'GIFT OF LIFE,' BECAME A BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS](http://www.bloodbook.com/part-1.html)  Most blood sales take place through clearinghouses operated by the American Red Cross and other nonprofit blood-collecting groups. But there is also a spot market - not unlike the one for oil - where hundreds, possibly thousands, of sales occur each year.  "It functions rather like the NASDAQ," a national system for trading over-the-counter stocks, said Dr. Charles L. Rouault, president of the Broward Community Blood Center near Fort Lauderdale. "You pick up the phone and call somebody you know."  No one - not the federal government, not the blood banks themselves - knows for sure how much blood is bought and sold on the open market. There are no requirements that sales be reported; no government agency keeps track.   So . . . you're against it?

Nigeria is expected to have a larger population than the U.S. by the year 2050 (meaning it will replace the U.S. as the worlds third most populous country.)   Off the top of my head, here are some basics of investing for retirement:  Tax sheltered retirements accounts vs "savings" account - Definitely use a tax sheltered account. These include IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc. That way your earnings grow for decades without being taxed each year.  Dollar cost averaging - simply means that you invest on a regular basis (e.g. weekly, monthly) at what ever the price is on that day. Don't worry about trying to time the market each time you money is invested. The tough decision is what to do when there is a large correction - I'm not even going to get into that now. The point is to invest for the long term.  Diversification - Mutual funds are a great way to go. There are many very good mutual funds that invest across a variety of sectors of the economy, and some funds are global so they invest in different countries as well. Just don't put all your savings into one, or a few stocks. While this can pay off well, it can also create large losses if one of your few stocks tank.  Compounding - I'm sure you are aware of the idea of compound growth (if not - look it up). To me, the most important part of the compounding story is how important it is to start investing NOW. Even if you're not sure what to invest in, just DO SOMETHING. You can look up charts showing how much more you will have at retirement if you simply start saving a few years earlier. So don't put it off.  Risk/reward - this is a tough one. Do your best to understand what you are investing in. If you don't understand an investment (e.g. annuities, REITs, futures, options, etc.) then either pick something else, or do your homework until you do understand it. You need to feel comfortable with the investments to be able to sleep well at night. Some investments are inherently more risky. This is not necessarily bad. Risk should mean greater potential for growth and loss. You need to be comfortable with the "level of risk" of each of your investments.  Financial Planners - I have never used one, but if you do, I recommend a fee-only FP. That means a FP that makes ZERO money off commissions from ANY of the investments. Fee only planners charge you an up-front fee (either a flat fee or a percent of what you have invested each year). That means they aren't compensated by the mutual fund company to steer you into one fund or another simply because they get a higher commission. Commissions can create conflicts of interest. So, I definitely see the value of a FP to help you make a plan, but only if they are fee only.  Wow, I didn't plan ow writing quite that much. Anyhoo . . . good luck, but more importantly, start ASAP.   You asked "What is the best way to start planning for retirement".  I would suggest a different approach. Plans change, investments will vary, options depend on many factors.  I advise you both agree to a retirement **commitment**.   Commit to a percent of your income that will be invested every month and every year for the rest of your lives - - together.  Commit that you will not touch that retirement nest egg EVER until retirement.  For example, if you hit hard times, before you dip into the retirement fund, downsize. Sell stuff. Change jobs. Take on a second job.  If you can commit that you will do this for each other, because you know that you want to provide for your "golden years" together, the rest - - the details - -  will follow.     Young Frankenstein should be novelized   That would be a tall challenge. So much of the beauty of the film is the dialogue and the interplay of the characters. That might be tough to replicate in a novel. That said . . . I like the way you think.   I didn't realize that Blazing Saddles was a book. (Just kidding.)   So, earlier today I posted about the quote "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!" being a mis-quote from the original book and movie. I was basically told that, no, it's the correct quote from Blazing Saddles. I had to explain about The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Aaaarrrggh!

In 1990, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "**culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film was among the first 100 films to be selected**.  Director Stanley Kubrick listed The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as **his 4th favorite film of all time** in his list of his top ten favorite films in a 1963 edition of Cinema magazine.

It is #34 on Rotten Tomatoes list of the [Top 100 movies of all time]( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/)  So yes, a paraphrased quote was used in a 40+ year old movie (Blazing Saddles). It was also used many, many other times.     The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven's novel The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927):  - "All right," Curtin shouted back. "If you are the police, where are your badges? Let's see them." - "Badges, to god-damned hell with badges! We have no badges. In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges, you god-damned cabrn and chinga tu madre!"  The line was popularized by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of the novel, which was bowdlerized to meet Hays Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film. In one scene, a Mexican bandit leader named "Gold Hat" (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) that he and his company are Federales:  - Dobbs: "If you're the police, then where are your badges?"  - Gold Hat: "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!"  The phrase from the book chinga tu madre translates to "fuck your mother".

 Add garlic, trust me. It'll change your life.   One of the best things you can do is to fix your body clock. You can do this in 1 day. Set an alarm clock for 7am and no matter how little sleep you get, wake up and don't go back to sleep for the whole day. Do what ever you have to and then go to be at a reasonable hour that night.   For actually going to sleep, here's some advice:  Turn everything off in your room, computer, TV, everything that has a LED or a humming noise.  Then close your eyes and get comfortable. It's story time!   Use your imagination, do something. Tell a story, come up with your ideal video game, direct a porno with you and Jessica Alba! Have fun with it, let your mind go. Remember being a kid and having these imagination sessions? There is no reason you can't do it again as an adult.  In fact, several times in doing this I've had epiphanies for work haha. The point is to let your body relax into sleep. Also stop drinking any form of caffeine after 5pm, that one caused massive problems for me for years.  Also it sounds cliche but a good diet and exercise does wonders for how well you sleep. I've been losing weight for the past 4 months and just eating better has given me solid nights sleep, which in turn gives me more energy for exercise when in turn means I'm more tired at night for sleep! It's cyclical!   Reach around, feel stick, what do?   When I started saying "Man I wish i was single" coupled with a feeling of sadness.  I realised that it wasn't just me whining, I was legitimately unhappy.  Spoiler alert, I felt 1 million times better after I bit the bullet and broke it off.   OH  **Transmission sexuality**  Transexual - I get it now.   I went bald at 22, accept it and move the fuck on. Keep it short, don't grow it out.  You'd be surprised how little anyone gives a fuck about it. That's especially the case if you don't give a fuck either.  I would even make the move to completely shaved. I've started doing it now and it looks much better.   Shaved mine last night and along with fresh sheets I slept like a baby in a field of marshmellows.  feelsgoodman.jpeg   Yeah, it's perfectly fine to be like that but I don't think it requires a word. Same reason why there isn't a word for someone who only sleeps with someone who drives a manual car.     It's not that uncommon, there is actually a title for it but I've not committed it to memory since it appears to me as a rather pretentious and unnecessary special snowflake title.   I get what you're saying, I guess it depends on who you're and what your relationship with the person is like.      That's very interesting, since it's currently only 70% on RT. I was rather shocked by that, how the consensus showed that it was nearly on par with Guardians and that was tracking 90+% on RT.   I have the dark circles under my eyes, I can see why someone might think that I'm tired.   I guess I can see that if you're self conscious about it that it may be an issue, but if the person speaking to you doesn't know about it, it's kinda harmless. I guess following that rule up, you should just completely avoid saying anything about anyones appearance? Just in case what you speak about is a touchy subject?   I'm one of those mother fuckers who can drop them incredibly easily. I went from smoking a pack a day for 5 years to quitting cold turkey without thinking about it.  I dunno, just lucky I guess?   I disagree! I do 30 minutes of cardio 2-4 times a week and I love it!  That's a 5 minute warm up walk, 20 minute run then a 5 minute cooldown.  It goes by so damn quick, even if you're just listening to music and it feels great!  It also helps if you have a TV show that you can watch on your phone.    I've had two wisdom teeth pulled on two separate occasions and I avoided dry sockets, I was so incredibly scared of getting a dry socket that I would spend hours researching horror stories about it.  It ended up just making me more scared, just follow the dentist's instructions guys and you'll be fine.   I'm not sure I understand this one, I've had it happen a few times and I never took offense, never even gave it a second of thought.  Just shows to me that someone is curious/concerned   Ya'll mother fuckers need better Facebook friends, I've managed to weed out all of the annoying social media users on my Facebook. It's so much more peaceful being the only person on Facebook.   I've since learned how ruthless you have to be on public transport when it comes to inconsiderate people.

Also fuck twitter.   I saw this last weekend! Insane movie, it holds up so damn well.  I wish Guy Pearce was in more stuff.   What else is he going to say? "To be honest, it's the same costume as the other movies"  I'm not sure how much different it can be from the most recent incarnation.   There has been lots of hype from critics about how it stands in comparison to the other Marvel movies.  How would you rank it against the others?   I forgot @midnight, I watch that for entertainment not for political satire and discussion like the others :)  Real time is tricky to recommend, but if you like the sort of harder hitting conversations from Daily Show and Last Week, then you'll probably like it.  Bill Maher can come off as a bit of an asshole, but I like his bluntness on the subject. Quite often the discussions put everyone out of their comfort zones and it can garner some actual discussion.   Mind you, sometimes pandering nonsense can also occur. I watch it every week and I enjoy it every week, but I can get why people can't handle Maher.   I'm just hoping that Mr Robot isn't his long lost father or something. That would be a completely stupid trope.   I'm a programmer too and I can appreciate their efforts.  They also tack on lots of project management buzz words. Gantt charts, scrums, sprints and cycles lol  I love that show so much, I can forgive the artistic licence they used for the compression stuff because they need a piece of revolutionary technology which doesn't already exist. So I have no problem with it.  Since compression technology has real world applications, cracking it in the show is akin to cracking cold fusion and thus makes the impact of Pied Piper more enjoyable to watch.   -feels like Fight Club with computers  I would say its a mix between Fight Club and EARLY Dexter.  That feeling of his 'dark passenger' is really enthralling to watch.  Side note: I hate the title of the show, it's so hard for me to get my friends to watch it when I have to defend such a silly title.   I stopped watching around 2 months in, I have nothing against Larry, I actually think he's rather funny.  But the show couldn't figure out what it was 2 months in. They kept on switching around the pacing and the format. The round table discussion didn't work, Larry was too soft on people spouting nonsense for a hard hitting TV show and there was too much pandering for a decent comedy.  Daily show, real time and last week tonight are going to have to do for now.   Is it just me or does that look nothing like /u/permanentlystoned?   I agree, the begining of that 4th day was awesome. Slow and steady play. Some great defence against the good balls and some excellent punishment of the poor ones.  All we needed to do was slow and consistent play. Not have shitty batting collapses. I was so hopeful for the Warner/Smith partnership.   Even this video can't make me feel better after this weekend. Damn you England!   **We all know how writing on ADWD was hindered by the Meereenese knot, how is writing TWOW going by comparison?

That would look completely stupid on TV.   Ive never actually given 'recieving compliments' thought since reddit has brought it up, but i honestly cant remeber the last time i got one.  Im so not used to it. For example, i started losing weight over the past 4 months (44 lbs down yay) and ive only just started getting compliments about how i look... and i freeze up lol, my compliment taking muscle has atrophied after all of these years it seems.  I love the compliments and its a real day brightener, but its honestly not something your average dude gets often. Even the ones in relationships. I hope it changes :)   I spent quite a long time years ago on /r/atheism and what I learned from my time there, is that I don't think that his quote was satirical. People actually talk like that, it's rather disheartening.   /r/atheism is a great sub if you're struggling with how society is treating you, it's a bad sub if you're just an angry basement dweller who ironically has a 'holier than thou' attitude towards the rest of the world.   The point is to create a massive ongoing joke and holy shit has it succeeded. The chain is hundreds upon hundreds of links long.   Don't believe me?

In case you didn't know why that's relevant, in Australia we have passed legislation requiring all tobacco products to be plain packaging and have [massive pictures of disgusting smoking related disfigurements on them](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cigarettes safe=active biw=1222 bih=602 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=iOWeVceHJIbg8AW6pLDACQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ gws_rd=cr) (**warning NSFW, gross stuff**). We also have pretty specific rules when it comes [to packaging and marketting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_packets_in_Australia).  I'm not sure what other counties do, but it's kinda intense here down under.  So anyway, how did it feel? I felt nothing and I didn't care. I think I can safely say that there is no smoker alive who has ever seen the warnings and said "Oh shit, it causes cancer? I better not buy this".  We all fucking know how dangerous they are and the majority of us don't fucking care. We're not thinking that far ahead, we're just trying to enjoy a smoke. When you have a drink after a long day at work, do you think to consider the liver damage sustained over a period of time?  So I see the packaging changes as a way to ward off young people from smoking. But I think the social stigmatisation of smoking does more than the packaging ever could. Nearly all of my smoker mates quit smoking and I think it's to do with how our current society reacts towards smokers.  Now if we could only point that stigma towards the junk food industry....      "Disposable Ordnance Remover" heh   This is also in australia during the 90s and early 00s. Everything is expensive in aus   Try /r/progresspics if you don't already, that place motivates the fuck outta me. It's great to see pictures of people who have the same stats as you :)   Some are, sure. But if they're rated as Top Critic by RT then I'm going to trust more that they dont have some sort of bias towards the  film.   CICO doesn't work, I read it on the internet. Keep your fake cult away from me and my body builder metabolism. /s   It wasn't that long ago where I was in that position, my friends all didn't say anything and I'm glad they didn't. Chances are that the obese person already knows what they have to do, but it's never going to happen unless they want it to.  My friends job during my fatness was to not judge me and not tease me but if I were to spout some fatlogic, they would rip it to shreds and if I said I needed advice, they were all over it.  Several of my friends worked as physical trainers and several were in the army, so any time I did have questions or queries I always had help. But as far as them coming to me? No, never.  Knowing myself, I would probably tell them "I appreciate that you care, but it's my choice to live like this. I know I need to lose weight and I'll do it when I'm good and ready."     "I need to lose weight" - No. They still aren't directly asking for advice.  If they say that, I would probably say "well if you want help with it, Let me know. I've gone through it myself :)"  It's the difference between offering help rather than just giving it.   Also daily weight fluctuations can fudge (hehe) the numbers.  I apparently gained 1 kilogram of weight last night. Either I somehow ate 7000 calories over budget, or I'm retaining water and waste.   And what reason is that?   Also only 6 out of the 24 reviewers are rotten tomatoes Top Critics. They're generally the ones I actually pay attention to.  Also Jeremy and Chris :D   Unblinking eye contact for as long as you can, it really is offputting.  Granted, this doesn't work if you love the person dearly.   Vegemite.

It's an engagement thing.  "So I saw Steve, yesterday-"  "Wait, Steve from work or Steve your cousin?"  "Steve from work"  I find that this is perfectly ok and it helps with clarity and context.  If this is an annoying habit to anyone, they've remained silent for 27 years of my life. I also don't find it frustrating when it happens to me, it shows they're interested and are listening.  I would say interrupting is only a problem when they try to change the subject.   You and I have very different friends it seems, if someone in our group doesn't look well we'll ask if they're ok.  No one gets offended, even my female friends.   I legitimately do head checks when I walk from the left side to the right for what ever reason.

So there's that too! :D  Also following up on your main point... Become an organ donor people! I could think of nothing more wonderful than for my organs to help those who need it after I pass   I removed all sodas and sugary drinks, began drinking water and green tea  It's funny how making this change seems to do the majority of the work isn't it?

Its so gradual that you don't even notice how far you've come. I've found this is most prevalent when I take the stairs. I can now almost run up stairs and reach the top with little or no shortness of breath.   My family would do it every week. We would turn up Friday after school, they had a deal with for $20 you could rent 3 weeklys and 2 overnights.  So each week, we would go there and choose 2 new releases and 3 older ones. More often than not, I would not have a different weekly to choose, so I would just get an old favourite - Terminator 2 Judgement Day. You better believe I would rewatch that shit.  I miss it, but at the same time Netflix is just Blockbuster, but 100x more convenient.   Solve for X (   )   Holy shit, I might actually see this now.

I'm showing that I have a quality which was caused by genetics which is not found attractive to the opposite sex (like fat people who blame genetics) and I don't go around telling women that they're wrong for having that preference.       Some people (like me) found the willpower aspect of weight loss easy.  Glad there is someone else like me, I feel really bad when I read about the mental illness struggles some people had to overcome to lose weight. I can't even fathom how hard it must be for them.  Really good post   Just make sure if you compare peoples weight loss to your own to factor in height. Even only 2-3 inches of height can make two people with the same weight look completely different.   Golf   I'm told porn is the tentpole which keeps tumblr erect.   Yeah, I was a bit confused too.

Every weekend I get coffee with mates and we hang out at a shopping center to people watch, its incredible how many are actually in this situation   For those who're looking to increase their fitness somewhat, take the damn stairs! It makes such a difference.  According to my FitBit, every work day I ascend and descend around 20-40 floors. All of which could be done with an elevator or escalator.   As I started to get into shape, I also stopped taking the elevator/escalator and starter taking the stairs for these seemingly short journeys.  This has made a huge difference to my fitness, i've been gradually increasing the speed which I take the stairs and now I'm practically leaping up them.   Speaking as a Melbournian who takes the train to the CBD everyday, don't underestimate how obese Victoria is.  Not a day goes by where I don't see 2 train seats taken up by a single person.   VICTORIANS REPORT IN   ;)   when in fact they are both completely in your control.  Even then if it weren't in their control, I still don't understand it.   I'm a 27 year old man, who is bald. I started going bald at 22 and that's the way the fucking cookie crumbles. This is truly something I didn't do to myself and is totally out of my control.  Now do I get all uppity and in the faces of women who prefer men with hair?  **Fuck no**, I'm not a narcissist, preferences are preferences. So I do the best I can with what I have and move the fuck on.  I don't blame society, that would just be plain fucking silly.    Nope, I'm being dead serias.

I was able to break the habit quite a few years ago and my nails are finally healthy and strong. Turns out, when you spend many years chewing your nails they become quite a bit less strong.   Adding onto this, turn off every electrical device you can in your room. It may seen weird at first to try to sleep in complete darkness and dead silence, but I've *never* had better sleep than after I started doing that.  My FitBit records all movements at night time and since I've started doing that, I get solid 'rock like' sleep, every night.  Even only getting 4 *uninterrupted* hours sleep is plenty for a day at work.   I'm with everyone here, unprovoked physical violence.    And so it fucking should.

Not just ridiculous, sad  Further, I see an absolutely vital place in our national discourse for a libertarian perspective in the wake these killings. We stand to benefit from a voice that is deeply suspicious of not just state power broadly, but with the specific execution of that power. And in a way that is cognizant of the structural inequality within and without our justice system predicated by our political institutions. After all, this is I think the libertarian critique of the state at its best and most useful. What is worse is that I think it is a pernicious and denialist kind of racism that prevents any useful contribution by libertarians. Its like theyve all bought into the idea that we live in a perfect individually driven meritocracy and that systemic variables dont exist oh, except taxes.

Second, cats are fairly nocturnal, one vet told me that she closes her bedroom door at night and lets her cats have run of the rest of the house so that she can get undisturbed sleep.  One trick that I've used is that when a cat wakes me, I pull all hands, feet, arms, sometimes even my head under the covers. I have three that are all adults and, for the most, part let me sleep. One loves her treats in the morning so she'll bug me a bit closer to my normal wake up time (she also likes to sleep on top of me, which usually doesn't wake me up these days).         Welcome, hope you enjoy it.         For New York City, as well as many old US cities like Chicago, a period from sometime in the 1960s through the early 1990s could be referred to as an era of [Crime and Grime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdDUmvPK2OM) A very significant year for NYC was 1977 - The Bronx is Burning, Son of Sam, the July blackout, etc. In fact, there's a pretty cool documentary called [NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHXAYddPLsM) that I highly recommend. It looks at the problems facing NYC, but also the music scene of punk rock, early rap, and disco.  Anyway, in 1994, Rudy Giuliani took over the mayor's office and installed Bill Bratton as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, Bratton pushed the "broken windows" concept of policing, which had a heavy focus on punishing quality of life crimes. Trains were cleaned up, a lot of graffiti was cleaned up, more effort to pick up trash, and gentrification was encouraged. Times Square went from a place full of prostitutes, adult movie theaters, and drug dealers to a place with a giant Disney Store.  The NYC depicted in Mr. Robot is not nearly as clean as it is now, the streets are safer in the real NYC, and, Elliot would have trouble affording an apartment on his own, even in Chinatown. That being said, if you've ever watched Gotham on Fox, that really is a NYC stuck firmly in the crime and grime era.  EDIT: TL;DR: Mayor Giuliani really cleaned up NYC to the point that it is much cleaner, safer than as depicted in Mr. Robot.               The problem with juries are that juries are made up of people who view everything through their own personal biases, beliefs, and perceived expertise. There was one car damage case that I had to litigate twice, the two juries were completely and totally different from each other, it was amazing.

It is a set of ideas, and satirising ideas is fair game, no matter how "offensive" that may be.   It seems to be an english language thing in general. Unless I'm mistaken none of the papers in the UK, Australia etc. are reproducing the cartoons. In Canada, ALL of the french media in Quebec are showing the cartoons, but the english media in the rest of Canada (and in Montreal) are not. What that all means I'm not sure.   I'm not sure either but I think M. Night Shyamalan has optioned it.   [This comes to mind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRIUbFLjtX0)   The guy promoted his snuff film before it was even made.

 See, this is what I like about Nero. Wanting to beat the shit out of someone, but having a rational conversation with them first.    The one time it counts....really counts. Juice wont speak up.           What I want to know is why Maggie wasnt all that concerned over the news Beth was kidnapped    Were friends of the chick with the swords and the kid in the hat.    Carol   I didnt think I could love Carol more than I already did but then this episode happened!                  Well its over.... And that preview just made me want to watch it more! So freaking good! American horror story: Freak show is AMAZING!    This season has started off so well, but why did they give Kathy Bates that terrible Scottish accent?     Evan Peters is literally deliciously sinfully attractive when his characters get angry for some reason!  	15

       Well, if he made TMZ, he must be!  Actually, I just don't get why someone would throw away their reputation for a pair of sunglasses.

Then, I was watching TV on Saturday night (Mr. Excitement, right?) and Hitachi sponsors a show and I saw [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SQNMclNGY)  Went back to Oahu and my memories of Moanalua grew fonder 'cause one of my kids was born at Kaiser.                                     to do something you can do for free in your living room while getting head and watching television?  ...while eating pizza...

 Awesome seller  :)  she had a bottle of super hard to find lotion that she sent me just a few days after I got her the shipping payment and added a few other goodies too   This sweet person sent me a box filled with cookies and candy and other little goodies that made my day so much better :)  she saw that I was having a rough time in a post last week and wanted to help me feel better and her mission was certainly accomplished!! Each little gift inside the box was individually wrapped and she even sent a handmade card  ^-^  its so good to know that there are people out there will to show that they care for others, even if they have never met them before.      [My box of goodies!!](http://imgur.com/cpToCCq)   I'm a 24 year old female, with an associates in English and a job that I've had for 8 months that pays $13 an hour doing data-entry. In September I filed for Bankruptcy so getting a loan isn't an option. After my bills and other payments are made for the month, I usually have about $250 left over.      I really want to get out and see different places in the world, even if they're just an hour away from my city in Oklahoma. I'm feeling trapped by my lack of funds though. I can count the number of times I've been out of state for more than an hour or two at a time on one hand.      I want to go climbing in caverns and hiking on mountain trails. I want to eat pizza in New York and watch the sunset on a beach. I want to swim in the ocean and see a real archaeological dig site. I want to see new places and do new things that I will never have a chance to do here in Tulsa, Oklahoma.      I want to do these things but I don't even know where to start. I'm 5 ft and 100 lbs and that has always made me wonder if I would be alright traveling alone, being so tiny. I'm used to being responsible and I like knowing that I'll a safe place to sleep at night so the wandering lifestyle just isn't for me. I feel like only a real stroke of luck will get me out of town, even if it is just briefly. I know people must venture to new areas all the time though.      I need advice!!         **I may cross-post this in another sub if it's suggested so please don't downvote for that reason :)       I would love it if a kind person would do a reading for me. I am extremely confused by the current obstacles in my life.      It isn't that I don't believe in coincidences but for the past month now, every time a try to go on a date, something happens that makes either me or the other person have to cancel their plans. After it happened again tonight I have become so frustrated. I firmly believe that life or some other force is trying to tell me something or point me in a certain direction but I am just being to dense to pick up on any clues other than I am supposed to be alone for the time being. Great, fine. I wish I knew what other direction I should be focusing my attentions instead.      A little about me if it is helpful for your reading: I am a 24 year old woman. I have a steady job that really doesn't have an option for me to make a career out of it. I'm a pretty good writer but I've never focused on it as a life goal. I recently put in an application to be a volunteer at the local childrens hospital and just finished the interview process and should be starting my shifts soon there.      I would be ever so greatful if someone would be willing to try seeking a little insight on what direction would be best for me to head in. I'm quite lost when I don't have a plan and I don't even know where to start right now   Aw thank you  :)   Yeah I probably need to work on this more. I have a lot of angry impulses. Sometimes I don't realize I'm in an angry rage spiral until someone is like "Why did that make you so angry?" and then I just feel retarded   I really do need to take time out each day to focus on this more. Instead of when I'm already laying down in bed and likely to fall asleep   I'm in the process of trying to get my brain to realize this now  :/  I keep thinking that as long as I allow these negative thoughts to keep running through my mind, I'm going to keep attracting unfavorable situations. Its becoming quite frustrating. Hence this post, lol   Feel free to link any helpful articles too!!   Que over-protective pug mom defending her baby's honor  :p  	10

My friend put in some agaves like the ones I have in there about 6 months ago and these are actually babies from his plants - so I have some hopes it will fill out over the coming year.

 Most jello products or food with gelatin is made with fruit pectin. No animals!   Hey fellow teachers, In August I will be teaching at a new school(7-12). The current Language Arts teacher is very, very into ECAR(every child a reader) and ECAW(every child a writer). I have done a little research into this program, and it seems to be geared towards elementary age kids, not middle school(what I teach). I am very hesitant to adopt this new teaching program. Any thoughts out there? Are there benefits?    oh wow...that sounds like a difficult situation.  	3
 He got 2nd place in Evo 2012 too :(   Which match was better? Infiltration vs Momochi or Gamerbee vs Infiltration?  Those matches were super hype and close   Don't forget the extra twitch views from the Topanga Japan stream.   Infiltration got 3rd place again in 2010, 2013, 2015 :(   That was only when 1st-4th place already qualified.   Momochi and Infiltration guaranteed top 3 + already qualified   Can't freaking wait for Ultra Top 8. Also cool that it is on time as well (for the first time ever?) so it could actually finish before midnight over there.    Congrats KaneBlueRiver!   Who says Marvel Top 8 is dead without the Gods? 160K twitcher viewers NOW!  	9

 I didn't submit it to pics this is r/funny   It's been claimed already but I appreciate the interest!   You totally would   If it gives a few people a chuckle I've accomplished my goal   Check out my website! http://www.train_subject6359.com   Check out my website! http://www.studioRalu.com         Someone who plays a big part in AMAs got fired and the admins didn't even let the mods know it was going to happen so a bunch of subs went dark to protest how the admins don't care about the mods.   I have a hard time rolling over to pick up my phone. I can't imagine actually standing up    As soon as I looked at it, I thought "sockem boppers."   I have no science to back this up but I always keep my stomach sucked in because I firmly believe that if you don't keep your transversus muscles busy, you'll get a beer belly.   Alcoholism   I caught mewtwo with a pokeball. He was burned and the last burn brought him down to his last shred of life. It was good bc I hadn't saved beforehand and I wasted my masterball on snorlax.   More specifically a lot of floor space   Some kind of nature. Some kind of soul.   We will not be going dark. While I support the rest of the mods wholeheartedly, I don't think this sub is big enough that it would even matter. Enjoy the tingles folks :)   None of those are large words if you're reading above a 3rd grade level...   We're all Spartacus   That short hair though  EDIT: I meant that in a good way as in I like the short hair. Poor phrasing.   I'm not a religious man but sometimes little blessings like this make me wonder.   People who forget to check what sub they're in. I thought this was r/funny til I read the comments   This guy knows. Literally this.   I'm just yanking your chain. This is definitely the best advice you can give a young person. But in my case I've been all over the world already and after 30 years of school I'll be looking forward to some good old fashioned materialism.   As someone who lives in a place with snow half the year and temps below 0, fuck my life   Driving home in an F type or a z06 would bring tears to my eyes followed by years of happiness too though   Is it supposed to be slenderman   I've sold a few paintings on reddit and I wanted a new username that would match my email and website. Too lazy to switch back and forth between accounts so I just don't use the old one. The 3rd was a novelty account.   Also where is your spare key hidden?   When I'm out of school im going to spend 80k on a new car and there's not a god damn thing you can do about it 3   Probably on the driveway. As awesome as this is, I'd feel selfish evicting my car   You are an adult now so you can't blame your parents anymore. Go on r/fitness it's amazing what you can accomplish in just a couple months.   I've been here for more than 5 years in my other accounts and it was the same then as it is now.   I was JUST saying to my friend how I've never had a desire to own an army green car until I saw a c7 wearing it in the Chicago burbs   That's what I figured but I thought there was a funnier explanation haha   Explanation?   I use c.t.o.mf  "Check this out, motherfuckers"   I guess you could call them tan but the one in the pic is the same color as mine regardless   If I were you I'd use flatworm exit right away. They got so bad in mine it was such a nightmare. Those same little red ones.   a squirrel who turned on me  Did the squirrel have sex with your wife? Same thing happened to me bro   I suppose you're right   I started black and white because paint is expensive and I couldn't be bothered to mix colors :p but it fits the subject matter of my paintings pretty well so I stuck with it. A style itself is kind of just a function of how your mind naturally works. Happens on its own. Glad you like them!  Edit: also check out Simon Stlenhag's work   No need to be a jerk. So many people in this thread complaining about people downvoting opposite opinions and then simultaneously doing exactly that.    I loved bouncing. My bar used to have a line around the block on Thursdays. Never a dull moment. Also I used to make bank off of bribes :)   Keep ya pimp hand strong homeboy   It's weird I tried to cultivate mojos in mine because I liked how they clustered at my lfs. People say they are pests but they took ages to grow  in my tank and mostly kept to themselves.   No need to use bleach just use hot fresh water. But make sure to rinse the crap out of it after or it will give you a N spike   There's nothing to get just use your imagination.   Your analogy only works if you assume that I don't already know the time and the person asking me is showing me a watch with a blacked out face and expecting me to be able to read it.   You don't need knowledge, vocabulary, or an SLR to realize that if we can't see it then we can't ID it.   Stop stop I wasn't ready. Can you start over   When you want to look like you 6 mm tall and drive a hotwheels   I don't know why but i imagine him laughing with a French accent. Oh hohohohohoho   If someone asks for an ID and its a blurry, unlabeled picture of rocks, im downvoting it.    Don't tell him what to do.   Poetry.   Thanks man! I have a summer job atm so I actually just lowered all the prices. Good timing!   I started a year and a half ago. I think you're thinking of "I speak for the trees." that guy had been doing that in a lot of subreddits so the mod and I ended up getting him IP banned ;)   It's more than some pretty face beside a train    yep!   Samurai Jack had some of the coolest ideas. Im sure they subconsciously find their way into my art!   Hahaha I like your interpretation the best   Not exactly a fan but I like what I've heard from them. And triangles are my favorite shape too   I think I would poop my pants if they used my art   Any time. Keep it up!         Acrylic on canvas. Creepier stuff at http://www.train_subject6359.com.

Awesome piece as usual!   That r2d2 air filter is sexy   A new record!   Your username is an instant classic   Because it feels wrong and exciting   Ill tell her you said that when I see her tonight. Heyo!   Maybe show the whole car   Why not just use the monolith as mood lighting since its the bedroom and have an actual lamp for when you need actual light   And the lack of tits. Oh you already said that.   Did you know: the frog is designed like that to minimize the amount of air that can get underneath it, creating more downforce which allows for more grip on the road. This allows the frog to go from zero to a hunnit real quick. On your marks, get set, science.   Hahaha classic Jamal   Haha you replied to the thread instead of to the comment ya goof   That's what I was thinking too.

I was shoulder pressing 65 pound dumbbells once and a pretty large dude was lifting with his friend next to me. His friend told him to go grab 50s but he was watching me and must have thought since he was bigger than me he should be doing at least 65 so he grabbed those instead. He couldn't even get them up. Felt good.   I prefer "tickle monster"   I live under a rock and don't get it so I'm just going to assume it's an Arrested Development reference.   Oh my god dude that is yours?? Your ancestors must have been able to digest solid steel.   I agree. It's disgusting.

             Oh I have relevant story for this! He actually did do competitive swimming for almost 10 years and he was quite good. The toe of course was no actual help with his swimming, essentially negligible.   Well at one of the competitions he was in, one of the other swimmers noticed his freaky little toe and ran to the official and insisted it was cheating and he should be allowed to participate with an "advantage" like that. Official walked over and looked at his one connected toe and laugh, basically told the kid to shut up and that it was in no way an actual advantage haha.   Well if I do it, I'll be sure to provide pics of the process.   That's exactly what I think of!! I loved commander keep! Still run it on a Dos simulator from time to time :)   his mom had the option of separating them at birth, the bones are completely separate it's just the skin that holds them together. But she thought it was "unique" and kept them joined hahaha.      I don't care to see more of her, but the picture you posted is very clearly shopped. I don't know how you can't tell...   be a use its clearly been edited, this is "realgirls" shopped pictures shouldn't be in here   I work at a Tim Hortons and I've had customers complain to me about this several times. I agree that it is completely stupid to advertise their products on the menu board full of THEIR PRODUCTS, but I have had customers even yell at me regarding this. I feel like it's worth mentioning that we in store can't do anything about this. It's all down from corporate.

Hbede p der var nogle som havde erfaringer her som kunne fortlle noget.   Tnkte at det var lettere at finde danskere som Har flyttet til England her.   Det behver ikke at vre London som sdan.

Et estimat med flybillet, lejlighed, alt andet som man ikke ummidelbart tnker p?   In Denmark the Saudi ambassador blocked an entire floor in a hospital so that his mother (who does not have a Danish citizenship nor has ever paid taxes here) could be there in peace for her cancer treatment. This meant that many Danish citizens could not receive their cancer treatment because the beds were "occupied". Remember this is Denmark which is supposed to have free healthcare for its citizens who pay between 38%-45% in taxes to get free healthcare. There was also stories about several of the nurses going down with stress and some who quit because the family treated them "like slaves". The ambassador later claimed that it was okay because "he paid for all the treatment". That doesn't change the fact that doctors could not check up on other patients because the Saudi ambassador demanded his mom get first priority and again many patients were denied a place in the hospital because the beds were "full".  Even more fucked, most media here were completely silent about this. Why did most media not write about this? I wonder. Also it later was revealed the person who ran the hospital had been invited home to the ambassador for dinner.  And they say Scandinavia isn't a corrupt place.   Lmao, so now you've resorted to personal ridicule, eh? Believe in whatever you want, I've said my opinion.   No I wouldn't, because it would take the spot from somebody else who was legally entitled to it.   Thousands of people die in the US every year because they don't receive treatment that they could have otherwise received in Europe. The same would probably happen to me.  If every US citizen with a medical problem was allowed to travel overseas and get free treatment, the quality of healthcare in European countries would greatly decrease or just wouldn't be able to cope with all the patients and in the end it would result in native Europeans not receiving treatment because of the decreased quality or lack thereof.  The same goes for immigration. Countries can't handle the level of immigration currently without it decreasing various aspects of the welfare. This world is not some rainbow utopia where everybody can live happily ever after. When you get older, you will realize that things are not as simple as you think they are.   If I have problems receiving healthcare in the US, I shouldn't come crying to Europe and expect them to solve my problems. I should deal with my problems in my own country.  So yeah, I do believe in that.   Because I wasn't born there and I don't need to emigrate to the West.   Because it's not my problem.   Women in Europe didn't have the rights they have now back then. But with hard work that changed.  Running away from your country because it doesn't give women rights is never going to make that place any better.   So why not campaign against the Saudi flag?   The confederate flag happened before the 19's so I think that's old too then. Also if the confederate flag is only a symbol in the south then Americans in the north shouldn't have a say either.   So turn a blind eye on everybody else and be good pals with them, huh?   Not murders.   What is the government about?     	22

I'm not sure where you are from, but the United States has an all-volunteer military.  Therefore, every GI, sailor, airman and marine who participated in the unjust wars against Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, et al, did so by choice.   They committed war crimes to further the political, religious and economic interests of a select group of elites whose only goal is to promote U.S. hegemony and empire.  They do not deserve admiration or thanks.               Why honor soldiers who participated in an unjust war?      No, it's just a statement by a person incapable of formulating an intelligent rebuttal argument.  I think you know the statement by the author is true, but you just don't have the courage to admit it.         Let me ask you a question:  Do you believe the soldiers who died in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere since 2001 died to "protect our freedom?"  If so, please explain.   I noticed that you didn't refute the premise of the piece.  Please tell me what is wrong with the author's statement.                                 From Wikipedia: Moshe Kantor has been the president of the European Jewish Congress (EJC) since 2007, having been re-elected to the position in 2008 and again in 2012. The EJC, the largest secular organization representing the interests of European Jewry, is an influential, international public association representing some 2.5 million Jews across the European continent in 42 national Jewish communities.                                                                                                                     How many women and children were killed during this slaughter?  How do they know that every adult male killed was an "IS Member?"  Did the killers stop and take DNA samples of each murdered body to determine whether the deceased were known "leaders?"  This reeks like the bid Laden raid fairy tale.              	199

 Censorship does not equal condonement.  US citz should know.   Maybe I'm stoned (which I am) but this is one of the first Advice Animals that made me laugh out loud.    The Zionists have taught us all why Jews have been hated since the days of the Roman Empire, driven out of one community after another over the centuries  Your first sentence is saying that the actions of the Zionists are indicative of some trait of all jews that have caused them to be pariahs throughout history.  You aren't talking about "Zionists Jews" in this case because there were not Zionists "since the days of the Roman Empire".  You are the one with malicious intent.  You are trying to incite rage against all jews by implying that they have some sort of inherent character or cultural flaw that leads to them being persecuted.   How does it compare with redwood?  i know redwood doesn't rot but it is expensive.   Thanks! I'll check this one out too.   This is not about jews. This is about a corrupt government.  There are jews inside and outside of Israel that object to and protest the actions of the Zionist government.  Of course you probably know that, because if you control F "jew" your post history, it's pretty clear that you are obsessed with bashing jews.   Have you seen [Room 237](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_237) ? It details how The Shining might contain a confession of Kubrick's involvement in faking the 1969 moon landing and other great stuff.   aww, he's just going through his awkward years.      Eating locally is better for the environment, so it's good policy.   Dairy and meat consumption are also linked with all kinds of health problems where fruit and vegetable consumption is linked with all kinds of health benefits.   I'm having a hard time processing this because it is antithetical with my idea of an incompetent and corrupt federal government.   [Coming soon](http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/522960-deus-ex-human-revolution-windows-screenshot-menu-augmentationss.jpg)   how much gravity does it have?

EDIT: lolz at all the people upset that i accurately described what soda is   explain it to me. i don't get it.   if there's a depopulation agenda it's [failing miserably](http://www.ldolphin.org/poprecent.gif).  [Better graph with projections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-Population-1800-2100.svg)   Dogs can see colors, just less than humans do to their only having 2 color receptors instead of 3.   I only tuck my shirt in if I *forgot* to wear a belt.  Helps keep my pants from falling down.   Well, they both travel through a series of tubes... so.. makes sense.   Pragmatic is just another way to say "self-limiting".   WTF is "politically feasible"? All that amounts to is pandering to the status quo.  The way democracy is supposed to work is that when the majority of citizens wants something, that's what they've get.  But when we are so concerned with politics that it inhibits us from even TRYING to get what we really want, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  We have to redefine in our own minds what is possible and stop limiting ourselves according to some arbitrary standard of "practicality".   On top of all the other nonsense you just spewed, you just put the icing on the cake by misattributing this stupid quote for the billionth time.   Of course any news of the Israeli government actually doing something *good* for a change is going to be spun by this sub as another reason to admonish jews.  Give it rest.   Except when men are raped of course.  Then it's always real and there is a media conspiracy to cover up how often men are abused and raped by women.  (Yes, I know it DOES happen, but come on people.  Double standard much?)   Woah dude.  You really need to check your attitude.  Where did I sign up to be your online therapist?  I thought I'd send you a few words of encouragement to hopefully make you think and get you on the right path of changing your thought patterns.  You could try being a little grateful that a stranger is willing to do that for you.  It sounds like you need more help than I can offer you via this correspondence.  Have you ever considered seeing a professional?  Having someone to talk to on a consistent basis can really help you to get in touch with your own feelings and thought patterns, and maybe uncover the root of the problems you are having.  I'll leave you with a few final words in the sincere hope that they help you: Ultimately, the only person that can make you happy is yourself.  You cannot control how other people will act, but you can always control your own reactions to what comes (or doesn't come) into your life.  Learning to observe and direct your own emotional state will dramatically effect the course of your life.  Most people want circumstances to change so they can feel better, but in reality, you have to feel better FIRST, by whatever means necessary, even if you have to "trick" yourself at first.  Once you've adjusted your attitude you will notice things will start going your way more and more often, until it becomes a natural flow.  It's the art of living.  I sincerely hope you think about what I'm saying and open yourself up to a new way of being. The universe WANTS you to be happy.  Everything you need to accomplish this is in your hands.  Bless you and good luck, brother.   Here's the thing.. you said jackdaw is a crow.   I've got to believe it's the tipping point. They can't control EVERYTHING.   Better late than never!   You must enjoy what you do?   You are not easy to ignore.   I think already know the bright side, don't you smarty pants?      Some people might find that sexy.   Are you in highschool?  If so, you can look forward to people to become less clichy and obsessed with superficial things later on.  Even in college a lot people still have to grow out of that.  And honestly, those people aren't worth your time anyway.  It sounds like you are aware of a lot of your own good qualities.  That will get you far.  Don't worry about who likes or doesn't like you.  Just do your thing, and eventually you are bound to run into people who you vibe with.  Be someone that you yourself are proud of and everything else will fall into place. I wish you luck!   *applauds*   [Some people](http://www.lardbiscuit.com/lard/truefa.html) like you for that!   ok   You are good at removing negative influences from your life.   I found this interesting enough to reply!   Gonna give you a serious answer.  You've just identified the reason you are unhappy.  That's actually the first step towards solving your problem.  Now you can go about doing whatever you have to do to change your patterns of thought!  Also, you know that it's up to you to make you happy. No one else can do it.   You give people a chance who others don't. That's nice.   You're a great friend.   You probably eat a diet high in fiber.   You're an entertainer!   Really good for you.  On the bright side, I'm sure could find a partner of legal age who looks young and enjoys roleplay?  Would that do it for you?   I'm sick of the 6 raging racists with 300 accounts upvoting this shit.  It's tyranny.   This sub is quite obviously vote brigaded. Jew bashing posts are routinely voted to the top and initially they are awash with favorable comments. Overtime when real subscribers start reading it, those comments start to get downvoted.   how many accounts do you have?    So your list includes people who left the government to work for Monsanto as evidence of some kind of revolving door. Quite the stretch if you ask me.  That's actually the definition of a "revolving door".  From the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics\)) which I suggest you read:   Industry, in turn, hires people out of government positions to gain personal access to government officials, seek favorable legislation/regulation and government contracts in exchange for high-paying employment offers, and get inside information on what is going on in government.  Moreover, you seemed to have cherry picked examples from the list that are the least incriminating.  Clarence Thomas, by the way, worked for Monsanto for 3 or 4, but the length of time is irrelevant.  Anytime a judge of a case is a former employee of a plaintiff in a trial, there is a real conflict of interest.  2 former FDA commissioners have also worked for Monsanto as well.  There are simply way too many connections to ignore.  This is clearly a case of the wolves guarding the hen house.   Only heartless POSs pray for others to suffer.  Nowhere did I say I didn't care about the victims.   As per usual, you didn't supply any new information.  You simply linked to your own blog.   http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg   You hit the nail on the head.   Labeling laws are kind of the last resort of people who are concerned about ecological effects.  The federal government is a revolving door with the biotech industry.  Look at [this chart](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) for details.  Because of the governments unwillingness to impose rigorous testing standards, and instead rely on the companies' own research to approve new strains, the only option a concerned citizen has is to avoid supporting the industry with their purchasing power.  Of course, this is very difficult to do if we don't have knowledge of which products contain GMOs, and that's the way they like it.         If you actually read the link I sent you you would know this already.  Here is just ONE example:  Plants are bred to be resistant to glyphosate herbicides.  Farmers begin spraying massive amounts of glyphosates on their crops due to the resistance.  The targeted weeds evolve resistance to the herbicide.  Monsanto creates stronger herbicide and new crops with resistance to this herbicide.  The cycle repeats.  As the herbicides get stronger and stronger the collateral damage to the ecosystem gets higher.  These herbicides are already known to cause damage to certain insect life.   [Read and learn](http://rt.com/usa/usda-gmo-risk-report-537/)   OMFG, you literally chopped off the end of what (s)he said to manipulate their argument.  They actually wrote: MUCH more research is needed to provide an answer as to exactly how the modifications will affect **ecosystems** in the long run.   Talk about being disingenuous.   *Tyranny is the deliberate removal of nuance.*  Most people here seem incapable of nuanced thought, and so are imposing rational minds to a tyrannical atmosphere.  It's time we evolve past this concept of "teams" or "sides" or even spectrum.  We live in a beautiful multidemensional universe with an infinite number of moving parts.  We can't distill things down to "Good" or "Bad". I wish more people on reddit would grow up and evolve their thinking a little bit.  Nuance people.   Bill THANK YOU for speaking up on this.  Too many people here act like any kind of critical opposition or concern with GMOs is by definition "anti-science".  They have been able to effectively frame the debate about human health and for the most part ignore the environmental implications.  The precautionary principal should stand here, because we could be changing the ecosystem in an irrevocable way.  In your opinion, are scientists who are skeptical over the safety and efficacy of GMOs given a fair chance to research and present this research?  Is there some sort of systematic discrimination going on in the form of funding cuts or ostracization?    Thank you again for speaking with bravery and integrity.   Can you expand on what you mean by getting legislation to draft an acceptable law? Like they refused to do it? Why can't citizens must right the law? Is this how state ballot initiatives normally work?    Hey, you do what you can when you can.  I started like 10 years ago just reducing my meat consumption to once a day. Now I eat completely vegan!  There are actually a ton of really awesome dairy alternatives.  For instance: [here's a really yummy vegan mac and cheese recipe](http://veganyumminess.com/creamy-vegan-mac-and-cheese/).  You don't have to go cold turkey or even ever completely give it up if you don't want, but reducing your meat and dairy consumption as you are comfortable is a huge help to animal welfare, and not to mention the environment!  Thanks for asking questions.   Hmmm..   Looks like CA first voted in 1972, but 66% rejected it.  The one I was referring to was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_19_(2010) with 53% voting no.  A substantial portion of the opposition came from people who were very pro-pot, perhaps even growers themselves.  They were worried about too much red tape and too high of taxes.   Embarrassed for CA right now.  We had the chance to be first and blew it.  Go Oregon!      This is why I don't call myself vegan even though I eat a 99.9% vegan diet.  Instead I say I eat a "plant-based diet", but every once in a blue moon I want to have a slice of pizza with real cheese, and I just do.  I don't feel bad about it and then I go right back to eating what I normally eat.  It doesn't have to be a dogma.   Moral objections are only one reason that people choose to be vegan.  Others include health and environmental concerns. Also, even if they do have moral objections to eating meat, they still might not tell you.  Like, if you object to say, abortion, and you're best friend just had one, you might just bite your tongue to avoid a conflict.   Are you a water/ress? It doesn't mean they don't understand it if they ask, it probably just means that it's easier to ask someone who's familiar with the menu than look through 50 menu items for the 1 things that doesn't have animal products in it.   Most wines.   Where are you getting your information from?  I googled that exact quote and the only the people using that quote are from sites dedicated to bashing Jews, not from Jews themselves.  Here is the real text of the Talmud online:  http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/talmud.htm  Now show me where in it, it says anything like that quote.  There isn't even a real conception in Jewish thought of a place called "Hell".  It's a more modern Christian concept, so this quote is highly dubious.  EDIT: and for the record, I've never ONCE heard a Jewish person refer to anyone as a "Goyim", I've ONLY heard it from people claiming that Jews regularly refer to the rest of the world by this word.  Jews really aren't the demons you're making them out to be.  I really suggest you open your heart and maybe try talking to some actual Jews to get their perspective.   Fuck this.  The Israeli government does not represent Jews as a whole.  Their name has been hijacked by Zionists.  Also, There is no legitimate reason to persecute anyone.  Here is the definition of persecute:  subject (someone) to hostility and ill-treatment, especially because of their race or political or religious beliefs.  Even if you can say without a doubt that the majority of members of any particular group are behaving badly, collective punishment is unfair and unhelpful.  It's unfair because of the members of that group that don't participate in this behaviour and may even speak out against it.  It's unhelpful because once you've stigmatized the entire group it causes an "us and them" division for both members of the persecuted group, and everyone else, which breaks down communication and bars finding real solutions.   I have been practicing yoga for over 5 years, and while I do go through phases of more and less active times in my practice, I see it as an integral part of my life's path.  I have been toying with the idea for some time to make the commitment to become a yoga teacher to share this joy with others.  Recently, I've made that commitment, declaring that I will do teacher training by my next birthday!  I don't know what form this will take, where it will be, or in what specific school I will study.  A note, I'm not necessarily looking to make a "career" out of this; my primary motivation is to deepen my practice and learn the skills I need to safely and effectively help others. I can see myself doing "by donation" classes in local parks.  A few questions come to mind at this point:  * What steps can I take today to move towards my goal?  I've browsed many websites, but I haven't found the one that looks perfect for me.  Still, I want to move forward * Is "certification" a very important thing when looking for a teacher or school? As I said, I'm not necessarily looking for a job in the traditional sense. *  Do I have to spend thousands of dollars on this?  Are there programs where I can volunteer for a reduced rate of teaching? * What about choosing a "style"?  I want to learn all I can about a variety of yogic paths and not box myself in to a particular school.  Thank you for your thoughts.      That is just false.  There is a standard AND a definition for "organic".  Google it and stop spouting nonsense.     Mine doesn't even stop to smell pee. Nose must be busted. :-(      Ha! Mine is even worse.  He will put the ball literally in my hand, but if I close my fingers around it he will start growling and tugging away.   Probably: The Kills  Might: Fleet Foxes  Probably haven't: Sunset Rubdown  Haven't: Buke and Gass   That's actually a tricky question and you'll get different answers depending on who you ask.  The first Zionists were secular and made a political argument for the creation of the state of Israel.  It is correct to say that modern Zionists are acting "in the name of Judaism", but not everyone agrees that they have the right to do that.  There are actually religious arguments *against* Zionism, such as [this group](http://www.nkusa.org/) lays out.   They overlap, but they are not mutually inclusive.  Zionism is a POLITICAL movement for Jews to move to Israel.  There are many Jews who are not Zionists and there are also Zionists who are not Jews.   I've personally heard first hand accounts from dozens of Holocaust survivers. They talk about their family perishing in the camps. Are you telling me that all of these people were lying?  So, they managed to get all the jews on board to all tell the same story?  Where are the whistleblowers?   The fact that you are downvoted so much really makes me worry about the intelligence and intellectual honesty of the frequenters of this sub (of which I am one myself).  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, but all that's happening here is people putting their fingers in their ears and going "Nanananana everything you know is wrong."   The first paragraph was the best part of this article.  Let's focus on that.  The day will come when no one is relying on a traditional job to survive.  We are reorganizing into self-sufficient sustainable communities.  The day will come when there is no one to run the grid power, and the servants will all leave the billionaires mansions to join these communities, and the billionaire will have to humble himself and walk down the hill to real community of human beings, beg forgiveness and ask to join.   Because it's talking about the average redditor.   What did we expect from /u/pm_me_ur_tits___  ?      The first plan is TO plan.  Everyone is going to have different ideas on how we should tranform the world and I say we try all of them.  Get together on the regular with real people near where you live.  Come together with a shared intention to make a difference and to come away with an actual plan of action, no matter how small.  Then share your experience with others so we can learn from each other's experience.  Stay positive, revise often, and don't lose focus on the goal.   you don't need to meet bigotry with bigotry.   The Powers That Be are extremely well organized and they thrive on chaos of the masses.  The more angry and scared people are, the easier it it to funnel their energy into their agenda.  As truth comes to light, the initial reaction is denial, followed by shock, followed by anger.  We need to take the next step, and come to a place of calm understanding.  From there we can begin to get together to take coordinated action to subvert the agenda.  There need not be one single, agreed upon plan, this is the MO of the power hoarders.  Instead we operate as [autonomous groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_group) that can network when appropriate.  We need to use every means available to us.  If we get active, WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE WORLD *THEY* WANT US TO.   Do not fall into the defeatist trap.  That is part of their plan.  This is our planet and it's time we take it back.   Who the hell is upvoting this nonsense? Seriously.   Does your game support Google cardboard?   Aaaaand it's 5am and I spend the last 12 hours coding, forgot to sleep!!  I've started on a new game, a puzzler!  I'm using [Processing](http://processing.org/)  to rapidly prototype the idea and for the level editor.  Once I have the design hammered out I plan on rewriting the game in Unity3D, bringing in all the good graphics at that time.  Very excited but I  must sleep!   Can anyone find the current status of the [lawsuit](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/05/adrian_schoolcr_1.php) that Schoolcraft filed against the NYPD?   In May 2011 a judge ruled that discovery could proceed, but I can't find any info and what happened after that.   Have you even *seen* a fossil? I mean, outside of your Darwin books.   This is really laughable.  Someone attempts to engage in a rational discussion of the content of the article and your mind automatically goes "SHILL!" Because anyone who even dares question any portion of your ideological view of the world is necessarily working with the enemy.   I see you edited your comment to remove you calling /u/werevolved "jewboy" for asking for proof that "the holocaust is fake".  Smooth.   In your reality people that question your denial of one of the most well documented events in history are "shills".  	100
 - The national spotlight will rip this guy to shreds. -  Yes. His actions need to come out into the light. He's a sneaky shit who needs to stand naked in that cleansing spotlight.   I think most people would not want to have a beer with Walker.  He apparently can't even go out to eat in Madison without getting booed.  That's why he has to take his lunch in a brown paper bag.    His own campaign will bring his misdeeds into the light.  Things will come to a head in this election.  The psychic boil of right wing hate/extremism will pop with Walker.  The pendulum is already swinging.     lol all the GOP presidential competitors say that.  But now that God's plan on earth has been destroyed by same sex marriage, can He find the strength to carry Scott to the throne?   Yes, this is it.   How shocking that she didn't answer his question.   My 2 favorite slow movements are from Mozart's last 2 string quartets - the Larghetto from No. 22, B flat major, K. 589, Prussian No. 2; and the Andante from No. 23, F major, K. 590, Prussian No. 3. I especially love the Larghetto, with its elegant, heart-breaking melodies.        JPOnion, you're contradicting yourself.  You said that his age (by implication, his health) is an issue in this election.  Then you say "The American voting public, Bernie's opponents and the media don't really care about your subjective opinion on his health."  Make up your mind.  Voters do care or don't care about age and the implicated health issues associated with age?    Bernie looks like he's in fantastic condition. He was a marathon runner and his BMI looks terrific compared to lumpy Hillary.  Physical fitness matters.    Don't the Republicans want us to keep working anyway? Consider the ages of the Supreme Court Justices.  Ginsburg 82; Scalia 79; Kennedy 79 in a few weeks;  Breyer 76.  Four out of nine are over 75, and consider that they are appointed for life.     Also, please direct us to your source that Bernie is "polling on average below Biden."  I'm interested in seeing those polls.     I want to add that it's worth considering if there is any relationship between Wisconsin's leading the nation in alcohol consumption and the continuing election of the far right wing to Wisconsin political office.    These right wingers are flagrant liars and users, engaging the entire state in (what are comparable to) alcohol fueled delusions about climate, the economy and our rights.  Are the voters of Wisconsin too hammered to recognize the right wing's theft of our freedoms?   The far right Republicans of Wisconsin are flagrantly rampaging against democracy. They aren't even subtle about it - they've gotten away with it for so long they don't even pretend to follow the rules. How about a new requirement for running for political office? Potential candidates have to take a test on the constitution, with emphasis on the Bill of Rights.   The far right Republicans of Wisconsin are flagrant in their rampaging against democracy.

 Oh. I was being sarcastic anyways   Now you have 7 upvotes :)   Yeah, the sous vide is much quicker. I've used the reverse sear oven method many times with bigger cuts like prime rib, excellent results   Eh, I like my meat rare. This is cooked to 125F (rare is 120-130F for lamb). Also haven't died from E. Coli poisoning yet so there's that   No it obviously came from my garlic mustard tree out back   It was at 125F for an hour, followed by 6-7 mins under the broiler on low   Who said I was white?   Why thank you!   see below   /r/misleadingthumbnails ?   Yeah I have to hold my breath when I cut open to cryo-vac packaging haha   Yeah I have a tall steel pot I usually use. Pre-heat the water and throw the vacuum sealed meat in.  This rack was exactly 1.5lbs, and I left it in about 1 hour   Anova sous vide. Love it :) I applied the garlic mustard paste and broiled it after sous viding it   lol   Horseradish if you like horseradish. Otherwise, maybe just try it with the garlic and oil   i don't get it.   Not too difficult. There are a lot of diy guides online   I posted the recipe below   Check out the Anova sous vide   First I rinsed the lamb and then pat it dry. I used salt, pepper, onion powder, sumac, and sliced raw garlic on both sides of the lamb, then vacuum sealed it with 1 tbs butter. Used my Anova sous vide to cook it at 125F for at least 1 hour (you can leave it in the water bath up to 3 hours).   Once you put the lamb in, you can start on the crust. Wrap about 8-10 cloves of garlic with some olive oil in aluminum foil and throw in a 400F oven for 45 mins to an hour. It's going to make your house smell heavenly so be prepared.   Once the garlic is done, place it in a bowl. Add 2-3 tbs of mustard (I used spicy brown) and about 1 tbs olive oil. Add any other seasonings you want... I used salt, pepper, and sumac to complement the flavors in the lamb. Mash everything together to make a thick paste.  Remove the lamb from the vacuum bag and pat it dry. Place in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet and generously smear the garlic paste all over the top. Then set your oven broiler to low, and put the lamb on the top rack for about 6 minutes (I had to move it a few times under my broiler to get an even sear).  Remove from broiler once the crust looks good to you, let it sit for 5 mins and then carve away.  Hope you enjoy!    Here it is before carving:  http://i.imgur.com/1mgMTa1l.jpg    No, it was insanely tender. Fell apart in my mouth   I sous vide it at 125F to account for the additional temp increase when putting it under the broiler to make the crust. Rare lamb is from 120-130F   Just made a thick paste out of roasted garlic, spicy brown mustard, olive oil, salt, pepper, and sumac. Apply the paste after its done in the sous vide and throw it under your oven broiler on low for about 6-7 minutes   I pat dried it after sous vide-ing... then put on my paste and threw it under the oven broiler on low for about 6-7 minutes      browned shallot and garlic in butter, added wine and cream and it became this color! maybe the longostino and shrimp added the pink hue?     	28
 Actually last night I loaded up the backpack with deer and made the hike through the Ravine for the first time. Seriously, these 3AM excursions are going to kill me.   I know the preview video I saw recently mentioned adding animations for eating, etc... but I'll be honest, I don't think it 'needs' those things anytime soon. I mean, I don't feel like I'm missing anything because I can't see me scrape out the inside of the dog food can with my fingers, a'la Mad Max, not that it wouldn't be cool. But I also kind of feel like that's what it would take, an animation for each type of food. And honestly, I'd much rather see more crafting or building type options (maybe the ability to gather wood for lean-to's or temporary shelters, or something like that) than I would see me lower myself to demolishing the last few bites of dog food.   Seems like perhaps a little less hatred of The Weather Channel is in order for you.   Drop your classes except for welding. Get your certs. Go make 100 grand a year and take a few years to figure out what you want to do in life. I blew my full-ride on weed way back when I was in college, like, literally, spent all the money on marijuana, and that was in 1998, so that was a lot of weed. Got into it with my dad, my mom, my friends, pretty much anyone who asked what I was going to do with my life and why didn't I give a fuck about being a fuck up. So I said fuck it, dropped out, got my welding certs (just GMAW a first), got one of the gazillion welding jobs out there where you go to work, put your helmet on, lay a bead all day and never really have to interact with anyone if you don't want to. Hid from everyone for a few years and when I surfaced I felt good finally. I felt good about me, despite anyone's views of who I was supposed to be or what I was supposed to do.   If you want, I work in Fremont now and live in Marin, if your near either of those places PM and I'll buy you a coffee and you can hang out and vent some.   One the Menu screen, choose forage for wood. You can do it inside or outside, but inside means you won't freeze while you do it, but once you've reclaimed all the wood inside a cabin, it's gone for good. You can forage outside as much as you want.   Thanks for producing such a quality piece of code. Good to hear about the updates, I'll keep exploring and see what I can find.    I know there's a big Long Dark forum since it's been around on Steam for a while now, but here's a quick post on my impressions so far, as well as a few tips that I've found out in my playtime.   Firstly, I'm totally digging this game. I downloaded it and the Elite Dangerous trials both at the same time, liked them both, bought the full versions, but haven't stopped playing this long enough to get any Elite time in, other than an hour or so. I'm usually not much of a survival-genre player, but I got a little hooked after only lasting 8 hours my first game and then figuring out ways to slowly get that number a little higher. I've played a dozen or so games now and on my current save game I've been alive for 12 and a half days. I've got two well stocked shelters (the Camp Office and the Trappers Cabin) and am beginning to explore the area. Overall, if you're into survival and crafting type games, you'll probably like this, and even if youre not, you should at least give the trial a shot, you may be surprised.   A few tips I've picked up, remember, almost like real-life, there's some priorities to your survival. Your number one priority should be shelter. Without shelter you'll freeze to death. No matter where you spawn you're never more than 30 minutes or so from a cabin, but if you haven't got the lay of the land yet (I recommend not looking at the abundance of maps available online, it sorta takes some fun out of it) any shelter will do. If it has an inside, but no stove for a fire than it's probably not great (I'm looking at you Logging Camp and you Lake Cabins). Stoves make starting fires easier, and are a requirement if you want to have a fire inside.  So, first and foremost, find a not-breezy spot to start a fire. Forage for a little wood (an hour or two long fire from a few pieces of softwood is fine for now) and get that fire going. Melt some snow and boil it for some safe drinking water. I think Im averaging a liter of water a day or so. Then food. Food is last, always. You can go a day and a half without eating a thing while exploring if youre not injured. In fact, if youre rationing, you can make a few candy bars and sodas last 3 or 4 days. If youre low on food, only eat when you run out of calories. And speaking of running, stop, unless you have a good food source. It burns calories and risks sprained ankles and falls. And falling will hurt and tear up your jeans, and well, without jeans, yeah, youre gonna die. Also, running around can easily attract a wolf that you might have been able to avoid, and if you get attacked by a wolf, yeah, youre gonna die. And lets not mention that bear that hangs out by the Lonely Pond, because a tussle with him, and yeah, you guessed it, youre gonna die. The only time running is a must is if you see a wolf chasing a deer and have something to scare the wolf off with (Flare, Gun, etc) Than run in their direction, the wolf will eventually catch the deer and then you can steal his kill and harvest without a tool, which is impossible to do with the frozen deer corpses you find.  I wont give away any of the stashs locations that Ive found, but I will say when you find Mystery Lake, take your time and fully explore it. Setting up a base at the Camp Office and getting into a forage for wood, get some food, explore, rest cycle will go really far for you. Dont venture too far until youve checked out all the little nooks and crannys around the lake, theres good stuff all over.   I will say one thing Im concerned about is how often this game will see updates. I can tell pretty quickly that now that I have a stable food supply and two well stocked places to crash with plenty of fire-starting abilities that I will eventually run out of stuff to find and explore. Im hoping by then that one of the other areas opens up, because if not, this game could get pretty boring pretty quickly.    There was a moment somewhere between 12 and 15 months (I'm normally not a month counter, years have always been good enough for me) when it went from me hugging her to her actually hugging me. The first time I picked her up and she wrapped her arms around my neck (it was a nightmare) will live with me forever.    This game is awesome and I've been waiting for something like this on Xbox. Its really great looking, sounds good, and plays fantastic. There's still small bugs to work out, namely for some reason their message parser doesn't read your button mappings correctly, but overall, this game is fantastic. I think I'm totally going to start up a small mining company off in the outer systems and just, relax, go to work every day, and earn an honest living.   Coming from a small dev team, I know the pain of getting things done. Its looking great so far, keep on it, I  know I'm super excited to play it.   They can if you also want to be forced to fight bears in that same trench.   Most the earlier riders that day had faced some pretty heavy headwinds which had calmed down by the time Gwen came up. Not very lucky in my opinion, but still an element of luck with him that day.   You got a bad deal on that Huffy man, those things go for like $49 around here.   Actually just woke up yelling from having a nightmare about my 2 year old drowning in a pool. Tried to go back to sleep and it went straight back to me diving into the pool. Noped the fuck out of there and am now Redditting.   I don't know man, I feel like if you had been driving on the correct side of the road in those clips you wouldn't have so many people trying to run you over. /s   Phenomena  do doo-be-do do be-do do be-do do be-do do dot a dot dot dotta da   Yeah, I can't make any comment about the games, seeing as how they didn't "show" anything, but this company isn't really getting me excited about anything.   Pretty happy that he was actually using that broadsword correctly.   Didn't Burnquist just win the Big Air at X-Games last week?  But, other than that I can sort of agree with you. Make this appeal to the gaming demographic, not the original THPS demographic.   Haven't played Perfect Dark in forever.    And you didn't x-post to call him (or her) out?   Hi, fellow Bay Area Rider. You live in the city or just go there to test camera mounts?   What about female... and [deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Fiolek)?   Do it up man. Just got back from my Sunday morning ride, not 74 miles worth, but fun none-the-less.   Wha? Just did the hike out to the falls and must have missed the lake and swing, where was it?   So nice. That stage where they're super fun to do stuff with, but they haven't quite started to hate you and hate doing stuff with you. I'm bookended with a 19 year old and a 20 month old. Enjoy those years. And in three or four years when you need a shoulder, let me know.   Case of the hot snakes.   Just got a Surface Pro 3 and am looking to get a case or skin for it. I do have the keyboard for it so it needs to work with that and I do use it docked so something compatible with a dock or at least easy to get in and out of for dropping it on the dock when I get to work.   Any suggestions?   Bandit 1250.    36,000 commuter miles. Not much opportunity to wear them off when I'm stuck between cars.   It was close, but him by an antennae.    Bandit 1250. I probably could take him, but he's got an advantage in the wet.   My commute is Novato to Fremont. Soaking wet was an understatement. Normally I find a few miles where it's not raining for a little respite. Not this morning. Solid rain from my garage to work.      Or you know, just a regular Monday. Hopefully without the crap rain that we're having today. Go F yourself California drought.   Yes, not so nice for the motorcycle commute from Novato to Fremont though. But I'll never complain about rain.   And we did, didn't we.   So on this panel for the outside players is the UP direction accomplished by pressing towards the screen or towards the opposite player?    They are in line with the buttons. I figured that would be the least confusing way to do it. But yeah, you're right, player 3 and 4 don't just get weird angles, they get weird angles that affect the way they play.   Good point.    Yes, on SNES, but never in an arcade. Although, it's funny, many people replied with constructive criticism's that couldn't have taken much longer to write than your two comments, and they were infinitely more helpful than "Have you ever played Smash TV" and "Agreed, this is... just... bad :/"   But thanks for all your helpful comments. /s   Ah ha, I see. I understand now. Yeah, the 3 and 4 player joysticks are rotated slightly to compensate for their angle to the screen. Good point. I guess I'll be cutting up that other board after all. I can get some mileage on this one in the meantime.   The viewing angle from 3 and 4 aren't too bad, I test played some Gauntlet last night to check. The BenQ monitor has a pretty awesome viewing angle. This is mainly going to be a two-player rig anyway, so I knew I was making concessions against 3 and 4.   Can you explain why Smash TV is going to be hard with this setup?   I went with a 48" diameter half-circle, with a 6" straight header at the top. I actually biased player one and two to have more room, since two player games some times get a little heated (a'la Street Fighter) and most of the four-player stuff only takes a couple buttons anyway.   Still just running on keyboard and mouse, I'm only about halfway wired up on the control panel. I'm going to leave the panel unfinished for now while I decide if I like the layout or not. I actually have enough wood left over to do a second one if I don't like this one.   The lexan is ordered for the front and the marquee and I'm still playing around with ideas for marquee art. I also have a lexan lower for the control panel that wraps around the bottom of the panel and hides the wiring, etc... I'm thinking of doing the entire first level of Metal Slug as the background for inside that lower wrap.      I think you were just making a joke, haha, these Bay Area folks can't take a little heat.   But you do realize that the reason they issued it wasn't because it was going to be hot. It was because it's going to be hot after weeks of cooler than normal weather. They just had a report published that said that May was cooler than any other month so far in 2015. So yeah, when the temperature spikes in such a short period, they put it out there so people can keep on eye on their pets or the little old lady that lives next door that doesn't have air conditioning.   I don't know if this is the same as the Toast in Novato, but I would also vote for the Bacon Cheeseburger at Toast.    Sometimes shit just doesn't work out. My parents stuck together "for the kids" it was the worst idea ever. We hated them more for doing it, especially when we found out that they did it. If it's time, just do it.   I watched the recently new Godzilla last night. I like this gif version better.   5k for my motorcycle. Ride it every day. Still love it.   So, good job, interest piqued. I'm just finishing catching up on the last five years of Daredevil (thanks Netflix), maybe you could point me towards some issues to get into this?   As a programmer it feels so satisfying hearing them count up in bit sizes.   I prefer the sequel, in all honesty. It's so much more fun than the first.   I wish so much for this to be true.   Something quick is the In n Out right next door. That Panda is just nasty.   No advice. But thanks, I didn't have work or anything to do for the last half hour.   Don't forget the most [important day of the year](http://www.officialsteakandblowjobday.com/).   I was wondering about this. I have a bunch of stuff laying around that I'm not actively using.   I've never made a packed library in LabVIEW ever. I think they're a pain to deal with and a mistake on NI's part. But besides that, I'm currently working on a project right now with over 3000 vi's spanning three target deployments using LVOOP and I have no problem with creating distributions, installers, etc... If I were you, I'd start by removing classes a bit at a time and retrying the build to see if it works. My guess is you've either got a corrupted project, which I've seen happen or a corrupted library somewhere. You are keeping your classes in library's, right?   Violin's suck.   Source: not violinist. Am biased.   You're going to buy a classic bike that could need work and was fast enough to rule the drag strips back in the day as your first bike?   Why not something like a nice Ninja 500? They're all over CL for less than 2 grand all the time and they're not much taller than the ZL.   Took my California motorcycle test (I moved from Kansas and already had the M on my license there) and passed the written. No riding test necessary.   http://www.fiery-foods.com/article-archives/86-capsaicin/1827-overdosing-on-capsaicin  Sounds like it's possible, but very difficult.    I've learned to gauge how serious it is from the initial cry, to the actual scream. My daughter does a short cry (less than a second) than the quiet, mouth open, scream, until she runs out of breath, than the real crying starts. The longer that time spent holding her breath with the silent scream mouth thing going, the worse it is.    Right, it's insane. As motorcyclists who travel between traffic in California we deal with a greater number of individuals per day than almost any other commuter out there. This means our chances of dealing with one of those insane people goes up. Which means you either accept that the person you're telling to get off the fucking phone is insane and might take your valuable advice the wrong way, or you swallow it and move on with your life. The choice is yours, just know that this crazy motherfucker, and other's like him are out there on the road.   I always have my DNS set that way. Didn't even notice it.   Not on a budget, just have an old jacket that I'm tired of 'dealing' with. Seeing this shiny new A* makes me want a new jacket.   Thank you, my life is complete.   I need a new jacket. My "three-season" jacket's waterproof liner is also it's thermal liner, so to be waterproof I also have to be hot. And since the California drought doesn't seem to hitting the bay area anytime soon and I'm tired of showing up to work soaking wet, I need a new jacket.   Why isn't this higher up? Dropping that mixer in the water, would at worst, heat the water up a bit and possibly (minor possibility) provide a small charge to the skin of the child, not across any organs, and definitely not any way, shape, or form provide enough current to kill the baby.    Same here. I switched my DNS to 8.8.8.8 and could get slow service so I reset the modem and viola, all was well. 20 seconds later they told me everything was fixed. They're so smart.   What time? Up in Novato Comcast took a crap for about 30 minutes around 9:30PM. No weird power stuff though.   Good job. Sometimes when I'm in Safeway I stand and stare at the Chocolate Peanut Butter Hagen-Dazs. Some of those times I win and other times I lose. Good job for winning today.   See my answer to /u/nerms1. Only 4 inputs per joystick.   Yep, you guys are right. They only have four switches each. Now I've got 16 extra inputs to play around with.    So the controller is finally coming together and I'm ordering buttons, joysticks, controllers, etc today and I'm a little confused about the IPAC4. It says it's 56 inputs, but by my count I need 60. 6 each for player one and two buttons, 4 each for player three and four buttons, 32 for four eight way joysticks, 4 player start buttons, 4 coin-in buttons. Am I missing something?   I'd buy from you all day long, except that it costs $75 in shipping to California.    Watched half of Kung Fury on my laptop, decided to finish it up on the XBox. It started where I left off. Nice. The future is now.   Have you seen Jodi Sweeten's boobs. Wow. Meth, maybe once, I guess.   Hey, don't worry about it. We all did it. I had your exact same reaction the first time she fell. I thought she was dead. She cried, she held on to me like the world had ended, I felt horrible. But life kept going on.    That sickening moment when you're sliding on your ass and you look over to see your bike sliding, and you kind of share a moment when the two of you look at each other and you're both like, man, this sucks.   Bro, I play rough with my daughter. A few days ago I was flipping her over on the bed and she landed on her neck and I seriously thought her neck was broken. She cried for twelve seconds but gave up because it was too hard to cry and laugh at the same time. Ended up just laughing.   These things are tough. Don't worry about it.   Good thinking dad. Not something I could pull off at home, because our XBox One doubles as the home theatre in the living room and my daughters toys rule the roost in there, so no room for a bike there. I normally find myself up till 2 or 3 am, playing games with my headphones on when I feel the video game itch. I'm also building a MAME cabinet and hopefully my daughter will be so into video games that she'll play some street fighter with her old man sometimes.   I can't even think of this movie without thinking about Mia Kirshner singing about wanting to fuck her brother.   I wanted to be her brother so bad.   Got sideswiped on 880 in the East Bay while splitting between HOV and left lane. Her insurance paid for 100%. CHP officer that was onsite said she told him that she didn't see me and changed lanes. Maybe it would've been different if I had hit her car in the rear, but my helmet dent was right on her roof, just above her door. It was obvious that I was right next to her and she hit me.   Body position. Body position. Body position. You fell because you had hard parts touch the ground because you were sitting in the middle of the seat and pushing the bike down below you. If you want to keep riding like an idiot on the street, you should do two things. One, pony up for a track day. They're not that expensive and the things you will learn in a few hours on the track will make you so much more successful on the street. Two, get off the bike some more. The further you move your center of gravity towards the inside of the turn, the less steep your lean angle needs to be, thus keeping the hard parts of your motorcycle off the ground. Move your outside buttcheek to the inside part of the seat, put your head wear the inside mirror is, imagine that you're trying to kiss your reflection.   And to make the point for the thousandth time, not that you'll listen, stop riding at 10/10ths on the street (this video was obviously more like 11 or 12/10ths considering the outcome). Proper riding technique can bring joyful riding even when you're only pushing it to 7 or 8/10ths of your ability, and it leaves room to correct for sand i nthe road, idiot drivers, etc...   Should be number one response. Everyone should know this.   My daughter was almost a year old when I switched jobs. Between the jobs I took a month off (thanks California bonding pay) and stayed home with my daughter. Going into that month I felt like you. Coming out of that month I was ready to have another baby.   It get's better. Sometimes it's little things that light the way, sometimes it's one moment when they look at you and smile and say Dada. This last week, my now two-year old daughter was down in Florida visiting Grandma and I had to stay back home to work. Wednesday night I talked to her on the phone just before bedtime and she said, "Miss you dada," and it literally brought tears to my eyes. Something I never would have considered happening a year and a half ago.   I've been told by a variety of sources that the definitive answer to this question is no. And that makes me sad, because I would love to play some Time Crisis.      This is my 19 month old's schedule. I'm an early riser so it works for me. She's a morning cuddler too, so we can always grab her out of the crib and go back to bed for another 15 or 20 while we wake up.   This seems pretty generalizing. I worked for Cargill (yes, the devil, thank you) at a mixed location. Cargill had somehow screwed the union employees so that we non-union workers got better pay, better hours, better benefits, and better job safety. But god help us if we tried to align a pump without calling a maintenance guy over to fix it (a union maintenance guy who would take hours to come over and do a job that took me 12 minutes).   I don't know about upside down, but extremely blurry past about four inches or so.    And oyster shells. Holy shit my ladies love them oyster shells.   TIL there's three times more people shooting themselves than other people in the US.   You're right, I do need to get on building my 'El Cheapo' adventure bike.   Seems to me like they're making a statement, because there's plenty of alleys to go down that aren't directly in front of where everyone is walking. Not that I think there's much that I can do about it.    And him using a Geiger counter to determine if water is safe to drink.   I thought "half life" was in the context of this half of my life is spent in the Wasteland but the next half will be in Valhalla. Also, the obvious carry-over from a nuclear fallout position.   While 70% of all natural rubber (from a tree) goes towards tires, it only accounts for about 30% of the total rubber being produced today. Most rubber today is made from oil. It takes between 7 and 10 gallons of oil to make a tire.   This. The timeline falls apart completely unless you understand that the events of Mad Max were occurring at the same time that Joe was out raiding and kidnapping and building a society. Max and Furiosa are likely the same age.    Right, sorry, that's the point I was trying to make but not sure if it came across clear or not. Max has spent a lifetime in the Wasteland and it's likely (seeing as how deep down he's a kind soul that want's to help despite his built in need to survive) that there have been many people whom he wished he could have saved but couldn't. Maybe some were women he fell in love with, although I doubt that since I couldn't ever really see him getting over his wife. I mean, his nod to Furiosa at the end says it all. You're safe, I'm going back to the Wasteland to go back to surviving. But yes, overall I agree, I don't think the imagery of the child(ren) should be taken literally nor do they affect the canon of the original. Sprog was a boy, that didn't change, just getting others' opinion on it.   I agree for the most part. [Ex Machina spoilers](#s "She's smart enough to to keep herself going and while her body or brain may not last forever, I think she'll come up with a way to continue on, download herself into another one, branch out to the cloud Skynet style, etc...")     Most are probably going to say **Fury Road** and while it was definitely one of the most intense, exciting, and action-packed films that I saw this week, I think **Ex-Machina** gets my vote for best move this week. Well thought out, moving, socially and culturally relevant to today's world (not the Max wasn't, just harder to see through all the action). It is also the one that left me wondering what happens next and postulating theories about the events following the film while Max just made me think about what happened between the films.    No, Peaky Blinders is a perfect example.    I was also trying to do the math in my head last night after watching it. You're right, at first it seems like a leap of faith to believe that all four movies fit onto the same timeline. However, think about it this way, because I think it's possible. If the crisis had started when Max was a child (the bombs dropped, etc...) but he was fortunate enough to grow up in one of the last 'safe' zones than it works. Max and Furiosa could be the same age. Joe had been going about building his society in the wastelands since Max was a child. I think that things were bad in the Wasteland during the events of Mad Max, but there were still 'safe' areas like the city that Max grew up in and wanted to try to protect. At the end he realized that he was no longer a protector and just one of 'them' and goes off to the Wasteland. That's why at the end of Road Warrior, the people of the refinery still have places to escape to. Places that only loads and loads of fuel can get you to. By the time Thunderdome rolls around the world has fallen apart. Even the safe places are deteriorating, and the Wasteland gangs are already developing into complex societies with 'laws'. I think if you put Max at 25 at the end of Mad Max and than add 5-6 years between movies, it works. But only if you believe that Mad Max is happening after the fall, not before (as some people claim).  	106

YES, THIS! Oh my god, I had no clue other people felt this way. We have these knives with wooden handles and I wont wash them and my roommate mocks me. I cant stand the feeling. its like even after I stop touching it I can feel it in my hand.  	5
 Yeah i use this: http://imgur.com/TOvn6ij over bleached hair, and it's a permanent dye so that's 6-8 weeks before it starts getting brassy. I bleach my roots and use this all over every 6 weeks - 2 months. I love the look but yeah it's terrible for your hair! I use a hairmask daily...   I have platinum blonde hair and use bleach to take all the colour out and then dye it 'extremely light ash blond' which puts a more white sheen on it. That second box is definitely dye and not bleach, but yeah that's not gonna do anything to take the pink away.      Well i don't know if the sexual thing he was going to as k me would have been weird, but a complete stranger once offered to pay me to take the next long distance bus (i was waiting at the stop) so i could go home with him.

 You're funny...  Yea im aware that it isn't. But the show is and they dramatize the fuck out of it.    If by close you mean when it says *19 spots available* but when I drive around the 2nd floor and there aren't any available and almost run into 4 different cars and ultimately Park on the 5th floor and since the elevators are slow as fuck I use the stairs and run to raef hall and now I'm late for the 3rd time this semester...  Kinda close?    It's never accurate   Your 4th celebration was a fucking hoot I bet   You gild your own comments.       Yea but the camera got it.  It's about the viewers not the kids sadly   He lacks confidence now in a league of players where mediocrity doesn't cut it.    Watch Jimmer in college and tell me that he was gonna be a bust.    You need to remember that we have an arena building in a year.  We can't afford  rebuild right now.  We needed to dump.  Hinkle saw our weakness and exploited it.  1st round is my only issue.  JT is solid but expensive.  Landry is trash.  Stauskas wasn't right for our system at all.  He has confidence issues and our development staff sucks.  Nik was gonna be trash here.   To soon to speak on Rondo but he is no different than everyone praising mavericks for Williams. We needed to take a risk for more reasons than most know. If we are a .500 team next year...  Cousins is gonna lose it.   We now have the deepest roster in 10 years. I'm OK with it.    I am pretty sure it's fake for ratings.   Well fuck Man...    How is he as a player on the team?  Did he accept his role well? Anything I should know?    Saw some nice cars in Saudi Arabia ....  Corvette,  Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Mustang... Same cars you find in every city street in America    Lol I actually fucking started turning my phone hahaha I'm fucking stupid   He's gonna play off the bench and be a huge key factor in calming the locker room. Had a good 3pt shot at one point but wouldn't call him a phenomenal shooter.  Plays solid D.  2x all star and has played on a championship team.  Vet minimum contract for two years...  Solid pick up.  Main this is his level head to keep our young guys focused.    Sounds about right. Clippers are an option too   "You want *me* to play? Seriously?  Hold on...  I'm in a game...  Lemme call you back vlad"    Nah I think Andre is gonna be here too      Fair enough but as an organization we shouldn't be   - putting our shit on blast about inside issues.   - going through coaches like Tswift and men.   - giving up on potentially the best coach we have had in years.    If it's Cousins or Karl..  I keep Cousins any day.  But we are grown ass people and Cousins needs to understand that Karl can take him to where he wants to go.    Solid vet pick up.  Don't believe he has alot in his tank but definitely a good role player.  I'm gonna take this as a sign that Smith isn't coming   Sounded something close to Rondo...    You a fool ha   I came to say this.  Literally one of the top posts on this thread was "we got Karl". All of a sudden a bunch of rumors start and he's the worst coach alive...  Give the guy a season.    Gotcha ha   Silver won't allow it?  What do you mean?    I would never sign anyone for that...     Same feeling I had when we traded for Gay and Gay was my #1 option. I felt validated haha   Because I'm a 225 lb.  Judo fighter who still wouldn't chase after someone over dumb shit. Bravado will get a bullet to the face.   Or get a Darwin award.    BIH?    Please do not get shot over incense...    Eh..  Crack  Fat Kardashian   That's the old Karl!    Dude said if you upvote this I will speak on a subject of your choice for an hour depending on who's the highest comment.       Because running is not what Cousins does... More like mosey down the court pouting at ref-DMC   Edit: It's a joke...  Jeez   Whose dick is better...  /u/realityis333 or /u/retrovisionofficial?   Taste?  Smell?  Length?  Why you like to suck one over the other? Texture? Vein pattern? That's enough to talk on for an hour...  But I'm sure you know it's a mouth full.    Upvoted thread because fuck your neighbor   Alot going on.  I see what your saying now.  I would be more upset that McCallum when to a team that hurts our chances at winning to boot. Losing him sucks but strengthening the spurs is a nightmare.   I just believe both of these trades were inevitable.  I figured we were going to trade McCallum...  Just not for cap space.    Yea we shall see.  I still believe the Pelicans are just a mess of a team.  Alot of talent with nothing to show for it but AD.   He had Kardashian issues...     We beat the Pelicans. Something is eating me about that team but I will for sure say it's more of a hunch than analytical observations.   I believe that we will make 6th seed but 2nd and 6th last year was like a game or so difference.    Why don't you wait to see what Karl does...    Forgot about Reggie but I have a feeling andre will be back   This.  Ray was the most expendable.    JT,  Landry, Stauskas, Williams, McCallum and looking like Hollins are all gone.   I thoroughly believe so are 28 win seasons. We have the best roster talent wise in over a decade. We also have a winning coach.   I'm ready to be a winning team.    We didn't trade for the pick.  We traded for Smith. How would you use Ray in our system?  Miller is a better fit plus vet experience.    Pop choses his players so obviously he sees something. By no means is this anything like IT. Andre is a player coach and can facilitate an offense with bellinelli on perimeter and koufos in post.   Smith  Ray.    Kings hate been real.... Lol   You think ray McCallum was IT level?    You mad because you can't get third round with his main tho haha   Someone matched or bettered our offer. Creating space to outbid someone.  Clips and Houston were our only competition to my knowledge.  Hou can't pay him and Clips have DJ.  Right after DJ goes back, we trade Ray. Bet we sign Smith tomorrow.    Smith   [Source] "McCallum traded after being caught with PF Erik Moreland's female."     Gonna be a good back up point guard for you guys.  Glad we traded him.  He has a ton of potential that would be wasted here at this point.      Simpsons joke?

Yah me 3   Little miss sunshine,  Juno, About time, Boyhood  and I really enjoyed the fault in our stars.    All clowns are killers and rapists.    From what I read the plan is to MLE Smith for 2.8. If we get that,  we receive a great deal while Smith still receives I think it was 10 mil all together. Smith, Rondo, Gay and Cousins are all friends. That win at all costs attitude may be good. We never know.  Josh smith seems to have calmed down a bit.     The power of what being an underdog can do alot of a team. Every person has something to prove from name cleaning to all star nodding. 2.8 mil for a 12-8 pf is good money spent.    Why would he take a pay cut...  He isn't gonna get over what he's set to receive from Detroit.  He's gonna sign for no more than 3 mil somewhere.   No we didn't sign Koufos to play bench on this roster.  We signed him with anticipation of Smith.   We are lacking at the 4 and Cousins can play 4.  Smith is a stretch 4. All depends on rotation.    [Sources] "Kings confirm biopic depicting FO off season mess ups. Karl-Vlade feud confirmed over cell phone. Cousins pissed."    Yes..  We did sign him to play backup.  He is a stellar backup.  Depth is what we need.  Who says Smith has to start?    Saw twenty one pilots at BFD.  If you have tickets...  Go see them don't sell them.  Amazing show.  Sorry.    Great pickup   Black bears are rather timid.  Mostly scared of humans.  They rarely attack.  So by asserting dominance over the bear by yelling, raising arms and jacket over head and being in groups scare the bear. Never really will you need to fight it.    Brown bears will kill for territory, protection or anger.  Big bears with a bad temper. Never look an animal in the eye but never turn away.  Walk slowly backwards in a sign of retreat.  If the bear attacks,  play dead in fetal position protecting head and neck.   None of these work if you surprise a bear or separate her and her kids.  You are in extreme danger. Never get in between a mama and her kids. Personally I'd physically fight back if this was the case.    I one time had ghonnerea...  Still not as bad as knowing coops around.    He looked like he was reenacting Kims debut movie   Good article.  I liked the "win cap at 42"  argument. /s... Where do these win projections come from? We add significant talent and give Karl a full season to work with and we improve by a pretty small margin.   We also forget what adding this talent may do for Cousins.  He may just go off and be that superstar we are looking for in him. (more than already...  Nba championship carry superstar)    Yes   Mike trout   I fucking hate haribo gummy bears   Unless it's a gilrizzly... Then pull out the Bible and pray...    Absolutley wrong.

He was a big part of the off season whether stats show it or not.     Acy is clearly not the better option due to Smith being more versatile.    Survival rules of three.

I have sent most of my colleagues and family to Bikes plus or Performance bikes (if a beginner.)   City bikes downtown is also not a bad shop.   I'm down for as many as you can get me.     Cousins has 1% better FG average and is our first option.  We aren't bringing Smith on for points... We are bringing him on for boards and perimeter defense. Vet experience to boot.   I hope Smith never accepts an Acy role.  I'd rather a Smith role. Play 4 and average 12 8 and I'd be content with that for 2.8 million... JT was almost 3x that and not as effective.    Smith was a huge facilitator in Houstons playoff run.  Hit clutch shots and even,  dare I say,  looked like he had a 3pt shot going. He hasn't been in Atlanta for over 2 years and Detroit was a shit team for him where he felt he needed to shoot.  Maybe he will listen to his friends Rondo,  Gay and Cousins and play his role...   I believe Smith makes a deal tomorrow or Wednesday. We will see but I truly believe he is our guy. You can have your 1/3 the ability PF that is exactly as he is advertised. 2.8 million for a guy who plays like a 2.8 million player.   I'd rather shop in the discount section and find a quality treasure. 2.8 million for a 6.5 million dollar player.    Bucks are my east coast team.  Love you guys.  Get ready for the ECF.    I read your comments...  You have no good reason to keep him out.    We add one more headband for Casspi to fix.  Happy Casspi  beard.    Josh smith has a higher FG% than Kobe...  (45%).  One predominantly a scorer and ones not so much.  Josh Smith isn't that reckless like people say.  He just was used to being the only option in atl so translated that to Detroit. Remember how bad Gays stats were when everyone wrote him off?  Josh smith's ceiling is ten times higher than Acys. Personally I'm not the biggest fan of Acy. Logically speaking,  why would you sign a guy who isn't even starting quality over a guy who was all star potential about 3 years ago? Choosing panda express over some homemade Chinese food!  We get a killer perimeter defender who has vet experience. We get him for super cheap and he already has established chemistry with 3 of our top players... Then there is Acy..    This is to real for me to laugh at...  Smh @ Cleveland    We shouldn't have signed bellinelli or Rondo before the GOAT.  he's the key to a championship    Acceptable answer.     You take the extreme side of things...    Josh smith for 2.8... Acy for 2.8...? Smith anyday   We're just spoiled now ha   Feel like this should be done already.    Do you actually watch basketball?    Ok.    That would be amazing for sacramento   Ok   We can't afford Hollins...  Last time I bought a goat, it cost me three chickens and a cow.    [Source] "Kings owner tweets threat at inefficient President Vlade. Gives Weekend deadline to sign players or shave his beard and lose his job.

That's what alot of this is to me.    When they come on with facts that are released to public like contract prices, length,  trades etc.  That's reliable.  Who cares about rumors at this point.   Maybe I wouldn't be so jaded with them if there wasn't so much lying this off season.    Not saying you can't trust them.  Always know the context tho.  Perspective is huge. Is Skip Bayless knowledgeable,  have inside sources and connections?  Absolutley...  But do I take his opinion on Mayweather knowing he hates him?  Biased opinions. I'm just more skeptical about information and leaks.  I use these same writers and piece together the best I can an idea of what may be going on.   Not trying to upset you.    A biased analysis that sells.  Controversy sells.  He stirs it.  Creates a problem that wasn't there...  Mountain out of mole Hill.  10k more followers.  Bam.  They have a job as well. They are great at it.  But by no means do I watch CNN and Fox and say...  "reputable"  sources.    Everyone has an agenda.  Look at Woj. He was considered very reputable but then dropped all this bs. The other day,  Tobias Harris turned down a Kings max offer...  WTF?  All for ratings.    Damn...  Haha against the Knicks.  I went crazy    Yea but he doesn't care about that..  He's more proud of his 7 bookshelves.    Who is the guy is the read a book a day guy?  He's always on the YouTube ads.  Who is he and what has he accomplished?   	147
 Where's Tufte to go all Hulk style when you need him?  I'm deeply unsurprised that the IRS can fuck up something as simple as a pie chart.   Moms Demand Action: almost as many members as people who are Never Nudes.    And ass pennies are the source of interpersonal power.   Possibly /r/changemyview but I haven't been there in a long time so it might suck now.   And just think, if they can't get something as simple as whether or not ccws are allowed at the NRA convention, how can they possibly be trusted to report on complex issues like healthcare?   *I've never wished a man dead, but I have read some obituaries with great pleasure.*  -Mark Twain, apocryphal    Denying the enemy a high-profile propaganda outlet in their own backyard.  That's just awesome.   Unless there's been a rule change in USPSA that I'm unaware of, Limited division requires a gun that makes major power factor but with a cartridge that is at least. .40.  .45 is only competitive in single stack and revolver.   Criminy, I remember when surplus Maks could be had for under 2 bills.     Go through your house and throw out any and all junk food, anything high in refined sugars or carbs, and only eat out once in awhile.  Even the best appetite suppressants really only help around the edges, and even that effect will be negated by eating foods that have addictive qualities to them.    Wow. This seems like a pretty solid invitation for smart gun proponents to go fuck themselves.      Does this trigger you? I'm not touching you... Does this trigger you? I'm not touching you... Does this trigger you? I'm not touching you... Does this trigger you? I'm not touching you... Does this trigger you? I'm not touching you...    Fine, substitute the phrase "hateful speech" if the current headline so offends your delicate sensibilities, nancypants.       Came here to say exactly this.  Aimpoint Micro all the way.   It seems like, more often than not, when Congress is set to vote to confirm a cabinet member or Supreme Court Justice that they always offer up a sacrificial lamb who is unlikely to be confirmed.  I suspect the executive does this as a way to make their actual choice seem somehow less shitty.   This is utterly heartbreaking.   They have been shown to work 90% of the time (9 rounds out of ten in the magazine) under ideal circumstances.  Kind of odd that Armatix refuses to submit their gun to 3rd party groups to test whether it will stand up to attempts to hack it or affect a DoS attack, though.   How about calling them what they are, repealing the NFA regs regarding short barreled rifles, and then the atf can stop trying to convince everyone that apples are oranges.   Yeah, I've tried that a few times already. It will sometimes work for a little while afterwards, and sometimes not.    I figured Mars One was bullshit after looking at the list of the group's primary officers and leaders and realized that not a single one of them had any background whatsoever in space, but they all had backgrounds in media and marketing.   For what it's worth, research has shown that there are components of cinnamon that can exert beneficial results on blood glucose levels.  It's not a cure for diabetes, nor should you take massive doses of straight cinnamon as it contains a compound that's carcingenic, but an extract of the spice can exert some beneficial effects for diabetics.

A search online told me that there's a good chance that the remote had lost the pairing with the Roku, and that there were a couple of easy fixes.  So far I've tried the following: - Rebooting the Roku - Rebooting the Roku and holding down the pairing button during startup - Going into the settings for the Roku and trying to pair the remote - Pulling the batteries out, leaving them out for a few seconds, and putting them back in.  At best, the remote will have function restored, but only for a short time, before failing again, but in most cases it won't even do that.  The remote appears to have power, as the LED is functioning.  So, anything else I should try, or am I going to have to order a new remote?  Thanks for any help!   This.  Is.  How.  We.  Win.    I dunno.  Internet?   Just picked up some L-Leucine from Bulk Supplements.   I know this is a total noob question, but what's the most effective way to take this supplement?   Should it be done pre- or post-workout?  Only taken on days when I'm lifting vs doing body weight or cardio?  Every day in the morning?  Is it beneficial to take it in the days following a workout when I'm sore, and my body is presumably repairing and building muscle?   Thanks!    OP, are you a caveman?   The fastest way to keep this from happening is to remove the language regulating short barrelled rifles from the NFA.  No need to register SBRs means no need to pretend that an AR with a short barrel is a pistol instead of a rifle.  If all short-barrelled ARs become, overnight, rifles, it means they can't apply the law covering armor-piercing handgun ammunition to .223.   By all means, please do!   Facts and math are two things that aren't generally in the average graboid's wheel house.    Competitors in High Power Service Rifle and National Match Rifle competitions shoot out to 600 yards with iron sights.  The AR platform is quite capable at those ranges if you know what you're doing.   Gun ownership as a percentage of households can be down, while the raw numbers of gun owning households can be at a record high, so long as the percentage growth in total households outstrips the percentage growth of households that become new gun owners.  Relevant info here:  http://smallestminority.blogspot.com/2013/05/declining-gun-ownership.html?m=1   FWIW, I'm not the blogger, I just happened to find the discussion interesting.   The guy who runs gun free zone regularly posts hits interactions with grabber types and a lot of them are worth reading insofar as it gives excellent insight into the minds of people who are anti-rights.     Politifact is right that the *claims of one particular columnist* don't necessarily stand up to scrutiny, but that entire article is an exercise in deliberately refusing to acknowledge the existence of a forest by minutely describing how a sapling is too small to possibly be a forest all on its own.    Glad I could help.       Give the Independence Institute a call and see if they can put you in touch with Dave Kopel.    http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=999   Gun deaths, as well as death via other violent means, are tracked, and to a higher degree of accuracy and with a far superior methodology by the FBI, which publishes the data annually in the Uniform Crime Report.  This lady is a deeply biased gun control advocate using a horrendously flawed methodology to drum up sympathy for the gun control movement.  The fact she'd even claim something like 50,000 US gun deaths demonstrates that she's either a liar or a complete idiot, because the FBI data shows the true number isn't even half of what she claims.  If you're going to claim to be pro-information, you need to be willing to vet your data sources, especially if the data is coming from someone with a clear agenda.   Robert Farago is an ass who had zero interest in guns or gun rights beyond his ability to use them as a way to generate income.   Not that there's anything wrong with profit, but the guy had engaged in some seriously weird and creepy behavior, and has publicly stated he's not into guns.    Yeah, but is it a ghost gun?    It wouldn't matter.   Feels before reals with these cretins.    Every group is bound to have a couple of mouth-breathers.      Tell me again how this was the doing of the BATFE with no executive branch oversight and Obama is pro-gun.      I don't recall the myo inositol I bought having a fishy smell.  I found that the powder itself has a pleasant taste; about half as sweet as sugar.   I'd prefer to skip that process entirely, and just add a simple "no guns" symbol to the state-issued ID of any prohibited person.  Want to sell a gun to someone? Check their driver's license for the icon of a gun with a red slash through it, and you'll know immediately whether the person attempting to buy the gun is prohibited from doing so.  Boom. Instant background check with zero need to pick up a phone or enter data into a website.  Hell, if you want, you could even attach a legal penalty for knowingly selling a gun to someone with a marked license, or to someone who refuses to show ID who turns out to be a prohibited person, and I doubt any gun owners would have a problem with that.   What's the actual Norwegian word for "probe"?   Obvious troll is obvious.   How the heck do you lift weights after taking Melatonin? I'd be out cold on the floor 30 minutes after taking a dose likethat!   Why do the anti gun people hate environmentally friendly ammunition?    Sorry, but if you show up to a 3 gun match with steel core ammunition, they may send you home without firing a shot.  Use of steel core accelerates the wear and tear on steel targets, so a lot of matches don't allow it.   Hey pal, I don't write the headlines, I just share 'em.       Took a turn on this one and was very pleasantly surprised.   this is an excellent movie.    Feel free to link to posts where I act as an apologist for any of those people, and/or supported some rich asshole's attempt to remove the civil rights of this state's citizens.   Harris was a straight up psychopath, and one who should have been arrested and thrown in prison for a number of crimes prior to the Columbine shooting.  Unfortunately, his father intervened and had his son put into a diversionary program.   [citation needed]   I'm aware of some FFLs that also charge a fee, but, as I understand it, they're not really supposed to per the wording of the law.  There may be some wiggle room by calling it a service fee or something, though.   Not trying to be a smartass, but do you have a citation?    There is no more vocal, self-entitled mob, than a bunch of gun-nuts having the most modest of regulations hoist upon them.   I don't know. I'd say the self-important, yet woefully ignorant, narcissists who think that locking average citizens up for merely owning a plastic box with a spring in it give 'em a run for their money.      It's not a partisan political viewpoint, it's a simple statement of fact that background checks, magazine bans, or really any of the other gun control proposals will not have a statistically significant impact on suicide.   You want people to stop using guns to kill themselves? Then perhaps you should support physician-assisted suicide.    You seemed lonely, I was just trying to engage.    Plenty of people, evidently.  You might be surprised to discover that people are capable of caring about things which you, personally, don't care about.  It's weird.  It's almost as if different people can care about different issues.   So, what you're saying is the law should be made enforceable, ostensibly at gun point, and that you're in favor of throwing decent citizens in prison because they own a plastic box with a spring in it?   Regulated, as used in the Constitution, is done so in a manner that is anachronistic in the 21st century.  At the time the Bill of Rights were written, the dictionary definition of regulated meant to be well-supplied, maintained, and trained.  So, if you're going to claim you're making an argument from original constitutional intent, I assume you're in favor of allowing citizens to be armed and trained.  On the other hand, if you're using "regulated" in the modern sense, I assume you mean to use the term in a manner that implies forcing people you disagree with politically to be at the beck and call of an onerous bureaucracy.  I would argue that your modern take on it is perhaps a tad bit intellectually dishonest.   Most mass shooters acquired their guns after completing a background check, so I find it odd you think someone should be imprisoned for selling a gun to a close personal friend who, say, already has a large, legally-owned gun collection, a concealed carry permit, and a clean criminal record.  As for addressing mass shooting events, magazine bans do exactly nothing.  Eric Harris fired nearly two times the number of rounds of Dylan Klebold during Columbine, this despite the fact that he was wielding a gun with ten round magazines, and Klebold had "high capacity" magazines.  The Virginia Tech shooter managed to pull off the worst mass shooting on US soil, and he did it with a mixture of ten and fifteen round magazines, which are completely legal in Colorado.  Even the Sandy Hook shooter didn't bother to empty the magazines he carried, instead opting to execute tactical reloads at opportune times in order to keep the advantage in his favor.  If magazine capacity mattered, there would be a strong correlation between mass shooting events, magazines, and number of people killed, but such a correlation is hard to draw, partially because such events are exceedingly rare, and partially because magazine capacity is pretty far down the list of things that enable a mass shooter.  In order to believe that a magazine ban has any sort of effect, you have to believe the following:  1.) That a magazine ban can be enforced in any meaningful way. Since we're talking about hundreds of millions of devices which are cheap, essentially untraceable, and about as complicated as a travel mug, claiming such a ban is enforceable is clearly delusional.  2.) You have to believe that reloading a firearm is an arduous or difficult procedure. It isn't. Even someone completely new to firearms can be taught to execute a reload in two-three seconds.  3.) You have to believe that in that 2-3 second time interval, a victim will be able to recognize the following: - That the assailant has run out of ammunition and needs to reload - Assess the situation - Choose to either run for an exit or attempt to engage an armed assailant in a physical fight.  And that's all assuming that the assailant isn't using tactical reloads (Sandy Hook), retreating slightly to reload (Virginia Tech), or armed with more than one gun (most every mass shooting.)    People who think that magazine bans will have some sort of positive effect on violent crime or mass shootings are utterly, completely deluded.   Perhaps the solution is to get people the help they need rather than stripping them of their civil rights.  Not that you actually care. Magazine bans and background checks do exactly zero to stop someone from committing suicide with a firearm, and the same goes for pretty much all of the other proposals coming out of Camp Gun Control, too.  The issue of suicide is just one that anti-gun advocates use to inflate their numbers in order to claim that there's some sort of crisis.    The metric of "gun deaths" is a fundamentally useless one, as it essentially implies that a death that involves a firearm is somehow worse than a death from other means.  Furthermore, it clearly belies the motives of the gun control set as being fundamentally unconcerned with overall violence or suicide rates, and that they're ok living in a world where shootings are replaced with death by other means in a one-to-one relationship.  Furthermore, even going with the lowest reasonable estimates of defensive gun uses, which are approximately 100,000 annually, it's clear that the use and ownership of firearms has an overall positive societal impact, and that's even if you manage to completely ignore all of the positives that come with gun ownership and use for recreational and sporting purposes.   Me, personally?  No.  Unfortunately, it seems that the teacher's unions are, once again, fundamentally uninterested in doing the right thing when it comes to kids.   Make gun safety a mandatory part of public school education, just like sex ed or driver's ed.   Whenever I see the term "loophole" used, I mentally replace it with "legal activity that someone, somewhere, disapproves of for spurious reasons."   The problem with adding this additional layer that might, or might not help is that it creates a situation wherein an average citizen can be thrown in prison because he loaned a pistol to a friend to go shoot a match, a rifle to a buddy for a hunting trip, or allowed people to handle firearms at a safety class that wasn't conducted st a shooting range.   It's just not financially worth it.  The FFLs are forbidden from charging a market rate for background checks, while still being forced to go through the same process of gathering data, walking the customer through the process, and submitting the information via the NICs system, which will tie up an employee for around an hour or two.  On top of that, they're then required to abide by all of the same record keeping requirements (entering the information into a bound book, keeping the physical 4473 on file for twenty years or more) that they have to abide by for a gun that they actually would have sold.  If any part of that process is done incorrectly, say, a procedural error in how the form is filled out (e.g. the person doing the transfer abbreviated Colorado as CO on the form) the dealer can be punished for the transgression during an ATF inspection.  Given the fact that there's no money in it, the process is a significant time sink, and it comes with a whole host of liabilities, it's really no surprise that dealers are refusing to do these transfers.   Too bad Colorado Democrats don't feel the same way.  I guess it's easy to sell out your own citizens when you're getting all that sweet Bloomberg money and media support.   I heard you were dead.    Unfortunately, that has never stopped anti-rights advocates from trying to claim that their abysmal policy failures are a result of not going far enough.    Collateral damage to someone like Holder.    Narcissists are always happy to tell you just how amazingly important they are.    Because the average anti-gun activist is a hugely self-important narcissist who has a high likelihood of living in a large city.    Smoking has been largely regulated and de-socialized to the point where they are unlikely to encounter it, and get upset at being exposed to smoking.   On the other hand, in the mind of a narcissist, the fact that guns are still legal causes them outrage because if they were to encounter someone with a gun, they would be at a disadvantage.   The thought of being at such a disadvantage causes them a tremendous amount of mental anguish, which drives them to advocate for stricter gun control.  This irrational mindset is why they are not swayed by facts, logical thinking, rationality, or appeals to basic human rights.   It's also why they are completely incapable of distinguishing between the average gun owner and a violent criminal. To the anti-gun mindset they are one and the same, merely because both a criminal and a gun owner possess the ability to visit physical harm on them, regardless of whether or not they actually would.    You'd think that 21st century society would have moved beyond the need for deodands.   When gun control fails to address violence in any meaningful way, the solution is to propose more gun control.    That's like getting a choice between a flying pegasus and a spineless jellyfish.  One of those creatures is imaginary.   It's a total meathead movie.   Not quite as over the top as Boondock Saints.    Yeah, but what oversight do the bot programmers have?   After the even licensed?    Even NPR is calling bullshit on Venezuela's government.   http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2015/01/04/374579364/venezuela-braces-for-a-tough-year-ahead  But please, tell us how a country with skyrocketing food prices and a government that cracks down on unions is a good thing.    Only a psychopath would do more than ten reps before taking a break.    No reasonable person needs the ability to squat more than 115 lbs.   Clearly we need guns control.    That's just proof that reddit needs government oversight and regulation.       Congratulations, you've managed to find a number of child deaths that is in the hundreds, in a nation that has well over 300 million privately owned firearms.  Let's round up the number of kids that die from accidental gunshots. Let's assume it's a total of 300 per annum.  That means that approximately 0.000099999% of guns are ever involved in the death of a child.  Congratulations, you fail at risk assessment.  Meanwhile, literally millions of kids have safely participated in shooting programs through the Boy Scouts, 4H, USA Shooting, NRA, US Steel Challenge, USPSA, and Hunter Safety courses in all 50 states, and managed to harm exactly no one.   Whenever I see someone make a statement like this, I automatically assume they were a particularly dim-witted child who grew up to be the special sort of dimwit who goes around projecting their dim-wittedness on those around them.   If you ever want to see some amazing slow motion footage ofoneof these things in action, watch the movie *Avalon*.   Putting our kid in an iron lung was totally a lifestyle choice!   The only Democrat who voted against any of the gun control bills was Tochtrop.  The rest of them voted along party lines to pass gun control.   Ah, yes, Russel Brand; the idiot's Tim Minchin.   You don't love Jesus enough.         There's no reason to trust the other side because they have, quite literally, lied about their intentions going all the way back to the late 1800s.   "Charging hammer"      Typical Narcissist, flying into a rage at the mere thought that others may not agree with him about something.   You should call it the Red Rocket.                     Ah, yes, more fear mongering from the man who holds one of the very few FFLs in the Washington dc area.    The Colorado house still has a 2-seat democrat majority.    In what way, shape, or form is Stephen Teret an expert on guns?   Is he a trainer? Ex-military hard charger? Highly ranked competitive shooter?    /r/dadjokes is thattaway --   I think it's a 10/22 bullpup configuration. The magazine is the black curved thing behind the swoopy part that connects the grip to the stock.  I think.    Markley's Law A variant of Godwin's Law: As an online discussion of gun owners' rights grows longer, the probability of an ad hominem attack involving penis size approaches 1. Person 1: I carry a gun to try to keep my family and I safe by exercising a Constitutionally-protected natural right.  Person 2: Hah! You carry a gun because you have a small penis, and you are trying to make up for it!  Person 1: Well, I guess Markley's Law is still true.       You're a deeply stupid person.   Who are these people who have the time to watch a half-hour long video on YouTube of some crazy person's rants?   It would likely also affect people engaged in the hobby of model rocketry, too.   If I had to guess, this might be an attempt to ban tannerite.   If only it were illegal to build your own explosives!  I mean, just look at how McVeigh and the Boston Bombers got off scott-free after killing all of those people!  It's a travesty, I tell you.   Form 4473s must be kept on hand by the FFL for 20 years.  If a gun store goes out of business, all of the 4473s that are under that age limit are relinquished to the BATFE, who warehouses them.  NICS data cannot legally be kept for more than 24 hours due to a lawsuit filed, and won by, the NRA in 2004. You will occasionally see a story in the press lamenting this fact, and dressed up under the guise of "but academic researchers need that data because reasons, and the NRA is a big mean doody head for forcing the feds to adhere to their own law!"   The same exact thing happened in Colorado when it came to light that Magpul was based there.  When it came to light that their stupid law would cost the state hundreds of jobs and measurable amounts of tax revenue, suddenly all of the politicians who had been denouncing "high capacity" magazines as only fit for mass murderers were falling all over themselves to amend the law so Magpul could continue to operate in the state.  So, according to Democrats, "high capacity" magazines are only fit for committing mass shootings, but it's ok to make them in your state so long as the magazines (and the mayhem they surely bring with them) gets exported to other states.   He probably has an official on staff whose only job is to remember his name.               No, you just engaged in a bunch of hand-waving and magical thinking to justify increasing the tax burdens on every citizen.   I love how you can't even explain how raising taxes on the average citizen will reduce pollution, you just take it as an article of faith, and expect me to but into your crazy pants religion, too.   You suck at this.   Seriously, even for a liberal, your inability to make a reasonable case for your position is pathetic.   Try harder.       I'd prefer one who's be willing to actually work to repeal anti-liberty laws and actually get dirty instituting much needed reforms at nearly every level of government.    A dubya joke in 2015?  Why don't you make a hanging chad reference while you're at it?   Why should I care about your amusement?    It's not so much that I hate being told what to do, that's not the issue.   The issue is that retards like you are completely incapable of overcoming their own Narcissism to recognize the fact that maybe you wouldn't get push back on your ideas if they weren't so demonstrably stupid.   You want me to go along with your recommendations?   Good.   Stop being an idiot.    I love how you're so far up your own ass that you zoom right past actually getting a widespread pop culture reference and go right into Smug Finger Wagging Mode.   I bet you're fun at parties.    Yeah, well, that's just like...your opinion, man.    To what end?   The end here is to institute yet another stupid law meant to harass and intimidate gun owners.    Thanks for taking the initiative and citing a source for me, I appreciate it.    More than one, actually:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098023/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1     Robert Farago, the guy who owns and operates TTAG has pretty much stated he's not all that into guns, and that he's really just in it to run a site to generate page views and income.  He's also pulled some weird stunts over the years, including creeping on a female gun blogger, and going public with comments from Alan Gura after explicitly acknowledging that the meeting he attended was confidential.  He's also used copyrighted images from other gun bloggers without so much as an acknowledgement of the source or even a linkback.  Dude's a creep.   I have no delusions that Boxer will be replaced by anyone who's more in favor of civil rights.   I do, however, take comfort in the fact that whoever replaces her will not wield the powers that come with senatorial seniority, like heading up various sub-committees.    Or Mr. Presbo.    The second would hopefully lead to the first.   I know right?!  Anarchy!  ANARCHYYYYYYYY!   But if even one regulation is repealed, it will result in ANARCHY!        You seem deeply unhappy.  That's really quite sad.   In my experience, all serious gun control advocates are deeply narcissistic.   I find it deeply amusing that the only part of his post you can actually articulate a response to is the ad hominem attack.  Facts?  Figures?  Citations?  These things don't even register among the handful of functioning synapses you've got rattling around in your head, rendering you all but completely incapable of addressing his points, but when it comes to juvenile, uncreative name calling, you're just Johnny on the Spot.  Do people in real life know you're this pathetic?   Have an upvote for not spelling it "baited."      This, exactly. Expect the graboids to be emboldened by the passage of ubc laws in CO and WA.   I suspect NV will be the next to fall victim to "common sense."   And here I thought Gecko45 was unrealistic.   My response to that line of thought is to mock them for being stupid, and then follow it up by saying that "we can debate legalizing nukes on the day when people are no longer being thrown in jail for putting a flash hider on a rifle."      So you shined him on, and he (obliviously) kept calling you names.  That's both hilarious and a pretty pointed example of the average mental capacity of the die-hard graboid.   This. As if prohibiting ownership somehow isn't an infringement.   They use the tactics of outgrouping and name calling because those are the tactics that work on them.   When encountering graboids with a milirary background who claim they have training that makes them superior to civilians, I like to ask them how many civilian shooting matches they've won.  Inevitably this shuts them up.   There were coffin-style magazines made for the Suomi,and a lot of NFA guys use them in Mac-style SMGs.  That might be a place to start for reference.   http://www.mac-11.info/review3a.htm     Honestly, the best orgs to donate to are the NRA, SAF, and state-level organizations, in that order.   I've never been particularly impressed by GOA for many of the same reasons I don't care for NAGR; all show, no go.    They aren't delusional.   That know exactly what they're doing, and what they're doing is using their social media outlets to shout a lie as loudly and repeatedly as possible in the hope that it will be perceived as the truth.    This movie is hilarious.    There is no such exemption in the DC law.  Gregory flagrantly violated the law, and his violation resulted in a pass from the legal system despite other people being prosecuted for similarly harmless violations.  If there should be an exemption to the law, it needs to be explicitly codified.   Lol. I was trying to phrase things neutrally, but I agree.   NAGR is an off shoot from the Colorado gun rights org Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. Both organizations are operated by Dudley Brown.  Brown has a well-deserved reputation as a controversial figure, both in the general populace, and among gun owners for his bombastic presentation style "no compromise" tactics and his willingness to attack moderate Republicans as well as the NRA.  In Colorado, he's quite proud of the fact that RMGO candidates often win primaries, but in the larger political landscape, most of his candidates end up being far too conservative to actually have a chance in Hell of winning in districts that aren't solid red territory.  RMGO, and presumably NAGR judge candidates on more than just gun issues, but also include a politician's stance on issues like abortion as well.  If you aren't a staunch social conservative, you'll likely disagreewith some of the positions and endorsements of NAGR.         The last number I saw was that the military pays something like $450 per rifle, but I don't have a source for you and sometimes my memory sucks.   I find it hilarious that when it comes to describing the M16/M4 in a military context, the left-wing media has nothing but terrible accusations to fling about how these rifles are underpowered jammomatics.  But as soon as a civilian picks up an AR15, they're described as military-derived rifles capable of empowering their user to rack up remarkable and abhorrent body counts.  It's like the gun control set can't actually ever manage to get their facts straight!   the antis told me that the number of gun owners is shrinking.   I refuse to believe that this is real.   /s  Congrats on your new rifle, be safe and have fun!    What's an oscillating turret?    BATFE would likely just define a different partof the gun to be the legally-mandated firearm part.   Note that there are examples of guns where the lower isn't legally considered to be the firearm.  For instance, the upper receiver is legally considered the firearm on an FAL, as is is the tubular upper on the Kruger Mk. I-III series pistols.   I know, it's great, right?    	176
 Have you seen Bloodline? That first season is 13 episodes...about 10 of those is just padding.

Whoa, hey now...It's definitely a different take and I can respect any actor willing to take on a role that would undoubtedly be compared to such a memerable character...That being said, the Mads Mikkelsen lends a more reserved take on the character, which has paid off so far and is a service to the character.

 It is unlikely that it would have been much of a problem for you today. It really should not effect you on Monday. As far as I know there are no mass protests or demonstrations planned for Monday.   Many of the protesters are pushing for legislative change. They want future prosecutions of officers to be conducted by special prosecutors. While the protest does raise awareness, it is also an attempt to force legislative change. Also, it is a peaceful way for many to release their anger and frustration.   The 1st Department is in Manhattan. The 2nd Department is in Brooklyn. The 3rd Department is in Albany. The 4th Department is in Rochester.      To be clear, under NY state law, you can legally non-violently resist an unlawful arrest.   I have never practiced in Missouri so I can't speak to everything that happened in that case. But I do have the added benefit of being able to review [the minutes and evidence](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/25/us/evidence-released-in-michael-brown-case.html) because it was released publicly. From the minutes and evidence I think the Grand Jury in Darren Wilson's case made the wrong decision but it was not as clear cut as the case here appears to be. There were conflicting eye witness testimony and forensic reports. Here, there is a pretty clear cut video of the incident.  The problem I have with the Darren Wilson case is that he was given special treatment. I do not know Missouri law on whether a defendant can testify in front of the Grand Jury so I'll refrain from commenting on that aspect. The prosecution treated him with kid gloves which normally does not happen. They did not really challenge his story or ask for significant clarification about his description of events that seemed unlikely or contradicted witness testimony. Other defendants would never be so lucky. The prosecution conducted a mini trial in the Grand Jury by presenting pro-defense evidence, witnesses, and theories. As a criminal defense attorney I fully support doing so and it is something we always complain about prosecutors not doing. The problem arises here because they never do that for any other defendants. I also highly doubt that any other non-cop, non-politician defendant that comes after Officer Wilson will be given the same treatment. The prosecution knew exactly what they were doing. They gave Darren Wilson special treatment.   I was not in the Grand Jury nor am I privy to the information that was presented to it in this case. But in my opinion, based on my experience and the experiences of my colleagues, it is extremely rare that a grand jury chooses not to indict with this type of evidence. An indictment is a very low threshold and for the most part the expression "the grand jury would indict a ham sandwich, if that's what you wanted" is true. Unless and until the minutes are released I can only speculate to why this Grand Jury differed from the norm.   I am a criminal defense attorney that practices in NY and I have significant experience with grand jury issues. A defendant has a right to testify in the grand jury and all that is needed to preserve that right is to serve on the prosecution a notice of the intention to exercise that right. This notice is under [C.P.L. 190.50](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/CPL/TWO/I/190/190.50) but is more commonly referred to as cross-Grand Jury notice.   You are correct that the prosecution can indict someone without telling the person they are about to be indicted but this is true under only certain circumstances and is quite rare. Typically, you are arrested and arraigned by a judge on the felony charges which immediately indicates that the prosecution can indict your client. The prosecution then serves their notice right then of their intention to indict. The defense attorney then has the option of serving cross-Grand Jury notice. If cross-Grand Jury notice is in effect and the prosecution indicts without allowing the defendant to testify the indictment would later be dismissed (with some exceptions). Now if they do not arrest the defendant but the defendant becomes aware of the Grand Jury possibly indicting him he can still serve notice that he wishes to testify and it must be upheld. The only time a defendant generally does not know is when it is a "silent indictment" meaning the prosecution indicts prior to the defendant's arrest. Those situations are generally reserved for charges stemming from long term investigations into organized crime and large drug conspiracies.  Although I cannot say absolutely what happened here I can make a pretty informed educated guess. The officer knew the prosecution was presenting his case to the grand jury because it was public knowledge and reported in the media. As a result he had his attorney serve the cross-Grand Jury notice which means the prosecution must let him testify. I have many problems with what happened here but the defendant being allowed to testify is not one of them. His ability to testify presents no reason to believe there is anything suspect. There may be many other factors that do cause suspicion though.   A lot of it will depend on what type of attorney you want to be. It may make your job a lot more difficult if you are a trial attorney, especially if your stutter increases with nerves. But only a small percentage of lawyers are trial attorneys; most never get any court litigation experience. That being said I know an excellent trial attorney with a mild stutter but I know it makes things more difficult for him.   I am more than aware what a felony does to someone's life; I am a criminal defense attorney. You are still incorrect about what is happening here. The current policy is not to charge you with a felony. It was to charge you with a misdemeanor or a violation unless you had felony weight. In fact, in NY, sale of less than 25 grams of marijuana is only a misdemeanor (N.Y. Penal Law 221.40). There is no change in the severity of the crime being charged here. It will still be a misdemeanor or a violation (depending on the circumstances). It is a misdemeanor for possession in public view, burning marijuana in public, or possession of more than 25 grams but less than 8 ounces. It is a violation solely for non-public view possession of less than 25 grams. That has been the law for decades.  This summons will not being like a parking ticket. The only difference from the previous policy will be that instead of being arrested and either being given a DAT after a few hours at the precinct or being brought through arraignments hours later (risking bail being set) you will be given a summons telling you what date and what time to come to court. If you have an active warrant you will still be arrested as usual. I will admit that summons traditionally are seen as less serious as non-summons but that doesn't change the level of the crime charged. The other problem is that since summonses were rarely ever used for this charge it will be interesting to see if prosecutors start taking summonses more seriously.  I would be happy to answer questions about this stuff or expand on anything.   You were able to get a DAT but they were not required to give you one. It was left to the discretion of the officer. They made a big push to change that but it was not 100% successful. Judging from your screen name I am guessing you are an officer. So you are aware the DAT data sheet had more check boxes than just active warrants. Anyone with an active warrant gets arrested, regardless of the severity of the charge.   Your title is inaccurate. He is not reducing the penalty. In fact, he does not have the power to reduce the penalty for it. Only the state legislature has that power. He is changing how someone appears in court. Instead of the person being arrested, placed in handcuffs, held in a precinct, then transported to the courthouse, and held until seeing a judge (and possibly having bail set) the "arresting" officer will give the person a summons (or Desk Appearance Ticket-it is not entirely clear) and the person will have to show up at court on the date given on the summons.   This depends. If you know for an absolute fact that your client is going to lie on the stand you have an obligation to explain to him the possible consequences of doing so and try to convince him out of testifying. Since your client has an absolute right to testify if he still chooses to do so you can ask to be removed from the case for a conflict of interest (irreconcilable differences about the defense).   If you cannot be removed from the case for that reason (ex. some public defenders or too far along the process) or your request for removal would make it obvious your client is going to lie under oath, you let your client testify and tell his story without eliciting any information. In other words, your client just tells his story in a narrative form instead of you getting it piece by piece by direct questions. This prevents you from suborning perjury.  It is quite rare though that you know for an absolute fact that your client's testimony is a lie or will be a lie.   I would still represent my client to the best of my abilities without violating any laws or ethical rules. The system would be even more unfair and chaotic otherwise.      I do not think I would assist the police but I would most likely try to calm my client down so that the situation would not be worse for her and she would face less consequences. Ideally, I would get my client under control before the court officers would get involved. I'm also pretty sure the court officers/police would prefer I stay out of it even if I felt I should help.     	17

 Thanks for giving my research some direction. My grandmother's grandfather would certainly have been born in the 1800's, but after seeing the pistol I figured it was WW1 Era or later. Cool piece of family history but I doubt it's worth much.   Grandmother says this revolver was owned by her grandfather. It's a US Revolver Co. .38 S W 5-shot top break revolver with pearl-looking grips. It's not in immaculate condition but I'd love some more information if any revolver guys could help me out. I have the serial number as well but I'd rather not post that so publicly.       I mean, as far as I can figure, you'll spend $200-300 in a decent barrel. Gunsmithing work is up for debate but from the prices I've seen around, installation and truing would put you in the $600-700 range total. And wouldn't you rather add to the collection anyway???   Well in that case it might be a good idea to call an experienced riflesmith and see what they have to say on the subject. Good luck though, we'd love to see the progress   Not much personal experience with such major gunsmithing, but I'll offer this: if the accuracy of the T3 from the factory is even remotely satisfactory, just sell your rifle and buy another one in your chosen caliber. There's a lot of work and money that would go into changing calibers. Certainly more money than purchasing a T3, especially if you'd add the funds gained from selling your current rig. Do with that what you wish, just my $0.02   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrUVMdkb4_k    	7
 I'm really looking forward for it.      	2
    Apparently all my responses are unpopular except the obvious ones.   Right, like the latest anagram "so wren is charles" is then not enough to determine wren is charles.   It's also "Nerd Lucas is the Liar". How is the black hoodie misunderstood?   oh okay. Maybe you're right. Some clues do seem like red herrings.   Upvote for you!   If you don't believe a thing that comes out of Marlene's mouth, then what's the point of acknowledging any clues she gave that link to Wren like the walking after midnight farm?   it may mean someone wanting to kill someone or kill themselves.  	8
 Umm, [sure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007#Shootdown): "A United States Air Force Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft flying in the area was monitoring the missile test off the peninsula."   While I don't know what was going through the pilot's mind or what his orders were when he fired...   They knew it was a civilian aircraft, they wanted to wave their dicks and shot it down.  ...I'm pretty sure that the USSR could have found some more effective and less lethal way to wave their dicks around. After all, downing civilian airliners is not a good way to generate positive PR.   Also gonna need some citation on an RC-135 being in the area, because I'm fairly sure you just made that up  When our propaganda organs started their narrative about the downing of the KAL airliner this facet of the shoot down was at times denied, and at other times ignored or buried. Now long after the USSR voted to break itself up, it is admitted and talked about.  A source?! For one, try actually reading the Wikipedia link/article that you originally posted.   So much for Russia being isolated...   Personally, I believe the unbiased scientists funded by Monsanto and our other corporate overlords. They would not lie no matter how much it financially benefits them -- just like CNN or the NYT would never lie.   Make sure you omit the fact that a US RC-135 intelligence aircraft was also in the area and the Korean airliner strayed over some of the most sensitive military areas of eastern Siberia.  If you include facts like those some may wonder if it was some sort of ruse to trigger Soviet air defenses and have the US spy plane record all of the electronic data.  After all, [we would never deliberately violate Soviet airspace to spy on them with aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident) and then *lie* about it, right?   "The chief problem in historical honesty is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important data. The definition of 'important', of course, depends on one's values." -- Historian Howard Zinn   But hey, after slaughtering those hundreds of innocent civilians on a scheduled airline flight, and shelling Iranian oil facilities in the Persian Gulf, the Iranians understood that the US government was serious about forcing them to agree to a ceasefire with our old ally Saddam Hussein.  Of course, the Iranians would later down a 747 over Lockerbie Scotland, but we fooled them and framed Libya for that tragedy.   Since when is corporate greed, inefficiency and price gouging considered "politics" by this sub-reddit's censors?   If that's all it was used for, that might be fine.  But the reality is that the US uses solitary confinement as torture. For example, to persecute former Black Panther [Albert Woodfox](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Albert+Woodfox+solitary+confinement), he was held in solitary confinement for *more* *than* *40* *years.*  Early in our republic the US was famous for *lenient* sentences for criminals. Quakers invented the penitentiary, a comfortable room with a bed and desk, at a time when Europeans were still literally throwing people into dungeons.  Fast forward to today and the US is not only the world's leading prison nation, but we're famous for prison rape and torture and for our draconian punishments. Clearly [we're doing something dramatically wrong](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/15/strange_bedfellows_why_are_the_koch).   Like Israel, there's no way the Saudis would ever attack Iran without a US green light of approval (even though our lying government may publicly deny they gave a green light).   Nice, but one has to wonder if our government, the prison capital of the world which makes heavy use of solitary confinement and which unapologetically tortures people, will comply.   We have money for wars and global skulduggery, but our [infrastructure](http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/grades/) is literally falling apart.  **Edit:** USA Today [is reporting](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/20/collapsed--10-bridge-given-rating-just-last-year/30428515/) that the 48-year old bridge was given a rating of "A" by the federal government just last year. But seemingly contradictorily the bridge was said to be "functionally obsolete".  Bureaucratic snafu? Bureaucratic cover-up? Incompetence? Act of god?  Who knows? All I know is that in-use bridges aren't supposed to collapse.       How are these not two sides of the same coin?   Because we have proven solutions to deal with global warming right now. To assume some scientific solution means doing nothing today and then applying some risky geo-engineering gamble when things are really bad.   It's not the *people*, it's the *governments*.  I'd go a bit further than that, would echo Naomi Klein's analysis; it's not only the governments, it's capitalism. It's the entire economic system based on greed and short-term profits that doesn't give a damn about the environment, sustainability, sanity or actual people.   Trump should be *proud* he did not fight in the Vietnam War -- there's honor and no sin in that!  McCain, on the other hand, was US Navy royalty and participated in the US' immoral war of aggression on Vietnam.  Let's remember, the US government broke an international agreement to hold elections to reunite North and South Vietnam because the CIA reported that the communist leader Ho Chi Minh would win any free and fair election.  The US government lied to the American people and the world about the [Gulf of Tonkin incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident) to start the war, backed a Catholic dictator in Bhuddist South Vietnam and then waged a war which resulted in about 3 *million* Vietnamese being killed. McCain dropped bombs on Vietnam, a country that never attacked us. McCain was shot down, tortured, beaten, etc., but blunt truth is that McCain and the US were the war criminals of that immoral war.  The bottom line is that today this entire "controversy" about the [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue) Trump disrespecting the war criminal McCain is political theater.  This is nothing more than a temporary [wedge issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue) designed to prevent people from talking about global warming, the US' many wars, our floundering economy, or any of the far more important issues that we should be talking about.   Exactly, thus my point is that the term "un-American" may seem handy and/or patriotic, but it's essentially a worthless label.   "Loyalty to the country, always. Loyalty to the government when it deserves it." -- Mark Twain   Trump should be *proud* he did not fight in the Vietnam War -- there's no sin in that!  McCain, on the other hand, was US Navy royalty. McCain participated in the US' immoral war of aggression on Vietnam.  Let's remember, the US government broke an international agreement to hold elections to reunite North and South Vietnam because the CIA reported that the communist leader Ho Chi Minh would win any free and fair election. So the US lied to the American people and the world to start the war, backed a Catholic dictator in Bhuddist South Vietnam and then waged a war which resulted in about 3 million Vietnamese being killed. McCain dropped bombs on Vietnam, a country that never attacked us. McCain was shot down, tortured, beaten, etc. But the bottom line is that McCain and the US were the war criminals of that immoral war.  The bottom line is that this entire "controversy" about the [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue) disrespecting the war criminal is political theater -- it's a [wedge issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue) designed to prevent people from talking about global warming, the US' many wars, our dying economy, or any of the far more important issues that we could be talking about.      How else can you keep people tolerating ever-increasing police budgets and the epidemic of police brutality and murders unless you create a fear of crime in them?  It's the same role the TV show "24" (and others) played, and the same reason the US government manufactures many "terrorist" cases by entrapping some ranty clown and charging him with plotting to blow something up.   "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"    But that's their job! Their job is to present a rational, coherent, plausible US government, pro-Pentagon, pro-capitalist and pro-corporate America, neo-liberal spin on news and events.  Their propaganda and bias is not ranty or overt and is very subtle. But it's propaganda nonetheless.    NPR is Fox News with a liberal veneer, but a veneer that's only convincing if...  I disagree.  FOX News is overt, ranty, right-wing propaganda which supports capitalism, corporate America and the US government.  NPR/PBS is subtle, non-ranty, neo-liberal propaganda which supports capitalism, corporate America and the US government.   Is China unapologetically torturing people and invading countries left and right, slaughtering hundreds and hundreds of thousands of civilians? Does China claim a "right" to attack any country it wants to attack even if it wasn't attacked first?  No, the worst thing one can accuse China of doing is building/expanding islands in the South China Sea and making loans to many countries to develop their infrastructure.  This is yet another article promoting the US' new (renewed) Cold War. Its purpose is to teach people to think in binary military terms, and demonize China and to paint them as a US "enemy."   "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"    Considering that both Nixon and Reagan worked with foreign powers to undermine a sitting US president to win their respective elections, "un-American" doesn't really mean much, does it?   Let's suppose they're successful at killing the deal.  What will the GOP, the Israeli lobby, and the entire US government look like if this much-heralded deal, a deal worked out over many months of hard-nosed negotiating, is shot down.  At that point, Iran will say, "We're complying with the deal" and they'll look like honest angels.  The US and Israel will both look like war-loving lunatic liars. (Not far from the truth, but the point is they'll look bad.)      If you're a shareholder of any one of the military-industrial/surveillance complex corporations, the answer is undoubtedly YES!  If you're an average American, no way.   Your summary of Obama's background is very, very plausible -- no doubt about that.   obama's not a 'coward'  I was merely contrasting Obama's public feel-good rhetoric to his actions. Given his many sell-outs, one can only come to the conclusion that either he is completely controlled and thus a political coward, or that he is a very good liar and deliberately misrepresents himself. Or both.   Sure, [Wikiquote says this is from](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler) a 1935 socialist newspaper "Common Sense."  Butler is a fascinating but almost forgotten hero from American history.  Most Americans recall Congress' "House Un-American Activities Committe" as being the platform for Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch-hunt during the 50s, or the 1960s when Vietnam anti-war protesters called in front of the HUAC mocked the entire proceeding and made a laughingstock out of the HUAC.  But the HUAC was founded in the 1930s to investigate the fascist coup d'etat which Butler blew the whistle on.  Being a popular and highly decorated general, Butler was approached by a group of industrialists who wanted to overthrow the US government, create a fascist government and to put him in charge as their figurehead (the so-called "Business Plot"). But Butler informed the Roosevelt administration about the traitors and caused FDR allies in Congress to start the HUAC.  Butler's famous short book "War is a Racket" should be required reading, but few have ever heard of it.  Today, the US Marine Corps issues out a suggested reading list of famous Marines to indoctrinate young Marines in training about the heritage and valor of the USMC. Despite Butler being 1 of the 2 most highest decorated Marines, needless to say Butler is not on the Corps' suggested reading list.   Partisan is an understatement. I started using /r/uspolitics because of the blatant censorship and [Yellow Dog Democratic mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_dog_Democrat) of /r/politics. Sadly, /r/uspolitics seems to be just as partisan, but thankfully without the censorship.  I think your post makes the sin of criticizing a Democrat. That's pretty likely to be downvoted here, no matter how much a war monger he is and no matter how repulsive the ideas are.     the US most definitely did decrease spending after the Cold War.  Despite the graphic from a rightist source, as I said previously, I agree that for a few years Clinton did allow inflation to eat away at the "defense" budget.   I see the core of what you're saying is that after decades and decades of wasteful military spending, and a shrinking percentage of world GDP, the US was forced to shrink cut is carrier fleets and dream of fighting two major wars down to reflect economic reality.  I don't disagree. Many history books have been written about how excessive militarism has wrecked the economies of empires and have lead to their decline. We're not an exception to that rule.  We saw it most clearly during our war on Vietnam. LBJ's years of deficit spending had many impacts. Social Security spending and its tax was merged into the "combined federal budget" to try to hide the costs of the war.  Nixon's expansion of the war into Cambodia and his deficit spending finally lead to countries openly questioning the solvency of the US dollar. France even went so far as to send a warship to the US to collect France's gold (a warship that returned empty). Nixon was forced to detach the US dollar from the gold standard, thus saddling succeeding presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter with the ensuing inflation caused by Nixon's move to inflate away the massive costs/debt of the war.  Bush's strategy of launching multiple wars and *cutting* taxes at the same time was sheer economic insanity.  With such a love of war, it's only common sense that we would eventually start paying an economic price and to be cutting back on the size of the US military.   Hence, even with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wound down/done,  Done? Don't you mean *lost?* The US Army's War College long ago rendered their verdict that *both* of those wars were strategic defeats for the US. Spending *trillions* on such adventures with no economic benefit to the US simply quickens our decline.   there is shift back to high tech equipment.  Shift or not, it hasn't meant that US wars around the world are any more successful, though the shareholders of the military-industrial complex probably have a different definition of "success."   "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist." -- President (and former General) Dwight Eisenhower, Jan 17, 1961.   I don't know what your point is. Clinton did not *cut* the so-called "defense" budget. He only allowed inflation to eat away at it.  Let's remember, the gigantic US military was sold to us for decades after WWII because of the "threat" of the USSR and communism.  But there was certainly no dramatic spending cuts despite the fact that the Politburo of the Communist Party of the USSR voted to break the USSR up into over a dozen countries that then became capitalist; the Warsaw Pact, which was created in response to NATO, was abolished; and Russia allowed the reunification of Germany, and then peacefully and voluntarily withdrew hundreds of thousands of troops from eastern Europe. In short, our enemy evaporated and became capitalist -- but NATO still exists and US military spending was barely impacted.  Yes, military spending increased after the 9/11 attacks and the month-plus-long series of anthrax attacks of 2001.  Considering Kennan's quote above, was the reason for that increased military spending because we had succeeded in *inventing* (Kennan's word) a new enemy?  What seems crystal clear is that the real reason for the massive US military spending after WWII was *not* because of the USSR and the "threat" of communism.   "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"    It's interesting to see how the so-called "end" of the Cold War meant no dramatic change to our "defense" spending.  One can only conclude that the Soviet Union and "threat" of communism was not the real reason for our decades of excessive military spending.   "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." -- US ambassador to the USSR and famous State Dept. geo-political strategist [George F. Kennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan).   Bill Gates' wealth equals the combined wealth of the poorest 120 million Americans, or 45 percent of our population.   "We may have democracy in this country, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both." -- US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis (1856-1941).    US foreign policy has always been pretty much about supporting the most stable political entity in a region,  US foreign policy is about supporting governments that will (a) follow American orders on important geo-political and economic issues, and (b) allowing US/western corporations free reign to run rampant in their country.   It has nothing to do with supporting democracy or human rights etc. Its all about the economy...  Aside from that "following orders" point, I completely agree. The US would prefer some neo-liberal "democracy" to rule, but you're right: It's not about any of the moralistic rhetoric that is the PR propaganda. As we've proven many times, the US government has no problem working with brutal dictatorships or fascists.  We've seen this recently when the Bahraini dictatorship shot unarmed pro-democracy protesters and admitted to widespread torture. Obama had no problem at all supporting the Bahraini dictator and supplying him with the weapons to commit his crimes.   I can understand the guy's generic argument about insulting or not insulting someone.  But his rhetorical claims about "double standards" and "the truth" are just that -- rhetoric and are pure opinion. The guy then uses that rhetorical foundation to go on to "support" his opinions on a variety of topics.  Overall, I thought it was a meandering rant with no coherent consistency.       how dare those racists help South Africa catch a known communist and terrorist.  Exactly! People like Mandela fighting against injustice should have been supported.  Instead of our the US government *supporting* and working with the racist South African regime, we should have been supporting the ANC and the freedom fighters to overthrow the minority white government.  But that would have been hard to do considering the outright Jim Crow apartheid racism practiced in many states in the US at the time.   I thought the most important thing here was the issue not directly addressed:  (a) How the US -- and remember, many states were based on flat-out Jim Crow apartheid racism then -- supported South Africa and worked closely with that evil regime.  (b) The headline' quip of "Can the story be told now." Doesn't that *scream* of self-censorship by our government and mass media? This immediately causes one to wonder what sort of crimes our evil government and media are hiding today.  	37
 Everything Everything can best be described as Prog Pop but critics will label them as Art Rock. The band says they skew more pop. Whatever it is, its a smorgasbord of everything you know you didnt want to hear in music. The Lyrics are provocative and the music straddles the border of the most progressive to the catchiest of pop hooks. A must listen!      Thanks for the praise! You'll hate the name of our stout then. "Mint Chocolate Girl Stout". American Stout with fresh mint and chocolate.   Brew partner provided a thorough guide!   Naranja is Spanish for the color orange. Hops for the IPA cept we spelled it with a 'j' because it has an 'h' sound in Spanish!      Victory screech!!!   Why not?   great. I have never felt passionate about a candidate before and for the first time, I am extremely excited about backing somebody who could bring about the progress we need with a track record to prove it. Working to spread the word as well as support as much as I can for my state.    I am very new to this. Never declared a party. I am 100% behind Bernie and just sent in my affiliation for NJ. Are candidates really not voted on until next June?    Donated and got a sticker. I've never given a single thought to backing a politician in my life but here is to firsts. Bernie has my vote.   is there an active link to purchase this shirt?   Hey Andr. Love your remixes and originals a bunch! What is your process for making another artists song your own? How do you conceptualize a remix from start to finish? Cheers.      Do you feel that art has helped you understand the known or unknown universe at all? If so, how?   An audible gasp was what escaped my mouth when I heard the news. A legend. He will be missed big time but man, what a life he led. Rest easy, Sir.    He finally got the screentime to show us all that he is a jolly dude. Love that guy.   was studying abroad and my trip to Amsterdam was about a week away. I asked my friends to help me out. They obliged. I didn't inhale properly and it didn't work but once I figured it out that European Dominos tasted pretty good.    I work in music distribution on the retail side of things. I've been lucky enough to work both at major labels and indie labels. People are buying records more than you think so thank you to everyone who supports artists and by association, the people like us who work for them. It is part of my job to get familiar with every DMS (digital music service) as to better cater our content to their consumers.   I am a Spotify power user. I love Spotify. It is my choice for on demand streaming. There are tons of great alternatives that essentially provide the same benefits like Deezer, now soft launching in the US, Rdio, Google Play All Access, Tidal, Guvera and many more.   While I use Spotify for the endless amounts of curated mixes for any mood, genre, decade, (not to mention pick   curate my own playlists) I use Google Play Access to store all of my owned and downloaded content in the cloud. This way I can listen to anything I own that may not be available for streaming. Google also has an a la carte download model akin to iTunes.   A new service called MixRadio (formally Nokia Music) is what I use for personalized algorithmic based playlists. Users get 6 skips and it is ad supported but the amount of music I have learned from using this service has amazed me ever since its launch. It learns your likes and dislikes better than most all other services IMO. Definitely give it a try.  Other stores like eMusic are totally different. They have a tiered subscription model for members. Each tier allows customers to buy a certain dollar amount of music a month. $11.99 a month gives you roughly 25 song downloads at $.69 - $.99 a track or 3-4 full albums. The plans range from amount to amount but prices are very competitive to combat iTunes leading download store market share.   End of the day, it is what works for you. As long as you consume music in a way that is convenient all while supporting the artists and business people behind the scenes, its all good. Happy listening!   edit: spelling   Yup - that is weed.    They probably wrote him out of the show at this point tbh. I would like them to return, however. There are so many storylines that need love i.e. Brotherhood Without Banners.    A king or high lord could make it happen   By Bran's burden I mean his journey.  He is beyond the wall with the Reeds to learn what the three eyed raven is about, the significance of his visions and who 'the children' and how they can help. Not to mention honing his warg ability. Probably a host of other things but those are probably some of the most important bits.    You smart smart human, you   	24
 That line cracked me the fuck up.  I just relived it, thank you.    I just meant there's no way they profit 50% on the hotdogs. I didn't realize there would even be a profit margin on them.    There's no way   Yea, I agree   Well, come on, regardless of their pasts, white characters inCrash come out on top. It may be subtle, but the two white characters we are made to hate, turn out to be the ones we forgive.     A remake of Michael Jackson's ["Dirty Diana" by Shaman's Harvest](https://youtu.be/1NHV6NUEKNU)   Yea, you're not missing much by not seeing the movie.  *rip aliyah*   This Is The End.  I know people just *love* this fucking movie.   I thought Michael Cera was the funniest part.   Get help man,  you deserve to be happy.    What movie do you deem hilarious?      I think a lot of people cringe at the white guilt manipulation-a-thon.   I used to think those monologues were epic.    It is so over-the-top.   You've gotta crow, and you gotta crow now!   Aw man, don't tell me that.   -marcus, score us some nacho chips and some radical salsa.  -dude.  -none of that green stuff.  -*dude*        Queen Of the Damned   They are expensive, so I definitely understand a boppy being a luxury.  But know that it has a purpose beyond breastfeeding.  It helps great with tummy time and propping baby up to sit, possibly more.    No one ever told me how much a newborn scratches up their face... so bad,  be prepared.   Edit: Plus, I agree, those muslin blankets are so freaking awesome. They are so stretchy, light weight, perfect to use as a nursing tent or to swaddle.    And living in a hot climate, it's nice to have something that is breathable to drape over her carseat.    Jesus. Thank you for the warning.  That sounds like a nightmare.    What does it feel like?    I watched that film a long time ago, I remember it ending with having what I thought was a decent understanding of it.    Now you are making me question it, and I don't remember it well enough to help you figure it out.  I'll have to watch again.  Maybe someone will come in here and help us.   The puppet in Puppet Master that spit leaches into people's mouths.   I was outside of my garage one day and this dog walks in to say hi.  Looked very similar to Mr. Lady,  matted up like crazy, and she seemed really thirsty.  This dog looked like she had been homeless for months.  So I got her water, checked for tags, no tags.  Took her to the closest vet to check for a chip, she had one!  The owner lived 5 houses away from mine.    I was happy to return her to her family.  When I got to their door, they didn't even know she had gotten out, and they weren't even that excited to see me with her.  It felt wrong leaving her with those people.   I should've helped that dog.  OP, I just wanted to share that story, but I think you're doing a great job.     You captured a beautiful moment!    It can be really hard to make these kind of people feel your pain.  If he has a victim complex, you just really have to know how to approach your conversation.    It's hard to baby them, but I feel like you'll get through to him more if you make a point to recognize the little sacrifices he makes, then discuss your struggles.  I feel like that makes all of your strengths and sacrifices more measurable, he needs to really see *all* you do.  It does take the role of a really strong woman, your kids are lucky to have you.    I feel your pain.    Oh wow, I'm so sorry.    Does he throw tantrums once in a while and text/say stupid stuff, or is his disdain for you just mounting and mounting?  I'm not too sure how your mom is, but if she is offering to help you more, I'd take it.  You really sound like you're reaching a breaking point, you need to let the ones that love you help you.  He definitely needs a kick in the ass and start contributing more to your family.  If he can make 3 kids, he can help raise your 2 kids.  It sounds like you're having to be the strongest person all the time, and I know that is tiring.    Try to see things through his eyes.  It must feel like shit to not be able to provide for your family.  Maybe he's taking a little longer to feel really paternal and maybe he's resentful that he can't act youthful and free.

I don't go to as many shows as I used to, but all the venues I still go to, Ticketmaster isn't affiliated.  I go to House of Blues, no Ticketmaster, The Joint at the Hard Rock, no Ticketmaster.  I *would* boycott that shit if it was any other way.   Well that's funny.  Makes sense now.    I live in Vegas, and every time there is/was a show, I'd go straight to the venue and wait in line there for tickets.  I would never give in to Ticketmaster prices.  Out here I never encountered a venue that didn't sell directly to you.  I think I would have boycotted the venue, fuck Ticketmaster.

 super honest question, jenna the autistic one seems completely normal.  So why do you admire her?  She seems like a decent normal girl.  i couldn't discern anything from the two without them continually telling me the other is autistic.   Nice try slipping that by, you were caught.  I applaud your attempt at a graceful exit.      Still remember Chick Hearn shoutin' "Nick the Quick!"   This was SUCH a great watch, caught a private link of it a few months ago, really opened my ignorant eyes to some NFL history.   To re-iterate their failure...I will take NY GM Phil Jackson over the mess that was Mike Brown and Mike D'Antoni, and just for some nostalgia coach Dell Harris.  Lakers have had some pretty shitty ass coaches for such a great team, every time my team gets some shit coach, we're in for trouble.  Great coach really matters, the players will come, but who the fuck wants to come for Mike Brown or honky Mike D'Antoni.     Again, the mere fact the terms of the contract allows Goodell to be Arbitrator does not supersede Goodell's inability to arbitrate fairly or Mr. Brady's right to due process.  He can be unfair if he wants, but that doesn't change that whatever he rules doesn't have to stand, if Brady doesn't want it to, this can go both ways, either way it just won't hold in court.  Goodell would be wise to prevent Brady from taking this to Federal, yea right he's in way too deep and if you just look at the past, he doesn't have a clue how deep he's getting himself into.   The main fucking point is Goodell inserted himself as Arbitrator, which cannot in anyway be consider fair.  Hello?!  Not rocket science here..whether or not you agree to the CBA that he is the default-arbitrator, it just doesn't hold up that you can be fair in that scenario.   	8

No, but it's been sitting on this table in my living room for quite sometime now.       oh theres more http://imgur.com/ALLqWbc,9mFrZze     alpina b7 yes it is     http://imgur.com/4h1YA0d      ^^AT^^-^^AT   https://www.etsy.com/market/death_star_soap  Theres a market for this stuff   What they actually did does sound movieish.  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-32414531   You ever come to MN and hit up the outdoor rinks?   Nothing really.   It's hard to find an OFNA 1/12 wing, especially black or white.  Watch your bearings if you upgrade to aluminum knuckle.   I would actually just upgrade screws and bearings if you have the extra cash.   Avid bearings and RCscrewz.      Exactly!   I actually snapped in A-arm and one stock bearing destroyed my HR Knuckle.    So i decided to update everything.     http://imgur.com/GYpvxu0  http://imgur.com/Ad8tLVf  http://imgur.com/k1vLqhD      Bought a 1/16 Revo.   I think I put in $500 this month    Ok so I don't understand the dimension.  I still emailed multiple examples and the actual right size bearing.     The kit was not right in the first place.  I received 8 bearings that do not fit my rc truck.     http://imgur.com/9YbVDmp  The blue is a traxxas 8x12.   The black is a FE 8x12  I don't understand then    I'll just include this now.  This was the email he sent back.   Now remember I have sent a couple picks comparing the bearings.   I even gave the traxxas part number so if you looked it up online or Google you would even see what the bearing look like.    This was his reply:  "Look at what your asking.   You want to send 8x12 back and to be replaced with 8x12.  We included 8x12. You asked for 8x12 and we sent more.  Now you want to send 8x12 back and get more 8x12?  I'm sorry. We have tried to get this taken care of for you but it's obvious you don't understand what you have or or what you need.  Please ask for some help from someone that understands what you need. "  Now I understand I am asking for the same size bearing.    It needs to have the same outer dimensions.   Both bearings are in fact 8x12.     (Now under my mistake I linked him to 2 different links.  How I obtained these links was that I googled "8x12 bearing" and the Boca site came up with the bearings he keeps sending me.  The ones I don't need.   The second Google was "8x12x3.5 bearing" which also popped up the Boca site first which was the correct bearing I needed.   So I included those two links in my email when I should have just linked him to his own damn site to the bearing I needed)  I replied with this: "Can you not see the picture I sent you?    Look at your bearing compared to correct bearing.    I need 8 of those.   Looks at this kit.   They have the correct bearing.   Do you see how big the opening is?    Can you not see the images I am sending?   I never originally requested a size.  I said the bigger ones that fit the axles.  You went ahead and just sent 4 more.   You never waited for measurements.   I send 2 pictures showing the obvious difference of the inside diameter of the bearings.  You for some reason can't comprehend that the inside of the bearing you sent is to small for the right bearings.   I guess that is all we can do though.   If you can't tell the difference between bearings it's just a lost cause.     This is the bearing size I need and what should have came in the kit I paid good money for.  Do you see the size?  8x12x3.5  http://www.bocabearings.com/bearing-inventory/Radial-Bearings/2814/8x12x3-5-MR1282GS?utm_source=googlefeed08292013 utm_medium=cpc utm_campaign=radial gclid=COj6qPLS_cQCFRABaQodREQAgg  This is what you keep sending me and not understanding that although they are the same size. It has a different inside diameter.  Do you see the size 8x12?   Yes you are correct that is the same size as the one above, but if you look closely the inside diameter would not fit a revo 1/16 axle through that opening.    http://www.bocabearings.com/bearing-inventory/Radial-Bearings/7491/0-6250x1-3750x0-3437-SR102RS  I hope you can see the difference.    Thanks,     Yes it should be in more detail.   It should include the 3.5 at the end.  You can tell at the skinniness in the manual, but if you are going off just by that number you end up with the fatter bearings.   Which I even explained to him in the email.   Which is when he told me this   "You told me what size you needed and I sent them. Don't assume what you need.  Measure them. Every time you assume it coats be 6.00. If you want to measure what you need and send the other 8 bearings back I will be more then glad to get you what you need.  The original kit has the proper size bearings in it according to traxxas " -Ed  So he assumed and took the 8x12 measurement and sent me the fatter bearings.   I told him I need 8x12x3.5 the bearing with the bigger inside diameter. And I sent him a pic of the two bearings showing the difference.    I said I would send those 8 bearings in exchange for the other ones.     I did twice.   I sent him the dimensions but he still insists that's what he sent me even tho they are the same outside diameter the inside ares clearly different.  I even told him the diameter but he insisted I measure.     I will be uploading the email mag along with it just so everyone can see how ridiculous the whole situation was.    I opted for a refund on everything.   I'm just going to go with Avid now.   They seem to understand the size of bearings after I spoke with them.     http://imgur.com/UFfvKHY One of the images I sent in my email.   Yet they still don't understand what bearing I need   Alright so I ordered a Revo 1/16 bearing kit from  FastEddyBearings.com.   The kit included everything except for the right size bearings for the knuckles and differential.    What it included was (8) 8x12 bearings which is the right size, but not the right inner diameter.  The bearings that were included would not fit the stock Revo 1/16 axle through it.     I emailed the company and received a quick reply.   They offered to take care of the problem.   During the first couple emails I disclosed that the bearings would not allow my axle to fit.   They asked if it was stock and I sent an a image of my axle not fitting through the bearing along with another image of a factory traxxas bearing and the ones I received.    He asked me in the email what size I needed and I just replied with the bigger ones as I did not know the size yet.  He went ahead and shipped the bearings.      The bearings I received again were 8x12 but the inner diameter was the exact same as the ones I had.    I sent him an email regarding the size and he sent back an email saying I shouldn't assume stuff and always measure and I costed him $6 more.    He must have not looked at the two images I included in the email to see the side by side difference.    I decided just to order another 10 traxxas stock 8x12x3.5 bb since I needed them soon and I replied to his email stating I ordered the correct size.      I slept on and decided to send another email stating I would send him the 8x12 back if I could get 8x12x3.5 in return.    I included another pic of the correct size and the ones he sent.  Just so he could see the difference.     He sent another email back telling me to read when I sent.   He said that what I'm asking makes no sense and he has been sending the correct bearing.    So he must have not looked at the image I sent (again).  He told me I need to find someone who knows what I need and can help me out and understand.      So that's why I'm here.  Please help Me understand what bearings I need for my knuckles and differential.    Revo 1/16 brushless traxxas  Edit:   I figured it out.   The bearings they sent were 6x11x4 When I needed 8x12.   So even after I requested 8x12.  They went ahead and sent another set of 6x11x4.  I should have just measured right away, I just put to much faith in kit.     http://imgur.com/EesDan3 http://imgur.com/LyXCQe7   How awesome is it on the rocks.   I live in Duluth and it's by Lake Superior and the shore is covered in perfect rock formations ranging from small to big.   Even some of the trails by my house look as if they were set up just for scale rigs and crawlers.    I should upload pics, but that really what is pushing me to get a rig like this.  The environment is just to perfect.      That's close, but they couldn't get them to fit    Corn in your shit for eternity     Ya you probably would.  No training or experience, you'd def be gone in hours.     My first was a HPI Savage Nitro and I picked up a E Revo 1/16 Brushless.   Both were RTR since I was new to the hobby, but I tore both of them down eventually for upgrades and cleaning.   So look into if you want to build or just start driving what's you get the proper gear.    Brands I think you should check out would be.    Axial - They have both RTR and KIt and also go for a scale look if you want something to look more realistic.   Something fast and just messing around with you could be looking at the Axial Yeti up to the more scale SCX10.   These guys are more trail riding/rock crawling/ not all out speed(they can be tho with right performance).   Traxxas/HPI - People bash Traxxas because they are pricey and you don't get what you pay for like other brands, but depending where you love they might be the best brand for upgrade able parts.   Traxxas only has RTR models and they range in price.   They have a variety of vehicles which you should check out.   This might even help you look at other brands and see the same models and compare parts.   Don't feel bad if you go with Traxxas, you will still have a blast.  Popular models are: Stampede, Slash, Latrax , Summit, Revo, Rustler   If there is a local hobby store by you check out what they carry.   Also check the internets for forums or community's based on your rc model and brand.   Watch YouTube vids on ones that interest you.    Other popular brands that you should definitely check out once you figure out what style rc you want would be:   Team Associated, Losi, OFNA , Tamiya, and there's many more.     Sites to check out  www.towerhobbies.com www.amain.com www.thetoyz.com   Cheaper brands would be.   Redcat, ECX, Helion, Dromida      I wanna specifically know what that thing is made of.

More parts are coming at the end of the week.   I will have to order another HR knuckle along with figuring out the correct bearings from Fasteddys or just ordering a set from somewhere else.      http://imgur.com/TMIgmcZ  http://imgur.com/Qis2HrD  http://imgur.com/GoLDIiA   What 90s commercial is Grandpa from?    http://imgur.com/8DyYOVT   http://imgur.com/SPWRBVj  Other items will be skids and bumpers just haven't decided which direction I wanna go with it.     I never really built an rc up with aluminum parts.  So I decided to build a Hot Racing 1/16 brushless Revo.  Along with the HR Im also using RPM arms and traxxas upgrade links and pushrods.     Other than that I have 2.2 trenchers, but I'm also picking up some on road.  A bluebird servo and fast eddy bearings.    Though I did not receive knuckle bearings that fit my axles, which I'm pretty bummed about.   Also have a custom fitted Spektrum Rx so it would fit in the water resistant case.   GTR shocks with upgraded springs.  Upgraded center dif.    Still waiting on the baja bug body and 1/12 OFNA wing along with paint and couple other items.     I am missing a few things but I plan on uploading more pics.     I'm having shoulder surgery tomorrow though so it will put a halt on the build.        And if that was a shoebox filled with old cum.     Alright alright alright.  Makes a left    It was me   main button  5005  main butyon   That's cool.   All I'm saying is electronics fail.

[The Cache I Want To Find The Most](http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1MDCE_jolly-green-giant)   I really really need to buy stock in the foil industry.   Same here. I wasn't around here then.   Makes me wonder if the chiropractor or Johanna caches. Nice attention to details matching the paint.   Live right by this church and it has always given me bad vibes.

It's all about dressing the part and not standing out too much.   They are yet they're not. Some are listed on the site but it's few and far between   If the black hole/tube was in the ground prior to you placing the cache I would say no.   They will do an investigation. Mine went through and as soon as it went through the money went back in.    Only thing I can think of when looking at the size you need is a Magellan eXplorist GC or a Garmin Chirp.   Pretty much.

It was a digital card BTW.   Was never really taught flow. Usually just write what's in my head.   If I remember correctly I believe this was a redemption product using the UPC code.

 In 3rd grade we had someone come into class late and their excuse was they were trying to catch a peacock that got out.  No one believed him until they talked to the farm across the street and found out they had just gotten a few peacocks and one of them did escape and was caught by elementary school kids.   A far fetched excuse that was true.   US was noticeably silent about all human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia.   I'm home now and just realized my son took my copy of Crime and Punishment with him when he moved out, so I can't check. Time to buy my 4th copy of it.   Maybe you should be teaching Christian religion at the universities since you seem to think you have cornered the market on proper interpretation of the bible and all disputes between religious leaders about interpretations can be answered by you. Even within the various Catholic groups there is significant differences in how they interpret the bible. Right now the Pope is getting a lot of flak for his interpretations of the bible and what it means to be a Catholic and Christian. Once again, they can just call you and solve the differences in their interpretation.   As you may have guesses, I don't care much about your interpretation. And I offered my 2 cents because I had something to say, much like you posting. I think using religion as a smorgasbord is the ultimate act of hypocrisy. It either is or isn't the ultimate truth. It's not something to pick and choose what rules you like. If the Torah, Koran or OT/NT are the ultimate truth. If my religion uses the Koran as part of their holy book, it either is or isn't the ultimate truth. I can't say well this part of the Koran does not pertain to us, that just for people who are Muslims anymore than we can take the Torah and add it to the Bible and say, well this ultimate truth was only for the Jews. No, the whole Torah was written for the Jews. There was no such thing as Christianity when the Torah was written. If Christianity wanted to pick and choose which rules apply to non Jews and which to Jews, they should not have used the Jewish religious book as the basis for the religion.   I find it difficult to believe that you think all Christian religions have the same interpretations of the Bible. It makes me wonder why you think there have been all the divisions in Christian religion. If they all see the biblical rules as ultimate truths, there is no picking and choosing what you like and dislike. But Luther had his own views and created a variation of Christianity. Why do you think Luther created his division if not for differences in interpretation? If only you had been alive then, you could have solved the dilemma he faced.    Not sure what religion you follow that only uses the NT. My daughter is Lutheran and they use the OT regularly. When we moved to Michigan, the Presbyterian priests regularly referenced the OT.  When I was in the Marines, we had to go to church during boot. Presbyterian was not an option so I went to Protestant masses. They also regularly referenced the OT. Other than a hotel, I've never seen a NT as a stand alone book. But you lost me on "The Bible is accurate in all it says." As accurate as Aesop's fables imo. The stories are useful and pertinent to day to day life, but accurate? Not to me. They are parables, like the Jews see the Torah. I accept science over religion and really struggle with the concept of God. IMO it is nothing other than what my forefathers thought of the Norse Gods. It's a way to explain what they didn't understand.   But I am fine with your believing what you want as long as you do not try to legislate your religious views or nag others for not following your sky wizard's rules.    For the DV's I just say: It is useless to show the gold piece to a cat.   Confusion reigned and I got wet   I found the Penguin translation of Crime and Punishment the best. I had lent my copy out and never got it back. When I repurchased the book I did not get the Penguin translation and couldn't figure out why it sucked so bad. When I repurchased the Penguin translation it reminded my why I liked the book so much.   Fast tracking is for the TPP. Since almost all our political leaders are bought and paid for by special interest groups and industry who will benefit from TPP, I have no faith they will do what is right for the public. They will do what lines their pockets and gives them the best chance to become a well paid lobbyist when they quit politics. Preventing Fast Track, greatly decreases the chance the TPP will be approved. I have no interest in driving US labor rates to 3rd world standards. I feel our manufacturing base is what keeps our country strong and provides decent paying jobs to millions of people. Moving our manufacturing to the 3rd world is what is killing our middle class. Walmart and Target do not pay what GE, Whirlpool, GM, Boeing, etc pay. Service jobs do not provide a path to the middle class for 99% of their employees. Manufacturing jobs provide a path to the middle class for 99% of the workers.   Or I was raised Christian so I am far more aware of what the bible states than what the Koran states. But I feel the same way about all religions. The religious leaders of all religions have many interpretations of the rules and what they mean. I was raised Presbyterian and graduated from a Jesuit university. I respected the Jesuits because of the way they interpret the bible and their willingness to learn and reconsider their views. Compare them to the Benedictine's who follow a very literal translation of the bible. Growing up our church focused on the New Testament. It was not about hell and damnation it was about making the right choices in life to allow you to have a relationship with Jesus. IMO the OT is a horror story with slavery, stoning people, restrictions on all facets of life and on and on. When I moved from Minn to Mich the religious leaders of the local Presbyterian church were all about hell and damnation and read regularly from the OT. Within a year no one in our family went to church anymore. I did not go to feel bad and guilty about who I am. I went to have a connection to something bigger than myself. I could not follow the OT or take part in any rituals associated with it. It is a book of hate, not love. At least the Jews understand the stories in the Torah are stories and parables. It is a book used to guide people through those stories. While the stories may be interpreted differently by different leaders, the stories did not change. They did not have the equivalent of a King James version of their book with new interpretations. But right out of the gate Christians said the Torah is the start of our holy book as it is the ultimate truth, but this part and this part only pertain to the Jews. IMO it is not different than people now using the bible as their smorgasbord of ultimate truths to pick and choose from. Oh gay sex, that is an abomination. Divorce, meh. And then the whole story of Leviticus is one horror story after another. Stephen King has nothing on Leviticus when it comes to horror stories.   And yes, for us to take the Jewish holy book, the Torah and integrate that into the OT but say oh this is only for the Jews and this is for the non Jews is a joke imo. Either it is the ultimate truth or it isn't. It makes as much sense as integrating the Hindu scriptures in the bible and saying oh well, but this is only for Indians. Either it is or isn't the ultimate truth.   I see it the same as what is happening with Islam. Islam is a very peaceful and loving religion. Some leaders have distorted their scriptures into being something other than they are and made it seem like a religion of hate. You can take the stories in religious books and interpret them many ways. Do those interpretations help bring more people together or to divide. All religions have people who are using their religion to divide.   Oh and sorry for not agreeing with your interpretation of the bible. If you have a copy of the interpretations according to Michael Forrester, please share it with us. Apparently it has the ultimate truths detailed with the reasons why we don't have to follow rule x, y and z as dictated by the Christian holy book just like the original prophets did as they went through the Torah and integrated it into the Christian bible. Oh this rule is for all, this rule is only for the Jews, this rule is only for priests, etc.   The smorgasbord of ultimate truths. Pick and choose which ones you like and leave the rest behind.    That is what is being written in the Financial Times, Forbes and the like. My comment was more general and in response to thinking it is a good thing. Only the propaganda makes it appear like a good thing.   They have their own courts which supersede a nations own courts and laws. If we pass a law that hurts a foreign companies ability to profit, they can sue the nation or state. That suit will not be heard in the US courts. They will be decided by the corporations who run the courts for the treaty.  We are giving up our sovereignty so multi nationals can get more profit for less risk.   This is about the multi nationals being able to move more of our jobs overseas and bring the product in without additional taxes or fees. This is about the drug companies restricting access to generic drugs. This is about creating a global business environment with no consideration for the interests of a nation.   Anyone who says this is about us being able to export more is lying and you just have to ask them what it is that we want to export and is restricted to the area we are trying to export to.   So the smorgasbord began when Christianity was started. The OT is the book of ultimate rules, except for these rules which don't pertain to us.  Sorry, religion cracks me up at this level. I accept the value of it to many people, but the manipulations of the fairy tale are humorous at the base level.   http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview   Interesting read for anyone interested   I had to drop XM because they were burning me out on bands I loved with their repetition. I haven't been able to listen to CCR since I dropped XM almost 3 years ago. I used to refer to them as Fogerty radio. When they started doing the same to Clapton I got rid of them. Even at 4 bucks a month it wasn't worth what they were doing to my favorite artists.   Yeah, I spent 8 summers dancing and singing at the church of Jerry. It just wasn't the same in Fall, spring or winter as someone who lives in the N. Central states.   I train sw around the world and I also like to travel and see museums, the local architecture and try local food. When I am traveling for work, I get to meet a lot of locals and get a much better idea of what the people are like and how they live. I rarely have time for normal tourist stuff. I may have 1 day on one side of the trip to explore a little.   When I travel as a tourist I see a lot of museums and the local architecture, but I have no time or opportunity to really meet regular people.   I find they both have their positives and negatives. My big problem with business travel is, if I did what I wanted as a tourist, it would cost me a lot of money over the year. As a tourist I budget for the things I want to do and I saved for the trip to do that.  For business, I can't afford to spend the money I would have spent if it was planned and I could afford it.   Subjective ultimate truth vs objective ultimate truth. Picking and choosing your religious tenets is a subjective ultimate truth.   The old testament is a horror story to me. I find it highly offensive. I also laugh at how the ultimate truth changes so much as time goes by and which ultimate truths are left behind. Even when the NT was being written, they were picking and choosing which rules from the OT would be upheld. Oh, those were only meant for the Jews, we don't have to follow that ultimate truth from the OT. But that other ultimate truth will send you to hell if you don't follow it. Even when I was majoring in religions it amazed me how people would pick and choose their ultimate truths and which ones had no meaning to them. It seems like the ultimate hypocrisy to me.   Leviticus 11:10 - And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which [is] in the waters, they [shall be] an abomination unto you:   Leviticus 11:9 - These shall ye eat of all that [are] in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.    Thanks for the clarification. I guess I had learned that it was only animals that eat meat that Muslims don't eat.   Thanks for the clarification. I guess I had learned that it was only animals that eat meat that Muslims don't eat.   No shrimp. That's a crustacean and against Christian and Jewish law. I think it's even against Islamic law. Instead of 20 virgins, you end up with 20 washed up prostitutes.   As a bird watcher, I have a 30x optical zoom so I can get pictures of birds from far away and still have them stand out in the cropped picture. It's amazing looking at the original and hardly seeing the bird and zooming in and having a very clear picture of the bird. +1 for Cannon's Japanese made lens instead of the crap being made in China.   I just gave all my old holey jeans to Purple Heart. I was imagining someone somewhere thinking they've found a gold mine.    Most people treat their religion like a smorgasbord and pick and choose what they want to follow. "I accept this is the ultimate truth, but I disagree with this rule so I am going to do it anyway." IMO It's either the ultimate truth or a fairy tale. If it's the ultimate truth, there is not picking and choosing what you like and dislike.   A good example is some Christians views of gays, which has little in the Bible and divorce which is specifically outlawed.    Yes, Yunnan Sourcing has several black tea cakes. I'm like you and don't really like Puerh tea but I love black teas from Yunnan province.   When we visited our Grandma we had our choice of water, milk or tea, so that was when I was exposed to tea. In college I switched to Twinings bag tea and about 20 years ago switched to Twinings and Harney and Sons loose teas. When I was in Australia I tried T2Tea's Grand Yunnan and fell in love. 90% of the tea I drink now is black tea from Yunnan. I think they are as complex as a lot of oolong teas. I also use honey in my tea for health purposes and Yunnan teas really lend themselves to a little honey. I find oolongs are naturally sweet and floral and honey overpowers them a bit.   T2Tea is in Australia and their tea is really good. I used to have their Grand Yunnan shipped to me about every 4-6 months.    I agree. When I cook fish or something that leaves a strong smell or excessive grease, I use a little soap to clean my cast iron. If it is something like bacon, I just clean it with very hot water and wipe down with paper towels. Cast iron is great for everything except tomato based stuff.   That's why I wouldn't even keep them in the house. I kept enough to get through a bad day and the rest were with my wife in her office.    I had shoulder surgery and got 80 percs for the pain. I gave all but 4 to my wife to take to work. I wanted nothing to do with those being in the house. I took them for 4 days and then was too scared to keep taking them. She probably has about 60 of them still sitting in her office drawer 3+ months later.   I've had both shoulders done now. The first time they gave me Vicodin which gives me anger-mares. I wake up spitting nails when I take those. So when I had the 2nd one I asked for Tylenol 3's instead of Vicodin but they gave me Perc's instead. Way stronger than Vicodin imo. Scary strong to me.   I'd get them a little selection of the classic teas like a nice TieGuanYin, a single estate Darjeeling like Lingia, a gunpowder green, maybe a matcha and a puehr and my favorite; Yunnan gold.   I had a buddy in HS with a van and he had a pair of Cerwin Vegas in the back. I had a pair of Visonik David's in my Horizon and those could also be hooked up to a car or home receiver.   edit: We have a really good car stereo store near us; Car Tunes, and I would call someone like that. I'm no electrician, but I would think the only functional difference is the power source.    It teaches you how to talk to people so they are interested in what you are saying. I took the class when I joined a sales team a lifetime ago. I needed to learn how to speak more effectively and bend the conversation to the topics I needed to focus on. Being a good listener is the first step in becoming a good conversationalist.   Have you read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Carnegie? But dominating conversations is not a way to win friends. People like to talk about themselves, not listen to others talk about themselves. If you can find something interesting in another person, it will be far easier to talk to them.   I was going to recommend Clive Barker as well. He wrote some of the most bizarre books I've ever read. His stories are great and his writing is exceptional. The sexual content can get a bit graphic if that makes a difference.   All of his books are really good including the one OG mentions. I also really like Weaveworld, Imajica and the Thief of Always.   I really like Steinhauer too. Have you tried Jo Nesbo?  I think Steinhauer has better stories but Nesbo writes better and his stories are really good as well.    Jo Nesbo is my new favorite author. He writes the best police stories I've ever read.   I also really like Olen Steinhauer. His stories take place in Eastern Europe and are sort of espionage/spy/police stories.   If you like Ian Fleming's James Bond books, see if you can find Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise books. They're fluff like the Bond books, but his stories, bad guys and plots are exceptional. It amazes me that they haven't been made into movies. They are far better than Fleming's books imo.   I can't watch chopped or other Food Network shows through dvd. Also getting the full set of Andy Griffith, Leave it to Beaver, MASH, etc would cost way, way more than a few bucks. I like old martial arts movies and those are not easy to find in the library and Redbox and the like doesn't have them. Netflix does.  Netflix would have to add really good stuff, like Kurosawa's entire collection, lots of old movies from the 30's to the 60's for me to watch a commercial to see them. Right now, Netflix is pretty lame with old black and whites and most of what I enjoy.   I guess what I should have said is the shows I watch on netflix are either limited to one or two seasons or they are new shows that I think are crap. New shows are geared for kids and young adults and I am several decades past that.   And with Encore I have like 10 commercial free channels. They play a lot of older movies I like and their western channel is fairly good. Netflix is a backup to that and allows my wife and I to watch some of the cooking shows we like when there is nothing else on the tube. I did like watching the Dragon Tattoo movies on Netflix. We tried to find them on DVD, but none of the local shops had a copy to rent. They only have the US version of the first movie.  I get that people like all the Marvel movies, house of thrones (or whatever it's called) and stuff. If I was 20 I would probably be the same. My wife and I watched the first 2 seasons of Big Brother and Survival, so we are not above watching crap either. In our 50's, we've just moved past most of the crap we used to be amused by.   I said you can, not that I do. The only advertised shows I watch and don't DVR to avoid commercials are sporting events, which limits me to college football and F1 commercials. I typically run the F1 races 45 min after start and ff through commercials. I usually watch football with friends and we talk through commercials so it isn't a big deal then. But yes, I loath commercials. Our kids could only watch commercial TV if they muted commercials or watched Disney, which was commercial free when it first came to cable. My son became anti TV all together and my daughter works in advertising. My methods created both extremes.   I also get up at 4:30 am so I do not have to deal with traffic on my way in or out of work. I do a lot of things to avoid things that frustrate me. Bumper to bumper traffic is one thing I hate and commercials are another. I am pretty anti commercial in everything. Adbusters is a great periodical and pretty much presents advertising in the way I see it as well.   I use the website to find movies. Searching in the TV screens is a PITA. Once I find something I like online, I save it for later and get it in my list then.      I have nothing against Netflix. What they offer for their price is very reasonable. Shoot, many newspaper sites want more than that to access their articles. I get my 7.99 worth each month even if I only watch 4 or 5 shows.   No, what you said is true. It's all fluff and is nothing but transmitted opiates to keep us amused. Unfortunately, I think most dramas are even worse. A lot of days I come home and turn on the stereo instead of the TV because it has become so lame. Trashy wife shows, lame competitions for dancing and singing, lots of the Jenner family whoring for the tv, stupid court shows and on and on.   If not for college football and F1 racing I'd get rid of cable all together.   There is no shortage of crazy people with opinions. But I feel really sorry for this person. She needs to meet a better grade of males. Not all of us are assholes just like all women aren't. The assholes just stand out more and are easier to find.   I like to cook and it's about the only new shows on TV that are worth watching. I wish we still got BBC so I could watch Master Chef Professional too. It had some drama to keep my wife interested and showed some new techniques to keep me interested. On Food Network, I like seeing what people can come up with under the limitations they are given.   Not a Walmart shopper, their stores suck and the people who work there are clueless and unhelpful. Not to mention the family that owns them.   But I get your gist. I do get movies from stores if they are under 10 bucks and I think I would watch it more than once. When I rent though, I have no idea if the movie is going to be worth watching for a buck, let alone worth buying a copy for 5 or 10 bucks.   I'm getting to be an old fart so most new movies are not geared for me anyway.  The Return of the King was the last time I went to a movie theater and before that was the last Harry Potter with our kids. I think The 2nd Hobbit movie was the last movie we rented from a video rental place. (Actually RedBox).   I also really like old B W movies so I watch a lot of Turner Classic Movies too. To me, it's like reading a classic book.  I have many Kurosawa movies on my DVR and he may be my favorite director.   Local library has DVD's. Sometimes 2 for a buck on old ones and usually a buck or two for newer ones. It gives them some money to keep getting new copies and get new movies.    Chopped, Cut throat kitchen, and other cooking shows. They usually only put up one season at a time or if we are lucky, 2 seasons.   Except I watch mostly Encore with no commercials. We watch a lot of Food Network but it is all DVR'd and we ff through commercials. I struggle watching sports now because of the number of commercials.   I'd drop it if I got ads. The movies are so old you can rent most of them from the local library for a buck or less. They don't show most new movies, even after they've been on DVD for a year. The tv shows are either very old or limited to one or two seasons at a time. I only really keep it as a backup to Encore on demand.   I thought it was that creature born in the back of the station wagon in MIB I   That's a joke. I'm very liberal in my views and 90% of my DV's are in /news.    DV's are fine. I am tired of people wanting the benefits of a group they have no biological association with. The Hi Ho is a Vonnegut hiccup when satire is used that I've stolen. Oh I feel like I am X so I should be treated like X. That's BS imo.   We have so many tasks that need to be done in communities that we can't afford. Picking up trash from the roads is an example. We don't pay people to do that in our area and it shows. And I think a lot of trade type jobs could be done within the prison. They need tractors and other vehicles to produce the food they eat. Prisoners should be learning how to maintain those vehicles. Same with building maintenance, learning electrical, plumbing, HVAC, etc. I think there are plenty of jobs within the prison and jobs not able to be afforded in communities, that prisoners could do.    I believe one of the biggest things we can do to reduce our prison numbers is to quit jailing people for minor drug offenses and other minor crimes that could more effectively be taken care of through community service and 1/2 way houses. I believe we have far more prison beds than we need. Turning our prison system into a for profit enterprise is the wrong path to make prisons anything other than a place for punishment and training for the next generation of criminals. They need to be places where doing the right thing moves you toward release and making bad choices moves you down the chain to more challenging jobs.   I majored in Sociology for a few years and did a research paper on this. I think the levels provides both an incentive to not cause trouble and a path to join society once they get out.   Create like 20 levels of prisons and 1/2 way homes/farms/businesses.   When you go to jail you're crime sets which level you start in. You have to work through each level to get out. Screwing up puts you back a level. Each level has sub levels. For example, at level 20 you are working in swamps and the like and it sucks bad. At the bottom of that group, you are pulling stumps and roots. If you follow the rules, you can move to the chopping and moving section and get out of the water. Next is maybe the people cooking food for the group. Once you show you can obey the rules at level 20, you can move to 19. Maybe 19 is flattening gravel roads and digging ditches. Each level brings you closer and closer to what you need to do to live in a community and be a useful member of the community.   From 20 to 11 it is a matter of degrees of how bad your job sucks and how tough it is. From 1-10 it is gradual freedoms and reduced restrictions to help someone learn how to live in society. From levels 1-10 they should actually be learning skills that can provide them a living once they get out. Learning a skill so you can work once you get out should be one of the primary goals of levels 1-3.   It needs to move away from doing time and move toward learning how to live in a society and community and how to pull your own weight.   I guess the challenge would be like repeated drunk drivers, parents who don't pay child support, minor drug offenses, etc.  Many of them know how to behave already, they just chose to ignore the rules. I guess using more community geared work for those offenders may have a better impact. If drunk driving is going take my weekends away for the summer so I can work on the crews cleaning roads, parks, etc, it may get more people to think. And the ones who chose to do it anyway, actually help the community they work in.  It may even be a method to spur the community to work together with the crews coming in and making it a larger community event and make those who are forced to work in them, feel like they are making a difference too. The big difference is volunteering for the weekends you want or being forced to work the weekends they want.  Not doing your job to a certain standard means the hours don't count or you only get partial credit.   The big thing is showing that your decisions affect your life. If you follow the rules and make good choices, you have more options.   I can't decide if it is a Fujian or Yunnan tea though  	57
 My bad. Deleting...            My mom?                                                   Are you serious? I did understand that as a joke.                              Summary agreed.   [Relevant](https://youtu.be/Zd7WBUj8PAs)                     Thanks!                           A team from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science, along with collaborators from several Japanese institutions, have successfully produced pairs of spin-entangled electrons and demonstrated, for the first time, that these electrons remain entangled even when they are separated from one another on a chip. This research could contribute to the creation of futuristic quantum networks operating using quantum teleportation, which could allow information contained in quantum bits-qubits-to be shared between many elements on chip, a key requirement to scale up the power of a quantum computer. The ability to create non-local entangled electron pairs -- known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs -- on demand has long been a dream.            1.

 Damn. That's depressing. I would never want my kids to go through this.   How likely is it that my kids would be autistic?   I'm not really interested in getting help because I would feel bad. I don't consider it a handicap or anything. I do recognize the issues but I feel like I live a relatively normal life compared to people that are worse off than me. On that note, if I could get scholarships because of it that would be so great.   17   I got a 42 but I'm not sure if it's even worth looking into. I just feel too old to be able to do anything about it if I am on the spectrum.  	5
 thanks you slut   this has a deeper meaning than op lets on.   balancing a stick on your foot.   it is not much different from your hand. place  it on top of your toe tips and move your legs accordingly to the weight shift    its also a crime against humanity to use hallow points in warfare   who indeed    NIIIIICCEEEEE. now give me the source you whore bag    So many theresas dying this week.  	7
 Thanks for the list, saving them all to look up later :)   Thanks, just looked up Dragon Tiger Gate, looks interesting :D  	2
 OK I had a feeling that was why.   I am just more upset that they had to wait till the eve of my appointment to tell me that!  they can't even give me a date yet the receptionist said they would call me back tomorrow with a date.  Oh well cheap/free American healthcare for ya.   OK thanks for the info. Only problem now is they called to postpone my appointment because my doctor is out of town :/    So I have been on Paxil for quite a long time now- 12 years and I feel like it really isn't working anymore.  I also was able to get a few small scripts for Ativan.  Problem is my regular doctor doesn't think i should be taking any benzos for a long period- no more than like a week at a time because its addictive blah blah.  I ran out of my last script of 20 1mg pills and she won't refill it for me so I am kind of in a withdrawl right now.  Sucks because I feel a lot better when I take just one 1mg of Ativan and I don't feel any better when taking my Paxil.  Here is my question: It seems like a lot of people on this forum have a decent ongoing script for benzos.  How did you go about getting it? I'm not asking for a ton of pills, just something that is more longterm that 1 or 2 scripts of 30 pills a year.  My doctor has referred me to a psychiatrist who I see tomorrow and she will be managing my psych meds from now on not my medical doctor.  I wasn't even going to post this but I might have a better shot at getting something that actually works for me on more of an ongoing basis because I feel pretty crappy now!! Thanks for any advice.   holy shit 90 month! I know that's something you worked up to but yeah.  I've suffered from anxiety and depression my whole life and been on anti depressants most of my life which has been documented.  I have a feeling the one I am taking now isn't doing much but when I took the ativan I was scripted I felt a lot better. I was only taking 1 pill a day, 1 mg.   are you getting your lorazepam prescribed on an ongoing basis? I have been able to get about 3 scripts within a year for 20 pills but I cannot get an ongoing thing.  Doctor says that it's not a med that can be taken more than a couple weeks at a time.  it's really frustrating!!   100 mg methadone daily for several months after maybe 5 years of any opiate I could find.    about 7 more of what you have in your hand   guess not   ha i'm on the same exact dose and have gained some weight as well so i'd like to know the same question!   smoke it off aluminum    It has to do with street racing.   ok cuz I mean I know several people that have been on drugs like xanax valium and other benzos for years so when the doctor told me that people don't take this for long periods of time kind of got me a bit mixed up   is your roommate's dad a toddler?   yes this is what I am doing. I was just a bit surprised when i heard my doctor say that benzos are only for short term use?     i do take them when needed like if i am more anxious than normal that day or if i feel like a panic attack is coming.  I don't just pop them like when i wake up like a lot of people do with certain pills that you need to do everyday.     That's how I'm taking it on an emergency basis not everyday   Well I don't take it everyday. Usually if I am about to have a panic attack or if I'm really anxious   I just got a new primary care doctor. I am currently on paxil (12 years) and ativan probably a few months. My new doctor has no problem keeping me on the paxil but hesitantly scripted me some ativan and said that is not a medicine to be taken long times. She is referring me to a psychiatrist to go over my meds and possibly change them. I have a feeling its to get me off ativan.  I never heard anywhere about it being used only short periods of time.  I feel like um being tricked into giving up my meds. Anyone have any advice!?!? Thanks!   Lol wow that's crazy I was a huge drinker during my early 20s then I quit cold turkey. It was stupid. Soon after that I got into opiates more than I did when drinking a ton I guess to fill a void.  Point of my story is when drinking I was an embarrassing sloppy obvious mess. On opiates nobody could tell a thing.   and have a great job and no money ever.......... so fucking depressing!!   yeah i would think that its a tight rope to walk!!  a lot of these folks work in offices so long sleeves :) plus it depends how far you are into your addiction- if your so far gone you can't play it off and maintain 9-5 seeming sober than you probably won't last to long ha.   it looks different all the time but that doesn't constitute weather its going to be bad or good.  smelling like vinegar is a good thing but not a sure thing    I think the DEA is trying to make people use heroin by tightening up the regulations and restrictions when it comes to controlled substances (mainly opiates).  As someone who used to personally have a decent script for opiate painkillers I was eventually cut off for no reason other than being told that the DEA is watching very closely now and bye bye.  No mention of my body and what I will do now to combat my pain.  So what'd I do?  Go to the street and get heroin  I am just 1 person so I am positive this has happened to many many people already and its just the start.  I am on methadone now because I don't like the junky lifestyle and hustling every single day, waiting on you dealer, getting bad cut drugs, legal risk, robbed, beat up, dying, etc.  I feel that being on methadone right now is the best option right now but it will never touch how well I had it before. I never expected to have my script pulled out from under my feet like it was.   I know "normal" people that use and sell heroin.  If you didn't know that they did, you'd have no clue based on their appearance and lifestyle.    jump out in front of a car (preferably a bus).  success.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bEobVhqaCk   have em shipped!!   its in california   food maxx   dude i found it at target less than 6 months ago!!   they're out there. ohh yeah they are out there!! you just gotta search.   LOLLLLLLL  UAF!?!?!?!?!  i am gonna have to accomodate that one into my vocab   yes. i was just at the pharmacy lookin in and thought that.   Yeah makes sense they should of bounced but possibly just were in shock as to what was going on and just went into the fetal position and didn't move kind of like a fight or flight thing lol   yeah the r.i.c.e. thing works but if you are like me and your ligaments are all strecthed out and shot there is really not much to do about it hah.  I even will wear the the braces if I go on like a hike where I know i'll be walking over a lot of rocks or potential shit that I would roll my ankle on.   saw it last night. kinda weird watching it since I am from only 20 mins away from where they shot it and skate at that skatepark all the time.  I never go to oakland at night tho.   i'm in a similiar situation. been skating since i was a little kid and my bad spots (every skater has at least one) are my ankles.  I used to blow them out all the time so damn badly that I bruised up to my sock line and down to my toes.  I went to a podiatrist and he recommended surgery but I don't really want to do that now since I am still relatively young.  I still skate but I always wear these good ankle braces I found at Walgreens. They have hard plastic around the brace and they lace up.  Really good support.  You should check em out if you still have wobbly ankles.   and it's only going to get worse with the doctors being scared of the DEA. That was the main excuse to me from my doctor when she cut me off my meds.   Being a young male puts you in the toughest situation to legitamitely obtain pain meds from a doctor.  I know this from my own personal experience.    lol i had those. circas.   she is a high end hooker?!?!   dude just go to the TL   fo sho indeed!   OK cool I think its a good idea because most movies keep getting repeated.   Wow so damn weird I was just literally watching this with my mom. Ended about 20mins ago   Someone(we) shouldmake a list of movies by now since this thread seems to pop up almost every week it could be a list that we keep adding on to periodically as well   Not too much of a difference but it did make me just a bit calmer and made the done last linger.  I don't plan on taking .more than 1 at a time.   He does look pretty ass now that mention it   Yay budlight lime   Yeah I just tried 1 mg ativan with my dose   ok yeah i'm not thinking that I'm in for a great trip haha   I have some Ativan lying around and I have tried that.  I am just hella scared because literally everyone I talk to says they had a friend die from that combo.   Yeah the only nausea I've gotten from opiates was just regular vicodin and I was in a car. I feel that im on way too much for  being able to feel the kratom   I'm registered over there.!   OK well yes I am familiar with opiates but never tried kratom . Just wondering almost if the methadone will make the kratoms effect lessen.   I am on methadone.  Just wondering if its even worth doing since I don't drink yet would liketo be able to have something with friends or at a party.   My NP was giving me 120/10 everyweek   I was eventually able to work upto 120 Norcos a month just thru my regular doctor    Yeah its weird like that but everybodys block off point is different.  I still do it like once a month just because of loving the ritual of doing it.  But weird you brough up take home cause i'm finally going to get me first soon just signed out all the paperwork.   Never   Hah I've done that on several movies where I go to watch it and I am already part way through the movie and didn't even realize that I started watching it before   Haha   Zero. Oxy or bth but can have em since I'm on methadone.   Man fuck this war on drugs bullshit   yeah im talking about the pills/crooked docs that i thought were fairly well erradicated from Florida.   did you get this on the westcoast?  the stuff i've been getting lately is pretty good.   M3s are badass   so I guess there still is hope in Florida?? Haha   I thought Florida cool down on all that stuff in the last couple years since the doctors got busted at least most of the pain clinics were shut down right?   it was a 1987 BMW 325 i with a stick shift. I think it had an inline 6 cylinder which is pretty big for that small of a car. Super fun to drive.   Haha sorry sir I am not on top of my internet game today. I read some of that guide but honestly just skimmed over it. I've been super distracted/ busy today so nothing I read stuck with me.   I got in the same exact accident you did but I was in the position of the other driver.  I was the one who came out on top so my insurance covered it.  They totalled my car and that was the thing that upset me the most.  Car wasn't worth a whole lot but was fun as hell to drive .   what do i do. huh?   that's what I meant as in drug tests.  it might, might not. google!   go to the bb forum    I can't agree more!!  When things started to get rough with money and as my tolerance was building I was in straight up hustle mode for I'd say a bit longer than a month, but looking back at it, that time felt like six months.  It was the same thing everyday: wake up and hopefully have something left in the house to get me going then it was off to try and make as close to $100 because I'd usually like to get as much as I could at a time. I'd makey money mainly scrapping metal or recycling but where I live those methods aren't extremely efficient due to people recycling there own shit to make money themselves and just lack of finding .material to scrap.  I cannot see how people can do that shit for like 10+ years but I see them at the clinic I go to.   Sure that they aren't sterilized?   Yeah there is: more cough syrup. Go buy some or check around the house.   I can't say I've never used it.    Either of those won't show up as a benzo if you were wanting to know that. Hydroxyzine is like benydryl. Ironic since I just got prescribed these a couple days ago    When I tried to quit, the first time I tried suboxone and it just didn't hold me over enough.   After giving up and going back to using again I wanted out for good so I tried methadone. I was worried at first since I thought that if this doesn't work I have no other options.  Well I am in MMT for about 3 months and I and pretty happy with the results that methadone has given me.  I could write a ton more about it and answer more technical questions if you or anyone starting or about to start cares to pm me.   Ah OK thanks!   Ok well the ones I was finding at the nursery weren't even of the papaver somniferum strain.  I found some in the store for cooking but all they said were ingredients: poppy seeds.  lol now more info.   Well its really random how they do it so there isn't much a way around it ha.  Just use right after you have been tested is the best way.  Hey i'm not even a subscriber here!  Never knew you had to subscribe or anything but I just tend to post in opiates more than any other subreddits. Is it recommended to subscribe?    	85
 He was diagnosed 1 month ago and given anti-depressants after feeling low for a few months (which has been happening now and then for four years but he has never been to the doctors). When he was diagnosed he told me he needed space to sort his head out and for me to not talk to him for a few weeks, no-contact.  I obliged and after 1 week he said he didn't like the thought of me being upset and it was all he could focus on so we decided to start texting again and he came and saw me, but he said he didn't know if he wanted to see me again for a while.  I then saw him that weekend for about two hours, and have seen him once a week since then usually for a night and a few hours the next day. He actually seems completely normal and happy when I have seen him which is nice, we laugh like we always do. Good things are happening with his job and he is doing really well and has applied for a promotion.  I am not seeing him throughout the week, and he has not come round to see my family in months - I have gone to see his. He has forgotten our anniversary and I gave him a card but he didn't get me one or offer to pay for the dinner we reluctantly went out for (something he would usually offer on our anniversary). He has been going on nights out with his friends.   I feel constantly on edge and nervous he's going to stop speaking to me or going to decide he can't see me. I think I'm having a hard time thinking that the depression has caused the way he has been acting because when I see him he is normal and excited about his job and just not different.  We haven't had sex for about 7 weeks because of the depression and now the anti-depressants have taken away his sex-drive. When we do see eachother we cuddle and it's nice but it's not the same intimacy and I don't know when his sex-drive is going to be back...  I am really struggling with knowing what to do, I miss him and feel so so lonely even though he is in my life, and because I feel like this I want to confide in him but I can't.  I have have such high anxiety levels at the minute, little things keep getting to me.  This all may sound selfish but it's just hit me how down I have been for the last month doing everything on his terms and praying he feels better and wants me in his life still.   	1
 STELLLLLLLAAAA!!!   CANTSTANDYA! CANTSTANDYA!   I've never had a tinder myself but my buddy has shared a couple interesting stories with me. So back story, there's a college near where I live and this friend would come down on the weekend, find a girl on tinder that was from the college and go perform the deed with her. On one occasion he went over and started chilling with her friends in the dorm room and whatever, after awhile the friends left and him and the tinderella(stolen from another part of this thread) began hooking up. At the end of the performance, she wanted him to finish in her mouth, after he did, she looked him dead in the eyes and winked. He said he didn't know how to react and it was both awesome/awkward. Another story involved him going and picking up a tinder slut from the college and bringing her back to the spare bedroom that my friends and I had in the house we shared. Since he had brought her back after my other roommates were asleep they had no idea there was a girl in the spare bedroom. My roommate busts in the room at around 7am with them both butt naked and yells HEY BRIAN!!!!!" to see both Mr. Tinder and Ms. Tinder in all their nakedness. Made for some good stories before he found his SO.      Forgive People   We had somebody in college who would poop all over the common bathroom and the write The Poopster was here" in his own feces on the mirror. He disappeared for awhile until one night when we saw The return of the Poopster" written on the mirror. The Poopster was never apprehended.   Thanks OP! Got mine shipped for $60.82, I told myself that is buy these if they went down to the $50-$60 range, this should be my last S/S item I needed.    There's a bar near where I live that makes every person who has a hat on backwards turn it around and if they refuse then they are kicked out. Apparently one time they had someone with a backwards hat on start a fight so now everyone who wears their hat backwards is looking to fight. Makes no sense.   Thanks man, good find, I was really wanting a sea stripe sweatshirt and was able to get one. You got an upvote from me.    Here's a canvas leather belt, I don't actually own it but I've been thinking about buying it for awhile and I think they might still be having some good sale or something. http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=941520042 locale=en_US kwid=1 sem=false vid=1 sdReferer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gap.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-belts.jsp   The exact point where you move from conscious to unconscious when falling asleep, there has to be a certain point where you switch over and I just can't grasp when or why that happens. By the way never think about this while trying to get to sleep because you'll be up all night.    A guy I know drove the opposite way while heading back to his hometown. Was supposed to be driving west and actually drove 2 hours east and ended up at the beach. In the same trip he also ran out of gas because he wanted to stop at the same gas station he always stops at on his way home. This was last year and he had a GPS and Smartphone. Also, he once told us that he wouldn't ask the bank to send him a new debit card because he didn't trust the mail, when we asked him how the bank received a debit card to give him at their building he said I thought they just had a machine to create them in the back." Another time, he attempted to do a backflip off the side of an in ground pool and busted his face on the side of the pool, this guy is a huge guy and stated that the chances of me hitting my face on that pool were astronomical." There are more examples but I'm starting to feel bad.    If you can find it on sale ever, Dolce Gobanna The One is my favorite cologne, smells amazing.  	13

 I got bitten by a kangaroo yesterday.   I've never been bitten by a shark.     I feel sick watching it.  So much laughter.    Some seats at a circus collapsed, injuring tens of people.       Pig dogging. Unbelievably, disgustingly cruel and dangerous.    Edit: I am not against hunting for the most part.     There is.  But we use last night instead   When they move back home at 26 and are currently lying in bed with their cat and browsing reddit.    Ugh! Those wide-nostrilled freaks!   I think we'd have found other things to discriminate people for and nothing would be too different.    Not as tiny as some, but about 800 people    Hahnforf :)   Eyre Peninsula.    I'm lucky enough to have never really had much to fear.  But the other day I stupidly took a small car on a dirt road after rain,  it was SO slippery, I got bogged twice,  I was no where near any houses and had no phone signal. My heart rate got up to 115. It was pretty scary,  doesn't compare to these other stories though.     Tiny town in South Australia    Well, actually, both testicles and ovaries.    I always pronounced it My-a until I met my friends daughter May-a so I mostly pronounce it that way now.     "It's me, Mario!"   I agree, but particularly with young children, robots might struggle the bonding, caring side of teaching.     What every girl really wants to hear   Teachers. More to do with the relatability and emotional bonds.   Kind of wish they would.  I loath the majority of politicians in Australia right now.    On your porcelain throne?   Toy Story 2 is the clear winner   And they have different teats for each joey with a different milk for each joey they have (strong, high protein and fat for young joeys and weaker for large joeys)   I never knew this. I'm going to give pens and paper to kangaroos and test this out.     I live in a rural areas a know many farmers, there are some who view kangaroos as pests and put up fences and shoot them.  And there are some that don't think of them as pests and don't even have fences and definitely don't shoot them and have no problems with crop damage.    These people are from the same area,  they very likely have the same numbers of kangaroos on their properties. The 'pest' label is largely based on opinion from what I can tell.    Edit: there are no reliable studies to show that kangaroos are pests.    Dad   Cups   Of   Emo stage.  At the time I denied being one, but I was. ..:(   Spiders are animals. :)  Once a brown snake chased me and my cousins.  Our Nanna saved us but I was sure we were dead for a few moments.

I was just considering buying nude by nature but I think I'll stick with what I know works for me.     Did you check if it had a pouch young?     Its a macropod, kangaroos such as the red or grey kangaroos are also macropods.    Public breastfeeding wouldn't be a controversy.    I definitely think the regulations are part of it.  I know a few people who have tried adopting but given up and decided on fostering instead. They give up because it can take years and years to get through all the assessments and paperwork and money and then still not have any certainty of adopting.    Yeah,  like you said,  just instinct i guess. I doubt they're ever taught it somehow.    The mother kangaroo licks a path to the pouch to make it easier for the joey to navigate, and she stays still throughout the process.   A lady i know who has kangaroos found a joey on the ground right after it was born,  she popped it in the pouch and it survived but I'd assume there are plenty that aren't so lucky.   Edit to add : the joey this lady found had the cord wrapped around its hands so it wasn't able to grip the fur.     They do use them to walk with part of the time... but yeah, I'm amazed at how muscly they get.     I might be wrong,  that's just what I've been told they are.     What would be a better alternative?     I think the worst spider we have is the golden orb spider, because they build their webs at night in the middle of walkways, I've had too many smack into my face after I've walked right into them in the dark.    But they aren't aggressive, i don't know if they're venomous, they run off as soon as they're disturbed    Weird.  I didn't know they gave magic weather detecting powers. Til.

Turns out rooting was putting the hair on. .. but I now feel extra creeped out by these dolls.    thank you!  I need to keep telling myself that I wont be perfect straight away (or ever, we all make mistakes), I keep imagining myself doing something wrong on the first day and being banned from teaching forever, which I know is stupid, but it fills me with such anxiety that I can't breathe.    I'm hoping I will be too distracted with everything to worry at all.    Hahaha magpies. They're great.  My mum has one that whines and barks like a dog.

Kiiind of like McClaren Vale   A girl i know was faking a pregnancy, i reverse searched the ultrasound pictures she posted and found they were originally from 2006 (this happened last year).

She then 'miscarried' because she 'had breast cancer'   I call them toasty toasties... pretty popular term for them in SA I've found   I have never heard of jaffles before.

Its so smooth   Hi all,   I'm just wondering it there are any other teachers/pre-service teachers here with anxiety? I am starting my first week of placement next week and am getting pretty bad anxiety thinking about it. It's something completely new for me and I don't know how to deal with it.   I will be working in a kindy (pre-school) with kids aged 3-4, a good age I think, which will make things easier, but I'm still worried.   any advice or stories from others in this situation would be very much appreciated! thank you   Cute! But it looks more around 8months old.    aww, this made me sad. poor kid.    dont all toilets have that?    that had me slightly confused too. Diagnoxis.    I don't really care that people self-diagnose, they can do whatever they want with their lives. But when they call years of intense study and practice 'training', they're going to far.       playground for grown-ups with a coffee shop in the centre.    Morialta has some semi-challenging tracks. Dogs are allowed as far as i can remember.    That's pretty much my thoughts too. Australia isn't perfect but we do a lot of things so much better than the US.    Homeless doesn't always equal sleeping on the streets. It can be couch surfing, living in cars/ tents etc., squatting, constant moving from place to place. So you aren't likely to see these people, but they definitely exist    Sadly true a lot of the time   That's hard, a lot of people are instantly turned off certain issues because of bad advocates. Like feminism being ruined by feminazis and now so many people just don't take it seriously anymore and its probably impossible to change their minds.   I think that just going about it gently and patiently. Do what you can and be proud of that.  Its good to be passionate and want to make a difference.    Yep. It was a song by some x-factor winner i think.  Awful awful song.     Joe Simpsons is pretty impressive   " Joe, who survived the fall but fell into a largecrevasse, manages to lower himself further into the dark abyss despite his broken leg and find an exit leading to the base of the mountain.

Don't be rude or judgemental.   Don't say your opinion is the right one or the best one.   Talk about stuff in casual and friendly conversation or polite debate.   Don't take every opportunity you get to advocate for whatever it is,  or people will get annoyed/ bored with it.   Bring it up in appropriate places and at appropriate times.  Be understanding of why others don't feel the same as you.   Don't be forceful.  Be honest.    It was so loud.  I thought it hit the house.  And it was just a one off thing,  quiet for the rest of the night.      Just some thunder. Very loud, shake the whole of Adelaide thunder, but just thunder.    Kangaroos make a screeching/ coughing noise when they're lost (usually joeys calling to their mothers) or cross. And they have two clucking sounds one for friendly hellos and one as a pre-attack warning.    So close.  So frustratingly close    The Chinese are ruining our country    My dad is nearly 60 and is a truck driver,  he's extremely fit and has no health problems so he finds the work easy, but i do believe some of the men he works with have had health problems like heart attacks and strokes and they still continue driving.   	103

You do your all your own casting, stamping, machining, etc.  You assemble it yourself, and you lubricate it using oils that you press from seeds in a mill that you copied from another shop where you used to work.  You set up your own chemical laboratory to make the powder and the primer.  You go so far over budget that you can only giggle about it when they ask how things are going.  Finally, you put it all together, you point the gun at your foot, you fire; and then your boss walks in and tells you to shoot the other foot too.  You calmly explain to him why you're going to have to make another gun.  Perl: it'll take a very long time to find the trigger, and once you have found it, you will notice that there are in fact an infinite number of triggers, and that you have an infinite number of toes, and you'll never be able to decide which toe you will shoot with which trigger. And without making any decision, you'll eventually end up deprived of your legs.  C: You shoot yourself in the foot.    FORTRAN: You shoot yourself in every toe, slowly, one by one,   until all toes are used up. Then you read the next foot and   repeat the process. You will continue, even though you have   used up all the ammunition, because there's no routine for   exception handling.        PL/I: You use up all the system resources including the   off-line ammunition. DP and personnel management double their size, triple their budgets, buy four new mainframes and let the  old one drop on your foot.   Pascal: The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot.     Forth:  You shoot yourself through both feet with a single bullet since you are standing with one foot on top of the other.  Algol: You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket. The musket  is fascinating in aesthetic respects and the wound confuses the   young nurse in the first-aid room.        Modula-2: After discovering that you will never ever be able to   manage anything in this language you shoot yourself in the head.     Ada: If you're stupid enough to engage in this language the US   ministry of defense will kidnap you, put you in front of an   execution squad and command: Shoot at his feet!       C++: You incidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and   shoot all of them in the foot.  First aid isn't possible, as it   cannot be decided which instances are bit-accurate copies and which  only point to other ones: "Over there that's me."        Smalltalk: You are spending so much time playing with the graphics  and the windowing system, that your boss will shoot you in the foot,  take away your work station and has you coding Cobol on a   character-based terminal.        Lisp: You will shoot into the accessory, which holds the gun, that   you are using to shoot into the accessory....      Prolog: You try to shoot yourself in the foot, but the bullet,   which misses the target, ricochets into the gun which explodes in your face.      Visual Basic: You pay Microsoft an inordinate amount of money, then   they put a control right there on the button bar that shoots you in the foot.  If you don't like the implementation, fine - shoot your foot in  another language. But don't forget to buy WIN 2000 first.  Assembler You put the bullet over your foot and drive it in to the instep with a hammer.   Javascript You attach the bullet to every shoe and it fires into the foot as you tie the shoestring.

 I'm taking a wait-and-see attitude with VR. But, I think comparing this next wave of hardware to the early-90s stuff is a case of false equivalence. The tech is so much more advanced now, it seems silly to suggest it will fail for exactly the same reasons. If anything, the trajectory for VR in the 90s gives me some hope that these new platforms will be viable. Early VR was awful--it was ugly, clunky, uncomfortable/painful, and unimpressive. Even the people consuming it didn't really like it; they just wanted VR to be a thing so badly that they were willing to pretend it actually worked.  No one really enjoyed it, and yet it persevered for a number of years, and people kept trying to make it successful by pure force of will. Plunking quarters, dollars, whatever, into obnoxious gear that didn't actually work on any level.  Contrast that with today, where the new VR hardware is sleek, powerful, and evidently capable of actually producing a "virtual" experience. I haven't had an opportunity to try it yet, but I will accept Jeff's assertion that you have to try it to understand how well it works. And I would wager that the same passion for VR that propped up ridiculous hardware in the 90s still exists today. When that demand is met with a product that actually works as advertised, it could be a whole new ballgame.    Absolutely. Being an armchair cynic is easy. The proof will be in the pudding, in the end.   I have an Xbox One, and I think the backwards compatibility is good news. In particular, I'm excited to regain some of my XBLA library that I lost when ditching my 360. I no longer have any retail games to take advantage of it, but I'm sure other people do. No matter how you slice it, backwards compatibility is a good thing for the console. A feather in the cap.  Having said that, the question is 'how big of a feather?' I'm not sure how XB1 backwards compatibility is any different from Xbox 360 backwards compatibility. In both cases, it only works for certain games, and it ultimately seemed like kind of an afterthought on the 360. I have a feeling it will be similar on the XB1. Even if tons of games are enabled eventually, it's tough to get the public to really embrace something that doesn't work across the board. It confuses people, and it annoys those with games that aren't supported.   As I said, I'm happy to regain whatever XBLA games I can through this service. But, I'm not convinced it will be that much of a boon to Microsoft. I suspect it will be a positive, useful feature, but not a game-changer.   You must be in college.   So, I read another write-up on the game yesterday, and there is a limit on jump distance. Apparently, you have limited capability starting out, and you need to explore, trade, etc., to upgrade your ship and increase the distance you can travel. So I guess that explains it.  However, it still seems like meeting up with friends should be possible once both of you have upgraded sufficiently and are nearer the center of the universe.   Have you tried not adding so much to the meat? I learned about a year ago that the best burgers are seasoned only on the outside. The meat needs to be worked as little as possible. Once you mix in a bunch of stuff and mix it until uniform, you're basically eating meat loaf on a bun--not a burger.   It looks tasty, but I will pass on any burger that can't fit in my mouth. I don't understand the fascination with impossibly-tall burgers.   Is there a limit to how far you can warp? I recall the developer saying that all players are contributing to the same map. So, if it's a static map, and each planet has coordinates on the map, it seems as if I could give a friend those coordinates and we could meet up. Unless, of course, there is some limit on the distance you can jump, which I haven't heard about.   I don't understand why. Haven't they said the galaxy map is persistent? If so, why can't you just coordinate with your friend offline and agree to meet at a particular planet?   Or just buy the U.S. version. It's coming to both territories.   Gotcha. Fwiw, gameplay similarity and structure of the games is what I was focused on. I don't think that list of games is mechanically similar to Team Ico's games, with the possible exception of 'Brothers' or 'Limbo.'      Hmm. 'Brothers' and 'Limbo' were vaguely similar to Ico, not at all like SoC. And nowhere near as good as either, imo. I haven't heard of 'This War of Mine' or 'Toren,' but the remainder are not similar to Team Ico's previous games. At all.    Thanks for providing the list, though. It illustrates the lack of games competing in the same space. For my money, Team Ico has yet to be surpassed in the genre, much less "far" surpassed.   ...the game looks like it's been far surpassed by recent similar platformers.  Okay, fair enough. Name one.   Basically, the best answer is that the two previous games from this team were something genuinely special, for most people who played them. That's not a very satisfying answer if you haven't played them, but what else can people say?   It might help if you explain what you thought looked terrible. The visuals are obviously causing a stir, but none of the detractors say much of anything beyond "looks like crap" or "looks like 2009." I don't think either of those statements is true. My son is currently playing through the PS3 remaster of Shadow of Colossus (a 2011 game), and the LG demo looks much, much better than that. Now, it doesn't look like a game with bleeding-edge visual tech, that's true. But the demo looks good--no blurry textures, cool character modeling, detailed architecture, very sharp, running at a high framerate. Appreciation of visuals is subjective, but we can at least quantify some of it.  The gameplay is harder to comment on. It looks like a puzzle game, and puzzle games are hard to get excited about in a linear, 3-minute demo. They might have been better served by cutting together a trailer showing off various environments, mechanics, etc. But, what they showed was enough to get fans excited. People who have played the previous two games can look at what was shown and see potential for a really great game. More importantly, there was nothing about it that suggests anything other than another very special experience from this developer. Without that context, it's easy to understand why you might not be excited. It's a fool's errand for fans to try to change your mind, but hopefully, if LG ends up being another winner, you'll find a reason to give it some time and find something to enjoy.  	14

 Fair point.   You're seriously like the most helpful Redditor right now...    the director thought it was better than having a high schooler  The director doesn't understand the character well enough then. Peter Parker was a bit of a child prodigy, and while he's not quite on the level of Bruce Banner, Tony Stark, Reed Richards, or Charles Xavier, he *is* one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe.     Amazing Spiderman #18, from November of 1964.  So I guess I won't be picking *that* up at my local comic shop...   [They Might Be Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsAiCs66l40)  "Particle Man"  Which is lyrically similar to the old Spider-Man cartoon which started, "Spider-Man, Spider-Man, Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size, Catches thieves just like flies. Look Out! Here comes the Spider-Man!"   Technically, the "webs" from the symbiote are just pieces of the symbiote itself which it can regenerate over time. For example, when overextending himself with "webs," Eddie Brock-as-Venom was left partially exposed because there wasn't enough symbiote suit left to completely cover him.  The symbiote learned the composition of Spider-Man's webbing and was able to mimic it  http://spiderman.wikia.com/wiki/Symbiote_Costume   Iron Man is secretive about his tech because something on par with the latest Iron Man suits, especially if one used them to equip a small army, could potentially become a global threat, as in a dozen or so Iron Men could seriously take over the world.  A whole army of men with web shooters isn't nearly as dangerous. They have way more non-threatening potential uses than threatening ones.   In America, you can buy machine guns, flame throwers, and even a tank. I don't think commercially available web shooters would even be in the top ten of our concerns in terms of citizenry-owned weapons.   I don't remember the movie very well, but I'm going by the comics where he definitely invented them.    (no pun intended)  [With all due respect...](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dont_believe_you_anchorman.gif)   That doesn't make it any less useful for any of the applications I listed and more.

In 2004 and for a few years following he had organic web shooters which was probably an attempt to reflect 2002's blockbuster Spider-Man film. I'm not sure what the canon or real-world explanation is, but he went back to the mechanical ones after a few years.    It would make it much more difficult to maintain his secret identity between getting paid and IP protection  He could just give the schematics and formula to someone like Tony Stark or Reed Richards, have them patent it, and have their guarantee of the profits or at least a percentage.   When everyone has web shooters, no one does...    it's not any more than a kid without autism  As someone who worked in a school for children with Autism, many of whom lived on campus because their parents literally could not handle them, I cannot stress strongly enough how incredibly wrong you are.  Most parents don't have to live in fear of being viciously attacked, the acts of self harm, having constant supervision to make sure they don't eat something they're not supposed to, having to physically restrain your child so they don't hurt themselves or others, bolting, or a myriad of other autistic behaviors like low functioning "children" who are near adult age and can't wipe after using the toilet, *if* they make it in the first place.  [Here's one tiny example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_23z9yJAq0) These parents likely go through this and things like this multiple times a day.  Educate yourself before spewing such wanton ignorance. Such nonsense is a slap in the face to every parent who has had to endure raising a severely autistic child.   I can't even begin to imagine all the real world applications that webbing would have, from search and rescue teams, non-lethal force weapons for police and military, mountain climber safety, tracking and capturing wild animals without hurting them...    I would never call "That was Then. This is Now" a sequel of "The Outsiders."  *You* wouldn't, and that's fine, but it kind of is. It's got the same setting and even shares a few characters as I recall Ponyboy being directly involved.  You raise an interesting point, though. The concept of a "shared universe." S. E. Hinton does this as does Bret Easton Ellis, and there's got to be a better word for something than "spin-off" or "prequel/sidequel/sequel" for stories that take place in the same universe and may even feature some of the characters but aren't directly related to the other stories.   For example, both Marvel and DC Comics have numerous shared universes, but this month's issue of Batman isn't necessarily a sequel to this month's issue of Superman even if Batman's issue comes out after Superman's and even takes place chronologically directly after. If one's story doesn't impact the other's, it's not really a sequel, is it?   Except that monsters and ghosts are dismissed as obvious hoaxes yet nobody bats an eye at the talking dog...

I can try to get the original photo to confirm if you're interested.   Even the ones that are good... aren't. Like the unified Pixar theory everyone gushes about. What Pixar is actually doing is putting back references and future references (because they plan ahead) in their movies as fun Easter eggs for fans. Instead, people come up with this facacta theory piecing all the completely unrelated movies together as if each is a sequel or prequel to another in a long series, which is obviously not true if you give it an iota of critical thought.   It's also exactly like a lot of other weak theories that try to connect a similar actor, like Leonardo DiCaprio's characters from Titanic, Shutter Island, and The Great Gatsby are all the same guy.

We still have certain standards for radio voices now but it's more about projecting your voice and speaking clearly, rather than with a certain accent.

The metaphor is that Superman is a god and Batman doesn't believe in him, not that he doesn't exist, but that Batman doesn't believe him to be a god. It's not that Superman believes himself a god either; just that he's thought of as one for obvious reasons. Note the trailer with the statue and the cult of believers.   This meme has nothing to do with God or religion.   Irrelevant discussions.  1. There have been many, *many* interpretations of Batman in the comics alone. I couldn't begin to list everyone who has ever written the character, then there's the movies, television, animation, video games, etc. He exists in literally hundreds of continuities, canons, etc. The writer dictates their interpretation, and Batman has been portrayed as Christian, but he also been portrayed a non-believer.  2.

I can do this all day.  And how many native peoples have you actually met and talked to? I'm curious myself as an Indian, Moche tribe.  I'll repeat, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) You may well have met all 37% of the total number of native peoples who prefer "Native American," and that's dandy, but it does not argue my point that the term "Indian" is not offensive to most Indians. You've done nothing to disprove that point.   I expect we'll get it, and to be fair, the first actual DC Cinematic Universe movie was Man of Steel and is so far the *only* DC Cinematic Universe movie. Everything prior was its own separate canon.   That being said, I don't consider Man of Steel dark or brooding; it was simply as realistic and grounded as a Superman movie could possibly be. It was also made specifically as the set-up for Batman V Superman, which itself is the set-up for Justice League, so I consider it groundwork-laying more than a great narrative in and of itself. In other words, I don't think Man of Steel can be judged fairly until we better understand how it fits with the larger narrative.  If anything could be taken away from that film as the WB approach to comic book movies, it's doing them in such a way as to ask, "What if this was actually happened in real life?" whereas Marvel tends to more openly embrace the most comic book-y elements apologetically.   Naturally, some people prefer one method more than the other. I personally like both for different reasons, but I do solidly believe that Spider-Man 3 and Amazing Spider-Man 2 both managed to kill their respective franchises for the same reason; they were too over-the-top stupid for their own good.  You can definitely go too far in either direction.    Someone should notify Thailand's tourism industry that some people apparently hear "Thailand" and immediately think "pedophile."

I've used that phrase about a million times when defending my position on same-sex marriage, as in I don't care what consenting adults do so long as they're not hurting anyone.   WTF does "consenting adults" have to do with pedophilia?   Right, this theory is ignoring the fact that Gus paid for this man's education and paid him well. Combine feeling like you owe somebody with the Libertarian philosophy and you've got all the explanation you need.  Pedophile is a stretch.   I know how you feel. One risky click and I saw something I wish I'd never seen and it's like it's burned into my retinas or my brain. It's the kind of thing that makes me want to kill people. Well, certain types of people anyway...   Also, the Thai subtitles on the video are consistent with Gale's music choices which are demonstrative of his idiosyncratic and peculiar personality. He is a fan of foreign language music and apparently speaks fluent Italian. As an example, as he waters his plants in his apartment, he sings along with Quartetto Cetra's "Crapa Pelada." A jazzy song, the Italian lyrics of Crapa Pelada are a bit of a tongue-twister because of its incredibly fast tempo.   So I find it perfectly believable that on a trip to Thailand, Gale created a film version of himself performing a camp karaoke version of Peter Schilling's "Major Tom (Coming Home)." He also had a picture of himself on Mt. Everest which is less than 3,000 miles away.   Other possessions in his apartment included vintage cameras, a mask, a potato battery, a water pipe, a copy of Stephen King's *Everything's Eventual*, Jane Austen in *BOCA*, The Waverley Novels, *The Magnificent Activist: The Writing of Thomas Wentworth Higginson*, and *Fundamentals of Marxism Leninism*, which is odd for a Libertarian. His apartment also contains a pair of skis and a surfboard. He enjoyed drinking both coffee and tea. In Gales Lab Notes, along with the Heisenberg formula, he included a list of top ten recumbent bikes, a recipe for vegan s'mores, indoor composting tips, and a Far Side cartoon where the scientist is about to pop a paper bag behind the one working on the nuclear warhead.   I'm not seeing anything that suggest pedophile.    I'm pretty sure Gale is presented as a hardcore libertarian  [He straight up refers to himself as such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3bWEP0QDx8) before OP's line about consenting adults wanting what they want.   Dat method acting...   Fun facts (for anyone wondering):  The T. Rex comes from an adventure on "Dinosaur Island" (Batman #35, 1946); the penny was originally a trophy from Batman's encounter with a penny-obsessed villain named the Penny Plunderer (World's Finest Comics #30, 1947). Other "keepsakes" in the cave come from "The Thousand and One Trophies of Batman!" (Detective Comics #158, 1950). These three stories were reprinted in Batman #256.  Other pieces often shown in the Batcave include Two-Face's original coin, one of Deathstroke's swords, the shroud of the vampiric Monk, and over-sized ten-pins.  He has also had Fries' original freeze gun, a piece of Kryptonite, and old partner costumes.    If you like brightly-colored, jokey, fast-paced, explosion-filed punch-festivals with thin plots and nothing to have to think too hard about, Marvel movies exist. They're great, entertaining popcorn superhero flicks.  There's no point in having two different brands if they're just going to make the same movies.  I like the darker, more serious, more thoughtful tone of DC's movies. I'd rather watch The Dark Knight 100x than see Age of Ultron a second.

So by that logic, we could have a team called the Washington Slaves and use a strong, black cotton-picker in chains as the mascot and that would be okay because it's honoring the mighty, hard-working negro slave of American history, not the modern day black American.    Their mascot is offensive, and you could argue that naming a team after a ethnic group at all is in poor taste, but "redskins" is a racial slur whereas "Indians," though an obvious misnomer, is still popularly used by Native Americans and non-Native Americans alike.  In fact, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) It may have changed in the past 20 years, but I can't recall ever once hearing American Indians refer to themselves as "Native American."   I know you're being sarcastic, but if enough people of Scandinavian descent felt that way I'd be all for changing their mascot as well.  I'm one of those lunatic liberals who thinks real people are more important than sports iconography.    And why do people think addressing a small, easily handled issue means he/his administration aren't actively handling bigger, more complex issues? It takes a minute to make a statement like this. Meanwhile, dealing with shit like ISIS is ongoing.

Food photography can be excellent, but it's beyond clich these days to take a cell phone pic of your food even when it isn't visually interesting.    Reminds me of what Dylan said about Hendrix' version of "All Along The Watchtower."  Dylan has described his reaction to hearing Hendrix's version: "It overwhelmed me, really. He had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldn't think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to do it to this day."   In the booklet accompanying his Biograph album, Dylan said: "I liked Jimi Hendrix's record of this and ever since he died I've been doing it that way... Strange how when I sing it, I always feel it's a tribute to him in some kind of way."   It is an American thing.

"The first time [Nintendo's lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto] played with the controller, because hes working most of the time on Mario 64, he would have seen Mario 64 with it. It wasnt so much that controller dictated Mario 64, it was just that was the game he was working on. Mario was the way of testing it out. Probably more the other way around. The actual movement of Mario came from the N64 controller, the way you move the central stick."   Giles Goddard, Super Mario 64 programmer  [Source](http://pixelatron.com/blog/the-making-of-super-mario-64-full-giles-goddard-interview-ngc)  "I think thats a misnomer to say that the N64 controller was designed around Super Mario 64.

X-Force goes into one of the many post-apocalyptic futures in circulation and run into Deadpool.   too op pls nerf    His change throughout the first book is for the better. He's grown above what society made him and become what society could be.  The only part I would argue is that I believe he was *always* better. From the outset he knows he's being manipulated and hates it. From the very first violent encounter, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and of course, the people watching his every move *could* intervene, but they don't, and this recurs three more times.  When he's at the lake and Valentine visits, he's done. He's had it with everyone's shit and she has to talk him into saving a world he's not convinced is worth saving. He sees the military that's been manipulating him as his real enemy and refers to them as such. He always doubted that he was on the right side and never felt in control. Valentine later confirms this on Eros telling him that no one is really in control of their own destiny and that she has manipulated him and was manipulated herself.  The end of the book proves what he suspected all along and also proves that he has always wanted to do the right thing and will search the galaxy to do so. The bugger queen obviously knew he was pure of heart or she wouldn't have created the elaborate set-up for her infant queen based on what she saw in Ender's mind.  I see the story as being about an inherently good person who is too powerful a tool not to be misused. He's like some well-intentioned nuclear warhead that doesn't mean anyone any harm.    The follow up books are a thought exercise. A philosophical rambling  I've been known to enjoy those things as well...   From the moment the character was introduced I liked Bean and wanted more. Knowing that the Shadow series follows him, I'm definitely interested.   This is the 25th time.    they gave away the big twist pretty early in the movie  That's unconscionable! My jaw dropped when the book got there and I thought it was especially clever because I expected   ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***   the remaining pages to be filled with the *real* battle. I thought it was clever to leave so many pages toward the end of the book for exactly that reason so I never saw it coming. I wouldn't imagine the end would have nearly so much impact if that were revealed early-on.   I would have felt that way, but I thought they did a good job of trying to justify everything by the end of it, revealing motivations, weighing what "doing the right thing" actually meant,   ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***  finding out that the buggers not only weren't evil, but they were never even going to mount a third invasion because they realized they were fighting sentient life and would extend forgiveness and hope to be forgiven; they had no way of knowing.  Earlier parts of the book hinted that they might have just been wanting for a means of communication. Ender I think was likeable and did have a sense of morality in that he tried to understand and love them--he even used those words--and was used as a tool against them. He didn't even know he was killing them when he did. Hell, he never knew he was killing anybody at the time when he did. He felt bad about things. He was a good kid with a ton of talent who was used. So was Valentine. Disagree with Graff all day, but he thought he either was doing the right thing or else at least believed he was doing whatever was necessary.   As to why anyone was worth saving, Valentine speaks to that best of all when she's telling Ender that it's all these individual lives and relationships throughout the earth that they don't even know. The reader knows, because we're them. We're just regular people trying to live our little lives while psychopaths vie for power and risk the lives of everyone on earth over money, land, power, etc. On that note, I found it very relatable. Change the existential threats, rework the politics a skosh, and scale down the technology a little and you've got a fairly apt parable of what goes on in the real world today.   I still cannot believe how utterly enthralled I was during every battle session and even practice sessions... and there were so many! You'd think they'd get tiresome, but nope.   Also, in terms of a few "holy shit" moments that didn't seem the least bit gimmicky, I've read few books that pulled it off so effortlessly.

My food doesn't win awards, but when the contest is over the chefs and judges come to me for their meal. I have asked friends many times, What are the best fundamental dishes of your life? Invariably, their response goes back to food prepared by a mother, a grandmother, a father, an aunt, or some other relative or friend. A main ingredient of those preparations is the love with which they are prepared. Those early tastes remain with you for the rest of your life. I stole that quote from the article but it is true,and I have made a good living on this concept.      Thanks for the interest. http://www.chefknivestogo.com/takamura.html    http://www.chefknivestogo.com/mamigy21.html   If you have money they give you some drugs to ease your guilt,if not you go to jail and those are the ones you hear about.   HAHA!   Your dad is fucking with you.ps... your dad is awesome.   Anyone who posts stupid political propaganda on FB,it used to come in my e-mail years ago and i had to nasty-gram the dumb fucks!   Catch EM and Kill Em, I say. these sick fucks have been around for centuries, have their own secret societies, and are so entrenched that they are accepted in politics,religion and money circles.   Free pussy!         you get the day off and everyone talks good about you for a week or so.   Try Jersey.    Humbly glad to offer my services.   Whenever we get a new one I like to put it on my head and staat talkin all rasta mon!   Look at the bright side,if you marry the girl you will always have something to hold over your annoying mother in law!   I live in a tourist town and every summer I see these douche bag families...Red Hummer with custom wheels parks in 2 spaces,plastic hair fake tan designer dad gets out followed by giant phoney boob Peg Bundy over the hill street walker edition mom, and of course the tween age daughter is dressed like they are trying to sell her on the Arab sex slave market.People actually raise their kids like this! FTW!   If I were the leader of a religious chef cult, this picture would be on the cover of my pamphlet about where good chefs go when they die.   I,m sure youtube has something about that.   No it's not, this is how city folk raise their kids now days. Makes me sick.   http://www.chefknivestogo.com/takamura.html   Thats a new one for me,thanks!   http://www.chefknivestogo.com/takamura.html   Yep! Otb edge razor cuts the loose ends of my hair and shaves translucent slices from a free standing tomatoe, mabey just a bit of stropping after a few weeks.   Takamura.   Sweet!

 This is actually so badass.         I'm gonna like this sub.         Get your dog some chew toys, man!      Someone call the Olympics. Tell 'em it's canceled. I already won!   Bullshit, it was a minor correction at best   Screw you dude, she winked at me   Username checks out    Add some color, get a wall paper and some fake or real plants and as someone else said have some height variation. Give the eye many places to look at and avoid symmetry.   Your puns are not welcome in our country   The math checks out   Sounds like a pro if you ask me...god dammit, I need to get back to work.       OP will deliver...      TRUST! HIM!   http://m.imgur.com/gallery/xgz9nkR   OP we're worried!   Don't tell me what to do   It explodes when it hits the fire. I mean come on, it explodes. Explodes...   Idk...   "You can't reason someone out of an opinion they didn't reason them self into" -some redditer in a tread I forget   OP will deliver   Hi qua- wait, god dammit    Thanks, the river turned out great, I'm glad you like it. I'm getting some more fish soon and I think your right with the white rocks. They stand out too much that it takes away from looking at the fish. All I need now is some more fish!   A wall paper I put as a background, thought it looked kinda fish themed. It's weird but it's better than seeing cables and wires.   Right now I just have fake plants in there but once the tank is established and I have more fish in there maybe I'll swap some props with real plants. I'll have to do more research on it though.   Thanks! I'm getting some more fish soon, I just need to get the chemicals right and let the bacteria build up to keep up with more ammonia from more fish. I'm still very new to fish keeping so I don't really know what kind I want but I have a great local store which will give me some great fish next time I'm there.   10 gallon tank Only 2 fish in there right now, Skirt Tetras. I'm still getting the water right. http://imgur.com/fEJTuAB http://imgur.com/L9LfWbh http://imgur.com/DpsUQ0d http://imgur.com/xZJawFt http://imgur.com/OpDqMCb http://imgur.com/6BRcufh http://imgur.com/uvZWNSI      I hear what your saying, I just don't think it's right to point out that wings progress may not be as good as everyone is making it out to be. He's still making a lot of progress and kicking ass while doing it.      His cheek bones look more prominent and he's much happier. We should stop focusing on how much weight he's loosing but rather that he is making an active effort to make a lifestyle change and needs our love and support. Who cares if Woody may have cherry picked a bad and good photo to use, they are giving their moral support and that's what matters.   He wrestled in high school and college, you can look it up pictures of him. You would think you were looking at a young Mike Tyson.   It was hard to see unnamed man go :'(  	39
 Hi everybody! I downloaded the latest update last night and i was playing through the game when all of a sudden it just froze. My car froze and the road disappeared like in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2eByv8odws. Also while i was driving through Castelleto the buildings and road starting disappearing and the game froze again. Is anybody else having this problem? Any tips to fix it? Thanks!   	1
 No, not on purpose. Although the new versions since Orbit got ahold of them are numbered.  Ah yes, the "no recap" thing. Man, I might be the only person in the world, but I can't stand recaps. No matter how subtly they're squeezed into a story, I always end up turning the page and saying, "yeah, no shit, I just read that." So I decided to write mine almost like one big story that had been cut up. Now, you're not the only person that finds that annoying, so maybe I'm the asshole here. That's quite possible. Something for me to think about in future works.  It wasn't a hard decision to end it at all. In fact, it wasn't really a decision. I had intended to end it at three books. But about halfway through the third book I realized there was no effing way I was finishing this big of a story (because it was very big in my mind) in the pages I had left. So then I just wrote until the story was done. Which ended up being six books.  The current covers are not me. The previous covers when I was self-publishing? Yes, those are me.  Thanks for reading!   Hahaha! I dunno, there may come a time when he needs to be resurrected...   I'm glad you found me! I love getting cross-genre interest!  You know, I actually tend to take aspect of people that I like and fuse them into my villains, because I just think that's more realistic.  The only real exception to this would be Jerry, because he was just a picture of every worthless politician out there.  	3

Nvm I'm retarded   CLOUD9 BACKDOORS ARE NOT READY FOR THE PEKE \#PREPAREYOURANUSNA   Thanks to everyone replying! Got a few hours I can fill right now :)   Thank you! Will check those out now   Would love to, but haven't got the time to do so :/   That is 1 title..:v   As the title says, please say wich game(s) you liked best and I'll watch those! Thanks!   I'm dissapointed  EDIT: NVM! OP got both, happy days   I never said bomb them. I'm talking about an intervention coordinated by the international community (NATO by example), not just the US.  We've seen that their method does not work, however, it's getting pretty obvious that something has to be done because the situation over there is getting out of hand, human rights being violated left and right..   No matter how gruesome, this should be everywhere. People have to know what's going on and realise that just watching it happen is not the way to act.  Fuck Russia and China btw, preventing the entire international community to intervene with political and economical pressure.   I still don't see the problem..   I think this is one of those people that actually clicks their skills instead of using hotkeys. Anyway, cringed   This is no fun on acid :(   Where's the EG option?   \#Istillbelieve   It's almost impossible but try to imagine that that's you, trying to deal with the sudden passing of your mother, dealing with all the questions. Newt thing you know, there's this kid making fun of you and of her.. Knowing me, I'de be in prison, I wish I could say I have the self-control but I don't..   The baby was born with abnormaly large feet, making the pre-purchased shoes unusable. I want to believe..   Say whatever you like, the kid can rap and has probably made more money now, age 24, then you (or me for that matter) ever will. So he must be doing something right..   True, but that one has lots of alternatives on somewhat the same level, sites like google and reddit are quite unique in my opinion.   That, or for papers due tomorrow   Good answer! A site I use so much and consider so normal that I haven't even considered, but losing it would indeed suck   Stupid as it may sound, my answer would be Facebook. I hardly ever check it for more then a minute but just knowing I can contact all my friends pretty easely (even when I haven't heared them in ages) if I need to is so convenient. Also, birthdays! Knowing me, I wouldn't remember more then 5 a year..   Perhaps better to exclude reddit since I assume alot of people would answer this.   I actually have red particles for him, there was a guide on how to do it posted back when he was released, I'll update when I can find it!   Cats are assholes. Love em   How on earth can you call players like Wickd, krepo, snoopeh and yellowpete 'trash'? Yes, they have their bad games, everyone does. I personally have seen lots of improvement troughout the last season and they ended 4th in the LCS. Trash? Gl in your series to bronze 2 or whatever it is you play in  /rant   I love me some trashtalk but damn, talk about kicking a man when he's down.. Anyway, ggwp Vulcun good luck at worlds   cheers!

Especially because, in this way, it would be alot easier for people from all over to come and join in, even some of us living in Belgium. *hint hint*   This is the reason it got me angry, if he stopped and considered the pro/contra's or the risks, there's no way he would of done this.

 This makes little sense to me   Scantily clad girls simulating sex with pool toys      just curious    To become a voice actor    So im trying to get my main character to fight a monster for a coming of age story how does one get fights to happen?  thank you in advance   my local game store, and for dropping 8oz of mercury on the floor   any help would be awesome      So i am D.M.ing a game in Gotham city, where my players are police and other Gothamites, and though i have found a few decent songs for the world i was wondering if this fine community would be willing to offer some suggestions, also any thoughts on what system to use for said game would be very helpful    Victor tzass with a tweaked back story   Watch out for the nhk I think is what its called.

 Lol, that's what went through my head.   Oh, cool Capitol Hill in Seattle is all good, then?    Seriously, what do people thin nk they can do when a whole chunk of the country decided to collapse in 15 minutes. Linda, you got the extra bottles water, right?    So it appears you're a redditor. What was it like reading all the comments when it blew up on here the other day?    No. Really?    What episode?    Yes. But watching an old person eat is far more disgusting than watching a baby eat.   Amen I not gay no more. I love a women.    That you? Good stuff.    Is he actively still living there?    Been attacked by yellow jackets one (stung about 20 times) and bald faced hornets once (stung about 10 times)   Those bald faced ones were no fucking joke.    If they are threatened they do.    I'm backing out. Stay well my friends.    Hills bro. Hills.    Explain.    The dishes are done, man.    I tore his ass...apart.   He ordered a chardonnay what was I supposed to say?    Responsive how so?    Thru aren't being forced.    Whos taking custody?    I concur.    Ya dude crazy.    An *enormous* infant.    Would you like a hand job?    You gotta take them off every once in a while though.    not me but maybe my buddy.    haven't heard that story in a while. thanks for bringing it up again.    Russian Bears. Not even once.   when I lived in Seattle it seemed pretty chill...then again I lived on Capitol Hill.   *this is rock and roll*   for science   okay how the fuck did you do that on mobile?   oh snap thats the first I've heard. Good shit.   cut the cord about 2 months ago now and I am totally not noticing it at all. My tv barely even gets turned on unless it's something I want to really watch but I am a solid Walking Dead fan and of this past first season of Better Call Saul I can't wait for those ones.    I don't get it.    Sheryl Crow?    When you scroll using the arrows is it super glitchy?    Perfect.   Beads?    The one by the eBay campus?    The black guy with the reefer joint by the piano probably playing jazz?   Come on!    Damn darkies with there reefer and jazz.    Are they from Jamba Juice?    You from Mystic?    Stephen Colbert drops his hat in the ring.   WILDCARD BITCHEEEES!    Paging Dr. Herman    Jon Mayer masturbation?    No, it wasn't.    He lost what?    Man I miss my 240   Jesus did I write this?    Same boat as you. Still use alien on my ipad though. Dont really care for the tablet version of it.    I started with alien blue on my ipad years ago and then when I got my first smartphone shortly thereafter I went with Android. Been using bacon reader ever since. I just wish I could get modmail notifications.    Rip in peace /u/xjtsx for a few weeks.    Great one. I think I've watched the gang gets trapped about 5 times.    I live in Connecticut how the dick did I miss this?    My dad too. It was in 93 I think. Division bell tour maybe.    Mulva?    You mean how do they give themselves sore throats?    So, 9 colleges would touch it with a ten foot pole?    Uh I recall everyone in Seattle using that word 20 years ago.    You don't have commercials where you live? Sweet.    I cut cable last month. Don't miss it at all. THE was really the only reason I ever kept it anyway. Who knows what I'm gonna do this upcoming. Omg season. :(   Rape Silly. That's my jam.    They revisit that scene in like season 8 or something. Hilarious shit.   It's the summer of George    How did that person get away with not along a question?    Seth Greeeen?    Headline News is...on.   BaconReader all the way.    What's so special with alien blue? I use baconreader and got rid of ads for like 2 bucks.    Outlook sucks. I don't get how it can be so bad    How can she...    Ooh link?    Oh, everyone is still okay and able to drive?    Great. Now reddit can get back to...normal?   How so?    Yall loved Alexis recently, right?    He was a dentist.    what has changed? Explain.   why? Do you know something that I don't?    we didn't do shit...well we...no we didn't do shit.   reason being?   according the userbase who seems to know why she was fired because...well...who knows.    fairly certain it will all be forgotten in a month.   Hi. Is your name Ryan and how little is your shirt and how little is your little payants?   crackwhoreconfessions.com?  lol   story time?  -USA  We love you. You just met an asshole.   your site is cool.   a lot of vodka, a low bank account and access to cocaine...on a work night.    when he forgets to finish the word wish?   no, it's a repost.   its a repost   I wonder if Mildred will make a comeback at some point.    Sea Change-Beck  how is there not a single Beck album on here. Shame on you, reddit.   CHiPs   I can only speak for where I have lived (which is outheastern ct) but I have also spent plenty of time in most corners of the state. I find it affordable and it's close to things I love (the sound/rivers/kayaking/fishing etc) so of course I am biased.   It's just in good proximity for me to the three cities (NY/Boston?Providence) and also good beaches in Rhode Island. I've lived from Chester down to Old Lyme and over to Niantic.   When it comes to crime it's really not an issue set aside some random weird shit.  What is your price range? Moving with wife and kids?    anecdotal, yes. Couldn't you say the same for people born with mental issues who go on to do horrible disgusting things to people?   ;)    When he cries while watching The Notebook. I literally couldn't even.    Nobody is there, sorry.    It's because they all know he's a sister lover.    So Penn and Teller were playing stupid.    anyone?   explain.   This sub is for the TV show Parenthood.    Ms Maggie McGill    Sea Change- Beck   How can she...    She just realized she left a drunk message on some guys voice mail.    The way it appears to throw it's arms up in disgust.    Why is this in this sub?    Well see. Getting gear ready today. Blackfish out by rock piles etc, right?    Goooooonies    Great stuff, man. I'll be out on my kayak in Niantic actually later in the am. Tight lines dude!    What's this from?    No, at Jamba Juice.    Well, how did that go?    Or she's in no state to be dialing on a touch screen.    Seriously, though. Before he knows it he'll be in /r/yachtrock just begging for some more smooth Michael McDonald.    Fer cereal. Fuck it. I'm on vacation I'm actually gonna get out of the house today.    No, we do. - CT   Or she was a bit too drunk to dial the number correctly?    It always feels like...    Lol   You're gonna try this tomorrow! Aren't you?    He gots them bird brains.    Fuck you I won't do what you tell me.    Pretty sure that's part of his sunglasses.    At first I thought your comment ended after the first paragraph and laughed my ass off.    I'm a 36 year old guy. I won a 60 inch smart TV from the local news station last year. My girlfriend at the time thought I had won a million dollars. I was hootin and a hollerin like a mad man.    What joke am I missing?    On mobile and about to pass out. Tomorrow.    Witb the dad turning the camera around so everyone would know who was making the jokes.    Probably not commenting on a post about them on reddit.    gonna need a link on who and why.    Am I at a Rage Against the Machine concert?    Lol at title.   Maybe.     where are you going?    A loss leader as we like to call it.    Wait until my truck miles align with my comment karma.    No. No it doesn't.    Is this the trailer to sharknado 2? If so I'm down.    That's why they use cars.   aww how cute.   That's a lot of carrots.    oh man that shit was out of my head you asshole.      It's like he's never mopped a floor before.    nice find.   seriously, though.   You mean I can take off this hypercoler t-shirt?    Put...put your dick in it.    Think it's a 5 speed manual?    Cool. Sure.    Like Atlanta?    I'm curious what has been interesting so far.    A new position for the gay men.    I guess, kinda. I'd just rather not take a side...its irrelevant to me. Claiming there is a God is the same to me as claiming there isn't one.    What about me? I'm an apatheist. We cool?    Kind of makes me miss Seattle. Kinda.    Ya, because all those celebrities weren't just peddling their recent movie/book.    Mistreated? For all we know she pooped on the office rug.    Why thank you. It made my day. ;)    Well, I just moved to East Pattagansett. Cool town. Love it.    It's pretty good stuff.       Bingo   That makes sense. Thank you.      I understand what you're saying. I do. I guess what I am getting at is when a person makes that decision to do some seriously fucked up shit like jump off a bridge with a baby, at what point did something in their head snap and go "okay, this is right"? as opposed to when a murderous drug cartel tortures someone who is "betraying" them etc. or when someone robs a bank or cheats on their wife. I am in no way saying any of that is okay I just wonder where it all goes wrong.   What made you decide not to do something horrible in your past? I'm genuinely curious. Were you born a good person, were you raised right? Were you just a better person for some unknown reason? Good talk so far, yo.   It's pretty good. Better than anything else I've tried here on the shoreline. While it's not really authentic they do what they do well. They put tomatoes and lettuce and shredded cheese on their tacos. I just prefer some fresh cilantro and chopped onion.   The flavors and quality of cooking is spot on, though.   I definitely recommend.   Side note: If you like Thai and are in Niantic you need to check out The Spice Club.    I don't disagree with you on that's it is all on him. I was just explaining that I believe it's not something people in their right mind does, at least I sure hope it isn't. I just don't comprehend how someone makes a decision like that without some serious mental issues and or a serious drug issue.       Mental illness?   Drugs?   Nobody in their right mind does this shit.    Citrocel fiber powder. Everything is just spilled out all over the place. I'm fucked.    764-Hero   ?   was the rest of the band 3 when they originally recorded this?   Awesome scene from Boogie Nights    ?    It's a woman were talking about here.    Love the username.    He was getting it give to his brother for Christmas.    With the classic little black kid trying to steal a bike.    Lol. That's some /r/showerthoughts junk right there.   You need to change your front page.    I'm just vacation. 7 more days of this.    and the fat cats and the skinny cats sheebow yip kartwaytow   aww thanks ;)   I can't hold this poop any longer pull over.    Sure, a sausage grinder would kinda work.    You know what a sub is or a hoagie?   Well in a section of Connecticut we call them grinders.    All this talk of grinders is making me hungry.    It only dispensed warm milk.    in watched the entire thing. I was 10 when that happened so I probably already saw it when it was live.   /r/forwardsfromson   Was hoping for Clark Griswold.

 Not with that attitude.   Download viber   Tacos. Tacos any day and every day.   www.meatspin.com   Plot twist: OP does not work in a dental office.   Wait, why are you mentioning Serato? Hook the cdj up to the laptop to load songs from rekordbox.    As low as your standards will go, I suppose.  Also, /r/beatmatch   I thought you just had to hook one cdj to the other, then hook the second to the computer?   1. Spend all your free time honing and perfecting your skills.  2. Blow all your hard earned cash on gear and tracks.  3. Attend lots of local events and gain a humble following. Okay, well not a "following," but people might say they've "heard of" you.  4. All your years of hard work and dedication have paid off and you KNOW that you're better than most big djs you see.  5. Fail to get any gigs and become bitter and jaded.   Drugs   if you are characterizing it like that, what *does* suck?  when would it be correct to use that word?  When referring to OP's mom.   I have a grumpy cat mug with the word "No" on it.   Would the bird that got swallowed not be able to peck its way out?   If you have to bend over at all, then the table is too low. If standing, you should be able to touch your set up while your back is fully erect. Being hunched over will cause back, neck and shoulder pain, as you've described.     M'iscarriage   _     Very accurate depiction of what I observe on a daily basis. I'm from the newest generation of workers, fresh out of college with a results oriented culture and I work at a government agency where there's a lot of bureaucracy.  People are lazy, incompetent, and inefficient. It's just the culture here. I tried to outshine other peers when I started here but it was met with a negative response. I was seen as over stepping my bounds. It's all about seniority here. It's not about how much work you do but about how long you've been here.     Proctology   "It's the fucking Catalina wine mixer!" POW POW   Not at all. My remark was just about jack stands being unnecessary for a tire replacement.   I know people who have died because they didn't use jack stands while underneath a car. It's not pretty.   I think you missed the point. The original post was about replacing a flat tire. Most people would just use the car jack. Using a jack stand to replace a flat shouldn't be necessary since you shouldn't be under the car while replacing a flat anyway.  Any time you are underneath the car, it is crucial to use jack stands.   While replacing a flat on the side of the road?   Plot twist: they're all dead.   You know how I know that you work at a big firm? Because you use dated business jargon like "mission critical." ;)  Edit: not sure what's up with the down votes. I thought the winky face smiley made it clear that it was a light hearted dig. I guess it hit a sore spot, you turds.   Sir Meowington   Well aware ;)   So a lesbian trapped in a man's body.   Because on certain other months, I don't drink beer! Haha. Sorry for the lame answer, but it's just my way of limiting beer consumption. 2 months no beer, 1 month beer, repeat.   Gin   tonic is my friend. I love beer but I only drink beer on certain months.   I prefer the "Family Van"  2 in the front, 5 in the back.   Is this the site that the one guy made that so called "hacked" the system to find the cheapest flights?   Wearing your gym uniform. Usually a t shirt and gym shirts   No. If your purpose is to waste time, and someone's post wastes your time, then you've achieved your goal.     I hope they get this working for Stephen Hawking soon.   Let the dumber people get the grades they deserve. You're only doing a disservice to yourself, and society as a whole, when you help dumb people misrepresent their qualifications.   I don't mind when they screw up either. We're all humans and can't be perfect. I mind when the dj is obviously too shitfaced to play properly.   I heard that if you put cardboard cut-outs on a toy train set and play Christmas music, it also deters burglars.   I'm not sure if he's an alcoholic but, living the life of a super star dj, it's hard to turn down all the freebies offered back stage.   Solid advice here.   You know he's mixing live because he consistently screws up. I'm sure being drunk all the time contributes as well.   YouTube, but you would have to convert your music file into a movie file in order to upload it.   Right there with you. But man is it "heavy."   I still have some kikwear jeans with 40" leg holes.   Well, I mean, I just left them in there.I never used them.   http://imgur.com/UW3P4a5   I do   Chicken satay  Shrimp curry  Duck salad  Siam seafood  Fried whole fish   Plenty of other lo carb choices there.   Thanks for the info. This comment should be number 1.   Hey, you might as well enjoy your vices, but in moderation.   I limit myself to drinking only on the weekends (2 days). So I don't keep track of my carbs very closely on those days.   I figure if I'm going to drink I might as well enjoy myself. Sorry, I don't have any accurate numbers for carb comparison for you.  I did a Google search and for 12oz of St. Bernardis I'm seeing 20-30g of carbs. That's no where near the 3g of carbs from Michelob ultra, but the choice for me is piss water vs. something I like to drink.  Edit: I scanned the bar code on a 12oz shock top just for fun. My fitness pal lists the following: 168cal, 15g carbs, 2g protein.   I'd like to offer an alternative train of thought.   I drink beers with the highest alcohol content I can find. Gulden Drak, St. Bernardis ABT. 12, Delerium Tremens, La Fin Du Monde, are a few of my favorites.  They are all close to 9-10% abv. I would rather drink less beer with higher alcohol content than drink low carb beer, but end up drinking more. Added benefit, the beers are much better tasting and because I'm drinking less fluid overall, I feel less bloated.   My dj name is my real name.   Thanks. I figured I should eat more since, on my last set, sometimes, I'm really gassed. But I know it's not muscle failure because I've completed a higher number of sets before with little difficulty.   Thanks for taking the time to respond.  To answer your question about my goal weight. At 164lbs with 18% bf I have about 29lbs of fat. At my GW of 160lbs with 12% bf, I'll have about 19lbs of fat.  So my transition from 164lbs to 160lbs would involve losing fat at the same time, gaining muscle. Not a huge weight difference but my body composition would change.   Sounds like you've been slapped on the head too many times.   Hello, I've been doing keto for about 2 months now and have stumbled upon /r/ketogains   I'm trying to get some more muscle definition and size but I'm unsure if my current method is the most efficient.  Right now, I'm working out about 4 days a week (mostly lifting). I'm on a 18% calorie deficit. I've noticed some size and definition but from reading around, I can only surmise that this may be "noob gains."   It makes sense to me that in order to gain muscle, you have to eat more calories than you expend, so those calories can go towards muscle growth (to put it in very simplified terms, I know it's more complicated than that).  I noticed also though, that I've begun to plateau as far as seeing the quick results as I did from the beginning. Can I have some feedback? I'm worried if I eat at a surplus, I will gain fat as well (along with muscle, hopefully).  Is it possible to lose fat and build muscle while on a caloric deficit? Or should I bulk and then cut? --- *Generated by [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com) 8.5*  27/M/5'11" | CW 164 | 18% BF | Mostly sedentary | GW 160 @12%BF  * 1710 kcal Goal, a 18% deficit.

 OK. I'll have to look into that.  I have a spare desktop that I can re partition to Linux.   Any off the shelf stuff that would work?   Hi guys, I've been looking into a simple home monitoring system.  I like what the Nest, etc. wifi cameras have to offer, but there are some big drawbacks that I don't want to deal with.  what I want is:  * Outdoor camera w/ 2 way audio ( it'll be placed under an overhang of a house, so only cold would be an issue.  I doubt it'll ever get directly wet.) * Selective motion alerts * **LOCAL** storage to my computer, no cloud or subscription fees * remote access, view and control via mobile OS and web * wifi setup and communication with my home network (to store the data on my computer).  From what I've seen, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartCam-Outdoor-SNH-E6440BN-Camera/dp/B00P1NAPPQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1436402372 sr=1-1) is the closest thing I can find, but it only has a 32GB capacity (some say it can go to a 64GB) and I'm not sure how it works for accessing the data remotely or how you archive the data without removing the SD card.  The reviews are hit and miss as well.  Any suggestions?   it's all a matter of perspective.  Living in Bend for 25 years, it was always a small town.  The big city was Portland.   It's all frame of reference.  I lived in Central oregon from 1990-2001 and 2003-2014 with Portland in the middle, I just recently moved to the Seattle area.   From my point of view if takes you less than 10-15min to drive across town, it's a small town   Those little one building villages I don't consider a town.  Grass valley, Shaniko, Brothers etc...  Metropolis=  250k. City=  100k.  Town=  50k.  Village=  5k.   Coming from the next town over that is 4x larger, it's small.  Bend is the biggest town for 100 miles in any direction, and its just under 100k people.  However, living is Seattle, it's a tiny, tiny town   I'm shocked that there are so many people that get the S without the 6MT.    Looks great though.  You'll enjoy it.  There isn't another car I would have for the money than the one I have   And into two others. http://www.ktvz.com/news/highway-97-in-redmond-reopens-after-injury-crash/33452188   This was in a small town in Central Oregon.  The person driving woke up from a coma the next day. The passenger survived as well.  The truck smashed into this and 2 other cars.  So while the meme has merit in its message, this particular case it's the trucks fault.     http://www.ktvz.com/news/highway-97-in-redmond-reopens-after-injury-crash/33452188   I bought mine from vzw and I'm in this same issue.  I have 47e   Depends... When she was in True Lies? Or in Bring it on?   I had no idea the little girl in the shitty lost in space movie grew up to be that hot ass woman in not another teen movie.  Almost like Eliza Dushku in True Lies then in Bring it on   One got replaced in later seasons, so it's THREE other hot chicks.  Woo! Party   You can never go wrong with a Tennis player.  90% of the ones from 1990+ would be acceptable.   Mallrats.  Hell yeah.   well...after the 4th season of That 70's show anyway.  She was 14 when she was cast.  She lied and said she was 18.   She went to my high school for part of one year while she filmed a failed TV show called McKenna.  This was before Party of Five.  She acted like any other girl at the school except every boy at the school said they hooked up with her in one fashion or another.  None of them were telling the truth, but still.   It was based on a republican system, but it's hardly perfect.  Now that everyone can get insurance, we need to tackle the actual cost of health care   Yeah it just gave insurance companies more customers.    It's a start.  It gave the insurance companies way more customers.  But the real problem is the health care costs like you said.    I'm self employed and my wife is going through a year long software boot camp.  We'll have to spend about $5000 a year or more on health care to make it work out to break even.  We won't even come close to that unless a major accident occurs.   The whole book is good   They are both great, we'll see how it plays out with the remaster coming out.  The iconic thing about 7 was the cut scenes   not sure about the W and Y being only for supercars...unless my Infiniti is a supercar.  I have a 98Y rating on mine.   looks like Z rated tires is all you'll need then.   They have an ODBII reader that you can get from the big companies.  I'm not sure what it tracks, but it COULD track speed, acceleration, deceleration, basically anything your car's CPU can track.  They would have a detailed picture of how you drive.   Well, you kinda contradicted yourself.  your tires are rated for 149+ mph.  160 mph is 149+.   you mentioned it in the last sentence.  The circuit is looking for the proper resistance (ohms) to check if the factory light is working properly, hence you have to add a RESISTOR.     Mine was DOA.  I just got spare out and it worked  fine.   But you won't know that until you talk to them   That's the initial D AE86.       While technically correct, it doesn't seem to accurately portray the source of where people are coming from.  Asia is a big place, but a person from Japan and a person from Pakistan are very different people.    Not a column for Indians (not native Americans)?  I thought it was Asian and Indian as the 2 largest minorities here.     You should be in the ball park price wise.  You might have to look around for one that has the right options that you want ( took me 2 years to find the perfect one).  Maintainence is very basic.  Change the fluids regularly and check the filters, replacing as needed.  You are good for 150k+ miles easily.  Sure, if something DOES go wrong it's spendier than an old Chevy to fix, but it would be few and far between when it happens.  Consumer reports said the g35 was one of the best cars you can buy overall.  Only the top end Lexus sedan and the Tesla Model S were rated higher   [OK, who brought the cougar?](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/ghostbusters/images/7/78/GB1film1999chapter18sc011.png/revision/latest?cb=20111218104117)   You won't wear out a transmission unless you are an idiot.  Look into rev matching and heel-toe to make it even easier on the drive train   Doesn't Verizon own AOL now?   I have 67000 miles on my car.  The brakes have never been replaced.  They are still in good shape as well.  It's how you drive that determines the life of your brakes.   I don't drive slow.  I've even gone to a track day or two.  With proper use of the transmission, you don't need your brakes for much.     Unless you have a super charger, you should be in the mid teens at the worst.  You might want to have it looked at   I was on a race track for 8 hours and got 9 mpg.  Wtf are you doing? Flooring it everywhere until red line in each gear then brake hard for stop signs?  Do you live in the middle of nowhere so there is room to do that?   I don't think any substantial gains are going to be had that are worth doing.  Any standard hypermileing techniques will improve the mpg.    These cars don't have the worst mpg out there, but they are pretty good for the hp that we have.    Forbes did a list of the top 10 fast and frugal cars back in 2012.  Both the 370z and the g37 made the list.  The top 3 were the Porsche 911, boxer, and Cayman   http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/fashion/weddings/how-americans-learned-to-love-diamonds.html   The music numbers are some of my favorite scenes over the years   Intrinsically nothing.  They created demand for something that was just a rock.  That's just good marketing.  Think the Pet Rock of the 70's.  Zero aftermarket value.  This person that found the diamond would still have to have it cut and polished to be set in commercial jewelry.  Until that time, it'll be worth next to nothing to most people.     "Have you seen my bear, Tibbers?"   Nothing.  Diamonds have 0 intrinsic value.   There is no such thing as a used diamond.  The DeBeers company made a huge ad campaign a while back to make people think that they are rare and worth a lot of money.  They aren't rare, the supply (and therefore price) of them is controlled by one company.  Think of how many jewelry stores there are in the world.  When is the last time you saw one say, "sorry we're out of diamonds today because they are hard to come by and we didn't get any"   Anyone with an actual agreement with them is banned from discussing the details of it, so this thread will all be guessing   no clue. I just regurgitate stuff i hear.    My wife is the biochemist.   I'm pretty sure Fluoroantimonic Acid is used in the Semi conductor industry    You aren't a majority shareholder, so you are only an expense that is negativity impacting their bottom line.  You are also a dime a dozen, so if you don't like it, they will find someone to replace you.  Going public is the worst thing a company can do.  As soon as that happens, it's all about how to make more today than you did 3 months ago so you keep the shareholders happy and your stock price goes up.  Employees and customers are a distant priority behind meeting sales expectations   That makes more sense   Nope.  Amazing forehand, pretty good backhand.  Excellent hands at the net.  My problem?  I wouldn't do more than 2 of these amazing shots in a row.  I was terribly inconsistent   "Andy Roddick has many 225km/h (140mph) or faster serves on his record but only his personal best of 249km/h (155mph) is included."  Like I said, there are a few that can do it consistently.    This would mean that is one of the top 30 players ever, not top 30 serves ever   Three points? I don't think so.  3 games, maybe.   Pretty sure they've seen quite a few that are faster.  Roddick was in the 150's a more than a few occasions.    I think there are several pros in the top 200 that can do 143 consistently.   I have a 100mph serve, but barely made varsity.     The silenced .50 cal sniper rifle does 1 shot kills to the head of the heavy troopers.  With the high powered scope, I could clear most of not all the camps without setting foot in them   Thank you Marla   I read on here that a guy got some burn in because he Reddited you much.  I don't think you'll have an issue unless you have the screen on for hours on end that's not a full screen video   They aren't falling, but it's less expensive.  There are a lot of good, high paying jobs available here, so it's a good place to live even in the suburbs   That's why I said suburbs.    Seattle is still building, especially in the suburbs   I was saying that if you go to spa, it might favor the higher hp P1.  I wasn't saying go to an oval   It was a good report.  However the conclusion was that the track was more suited to the awd setup.  I'm sure there would be a different result on a different track.   They were so close it's splitting hairs   No idea on that.  I had the dealership do it all   You can get a back up camera and nav.  Mine has it.  I've only got 9 mpg on a race track.   I've heard it's systemic, so I'd have it checked to be safe.  It's plastic, so you could be proactive and have it replaced with a metal one before it fails   haven't tried to get the scratches out.  It's been detailed a few times, but that's a hard spot to get a buffer to.  there is no slave cylinder on an AT, so dont' worry about that.  Fuel milage is ok, not amazing but not horrific. It's a good hp/mpg ratio.  It's been the best car I've ever had.   I still call the stuff they sell "Hate Chicken"   I've never been there, and they will never see a penny from me.  However, if someone bought an extra one and offered it too me, I'd eat it.   My car has the same scratches in the same spot.  Its from fingernails and other stuff that's on my hands.    I bought [this](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OBCAW2?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00) and took a DC - USB power port next to the RCA inputs and connected them with a 3.5mm - RCA cable (I think it might have come with some, but I already had it).   It's 2x as loud as just the cable direct to the ports from my phone.  I had to turn up the car volume and the phone volume to the max to get good driving levels.  Now it's too loud at 50% car.   You can probably get the curbed wheel repaired for less than $300  The only problem I've ever had was the slave cylinder failed at about 55k miles.  Normally that isn't too big of a deal, but it took out the master cylinder, the clutch and the flywheel with it.  So it was like a $4k repair.  Get that checked if it's a MT because apparently it's a known issue, but they won't do a recall on it, and WILL NOT cover the failure out of warranty.    LiDAR and RADAR are both used by police and are picked up by good detectors.  Same principles apply.  If there is no signal to detect, it can't alert you.  If you are the only car in the lane, and a cop just powers in on briefly and only at you, the detector will go off, but it's too late.   The false positives of detectors have gone down over the years, but it's not 100% fool proof.   meh, in the city, it's probably 6 of one 1/2 dozen of the other.  The detectors can pick up false signals, and if the cop doesn't hold the laser on, you can detect it until he pops you.  By then it's too late.  Same goes for the app.  Someone has to see the trap being setup and use the app enough to report it.  I get a lot of false positives on there.  I wonder if cops report themselves then move on just to slow down the people using Waze.   Yeah, they are CCD detectors which can read a 785 laser uncooled, but their sensitivity aren't as good.   Yeah, that's why I didn't mention the lasers themselves. the detectors and the batteries to power them need to catch up   I sell something that was invented in the late 90's that touted itself as a tricoder.  They got a cease and desist letter from CBS   532 is a really sensitive wavelength.  I deal with 1064 a lot, and it's 16x weaker.   When battery tech and cooled detector tech gets small enough.  Lasers suck up a good deal of power in most scientific applications.  Detectors in NIR and RAMAN spectroscopy usually need to be cooled to get the best sensitivity to get lower levels of detection.     http://i.imgur.com/tI2xGob.jpg   https://youtu.be/TSYxXKzmCho  Here you go.   I thought those wraps are reserved for only stacks of ones.  Each denomination had a different color and they were x*100 in value.   I've seen 40% methanol in samples pulled from bottles.  It's lethal.   About 4-5 lbs.  www.rigakuraman.com  Yeah, they have distributors world wide.   Lynnwood just has the big blue bin   My guess is the metal substrate makes the first layer stick really well to the reflective surface, then it just piles on.  The plastic bumper is smoother so harder to start the first layer.   That and the voids you see are the grill.  The radiator could be just as bad   Why are there so many bugs?  Big still lake right next to the highway that you drive on and it gets pretty warm in the summer.  Good breeding grounds for them.  I've driven this same road.  It's nasty   They might not spike it with anything, they just don't remove the methanol.    I sell portable equipment that can tell the difference between legit and counterfeit alcohol (and lots of other things).  I've seen an application method explicitly for this purpose and location   It took months to find a used car for my wife.  We had the make and model picked out, but it couldn't be black, white, or grey/silver.  We'd have taken red, blue, orange, yellow, etc.  Finally found an orange one.  Looks great next to my bright blue car.     Rooting is very simple and you won't be able to edit the build.prop otherwise.  Might be worth looking into how to do it   ...and this is?   Functional Public transportation.  Most of our cities are just terrible about implementing any kind of real permanent solution.  I was in Munich, but staying out at the airport,  for Oktoberfest.  Didn't set foot in a car the entire time I was there.   It's been awhile since I've gone in there, I knew it was up there.  I don't know if I've ever noticed a UHD stream even when I have a 100mb/s connection.   The lowest I've ever got was 15.5, but that was flooring it all over town.    The best was 28, but it was 100% cruise control for 400+ miles.  I'm usually ~21 with mix of interstate and city.   Number 4 and #13 contradict each other.    Just finished sophomore year of high school.  So that meant biking to downtown to get some ice cream or sodas at the local sweet shop.   Normal business...maybe.    Retail? nope.    If people have more free time, then they will be wanting to go out and do things more, so that sector will need to be more available to the new times people have.   At the highest speeds, Netflix is 2gb / hr.  You can, however, go into your account settings and cap the Fidelity/throughput so that it doesn't go the best possible, saving some data.

Do their tax bill is lower   You call them when you arrive and only then do they bring your car around and warm it up.  I was supposed to get in at 10pm, but didn't get in until 4am, same service.   It's about $25 a day to park AT Sea-Tac now.  But there are park and ride places that are much cheaper and shuttle you to the airport.  When you get back, they have your car warmed up and waiting.  not a bad gig.   I thought the industrial area south of downtown was "South Downtown" or "SODO"?  Wallingford, Phinney ridge, Greenlake, Freemont are usually referred to as themselves, so I'm not sure why they would even try to group them together?   This is exactly how I ran into him too.  I was there in 2013 when they announced the PS4 and XB1, so it was a hell of a year to go. http://i.imgur.com/pDhUYw4.jpg   There is (or was) a contest where if you could prove a cable was better than the coat hanger, they would give a bunch of money.  AFAIK, no one has collected.   I'm too lazy to learn to not kill myself with one of those, plus I'll spend about $3.50/cart and each cart will last a month or more.  I don't shave daily.   leasing?

 I've been searching for one and found some links to products but they are either not commercial yet or very expensive!  * This [one](http://www.electronicsnews.com.au/Features/First-commercial-silver-ink-UV-cured-without-heat) was announced in 2012 but I can't find a link o buy it. * This [one](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/791873?lang=en region=US) costs $389 for 10 gm! * And I don't know how to get this [one](http://www.conductivecompounds.com/uv-curable/z-904-ultraviolet-curable-anisotropic-conductive-ink.html), the company is not replying.  Can anyone help?       Awesome! Check more projects on its [Hackster page](http://hackster.io/1sheeld/projects).   Why dead? the percentage of successful campaigns is growing far beyond the failing ones.   I've met them in the bay area maker faire last month, it's working!   My recommendation is to put a switch to change the mode of your shield between 3.3V (for the Due) and 5V (for the Mega).  Have you heard of the [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com)? It has that switch and the manufacturers share the schematic design to be open source, check it on [Github](https://github.com/Integreight/1Sheeld-Schematics-and-Board).    I recommend the [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com) Arduino shield. It turns your smartphone's hardware into 40 different shields through an Android app.  So you have the sensors like a Gyroscope, Accelerometer, GPS, Proximity, Temperature (I don't know if you have that in the S4). Also voice recognition, storing data, text to speech, posting on twitter, facebook, video streaming through Skype ... etc.  Check the list of [shields](http://1sheeld.com/shields/) and the getting started tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LlfBoycKE8).  I built with it some projects like a [candy grabber machine](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-create-your-own-candy-grabber-machine-using/), where I used the phone as a Gamepad controller for children to grab candy and teach them about Arduino and coding, it was a nice game in the maker faire.   Nice!   Intel Galileo would be a great idea, if you code using Arduino IDE it sucks but I'll try Windows, thanks a lot!   Thanks, interesting read.   Sure! I'l keep you posted.   Thanks!   Exactly, I want to control the ink jet as i control a CNC machine. So basically there are no open source drivers? Do I have to override the driver and control it with motors directly?       Well at least they have the Arduino trademark in the US.      Yea some of them are collaborations with they guys at the makerspace :) They don't like using Reddit! Say it has a bad interface which is true :D  	17
 One of my favorite Reggae artists of all time is [Yellowman] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NdqsIeA6mU). Have you heard of him before now ?    Dude you could pick ANY color.  Bright blue, an intense green.  It would probably all be really really vivid on your hair, and no bleaching required !     Love you with all my heart.   Love whenever you're together,   Love you pulled apart.     I love you [smoked pork butt. ] (http://imgur.com/jEGktgs) ________________________________________________  I've been doing just brisket and ribs for a long, long time but I venture out with a pork butt.  It was sold as one 15 pound package, but was actually two pieces of meat.  Rubbed with nothing but Dixon Hatch medium chile's from the Chile Shop in Santa Fe.  Smoked for, gosh, forever, with coal and hickory on a sidebox burner.    Ran out of coal, and was losing the smoke so I transferred it to my 'lectric (which barely uses any wood at all ) for the last hour or so.    It's resting right now, but I couldn't help but sneak a good sized piece.  It's Famazing.  You know what the F is for.   I may not smoke ribs again for a while.     I'm in love with a pork butt.        Hmm, the Sheep and Wool Festival has a lot of regional family farms, I've just never sought any out.    Is there really anything more American than backyard Q and a PBR ?    I have a [Smokin Tex] (http://www.amazon.com/Smokintex-1100-Pro-Electric-Smoker/dp/B008KCKA1O/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden ie=UTF8 qid=1436731636 sr=1-1 refinements=p_n_feature_keywords_browse-bin%3A6452780011%2Cp_89%3ASmokin+Tex) and it's as easy as it gets.  Use surprisingly little wood/coal as well... the actual heat generation is the electric, and it heats up the box of wood just enough to make it smolder without flaming.  Since it's very tightly sealed and insulated it doesn't require much heat to do that, and there's only one very small 1 inch hole as a "chimney".  Therefore the dwell time of the smoke is very long, and you burn next to nothing.  And it all burns down very well as well.   It recommends 2 oz of wood per ten pounds of meat for a "medium" smoky flavor, I use more along with coal to get the nitrates going.    All I do is load it up, turn the knob to 225 and then go do whatever else I want.   Light years easier than my stick burner.     oh cool, didn't know that - thanks !   Do you think the food stores stick to that, or do they just generically call it all "lamb"  ?   Chinese style ribs.  It's all in the sauce, doesn't matter if they're smoked or not.  Pretty sure no chinese restaurant smokes anyhow.    BUT, isn't there a HUGE difference between these three scenarios you provided (and thank you for that) and not offering employment because one won't provide their social media information ? There are many commenters here saying they were turned down jobs for the stated  reasons of not having a Facebook page or not providing their login credentials to the prospective employer.  That sounds completely illegal.  Hopefully it is.    Sounds like you were better at marketing than the company was.    Noone needs your facebook password to view posts that you've shared (intentionally or unintentionally) with them.   The only reason to ask for a password is to view privileged communications not shared with them, which is slimy as fuck.  These companies need to get sued into the ground so all the other sleazeballs out there will stop this fucking trend Right.Now.   In all seriousness, this sounds ripe for a class action suit.  "We'd love to employ you, but first we need you to violate the terms of service of your email provide as well as contradict every bit of common sense online security the entire world has spent millions of dollars teaching each other so that we can access your privileged communications. "   I don't see a problem... I thought that was every grill ever.    NO WAY I'd use galve.   Someone hands me food and says it was made in something that contains galve, I'm not stopping to list to whether it was in the hot part, the cold part, food contact ... that foods going in the trash before they even get a chance to explain.    We use a flat black rustoleum IIRC.     I'm sorry, I misspoke.  I'm used to lamb being served in other ways, but I Just saw a picture of a lamb leg someone smoked and the meat came out rather light like pork, so I suppose it's a matter of the cooking technique making it darker and not the meat itself.    the family is used to eating late.  Yep !  When is the barbeque done ? WHEN ITS DONE.      You filled a smoker with chicken and ribs, and noone came over ? Your buddies have their priorities mixed up !!     That smoker looks suspiciously clean;)   Season 'er up !!    it was a traditional preservation technique, along with salting, but the idea is you do that to fresh meat to preserve it.  It doesn't reverse any bacterial damage already done afaik.   what /u/damagement said, plus I'll add:   - add slowly; just a few pieces and give it time to come to temp.  for my silver smoker I'll add just a handful of coal or wood, and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes before checking it; if it looks good, I'll let it go on for an hour and a half, two hours before checking it again.    - I don't adjust my vents, mostly because they're all  stuck and rusted, but also because I found that my que does better when I STOP MESSING WITH IT than when I constantly tweak it trying to get a perfect 225.  Yep, I get variations, I think it adds character to the que and it still comes out great.     -Personally I think messing with it every 30 minutes is too often, but if this was on a Weber that's a pretty small area and you're cooking directly on top the of the heat source so I don't know how that affects everything, I use a cheap sidebox.   -To me there's alot more to great q than just the tenderness - while I definitely shoot for tender, I've had incredibly tender yet flavorless q that may as well have been cooked in an oven.  I wouldn't worry too much about whether they came out perfectly tender or not and focus more on the overall awesomeness of it.    Yes, pork butt is very different from mutton, which is lamb.  Mutton is a very dark meat, darker than beef, and has a more wild taste than beef. Pork is much more commonly found in the US, has a less strong flavor and is more traditional for bbq.  Pork is a light meat; the pork industry association for years marketed it as "the other white meat" when health concerns about eating too much red meat became popularized.      thanks man, turns out it was actually two in one package so I'm good to go there.  May actually be done sometime around dinnertime !!    a couple other tips I just thought of ... I'm totally guilty of not following these myself but ...   - start with the vents closed, so you have the ability to open them later down the road.   - err towards lower heat and taking longer... although you're trying to time a meal.  I never try to time.  It's done when it's done.   - warm your smoker up first... after your coals are ashen put them down and let them warm up the empty smoker... if it's a bit cool than add a bit more coal, give it a couple minutes.  That way you're starting with at least a decent baseline and any swings you have then aren't affecting the meat.   - I find that wood burns much faster and hotter than coal, so I'm more careful with it.   - if  you have a cheapy sidebox burner like I do, there's probably a good bit of temperature difference from one side to another; there are online mods for common cheapies that help address this, but they don't completely fix it ... so I rotate the meat every once in a while.    - Ive found the chimney cap doesn't regulate heat at all, just smoke dwell time.  I keep it wide open since I use a bunch of coal and wood and don't want a creosote problem.        Don't get discouraged... when we first got RON years ago we would try playing online ... only to find it was all pretty, well, one-sided ;)  I wouldn't mind trying now, but honestly the solo play or lan play gives you so many AI and game options that I never tire of just playing solo games and constantly trying new challenges.    But I cannot lie ... it's been a long time since I smoked a hunk 'a pork and this one's a 15 pounder.  What can I expect in terms of smoking time and plateaus ? Should I let it finish in a cooler or take it all the way in the box ? Wondering if I should slice it in half to get more surface area.    Also considered injecting it with apple juice stuff, but  I dunno ....     Dude looks great to me.  I actually like my que a little more on the well end side... I like some char, some bar.  I don't like it to come out perfectly tender but devoid of any signs of having been cooked with fire ... you can just use an oven for that.    "Dahktor" .. I get it now.  So tell us about  this joint you're opening !  Or better yet, tell us about  the  process  of opening a joint; what you've learned, what challenges and obstacles there are, etc.   Also up for a good business story.   the trick to heat control is small changes over time.  nothing drastic... don't "oversteer" it.   you may eventually benefit from modding your smoker ... sealing a gap hear or there, adding metal plates etc ... I experimented with all that, and ended up removing the heat ballasts and just learned to have a lighter hand on it.  But then I also don't mind if I go up or down 25 degrees.  Yes, it's inefficient, but if the que is good the que is good... this is art, not science... it's the results not the methods that count.     I guess that would change with kids though. OH yeah. It's ALL changes with kids.     My thoughts:   I wouldn't rub or sauce everything the same way.  I've only smoked pork a few times and didn't bother seasoning it at all; it all got pulled and sauced on the sandwhiches anyhow.   Brisket rub should be different than rib rub IMO.  JUST IMO.  For brisket I use New Mexico hatch peppers I buy mail order and use them as the base, with onion and garlic; I like to keep that one simple and hot.   For ribs I use brown sugar as a base and then add a LOT of stuff, but only a hint of peppers (usually cayenne or hatch, and some ground black pepper).   This is my personal preference, great thing is its YOUR Que, do what makes you smile :)    I wouldn't start them all at the same time... I'd try to get them to come off roughly the same time. If something does come off early, you can cooler them as you stated, but remember that the meat will continue cooking even off the smoker for a bit.  Don't know what else to say there though; I've never  had the problem of que coming off *early*.   Always the opposite for me ;)    To reheat, use a steam basket.  Don't just put it in the oven...by steaming it you'll get it "falling off the bone" moist, always you may lose some of your bark or your rub may get a bit pasty.   I don't think the ribs will take 6 hours ... I've only done a few back ribs but they're really small and light compared to spareribs... I think my last batch was  maybe 4 hours total if even that.   If you want to marinate, I recently experimented with 4 different racks of back ribs.  Each was marinated differently:   - "Chinese rib" sauce, a recipe online.   Didn't come out like chinese restaurant ribs though.  - Some commercial hoisin style marinade  - Can't remember the other one but it doesn't matter because the mega winner was:   - Chinese chili oil.   You know that paste of hot peppers they have on the table in restaurants ? You can buy that by the jarfull.  I added extra oil to thin it and make it more of a marinate, and soaked the ribs in it over night.  Everyone agreed these ribs were the best.  Firey, tasty, they were just awesome.     Maintaining heat: get to know  your vents, and open them over time instead of adding more wood. And stop looking at the damn thing. Everytime you open that door you swing the temperature... check it half as often as you think you need to, or use an outboard thermometer.  I like to use wood and coal from the start, and all the way through.  There are techniques you can try such as building a mound of coal and wood, and putting your lit starters on TOP of it; since the heat goes up they don't all ignite but rather the fire "settles down" and keeps the heat going.  The idea being that if you do it right the rate of it keeps the temperatures even.  I've tried this, even built metal pyramid shaped grates for it ... it DID help, but now I just add more wood and coal as I think it's called for.  No, I do not get steady temperatures, and I'm okay with that the que is great either way.  I have a lazy electric, and although it maintains perfect temperature, the que off my stick burner is always better and honestly I'm beginning to think that it's because of the variations in temperature.     Good luck man, now I'm thinking of running out to the butcher !!     I'm not to proud to admit I've finished in the oven, particularly with some of the larger briskets (ie over 10 lbs) where I just couldn't be arsed to get up twice overnight and check it.   The smoke flavor sets in earlier in the process anyhow.    My place isn't that large, but I'll tell you that space fills quicker than you realize, especially with kids.   It's amazing how this house went from "what will we do with all this space" to "need more space"   "drop shit and still make it look good".   Yes, that was incredibly smooth.    another great choice.   man, that's taking it back even for me.    well, to be fair, didn't they actually split up between recording and releasing it ?    yeah, that's the whole thing to saving and investing.  It's kind of like eating well... everyone knows the 'rules', it's adhering to them under temptation and adversity that's the hard part. I mean, I don't need to be told I'm not supposed to eat cheese steaks at all much less with bacon on them, but I'm still gonna do it.    Mine would be Return to Heaven, last track on I Against I.  Honestly though I think every track on that album kills it.   Bad Brains   I can't recall what's A or B side on most of their stuff, and frankly I've been listening to so much of their music for so long, that I don't even know what wasn't relleased as singles or what is or isn't considered big hits of theirs.  So I'll go with an Afrikaa Bambatta  cover - Renegades of Funk   Funny thought cause I'd swear I heard Fire on the radio back in the day .. course I'd listen to it so much that it was probably replaying in my mind a lot.   I'm a big fan of Jacob's Ladder.    I Can't.    "Please excuse the words that I just blurted out.  They were not me, it was my strange confusing doubt.  It keeps rattling my cage and there's nothing in the world to bring it down.  For even though I might, even though I try I can't".      sorry, I get it at Costco and it's relatively cheap there but yes on an absolute basis it isn't the cheapest.  I am quite happy with it though; mixes and goes down well, only has the faintest odor in the tub and no odor when mixed.   Now, that IsoPure powder I tried while on a business trip (forgot to bring ziplocks of my own) however was just foul. As in I literally returned it to another GNC (multiple towns in a few days trip) explaining that I just couldn't take it anymore.   And I'm not one to return used /consumed stuff ... it was just literally the foulest stuff I'd ever used.   Odd to considering how much I like their premixed bottled stuff.    yeah bro sorry your folks probably paid north of a buck sixty for it and 95 would be perfectly reasonable (IMO) but the googles says campsaver has that model for a buck ten now :(    you could have avoided a lot of expenses by not paying someone to backhoe out existing plants ;)   Depending on what soil is left, topsoil may be beneficial but not necessary.  I think it's more important to till or at least deeply rake whats there, so that the seed get the best possible soil contact as well as facilitating easy root growth.  Regular light watering from  there is next.   In terms of finding stuff, both topsoil seed and gravel are all available at your box store.  Depending on the volume needed you may be well served to call local supply shops.    If they backhoed out all the good dirt and just left you the clay, I'd add topsoil or at least bring it  in from another part of the yard.   Yeah man, it's Mark !!  How awesome someone would know him ;)  I'll definitely drop in at the Y just to say Hi, thanks for that tip.  See, I knew it was a tight enough community that if I described him someone would know him. How funny.  thanks !!   A museum of carved birds sounds great.  I've always wanted to visit a Decoy museum.  A buddy and I were talking about how nice fishing lures were these days too, you could almost collect and display them.   Wonderland, Seawall ... both high on the list.  I want to start looking for some top roping there too.  thank you, this is gonna be a great trip.  I'm so stoked.       Running is the only thing that works for me.  If I stop running, I fall off the wagon.  It's a bad situation, but upside, I ran 6 miles once ;)    I agree with /u/flannel_smoothie.  When I quit I experienced the same ... I actually felt worse than when I was smoking - congested, coughing, etc.   Go run.       I use ON (Optimum Nutrition) Isolate from Costco.  It's very high quality, very affordable, and the most agreeable I've had.   I also really like IsoPure's BOTTLED Premixes a LOT.  I tried their powder protein once though and had to return it.... absolutely vile stuff.    I can understand why that's an actual thing.    sorry, formatting messed up  ... fixed.   the member's SSN on it   that what magic marker is for.  I agree with /u/NEHOG and the last three paragraphs of the article. This really doesn't seem like a problem that needs to be solved.  I needed my 214 for something once, I just pulled it out of the cabinet and copied it.  Really, not a big deal.   yeah, that part bummed me out.  I saw that sliced tuna and I was like "oh yeah, time to start boiling the macaroni" :(    THANK YOU :)  It *is* a beautiful place, the whole state is.   I'm sure in your lifetime you would say that it's nothing like your youth, but from my perspective it's unspoiled.   We used to have farms, orchards, brooks, streams and the sort here in the DC area, now we have condo complexes named after them instead.   I will greatly enjoy, appreciate and respect your side of the island.    thanks, we actually have a favorite rental that we've already reserved.   With 2 kids and alot of outdoor rec equipment in tow B and B's aren't really in our vernacular anymore so we tend to go more for cabins.    thanks !    thanks.  We're thinking about a half-day now ... finding an open meet around 2-3 in the Mall area probably isn't that tough, but yeah Friday evening in a restaurant zone may be tricky. I'm actually considering shelling out for a garage or Metro     Ted's Bulletin thanks!    thanks ! I was worried because some of the closer Hill areas I've seen seem a bit young and trendy.    Thank you very much !    Visiting the barracks this Friday evening with family, and I haven't been in that area since before the ballpark was built.   Are there any family friendly restaurants in the area ? How's parking ? Decent chance of getting street parking around 6 on a Friday ?  I know there's a metro station nearby but I prefer to drive cause... well, cause metro.    Wow, it's funny when you listen to it playing the game, it's just great background music.  Listening to Battle At Witch Creek by itself, as a song, no game running though ... it takes on a whole new dimension and depth.   Truly a great song; you could play it for anyone and tell them it was a famous classical piece and they'd never know.    Hey Thanks !! I love the soundtrack too ... in fact sometimes I wonder if I left the game running with the speakers on because I'll have it playing in my mind so often.   I dunno ... I find huge benefits to using formations and stances when I'm down to combat.   Agreed it shouldn't be a sole focus, but learning to use them well seems to make a difference, particularly when you're outnumbered.   I'm finding myself using Stand Ground much more often, particularly when trying to defend newly won cities close to the border with unsupplied troops and high attrition.   I'm fine with you calling it whatever you want.  I call them great.    My favorite is to put the beef in a bowl and mix in finely chopped onion, an egg, some Italian breadcrumbs and a large splash of A1 sauce.  I like to top them with a really good sharp cheddar and perhaps even some jalapeno, and eat it on a kaiser roll.      Say, on another note, do you happen to know if there are any creamery's in the area ?   Down here we used to have a creamery that was attached to their orchard and OMG their ice cream was the most amazing.   Imagine ice cream made that day, with fruit picked yesterday from an acre away.    thank you for that tip.  Looks like the perfect place for a good cheap lunch .... lots of awesome deserts though, that could be a tough temptation to pass !!   The prices don't look too bad to me considering as you said the novelty of it, plus if they have some nice old cars there or a band there I mean really, that's just a classic summer moment you know.   I do definitely need to find some good, cheap clams though.   I LOVE your clams and just plow right through them.  Literally, my whole life I've been eating what I thought were fried clams, I had no idea what fried clams were till I first got to NH/ME. You're all very fortunate.      That's awesome.  Definitely before I ever dip the line I make sure I have all my licenses, stamps etc, local catch guidebook and know the laws... gotta preserve these gifts for future generations too ya know ?    thank you! Yeah, they're pretty cheap, I was just hoping to avoid the added round trip and time spent in the store renting and returning it, and give that same money to a local Redditor instead.   I could probably get it all into my Subie if I broke it all down, but I'm just tired (long time homeowner, long time DIYer, sometimse it's fun, sometimes you just get really, really tired of it all).    I googled that up, gosh now if I tried using one of those I'd end up casting my hat, glasses, sandals...   are mack's good eating ?  is it ok to eat what you pull there or is it frowned upon ? catch and release is pretty much the protocol around here  (small man made lakes, small rivers)      Thanks ! Long Pond - that was it !   Thurston's is definitely on the list, I agree nothing better than eating on the docks.  That museum is definitely on the list too, that's exactly the sort of "off the beaten path" stuff we really enjoy. Thank you very much !!   And sorry, I've been referring to the area as Southwest Harbor the whole time ... now I realize that that's just one harbor, one village on that whole peninsula... it's really the whole area I hope to explore.     I think I may have a spoon or two... I've only fished freshwater so everything I have is small ... we tend to use a lot of worms, jigs and then a variety of top lures around here.   Of course it's been years since  i've fished but a buddy wants me to get back out there with him.   I managed to google up a couple headboats there too, sounds like the fishing there is great, and completely different stuff than what we're used to here.   I'm really excited at the prospects of pretty much staying on the quietside the whole time.        ah thank you ! Coming from inland I completely forget that there's different rules for fresh and saltwater.  Catching a mackerel from shore would be pretty awesome.  Actually with kids, catching *anything* is awesome, that's one of the joys of fishing with kids.   Hey good morning everyone,   I'm lucky enough to be heading back up again this August.  Last couple years we've been down in the Portsmouth to  Portland region, now we're heading back up to MDI.   We try to avoid crowds and the crassly touristy stuff and we really liked our last stay in SWH . I'm sure we'll be venturing up to Bar Harbor and Acadia as well, but I was wondering if anyone wouldn't mind sharing some beta on SW itself ?    I apologize that this is kind of long and all over the place, but last time we spent a lot of our time there figuring things out and we'd like to be better prepared this time.  It's been years since we've been there and I can't find much on the web other than rentals.    A couple things I'd be really interested in if you don't mind:   -I recall a wonderful walking trail on the harbor, but I can't recall the name of it or how to  locate it.   I remember something about driving towards a seawall but honestly I may be confused about that.  -There's also a small but nice lake where we can rent kayaks (we shlepped all four up on a trailer last time, but I don't want to do that again just for one day of paddling).     -I remember a really nice gentleman from a local paddling outfitter who took me on a guided trip in the harbor, but for the life of me I can't remember his name or his company's name....all I recall is he was originally from Maryland, was once in the Air Force, and capsizing in Maine is cooooold.   -Any pointers on local pounds, shacks or restaurants would be great. I don't get any seafood at home due to kids with allergies and other dietary restrictions :( but the wife lets me binge when I'm up North :)   -Any local museums, historic sites; we love small kind of "out  of the way" museums, we've been to a textile museum, a glass museum, historic homes, historic gardens, etc.   -outdoor recreation ...hiking, walking, climbing (we top rope only) bicycling, camping,backpacking trails.   -fishing ... I could bring the rods and tackle for the kids and get myself a short out of state license... or are there head boats that leave out of SW ?   -Are the Cranberry islands a nice visit ?   thanks everyone, I realize this is a lot to ask and I do appreciate any insight you wouldn't mind offering.    I actually wonder how long it would take for all the viruses floating around to eventually consume everything.     yep, been that monkey.     that's a good point.  back in the day software would routinely eat itself ... but these days if ran steady state with no change ... I wonder  what the actual availability numbers would be like.     Alots have been secretly accumulating a lot of  IT skills for a while now.   Hey you're the first person to post here besides myself.  Thanks !       fascinating. I didn't realize you had to careful balance generation and consumption.    Great point about the power stations.   I've heard our grid is a bit of an overgrown mess.    /r/geartrade.  But as /u/nobleheart said, get fitted first. This is incredibly important.  Also beware that Osprey doesn't make a huge number of adjustable packs, so try to know what model you want before you get fitted in it.    HI Op, any luck on finding someone ? Any info you can share ?    Would you mind giving us an idea of what they've charged for what kind of jobs ?     I need to run some stuff up to Alpha Ridge but it's too large for my car and I really don't want to go through the hassle and expense of renting a truck for one quick run.      If anyone has a truck and a few minutes to run me and my junk up and back (I'm by the Mall) I'll do the loading and unloading, pay the fees and I'd be glad to give you something for your trouble.     No, that's not true at all.   Reliant on salary is different than reliant on income, and I certainly don't plan on relying on savings alone.    the Times grasping at relevancy ?  Are they no better or worse than the Post ?    1. Make sure the family know all the account numbers and all the passwords.  2. Will  3. Long talks with each of them.  4. Pack the backpack, take the next flight to one of many national parks out west I've always wanted to visit. 5. Hug and kiss the family one last time and then just walk off into the woods.    This is a really interesting question and I'd really like to see serious responses from people who are currently in Ops/ DR roles.  I reckon parts of it would start falling off within the hour. On the bright side, you'll make front page.    Explained: IT systems can actually be remarkably fragile and need continuous care and feeding like plants or animals.  Hardware eventually fails, software crashes, logs fill up disks, a patch or other upgrade requires rebooting ... it's all a good bit more reliable now than in the past and the administration is now more highly automated but the need for human engineers is still there. Look at how often Reddit has issues for example.  Alot of this maintenance occurs at night when usage  is lower; there could be automatically scheduled reboots, automatic patching, or other activities that incur a high risk of the system not serving up.  With noone left to catch the problem systems, than I suspect that as the day goes longer in each time zone more systems would drop off, until eventually the majority of the net is dark.   I think it would happen slowly at first and then build, and would have a cumulative effect ... for instance if a core router or a root name server went down there would be a huge number of affected  systems.  Eventually the network outside your house would fail, and you'd be stuck on a standalone computer hating life, until something on your computer croaked.   I'm guessing the last thing you would see on the last computer in the world would  be one of those damn Rogue AV's or a Coupon browser plugin :(      Costco has giant tubs of Sabra. I think it's Sabra ... it's good whatever it is.  I was raised on hummous and I like theirs.     I'd be willing to drive probably up to 15 mins to find somewhere  Even 20 years ago if you really wanted to get away you had to drive a lot longer than 15 minutes.  These days 15 minutes just gets you to the other side of 175.   The state parks are nice, the only one I consider quiet and peaceful is Marriotsville north of 70.    There are many, many types of "fall jackets", so you'll get more helpful recommendations if you describe the type of activities you do, the climate, etc.         I've definitely bought plenty of red onions that size.    Now adding "Come down the Pike" and "Glow with pride" to my vernacular.  One day we'll make those shirts accurate.    I think it won't be long before we have self-driving cars, and that will definitely prompt a whole evolution of rules around how we transports ourselves in society.   There's an economic reality to it as well.  I would love to be a fulltime steward of our parks, but for me at least it will have to wait until retirement when I'm no longer (hopefully) as reliant on my income.   And they probably paid thousands for it.   And not just how, but WHEN, with very specific examples of different types of shrubs, trees in different zones, etc.  I think the general knowledge of "prune stuff, cut grass, weed things" is already out there, but I for one could really use something that contains more technical reference material.

And a mushy thank you, you're all a very important part of our local and national cultural heritage and for me especially having been raised in MDW in the 80's you were a constant backdrop to my life, including the loss of a parent.     we were there yesterday, the scaffolding was definitely present.  They probably just worked in old footage to save grace.

(Haven't read books, only watched show)  When Daenerys finally OK'd the fighting pits, she did so because they were now "free" do so. The logic used to defend them was that it was tradition   these fighters wanted to do it.   Yet, 2 episodes ago, we saw a slave trader selling people who were chained up   told to fight to their death.  They did so right in front of the Queen who was in attendance (begrudgingly). What gives?      w/ software updates (via XB1) it's better than it was at launch (be sure to update controller when it's plugged in)  I bought one a month ago through MSFT store for $47.   It's comfortable. In fact, very comfortable (I use it for more than XB1 now). I have it on for hours   never bugs me (rare for a headset)  Sounds great (no surround; only stereo). It's Polk, they make some of THE best speakers around.   Yes, the built in mic isn't as great as others... So, register it @ Polk's site w/ the yellow paper that's packed.   Then look at their support page. Find the email they post to like EVERY complaint about mic sound. Email them w/ address, Serial Number, phone # etc...  I did it, got a new (free) mic in 2 days shipped (free).   Some say their 4 shot now comes w/ headset adapter, mine didn't. I actually like the adapter, has a great mic   awesome cord to connect to controller (the material is soft   doesnt' seem to get in the way).  It's a great headset. Especially at that price, it's THE best XB1 wired headset I've used. You can spend $250+ on a wireless Turtle Beach w/ surround, but that's up to you. Enjoy.       I had 3 Jolder's (1/ damage)...

 A scientific poll is MUCH more relevant than an Internet poll.    They would try to match the state demos.

He's an affable guy and seems honestly passionate about his issues. But he'll never be able to deliver them. All his radical changes have to get through a congress controlled by republicans where the tax raises needed to pay for them are a non-starter. We'd have 4 years of an ineffectual president with little to no foreign policy experience and the bad taste left in voters mouths would move the presidency back to republicans.    He's getting hardly any support. He's getting far less than Obama did at this time in 2007.    Way way behind in the polls. And behind in money. And behind in establishment endorsements. Obama had far more money, endorsements, and better polling numbers at this point in 2007. [And he's the exception to insurgent candidates.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-isnt-barack-obama-and-2016-isnt-2008/2015/07/17/5d85377e-2b37-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html)   [Most see the Post as having a liberal bias.](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/content/pdf/4541)   I supported Obama in 2007-2008.    Of course it's not spent on "luxury."  It's spent on extra field offices and paid staffers and mailers and commercials.    Someone doesn't love Bernie HES A SHILL      And Clinton has been in the high 50's for that same period of time.   You're welcome!  I hope this has opened your eyes a little.    If the Clinton folks weren't in the panic already, they most assuredly are now.  You think a candidate that leads nationally by an average of 40+ points is in a panic?  She's never polled behind Sanders in any state.  In some early states, like South Carolina, Sanders is behind Biden.   Responses are weighed against the demographics of the electorate.  They don't just post the raw numbers they get in response.      I take no issue with a politician that evolves and grows on an issue. Even Lincoln did that.   Also no other sub has individuals as out of touch as this one.    Article from the summer of 2012.  The final results in that election prove that the pollsters were still, by and large, accurate.   Pollsters don't just use raw numbers.  They use previous statistical information and cross tabs to ensure their information is as accurate as possible.   Just trying to bring a dose of reality to the sub.    Landlines and cell phones.  The polls are painting a clear picture, you just don't like how it looks-much like the Republicans in 2012.   Doubt polls at your peril.  Republicans constantly tried to unskew the polls in 2012 and it turns on the polls were pretty spot on.   He's been running for 2.5 months       This will be a fight for the Democratic nomination, and it will be hard to secure it, said communications director Jennifer Palmieri. There are a lot of people Hillary Clinton will need to convince to support her and thats what we expect will happen.  If you think that's an honest statement you're very naive.  There's no way the communications director for Clinton actually believes that.  They're setting expectations high for Bernie.         There has been. [Sanders runs behind Biden.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-4167.html)      That post has over 43,000 likes and over 12,000 shares, and less than 6,000 comments.  Even if we assume every single comment is pro-Sanders, I think the reaction is mostly pro-Hillary.   I accepted your response and was continuing the conversation.    Not the guy you originally responded to. I'm a guy starting a new conversation.    The issue is it isn't that simple. It's pie in the sky hopes and dreams. Congress will never have enough democratic socialists to pass what he proposes. The chances are high that at least part of the next term at least one, if not both, chambers will be republican controlled. His plans will never come to fruition.    Clinton hasn't campaigned against any republican either   That makes no sense.    She has leads in swing states on all leading republicans.

The bad news for Trump and Sanders: If history is any guide, eventually their bubbles could burst.  Duke University professor John Aldrich cautions voters not to get too excited or worried by this summers boomlets from Trump and Sanders.

But if he wants any chance at winning he needs to do much much better in states not next to his home state. 19 down in Iowa and 40 some down in South Carolina won't cut it.    No he wasn't. Clinton had a three point lead in polls taken at the same time in 2008. Nowhere near 19 points.       While it's narrowed, Clinton still has a 19 point lead and leads Sanders in favorability, leadership, honesty, and caring about their needs and problems.    Doubt polls at your peril.  Republicans doubted polls all last cycle, and there were numerous news stories and websites devoted to "unskewing" them, and it the end it turned out they were right.  Also their likelihood of voting is determined by asking them a series of questions.         You think that, in my off time, if I wrote articles about how shitty my company's products are, my employment should be protected by the 1st Amendment?  Are you genuinely selling substandard products to your customers? That is a pretty shitty thing to do.    You didn't answer his question.    Leadership also meaning being willing to change your stance when you're wrong.   Obama wasn't even close to this far behind in 2007. Not even close.    [At this point in the 2008 campaign Hillary was up 10-16 points on Obama.  Nothing near 42 points.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html)   That poll references an 18 point lead.  Hillary has a ***46*** point lead in the latest polls.  You don't think those two are significantly different?   [Only down 26 in Iowa!](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-3195.html)  [Down a mere 41 in South Carolina!](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-4167.html)  [Only the barest of bare bones leads in Florida!](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-3556.html)       Last year President Obama won the popular vote with 65,000 American supporting him and 5,000 vote margin.   You're missing some zeros.    Did you read the article? The whole point was that those strong front runners, even after losing some states, *still won*.   [The people that make these predictions for a living say they're very indicative of what will happen.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-to-make-of-the-bernie-sanders-surge/) They pay a lot of attention to these things.    And he's behind in every state that isn't next to his home state. Iowa, the first caucus (happens before New Hampshire) down 42. South Carolina, the third primary state, down 41, and behind Biden *who isn't even running.* Florida down an astounding 55 points and again behind Biden. You have your head in the sand if you think these numbers are meaningless.    And is about 40 points behind her just about everywhere else.    Key states like Iowa, where Clinton is leading by 42%? Or how about South Carolina, the third primary state, where she's leading by 41%, and Sanders is 5 points behind Joe Biden who isn't even running?   Harmful if Swallowed was hilarious.  Fite me irl   The point is they didn't keep it to themselves or their sub.    Rodney Marks was an Australian astrophysicist employed at the South Pole with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, working on the Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory, a research project for the University of Chicago at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  On 11 May 2000 Rodney Marks became unwell while walking between the remote observatory and the base. He became increasingly sick over a 36-hour period, three times returning increasingly distressed to the station's doctor. Advice was sought by satellite, but Marks died on 12 May 2000 with his condition undiagnosed.  Marks' body was held for nearly six months over winter before it could be flown to Christchurch, New Zealand, the base for American activities in Antarctica, for autopsy. Once in New Zealand, a post mortem established that Marks had died from methanol poisoning.  An investigation was undertaken by Detective Senior Sergeant (DSS) Grant Wormald, of the New Zealand Police.  DSS Wormald stated it was not credible to believe he had accidentally drunk the methanol, when he had ready access to a large supply of alcohol. Marks had recently entered a new relationship, had nearly completed important academic work and had no financial problems. He had promptly sought treatment for an illness that confused him, and there was no reason to suspect suicidal intent.  Wormald indicated that Raytheon and the National Science Foundation had not been cooperative.  Having obtained details of the 49 other people at the base at the time, DSS Wormald told a newspaper, "I suspect that there have been people who have thought twice about making contact with us on the basis of their future employment position".  The whereabouts of the station doctor, Robert Thompson, have been unknown sometime after 2006.  In September 2008, the written report resulting from the December 2006 inquest was released. The coroner could not find evidence to support theories of a prank gone awry nor foul play nor suicide.  The case received media attention as the "first South Pole murder", as suicide was considered the least likely cause of his death.  http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/410965/2104065    I didn't ask how you thought it would turn out, I asked if I was legally able to. If I am legally able to this could work out really well for me actually. Thanks  Sounds like this confrontation is going to go great.  	75

Neuromancer is a scifi book by William Gibson that was released in the mid eighties - it's regarded as a seminal work in the cyberpunk subgenre (it basically transformed cyberpunk from a fringe subgenre to a major form of scifi), and popularised the work cyberspace (the term itself was coined by Gibson in an earlier work.   The story is set in a dystopian future, where people can log onto a VR digital space called the Matrix, which is kind of a VR web, and people have gone as far as suggesting it actually influenced the way the web was developed.  It's an amazing book and I highly recommend reading it!

To keep from arousing any suspicions they named the dog "This" so the name could be used in conversation. One day This ran away. They never saw This again. No one else knew about This.

 If you are set on that area, live closer to 17th. There's more restaurants. It's a closer walk to Adams Morgan, U and P 14, etc., and feels far more like a neighborhood with all the basic shops you need, plus some decent hang-out places. There's a Soviet Safeway nearby and Whole Foods.   There's a lot of really high-end housing west of Connecticut., and some decent restaurants, but not much else, other than what's on that part of P and Connecticut. If you move there, seriously, you'll spend most of your time crossing Connecticut to get to the East Side.    Being closer to Georgtown is nice, but that part of town grows old fast. It's more of an out door, higher-end shopping mall surrounded by lovely townhouses. But it does have a good movie theater, an Apple outlet, some good bicycle shops and a decent running store.   And as far as safety goes? All these areas are safe. But this is a city.    Carly Fiorina is the irritating, clueless kid in the classroom wildly waving her hand to get the teacher's attention.    Really surprised about Louisiana. Considering its experience with Katrina, and its profound vulnerability, it's seems solidly in the blue camp. It's interesting that Texas is as split as it is.    Not one community is over 75%, which seems striking.  The alignment seems anchored among along energy producing states and conservative ones. But I do wonder about the rust belt.         Malloy said that the widening project will mean less congestion and more productivity in Connecticut.  It will take 20 years to make up the productivity lost during the 10-year construction period.    This is the original pavement. It was surfaced with asphalt in 1774.       The Pope seems to be heading in this direction as well.  Pope Francis: On climate change, "there is a clear, definitive and ineluctable ethical imperative to act" (He's said other things about climate change as well. It appears to have a solid place on his agenda.)     Great bill. Ban smoking when the kids are in a car. Totally support it.   Smoking is a reckless, selfish activity that causes real harm to the people who are exposed to it.   And the entire reason why kids smoke is because adults are too damn stupid to quit.      well done! i actually believed it for a minute.    What happens when NC, Ark do the same thing?       I think its great. Hope they include bike lanes eventually.     No hubris among a lot of low to medium paid scribes doing their best, who had little, if anything good to say about their counterparts doing the same thing, often for less money, in radio and television?  Huh? Not in my universe. There was very little interaction with TV/radio people with 90% of the things we wrote about it. Sure, they were there for the big stories but that was it. I don't know why TV/radio felt put upon; perhaps there was something different about your market. There was almost a complete separation in social spheres because there was little cross-over in working environments. The state house guys, print and electronic, might share a beer, but us city scribes never really interacted all that much.   for less money  You might want to check that.   What killed the great American newsroom was the inability of it's business model to adapt to changing circumstances.  Agree, but I don't think they could have changed successfully.  There was no way our newspaper could have survived after our city  in lost roughly 90% of its manufacturing employment and most of the retail shifted to a mall outside the city limit.   way print journalists were eager to brand themselves as the only "real" journalists doing any work.   If you don't like print journalists, okay.   belief that one medium possessed an inherent superiority over another had more to contribute to the decline of newspapers than anyone connected to them is going to be willing to admit.  Again, I don't get this. The best reporters never moved with a "inherent sense of superiority," they worked with a sense of humility, an understanding of how little they really knew, and a deep sense of responsibility, because they understood (in these pre-Internet days) that they had been given a great deal of responsibility to report the news accurately, fairly and fearlessly. I don't recall people sitting around nursing grudges, real or imagined, over things that hardly mattered.        Back in the day, our news operation had 80% penetration in some of communities. Perhaps news organizations didn't "stitch people together," but they clearly connected them to information. The daily newspaper I started my career at in 1981 didn't keep its readers because of hubris, but because of reporters and editors who produced quality content day after day.   It wasn't hubris that ended this. There was nothing wrong with the business newspaper model because it was perfectly tuned for economic environment that began vanishing in the 1960s, and before.   There was no hubris, just a lot low to medium paid scribes doing their best.   What killed the great American newsrooms was the loss of an ad base as manufacturing declined and retail shifted away from the urban core; it was the advent of corporate journalism, that swept in and acquired vulnerable independent operations. They promised modernization and improvements, but most of what they did was lay off people. And finally it was shift in advertising to multiple models, the arrival of the Web browser in the 1990s that dispersed content and advertising.   Hubris. Not for a minute, at least among the reporters and editors. Just sadness as careers and lives were swept away with the changing times.   Yes, the journalism has been separated from the newsrooms of old, and has created many new opportunities. But the newsrooms of their day were great places, full of life, energy. I feel sorry for the folks today who will never experience the great thrill of a newsroom responding to a big story, and barroom banter that followed.        Good for AP. The word is clearly offensive, and the short version of the, "skins" makes me puke.     That's impressive, bold, and I love this line in it: "Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand."  Indiana is at real risk of becoming an economic backwater. The corporate protest is amazing. I don't recall anything quite like it. They understand something about today's high-skilled, mobile workforce that the lawmakers who back this bill just don't get. The last thing the Indiana newspaper needs is another economic hit, the loss of major sports tournaments, convention business (7 major sponsors pulled out the Indy Big Data Conference schedule in May over the past couple of days), and an always-on-the-defensive state.    But this front page, screaming editorial, also hints at the desperation in this business.        Don't miss the photo breakout. It's absolutely the best part. It's heartbreaking. Dear lord, I so miss the newsroom era.   http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/mar/21/the-death-of-the-american-newsroom-in-pictures      This is complete Onion fiction. The quotes aren't real, and for some reason they decided to single out CCSU.    The connections you make at any college will help your journalism career. (1) Because I worked at my college paper, I developed a connection with a stringer for a local paper. He graduated before me and we knew each other previously as students. He recommended me as his replacement for vacation and days-off. This gave me my first professional clips. (2) After I graduated, the head of the college's PR department, a former newspaper editor whose pub closed, put me in touch with a former colleague of his who was still in the news business. I got my first full-time job this way.     Amazing that its author decided to attack the NYT rather than "its cross-town rival" the WSJ, which runs an opinion page dedicated to the denial of science. This piece is more about RCS pumping itself up.    I'm not going to jump on this happy wagon just yet.    their bowl of chicken soup restores the soul.    No stops between Waterbury and Hartford? Wonderful. I realize no one lives in Eastern Connecticut, but to completely ignore the entire region?     I like the new name. I don't why, though.    Anyone who thinks there is too much opinion in the world is spending too much time on Reddit.   Providing a platform for a discourse of ideas (how many newspapers run op-eds on a semi-regular basis on philosophical issues?) is one of the NYT's great strengths. From this list, it appears as if the Times has assembled some interesting people.       SOP, especially in regard to the White House. It happens on their phone briefings as well.   Nonetheless, there were a few good question and they elicited non answers.   One very pointed question was about security of the server. It was nicely framed, dead on target.   This was one of the best questions. (Transcript: http://time.com/3739541/transcript-hillary-clinton-email-press-conference/)  *QUESTION: Madam Secretary, two quick follow ups. You mentioned the server. Thats one of the distinctions here.  This wasnt Gmail or Yahoo or something. This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it  was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary?  And then separately, will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president? Thank you.  CLINTON: Well, the system we used was set up for President Clintons office. And it had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.  So, I think that the  the use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure. Now, with respect to any sort of future  future issues, look, I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters. And I feel that Ive taken unprecedented steps to provide these work-related emails. Theyre going to be in the public domain. And I think that Americans will find that you know, interesting, and I look forward to having a discussion about that.*   The first part of the reporter's question was dead-on and very professional. "This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it  was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary?"  All the short, rapid fire questions were a nice way to target one overarching query:  Did the State Dept. approve this system and monitor it for security?   The reporter should have stopped right there. Instead, she bundled in a second question, a completely separate question, which gave Clinton a fast exit to a less thorny topic.   I've learned as a reporter it's best just to ask one question at these dog and pony shows. The best question. If you bundle two separate topics in two separate questions -- or three questions which was also done at the Clinton presser -- your odds of getting anything answered fall dramatically.   And if you just ask one question, and it gets a non-response, there's a chance another reporter may pick-up the thread and give it a try. If your one question isn't  answered, yell "follow-up," because the need for the follow-up will be obvious if the question isn't answered.     new would be old. someone who can't stand social media, and who still believes the best way to get information is to knock on doors and make phone calls, and who still understands that the world can't be defined in a collection of top 10 list.    human extinction is on the table?  I don't think so and hopefully it's not false optimism. Well before irreversible calamity we will react. We will put all our science, resources, vast intelligence, and powers of empathy and cooperation, to reverse course and undo the damage. But for this to happen, we need to get closer to the edge so the temps will rise at least two degrees before that happens.      Well, maybe it's true then that the media attracts narcissistic people who are insecure, need constant affirmation and tend to pump up accomplishments to win approval.    What's the difference between curator and gatekeeper?   The real issue is credit. MSM organizations seem to give credit, when they must, to the local blog that is first to report something significant.   Giving credit is the best that can be done here. MSM should treat the citizen journalists in their communities the same way they treat any pub they are referencing. It helps with credibility and improves, one hopes, mutual respect.    Curated lists arguably serve as gatekeepers because they source narrowly.     In my city, DC, centralized journalism works something like this: A local blog, for instance, reports on planning for a new condo in the neighborhood; real estate blogs do likewise, but carry their reporting further by writing about city-wide trends and mapping it to data. The centralized pubs, The Post, Washington Times, City Paper, and neighborhood print weekly newspapers, broaden the story into an assessment of District's changing landscape, affordability issues, and demographic shifts, and, most importantly, can get top officials to pick up the phone and explain what's going on, something the neighborhood blogs, and citizen journalists, can't do.    it's anon. it's unverified. the motivations of the writers are unknown. its dangerous and it won't give your story the authority it needs.       This is just depressing    I don't doubt that medical students might benefit from media training. But the idea of increasing the knowledge of journalists who report on these matters, is a good thing as well, and probably necessary.    Plainville as well. Loved that place. Popcorn, decent food. Nice atmosphere.    A fellow I worked with did just that. I believe the state even had a program to fast track professionals to a teaching certificate. I never had the chance to ask him how it worked out for him. But kind of believe that journalism and teaching are similar in a way, in as much as the people doing this work believe they are helping others.       I've used Sony IC recorders for years because of the transcription software: Sound Organizer and the earlier Digital Voice Editor. They have customize keyboard controls, so you can set up the Stop, Play, etc., to the key combination works best. I believe you can use this software for any mp3 file from any device, and probably other formats as well, But you are using a non-Sony recorder, you will probably have to make a number of clicks to bring up the file. Not that hard to do.   I'm very interested in Sony's field recorders, but don't believe they have native support for Sound Organizer. They are more targeted, it appears, for people recording live music, not journalists transcribing notes.   But very interested in hearing from anyone who prefers field recorders on the job over the more standard voice recorders.     Oh, right, climate change is real - 'let's build the pipeline.'   What they should have done is attached James Hansen's "game over" piece to the legislation: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/opinion/game-over-for-the-climate.html?_r=0  It's the height of irony that the Senate is approving a project that may send the earth's climate over the edge, while at the same time agreeing that climate change is real.   To say that this is totally f**** up is an understatement.    This is why I miss covering local news. The riches.   	45
 Alternate headline. Thanks to the ACA, average woman has other working people paying $255 for her birth control pills.   She doesn't really hate America. She hates those little insignificant people who work in places like bakeries and restaurants. Ewe, those icky unwashed masses.   Maybe it's because illegals are willing to work "under-the-table" for fifty bucks a day when Americans actually abide by the minimum wage laws.   The "for profit" part is meaningless. They all pay their administrators and staff with the wheel-barrows of cash student borrowers bring in.   This one is awesome   My cat is missing a top fang and his mouth does that same thing.

 I read something about that too. They said there is a dev for the combat system, another one for healing, another developed the water graphics and manages the water zones, and so on. Also, they are supposed to be relatives from the same family in a crazy geanological tree. I couldn't stand working with my family in the developing of such a big project even for a minute.   No developer? That would mean that the game always existed or maybe programmed itself, and that is ridiculous.   I started to use this potion after reading a lot of good things about the buff and the bonus in productivity, but later I quit after reading somebody advising that it doesn't go well with a character like mine, artist class with the OCD disadvantage.

I guess I've make some nice things but this is the one that comes to my mind. A fond memory.  I went to the cinema to watch The Two Towers with my best friend. At some moment I lied to him and told him "The movie is ending. See? Galadriel is making a speech, saying all hope is lost etc. They are setting all up for the next movie". And then the battle of Helm came and it was getting obvious that the movie was not ending. "But you told me the movie was ending". "I lied! Now comes 45 minutes of an epic battle scene!". He is a fan of LOTR and epic battle scenes so he enjoyed that surprise like a child. He kept on telling me "Thank you! Thank you!".  It was like I had told him that he was not gonna die, but live one month more and it will be full of awesome sex.

[The spanish laughing man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv-C2x8TrM0) went viral recently.  He is a very popular guy here in spanish tv. The funny thing is sometimes it's very hard to understand him even for spanish people, since he has a very deep andalucian accent.  [Here is the original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDiB4rtp1qw) with english subtitles, in case anybody wants to know what he really says.   Very useful. Thanks.   Necronomicon   Greetings, comrades. It's been a while since the last time I posted here. Now I come to you looking for help. I'm thinking about making a post about OCD in my blog, talking about things aspects like what OCD is, what causes it, what kind of OCDs there are, how is the life of a person with this disorder.  I would like some help looking for good documentation. What articles about OCD do you recommend? Which ones you really liked? Which ones did you find well explained and useful?  I could use the wikipedia article, of course, but that's not always the best option and I'd prefer texts written in more casual and "human" style, something less academic. And I could use Google, but experience tells me individual users are more helpful finding good material.  Thanks in advance.  Stay strong, my friends.   This is the only paranormal thing that ever happened to me.  When I was in highschool I went through my first severe depression. One night I realized one day I would die and I couldn't do anything to avoid this. My death could happen at any moment and it was getting closer one second at a time. I couldn't stop thinking about death, everyday, everyhour, from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. This was my first obssesive-compulsive episode.  For me, life was absurd, since everything finally vanishes in death. I started questioning myself about the meaning of life, about God and religion.  My family was a disfunctional one. The situation at home was a mess. I couldnt' focus on my studies due to all the shouting and arguments and tv noise. I stayed at my grandparents home for a time. I used to study in my grandfather's office. He is a fan of literature and has hundreds of books. Selfs and selfs full of books.  So one afternoon I got to a moment when I couldn't stand it anymore, I couldn't stand all the anxiety and sadness and confussion. In my mind I have a conversation with God: "Ok, God, if you do exist, if all this, life and existence, has a meaning, send my a sign".  So I went to my grandfather's library, took one of the hundreds of books he has, opened it in one of the hundreds of possible pages, and choose one of the hundreds of possible lines.  It said: "And then, he realized it was all true".   http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/horadeaventura/images/4/44/Oow.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130502202758 path-prefix=es   They should add a rule on this sub about doll pictures.   There is a story in the horror manga "Fuan no tane" very similar to this, only it's about a face in a door.   Do you feel guilty for this?   Even if we had sex robots that will always find us desirable no matter our look, people would still try to look sexy because its just fun. You know, getting ready for your lover, the rituals, the make up, looking for the perfect outfit... People would still like to look at themselves and think "Damn, I'm looking good!" (please don't read this in Duke Nukem voice).   I can't say. I only watched the first one. I don't trust very much in horror sequels, specially if they are spanish, and specially if they get to the ridiculous number 4.   *Fly in the forehead*   Could you record yourself reading/screaming this?   Good to know I'm not missing anything. I'm always curious.  The way you described makes me remember some of my favorite moments of the original movie were the silent and calm ones. That film has rythm.   Ok, ok, you are a cilinder. You convinced me.   "I don't know about that accent".   Do you know there is [REC] 4: Apocalipsis?   A mother called Africa   Quarantine is an adaptation of "Rec". You might be interested in watching it.     For me, The Fourth Kind was a failed attempt to convince you that something is real with the double gimmick of mockumentary and found footage. Not scary, even boring.   It has a scary aesthetic and use of sound, but actually it's quite long and slow.   As a spaniard, I'm glad to see a spanish film has had such a success outside our country.   I must say I haven't watched the remake (and I don't plan to do it) so some would say I can't really have an opinion. But personally, I don't think I need to watch it to know it's not better than the old one. What can you expect? What can this remake add to the original? Do they really think they can do it better than Spielberg and Tob Hooper together?   I've recommended this movie to people so many times, and it's so hard to do it without making any spoilers or generating too high expectations.   The 80's original classic, of course.   My personal favorites:  -The Shining.  -The Ring, both american and japanese versions, though I find the japanese to be more subtle.  -The Exorcist. I always tell people that this is the only movie that got to really scare me.  -The Saga V/H/S has some flaws but in general is very funny to watch.  -Funny Games, the original 1997 version, it will ruin your day.  -The Blair Witch Project.  -The Poughkeepsie Tapes. Quite irregular, but very scary for some moments. I bet many people have watched it just after find about [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAQNnnfLvkQ).  -Paranormal Activity. That fucking ending though, wtf man, why giving it such a clich ending... Damn.  -Poltergeist.  Edit: I like the first Shyamalan movies too: The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village. After those, Shyamalan turned shit.   [Elly Tran](http://acidcow.com/girls/58371-new-photos-of-elly-tran-ha-39-pics.html)  Feast your eyes.   I think this would happen if we got to find God is actually a totally different thing, like several alien entities running our universe in a huge computer simulation.   It's a character from the Hellboy and BRPD comics. If I recall correctly, he was having a spiritism session when a bomb destroyed the house and the people inside. So, his ectoplasmic spirit remained free and was later contained in a transparent suit. He has psychic habilities.  I guess I liked his personality. I prefer the [comic version](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/hellboy/images/5/5e/Johann_Kraus_002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140103030020) rather than the [film one](http://halo.bungie.org/images/johannkrauss.jpg) (Hellboy 2). He is deeper and more elegant.   [Beauty, by Rino Stefano Tagliafierro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVPgXJ_aVJo). It has a quite soundtrack though. You should check it out when you can.  Also look for long skateboard videos. They are awesome and you don't need the music soundtrack at all to enjoy them.   [I'm watching it now and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwXH1c--BzQ), god, this movie is even worse than I remembered it. There are more stupid details than I could see the first time in the theater.   I doubt nowadays they can make something as bad as Dungeons and Dragons.   Damn, you got me...   Hey, nice curtains!   Of course I'm not gonna try to define it or get into that old argument. I'm just stating an opinion. I'm an artist and that's how I personally feel about my work and art in general.   Thanks. It was pretty hard.   Yeah, I heard that the sequels are quite better.   That's surely even more anti-artistic, of course.   Are you planning to get that AI into a [wrecked police robot](http://artes9.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/chappie-wall-e-meets-district-9-and-robocop-what-s-not-to-like-dd18052f-1e71-4959-bbbc-36351e86b1b7.jpeg)?   I can't stand psychophonies. 2spooky4me.   Cat.   Being so sensitive about other people's rejection feelings, like hate or anger.   That's right. Thanks. I checked youtube and found some video called "I am a butterfly remix" so i thought it was the real title.  And yeah, Die Antwoord videos use to be very cool.   My point actually is that true art must not be made to please audience. It must be an act of passionate creation. Letting a lot of people changing your work of art is humiliating.  I mean, I understand that in the serious show business you have to get profits and satisfy your clients but I don't think that counts as sincere and real art.   [This.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5OXON8vIaA)  Sorry, I stole this joke from The Simpsons, actually.   Dungeons and dragons, the movie.

 They are not dropping in price THAT fast. For example I bought a 480GB Sandisk SSD from Amazon in December for $179, and when I look at the same drive now on Amazon and Newegg, it's around $170.   Be happy with what you have, as it's completely normal to watch prices drop after you buy the latest and greatest hardware.   I think $1500 was my out of pocket limit back then. Insurance covered everything else.   Whenever it happens, and if they are cheap, I suspect birth rates in developed countries will plummet. Especially for individuals outside of a marriage/long-term relationships.  Many of the guys I know who had kids when they were in their 20s did so because either they didn't want to wear a condom due to reduced sensations, or because their girlfriends forget to take the pill (or in some messed up situations told them they were taking it, but actually were not).  I'm hopeful that a pill would help reduce unexpected pregnancies across all populations, but for some of those that don't use their brains, I can't see them popping a pill everyday when they can barely pull their lives together.   I was in the hospital for almost a month in 2012 and my bill from the hospital itself was $174,000. But for the life of me I couldn't figure out where it all came from. The labs/imaging bills were separate, and when I talked to the billing department they weren't sure how to make sense of everything either... I had a bill for the same thing from two different providers. It was a clusterfuck.  Thankfully insurance saved me. But holy hell it seems like it's a headache for everyone involved.       This will surely calm racial tensions in this country...      $50 says this guy's favorite movie is Fight Club.   Staring straight ahead, taking a long swig and then slowly setting the glass back down on the table... before saying "... know your secret."  Someone like that would have a lot of secrets, and is probably pretty self-centered as well. Who wouldn't want to know what secret someone knows about them? It'd buy me time so I could finish my beer.   "Ask not what your country can do for your goddamn self... Ask what you can do for your motherfuckin country!"   I'm not sure why this is viewed as such a bad thing. If you take away the digital factor would people have problems with it? For example if the cops had a board of flyers with some criminals on it, and were standing at the entrance to the festival with their 'eyes open' to spotting any of those people... would there be such an outrage?   90 and I still feel like I'm teetering on the brink. I guess I should free up some assets if I ever want to dive into a pool of gold coins like scrooge mc duck.   I've seen dogs do this when they aren't normally allowed somewhere, but they are finally given a free pass. They refuse to make eye contact too because they still thing they are breaking the rules.   ISIS thus far hasn't shown any urge to try to take territory in Turkey. By opening a direct conflict with them it risks spreading the ISIS battles to Turkey. Plus Turkey sees the Kurds as a threat to the Turkish State and as long as the Kurds have their hands full battling ISIS, Turkey likely sees their threat level as reduced.   Turkey is a great ally to have in the Muslim world. But I'd like to see their current leader pushed aside by his people.  If you want a jackass ally, look to Saudi Arabia. That's an ally that should be an enemy IMO.   I don't think that's a fair comparison at all, the people of Turkey are predominantly secular in nature. It's their current government that's back tracking on their freedoms that made them a model Muslim-majority secular state.    I feel for the people for Turkey. They tried to rebel, but were hit with an iron fist, and now Erdogan is actively removing those that oppose him from high positions in the military, politics, and even journalism.   This is also something I've searched for in the past. There are not many services out there because regardless of the service you need to have the other person's bank data and/or they need to sign up for an account somewhere (paypal/etc) which is too much work to ask of customers.  A lot of banks have easy ways to send out electronic checks, and I've found that is the simplest. I also use something offered by Chase called Chase Quickpay. The recipient still needs to sign up, but they only sign up once and the money gets transferred directly to their bank account in the future.   Such containers aren't re-enforced well enough to be buried safely, and they would also need to be waterproofed and prepared for the elements. For the size, and the amount of work (re-enforcement, etc) required with a cargo container, it really makes more sense to build a concrete structure using re-bar or build a wide structure with steel.   Depressive / bipolar meltdown might be more accurate for what she's having... High functioning autism isn't defined to include such episodes, and typically has muted emotional responses rather than such excessive ones.   Whatever the cause, a dog makes it better!         What does this have to do with the Iranians? Their coup was nothing like the Turkish one. It was put into play by foreign powers, the Turkish one was home grown.   Looks like he wants to lay down a different type of pipe.   http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/2015/06/12/naacp-controversy-rachel-dolezals/71137976/      Modern Turkish history is full of coups, there were two successful coups not long before the one in 1980. The 1980 coup would have happened regardless of American involvement, and based on previous history it was almost guaranteed that it too would be a successful coup... so I don't think the US can be blamed for causing such a change, as it was inevitable.  Erdogan's biggest fear is of his military leaders, and he has been cracking down/removing senior leadership. When Turkey goes too far in the wrong direction, the military usually steps in.   IMO, there are a lot of variables left out that are required to give any kind of reasonable suggestions. Like:  * What's the location? * How much time are you willing to invest? * How much are you willing to sacrifice before making a profit? * What kind of skills do you have? * Do you have income outside of this 40 grand? * What's the least amount of profit you'd be happy with say 5 years down the road?  It's not a simple/easy question. There is a lot more than money involved when it comes to creating a successful business.   Much of it has been completely rewritten based on what I've read. To the point where it can really be considered a separate entity.  I'd say it's a relationship much like the original half-life engine GoldSrc and the Quake engine (which HL's engine was based off of).  But you're right, technically it still has some gamebryo in it.   It was released in 2011, it's almost 5 years old, which is pretty major mind trip to me.   They used a different engine in Skyrim which was developed in-house. Skyrim has beautiful graphics and it's the first generation of their new engine. I think their next Elder Scrolls game will be just fine without Unreal.      Sounds like a lot of fun.  I had a girl go into a yelling rage when I told her I bought a house because rents were skyrocketing and it now made more sense for me to buy than rent... I don't understand the people that get angry at individuals in the tech industry. It's not like we want to drive prices up, or want others to suffer.   Techie hate in Capitol Hill and neighborhoods around UW are reaching epidemic levels. Now when people ask what I do for work I generically tell them I'm in engineering, because if I mention software I know it's likely I'll hear an earful about how tech people are driving up housing costs.    After politics was removed as a default sub it started to leach out into other subs. Browsing the default subs is no longer as fun and relaxed as it used to be for me. It seems like every other post is a post that intends to get some kind of reaction out of users like "look what this company/person is doing?!?!", "our rights are being taken away!", or they are something like "check out this video from a talk show host talking about something political!", etc etc.  I've started to find myself going full circle. I'm actually using Digg again because of all of this political/sensationalist nonsense.   Whether cop shootings are justified or not, this is not a new pattern in the US, and the media/feds seem to put a very high focus on those involving minorities... It makes me wonder at times if there is an effort to sew discontent and chaos in this country. By who I do not know or wish to speculate, but you could not ask for a better campaign to cause tension in the population.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kyle_Dinkheller   So that's where McDonald's burgers come from...   *tips fedora      Lately r/nottheonion is just becoming the all hated r/politics .   I don't think the reason they are homeless is because they can't afford a home on the median salary.   It happens in the States too. I don't blame the Chinese individuals (doesn't everyone want to make money?) but it is very frustrating. I lost out on two houses when I was searching to buy because investors put down an offer of cash that I could not compete with...   I think it's partially because while they are generally safe barring tremendous external forces or operator error... nobody wants to live by one. I am all for building new nuclear power plants with the latest designs, but even then I would not want one built near me. So unless they build them in the middle of the desert, the reaction from nearby residents might be overwhelming enough to keep them from building new plants.

I'm really hoping Snapchat builds a client for Windows Phone 10.      Walmart is a big believer in Tesla and is one of their top customers for batteries that are supported by the Solar City company (of which Tesla is associated).  It seems like this article is all about making connections between companies and their own agendas. Just because the family is invested in a company building solar power plants that wants to survive its competition (at home solar panels), doesn't mean they are anti-solar.        It hasn't been a military dictatorship for day to day politics. The military has upheld a secular Turkey in the past when leaders have moved away from it. I would say the reason Turkey has remained a model secular state for so long is BECAUSE of the the military. As Erdogan has gained more and more power he has targeted some existing military leadership as 'opposition' and worked to lessen there power... I'm hopeful the military will step in at some point and warn Erdogan against making more anti-secular moves.    "Sorry, I'm busy and don't have time to talk at the moment" - and walk away   No, as it was a mistake it's neither income nor gains. It's not going to show up on any tax forms, and obviously you wouldn't count it as income yourself.   Turkey used to be the model secular majority Muslim state, Erdogan is quickly changing that...   But a lot of utilities are building/testing batteries for Wind and Solar installations for example, so it's not clear if some of the wind/solar energy (or any energy source) gets counted twice (once being generated at the installation, and again coming out of the battery).   Seeing "batteries" on a chart of sources of energy production seems really odd to me.   Playing video games by yourself. When I was younger when somebody asked me what I did the previous night, saying "just stayed at home and played some games" was totally acceptable. But as I became older it's not something I really want to admit to, because I feel like as an adult I should be doing more productive things.   Do you want to activate militias? Because this is how you activate militias.   American construction is also top notch.    Chinese construction is top notch these days. They've started to copy/enforce a lot of Western Standards.

Such nationalism needs conflict or the sense of conflict to grow, and Putin probably would not stop short of war to continue stoking the nationalist flare.      That's why I blamed the "scientific publication community", ie: the publishers. If well-known respectable publishers don't enforce quality standards equally across their publications (conferences included) and don't hold publishers they partner with accountable, it's a fault that should absolutely be addressed, but it doesn't seem to be.   That's precisely my original point. In this example, both IEEE and Springer are very respectable in the community, but they and other publishers don't apply their review processes in a consistent manner to identify fraud. And in cases where fraud research is found to have been published, they should make the changes to address it. I don't see indications of that happening.   They were not scam journals, unless we are thinking of different incidents. This is the incident I'm referring to: http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763 . Though I wouldn't be surprised if there are more. The publishers included Springer and IEEE, both of which are well trusted publishers:   Ruth Francis, UK head of communications at Springer, says that the company has contacted editors, and is trying to contact authors, about the issues surrounding the articles that are coming down. The relevant conference proceedings were peer reviewed, she confirms  making it more mystifying that the papers were accepted.   The IEEE would not say, however, whether it had contacted the authors or editors of the suspected SCIgen papers, or whether submissions for the relevant conferences were supposed to be peer reviewed. We continue to follow strict governance guidelines for evaluating IEEE conferences and publications, Stickel said.   I read it. I'm not suggesting just the journal itself should have caught it, but rather that the 'research' became so prominent across media and people in positions to correct the misinformation didn't really question it.   It's not just infamously bad journals publishing fake papers, it's been a problem with other journals as well. A couple of years ago a CS team at a university created a paper generator and submitted the papers to some well known and generally trusted journals, and the papers were published even though they were non-nonsensical.     If the scientific publication community didn't quickly identify this as a sham or even questionable, it makes me wonder just how many papers are published that contain false research where the author(s) **didn't** want to get caught.   It took me a year of searching for houses and making offers before I had my offer accepted (and only because the previous investors who had their offer accepted backed out). That was in February, and I paid around $450k for the house, which is not very far off from what the value estimate was on Zillow. Now 3 months later the value estimate is $530k, and a fixer-upper house down the street just sold for $500k. It's an absolutely crazy market right now.   The police must be frustrated. Mexico officially lacks capital punishment, and it seems each time federal forces capture and jail cartel members they either escape from prison or are released by the corrupt.     I grew up on a farm and we used multiple gopher exterminators and they always killed them. I think no kill services are probably more common in highly populated areas.         The issue here is that energy weapons are banned via "international rules of war" against enemy personnel. So laser attacks against infantry would be 'banned'. IMO the military should just do it anyway to reduce collateral damage, but a superpower ignoring international weapon conventions would not set a very good precedent.    I wish the US government would change our Middle Eastern policy and give more recognition to the potential benefits of an Iranian ally. Though it's very far from perfect, Iran is actually very moderate now and is far more in line with our principles than other allies such as Saudi Arabia. If we were to base our friends and foes upon principle, Saudi Arabia would be one of our top enemies.       Most family farmers need subsidies to survive and be able to produce food for others. The ones that don't need subsidies are the big corporation farms (usually created by buying out family farms). I wish more people understood this... Family farmers are not getting rich off the government. Even with subsidies most still struggle.    Though at a certain point the composition of the atmosphere would take effect, the primary factor behind tree lines is temperature. At a certain point it becomes too cold for the species to survive, or there is too much moisture that remains as snow cover for them to get started.  The atmospheric composition statement can quickly be debunked by comparing altitudes of tree lines across different regions. In tropical and warmer climates you'll find trees at much higher altitudes (in many cases all the way to the mountain tops), where as in colder climates the tree lines will generally be much lower. If the primary factor were atmospheric composition you'd find tree lines across the world were much more uniform in altitude.   Awesome. Thanks, this is very interesting. I have an neurodegenerative illness based on autoimmune disorder. I may try something like this just for experimentation sake. Have you tried it before?    Do you have sources? I like to keep an open mind, but I'm very skeptical of such a thing having even the slightest positive effect on immune system function. It sounds like pseudo-science.

The catered food was better than the stuff they gave the students (though not by much). There was one time I was told the cut beef so I went back and grabbed some. But it was the steak that they serve to catered events. I was told to put it pack and get the proper meat for the students, which was like 15 pounds of solid meat with about 6 pounds of it being fat. I had to cut all the fat off before I could even start cutting the meat that was on there   They did the same at my school. They threw left overs on the pizza or made a sandwich out of it. The options were meatloaf sandwiches and macaroni and cheese pizza    I went to a small school. Meal plans were required to be bought if you lived on campus and were included as part of room/board fees.      The employees were some of the nicest people you'd ever meet. There were several older ladies that that adored the students and the students loved them back. It was the Aramark management that was shitty and only cared about cutting corners whenever they could.

Relevant text:  Kangatarianism is a recent practice of following a diet which excludes meat except kangaroo on environmental and ethical grounds. Several Australian newspapers wrote about the neologism "kangatarianism" in February 2010, describing eating a vegetarian diet with the addition of kangaroo meat as a choice with environmental benefits because indigenous wild kangaroos require no extra land or water for farming and produce little methane (a greenhouse gas), unlike cattle. Advocates of kangatarianism also choose it because Australian kangaroos live natural lives, eat organic food, and are killed humanely. For similar reasons, Australians have discussed eating only the meat of Australian feral camels ("cameltarianism").      Please tell me you're joking right now.        God dammit, get these fucking useless posts outta here!  Regardless of what your mom told you, you're not as important as you think you are.   Relevant text:  Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Dogs for Defense was (DFD) was established. Word soon got out that the armed forces needed dogs. Thousands of patriotic pet owners across America responded by donating their pets for enlistment into the K-9 Corps. Little did a family from Pleasantville, NY know that their shepherd mix, Chips, would become the most decorated dog hero of World War II.  Spirited and quick to learn, Chips served bravely as a tank guard dog, traveling throughout Europe, Africa, and Italy with General Patton's Seventh Army.  On one occasion, Chips alerted to an impending ambush. Then, with a phone cable attached to his collar, Chips ran back to base, dodging gunfire so that the endangered platoon could establish a communications line and ask for the backup they so desperately needed.  Perhaps the event that most exemplifies his courage and devotion occurred early one morning on a beach in Sicily. As he and his handler proceeded up the beach, they came under fire from a disguised pillbox. Chips broke free from his handler and launched himself right into the pillbox. Moments later several bitten and surrendering Italian soldiers emerged, all shepherded by a very determined Chips.  Though wounded in the melee, Chips returned to duty that night, and alerted troops to an approaching group of Italians. This allowed his handler and squad time to capture all of them.  Chips was a true hero. He was awarded a Silver Star for valor, and a Purple Heart for his wounds. The newspapers heralded his exploits. Unfortunately, the press attracted the attention of the Commander of the Order of the Purple Heart. He complained to both President Roosevelt and the War Department, claiming that by so honoring Chips, they were demeaning all the men who have been awarded a Purple Heart. Chips' medals were taken away, and he was given an honorable discharge and returned to his family in Pleasantville. No military dog has received an official decoration since.  The debate surrounding the giving of metals to military dogs not only led to the denying of dogs the right to recognition for their efforts, but also paved the way for the military to classify them as "equipment" -- a classification that would cost them dearly. When the US pulled out of Vietnam, the military dogs were classified as "equipment" and left behind. Despite earnest efforts to bring the dogs home, the order to abandon them was firm. Over 4,000 dogs served in Vietnam, many sacrificing their lives. They saved thousands of American soldiers from death or injury. Stories vary as to what became of these valiant canines, but one thing is known to a certainty is that they shared all 24/7 with their handler. These dogs gave their full measure of devotion -- whatever the danger -- but they did not get to share the freedom of coming home.       They made tintypes of Mary, and he received one. As the story goes, the rope used to hang the conspirators was cut up and distributed to the members of the unit. We still have both of these items in our family.   Wow that is amazing!  Nice pieces of history right there!   Relevant text:  Construction of the gallows for the hanging of the conspirators condemned to death, among them Mary Surratt, began immediately on July 5 after the execution order was signed. It was constructed in the south part of the Arsenal courtyard, was 12 feet (3.7 m) high and about 20 square feet (1.9 m2) in size. Captain Christian Rath, who oversaw the preparations for the executions, made the nooses. Tired of making nooses and thinking that the government would never hang a woman, he made Surratt's noose the night before the execution with five loops rather than the regulation seven. He tested the nooses that night by tying them to a tree limb and a bag of buckshot, then tossing the bag to the ground (the ropes held). Civilian workers did not want to dig the graves out of superstitious fear, so Rath asked for volunteers among the soldiers at the Arsenal and received more help than he needed.  At noon on July 6, Surratt was informed she would be hanged the next day. She wept profus She was joined by two Catholic priests (Jacob Walter and B.F. Wiget) and her daughter Anna. Father Jacob remained with her almost until her death. Her menstrual problems had worsened, and she was in such pain and suffered from such severe cramps that the prison doctor gave her wine and medication. She repeatedly asserted her innocence. She spent the night on her mattress, weeping and moaning (in pain and grief), ministered to by the priests. Anna left her mother's side at 8 A.M. on July 7, and went to the White House to beg for her mother's life one last time. Her entreaty rejected, she returned to the prison and her mother's cell at about 11 A.M. The soldiers began testing the gallows about 11:25 A.M.; the sound of the tests unnerved all the prisoners. Shortly before noon, Mary Surratt was taken from her cell and then allowed to sit in a chair near the entrance to the courtyard. The heat in the city that day was oppressive. By noon, it had already reached 92.3 F (33.5 C). The guards ordered all visitors to leave at 12:30 P.M. When she was forced to part from her mother, Anna's hysterical screams of grief could be heard throughout the prison.  Clampitt and Aiken had not finished trying to save their client, however. On the morning of July 7, they asked a District of Columbia court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction over their client. The court issued the writ at 3 A.M., and it was served on General Winfield Scott Hancock. Hancock was ordered to produce Surratt by 10 A.M. General Hancock sent an aide to General John F. Hartranft, who commanded the Old Capitol Prison, ordering him not to admit any United States marshal (as this would prevent the marshal from serving a similar writ on Hartranft). President Johnson was informed that the court had issued the writ, and promptly cancelled it at 11:30 A.M. under the authority granted to him by the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863.  General Hancock and United States Attorney General James Speed personally appeared in court and informed the judge of the cancellation of the writ.  On July 7, 1865, at 1:15 P.M., a procession led by General Hartranft escorted the four condemned prisoners through the courtyard and up the steps to the gallows. Each prisoner's ankles and wrists were bound by manacles. Mary Surratt led the way, wearing a black bombazine dress, black bonnet, and black veil. More than 1,000 peopleincluding government officials, members of the U.S. armed forces, friends and family of the accused, official witnesses, and reporterswatched. General Hancock limited attendance to those who had a ticket, and only those who had a good reason to be present were given a ticket. (Most of those present were military officers and soldiers, as fewer than 200 tickets had been printed.) Alexander Gardner, who had photographed the body of Booth and taken portraits of several of the male conspirators while they were imprisoned aboard naval ships, photographed the execution for the government. Hartranft read the order for their execution. Surratt, either weak from her illness or swooning in fear (perhaps both), had to be supported by two soldiers and her priests. The condemned were seated in chairs, Surratt almost collapsing into hers. She was seated to the right of the others, the traditional "seat of honor" in an execution. White cloth was used to bind their arms to their sides, and their ankles and thighs together. The cloths around Surratt's legs were tied around her dress below the knees. Each person was ministered to by a member of the clergy. From the scaffold, Powell said, "Mrs. Surratt is innocent. She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us". Fathers Jacob and Wiget prayed over Mary Surratt, and held a crucifix to her lips. About 16 minutes elapsed from the time the prisoners entered the courtyard until they were ready for execution.  A white bag was placed over the head of each prisoner after the noose was put in place. Surratt's bonnet was removed, and the noose put around her neck by a Secret Service officer. She complained that the bindings about her arms hurt, and the officer preparing said, "Well, it won't hurt long." Finally, the prisoners were asked to stand and move forward a few feet to the nooses. The chairs were removed. Mary Surratt's last words, spoken to a guard as he moved her forward to the drop, were "Please don't let me fall."  Surratt and the others stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath clapped his hands. Four soldiers of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the dropher body snapping tight at the end of the rope, swinging back and forth.Surratt's death appeared to be the easiest. Atzerodt's stomach heaved once and his legs quivered, and then he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.

It was based on a scholarly reconstruction of an ancient Sumerian recipe known as the "hymn to Ninkasi". The recipe started with a twice-baked bread known as bappir as well as malt, and was sweetened with honey and dates. It did not include hops or other bittering ingredients, so it was considerably sweeter than modern beers. The recipe is described by Charlie Papazian. Also in 1989, the brewing process for a batch of Steam was interrupted during the Loma Prieta earthquake. The resulting (altered) brew was released as normal Anchor Steam, but with an inverted label; this beer has come to be referred to as Earthquake Beer.       Relevant text:   So.

The earliest known fossils of the great white shark are about 16 million years old. However, the phylogeny of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a prehistoric shark, such as the C. megalodon. C. megalodon had teeth that were superficially not too dissimilar with those great white sharks but its teeth were far larger. Although cartilaginous skeletons do not fossilize, C. megalodon is estimated to have been considerably larger than the great white shark, estimated at up to at least 17 m (56 ft) and 59,413 kg (130,983 lb). Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and C. megalodon led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name Carcharodon megalodon was applied to the latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the C. megalodon and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family Lamnidae). The great white is also more closely related to an ancient mako shark, Isurus hastalis, than to the C. megalodon, a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012. In addition, the new hypothesis assigns C. megalodon to the genus Carcharocles, which also comprises the other megatoothed sharks; Otodus obliquus is the ancient representative of the extinct Carcharocles lineage.

Relevant text:  The Ford Mustang was brought out five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The earliest versions are often referred to as 1964 models, but VIN coded by Ford and titled as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964 production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). with production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964;[10] the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.  Executive stylist John Najjar, who was a fan of the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, is credited by Ford to have suggested the name. Najjar co-designed the first prototype of the Ford Mustang known as Ford Mustang I in 1961, working jointly with fellow Ford stylist Philip T. Clark. The Mustang I made its formal debut at the United States Grand Prix in Watkins Glen, New York on October 7, 1962, where test driver and contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney lapped the track in a demonstration using the second "race" prototype. His lap times were only slightly off the pace of the F1 race cars.  An alternative view was that Robert J. Eggert, Ford Division market research manager, first suggested the Mustang name. Eggert, a breeder of quarterhorses, received a birthday present from his wife of the book, The Mustangs by J. Frank Dobie in 1960. Later, the book's title gave him the idea of adding the "Mustang" name for Ford's new concept car. The designer preferred Cougar or Torino (and an advertising campaign using the Torino name was actually prepared), while Henry Ford II wanted T-bird II. As the person responsible for Ford's research on potential names, Eggert added "Mustang" to the list to be tested by focus groups; Mustang, by a wide margin, came out on top under the heading: "Suitability as Name for the Special Car." The name could not be used in Germany, however, because it was owned by Krupp, which had manufactured trucks between 1951 and 1964 with the name Mustang. Ford refused to buy the name for about US$10,000 from Krupp at the time. Kreidler, a manufacturer of mopeds, also used the name, so Mustang was sold in Germany as the "T-5" until December 1978.  Mustangs grew larger and heavier with each model year until, in response to the 19711973 models, Ford returned the car to its original size and concept for 1974. It has since seen several platform generations and designs. Although some other pony cars have seen a revival, the Mustang is the only original pony car to remain in uninterrupted production over five decades of development and revision.

Four children died of hemolytic uremic syndrome and 600 others were reported sick after eating undercooked patties contaminated with fecal material containing the bacteria at a location in Tacoma, Washington and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. The chain was faced with several lawsuits, each of which was quickly settled (but left the chain nearly bankrupt and losing customers). At the time, Washington state law required that hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 155 F (68 C), the temperature necessary to kill E. coli bacteria, although the FDA requirement at that time was only 140 F (60 C), which was the temperature Jack in the Box cooked. After the incident, Jack in the Box mandated that in all nationwide locations, their hamburgers be cooked to at least 155 F (68 C). Additionally, all meat products produced in the United States are required to comply with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) regulations. Every company that produces meat products is required to have a HACCP plan that is followed continuously.

In October 1963, Valachi testified before Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations that the Mafia did exist.  Valachi's motivations for becoming an informer have been the subject of some debate. Valachi claimed to be testifying as a public service and to expose a powerful criminal organization that he blamed for ruining his life, but it is also possible he was hoping for government protection as part of a plea bargain in which he was sentenced to life imprisonment and avoiding the death penalty for a murder which he committed in prison on June 22, 1962. While in prison, Valachi feared that mob boss Vito Genovese had ordered his death as a traitor. Using a pipe left near some construction work, he bludgeoned to death an inmate whom he mistook for Joseph DiPalermo, a Mafia member he believed was commissioned to kill him. (Valachi and Genovese were both serving sentences for heroin trafficking.) After time with FBI handlers, Valachi came forward with a story of Genovese giving him a kiss on the cheek, which he took as a "kiss of death".  When Joseph Valachi decided to cooperate with the Justice Department, attorney William G. Hundley became the mobster's protector. "We'd put dark glasses and wigs on him and take him to the Roma restaurant. He was a hell of a guy. . . . My days with Valachi convinced me that the Cosa Nostra was the most overrated thing since the Communist Party."  Although Valachi's disclosures never led directly to the prosecution of many Mafia leaders, he was able to provide many details of its history, operations and rituals, aiding in the solution of several unsolved murders, as well as naming many members and the major crime families. His testimony, which was broadcast on radio and television and published in newspapers, was devastating for the mob, still reeling from the November 14, 1957 Apalachin Meeting, where state police had accidentally discovered several Mafia bosses from all over the United States meeting at the Apalachin home of mobster Joseph Barbara. Following Valachi's testimony, the mob was no longer invisible to the public.  After the U.S. Department of Justice first encouraged and then blocked publication of Valachi's memoirs, a biography heavily influenced by those memoirs and by interviews with Valachi was written by journalist Peter Maas and published in 1968 as The Valachi Papers, forming the basis for a later movie of the same title starring Charles Bronson in the title role.

Due to the cloistered nature of Amish lifestyle, they are often reluctant to bring complaints to local police who describe the attacks as "very rare". In September 2012, a group of 16 Amish men and women from Bergholz, Ohio, were convicted on Federal hate-crime and conspiracy charges, including Samuel Mullet Sr., who did not participate in the five hair- and beard-cutting attacks but was tried as the leader of the campaign. Initially Samuel Mullet Sr. was sentenced to 15 years in prison on February 8, 2013, with fifteen others receiving lighter sentences ranging from one year and one day to seven years; after these convictions were overturned in August 2014 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, these sentences were reduced in March 2015.

A military guard was first posted on March 25, 1926. The first 24-hour guard was posted on midnight, July 2, 1937. The Tomb of the Unknowns has been guarded continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, since that time. Inclement weather, terrorist attacks, et cetera, do not cause the watch to cease.  Since 1948, the Tomb Guards, a special platoon within the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) work on a team rotation of 24 hours on, 24 hours off, for five days, taking the following four days off. A guard takes an average of six hours to prepare his uniform  heavy wool, regardless of the time of year  for the next day's work. In addition to preparing the uniform, guards also conduct physical training, Tomb Guard training, participate in field exercises, cut their hair before the next work day, and at times are involved in regimental functions as well. Tomb Guards are required to memorize 17 pages of information about Arlington National Cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one.  A special Army decoration, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge is authorized for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions (from a pool of more than 300), a uniform test with two gigs (errors) or fewer (measured to the 1/64"), and a test on the guard changing sequence. After serving honorably for a period of nine months, and having passed the sequence of tests, a Tomb Guard is permanently awarded the Badge. Since the first award on February 7, 1958, fewer than 700 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this Badge, including three women. A small number of Tomb Guard Identification Badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as Guards before 1959. Those numbers make the Badge the second rarest award currently issued in the United States Army; only the Army Astronaut Badge is rarer.  The badge was designed in 1956 and first issued to members of the Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns on February 7, 1958. The badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item, meaning the soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the Honor Guard. Upon leaving the duty, the badge was returned and reissued to incoming soldiers. In 1963, a regulation was enacted that allowed the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform, even after the soldier's completion of duty at the Tomb of the Unknowns.

Relevant text:  To restore his family's income, Grant wrote several articles on his Civil War campaigns for The Century Magazine at $500 each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, Robert Underwood Johnson, suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done. Grant's articles would serve as the basis for several chapters.  In the summer of 1884, Grant complained of a soreness in his throat, but put off seeing a doctor until late October where he finally learned it was throat cancer. Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; it would be his last public appearance. In March of the following year, the New York Times finally announced that Grant was dying of cancer and a nationwide public concern for the former president began. Later, Grant, who had forfeited his military pension when he assumed the presidency, was honored by his friends and the Congress when he was restored to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay.  Despite his debilitating illness, Grant worked diligently on his memoirs at his home in New York City, and then from a cottage on the slopes of Mount McGregor, finishing only days before he died. Grant asked his former staff officer, Adam Badeau, to help edit his work. Grant's son Fred assisted with references and proofreading. Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant accepted a better offer from his friend, Mark Twain, who proposed a 75 percent royalty. His memoir ends with the Civil War, and does not cover the post-war years, including his presidency.  The book, Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, was a critical and commercial success. In the end, Julia Grant received about $450,000 in royalties. The memoir has been highly regarded by the public, military historians, and literary critics. Grant portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero, whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness. He candidly depicted his battles against both the Confederates and internal army foes. Twain called the Memoirs a "literary masterpiece." Given over a century of favorable literary analysis, reviewer Mark Perry states that the Memoirs are "the most significant work" of American non-fiction.      Wow.

Relevant text:  One day early in May 1830, four men armed with scissors and razors attacked Palmer outside a Fitchburg hotel and attempted to shave him. Palmer successfully fended off his attackers. He was even able to use his jackknife to wound the legs of two of his assailants. Charged with "unprovoked assault," Palmer was arraigned a few days later before Judge David Brigham and fined. Palmer refused to pay the ten dollar fine, nearly forty dollars in court fees, and a seven hundred dollar bond that resulted from his conviction for the crime of defending himself. Palmer was thrown into the Worcester County Jail and kept there for more than a year for refusing to pay the fine. Palmer kept a detailed journal of his fifteen months in the jail; the original is preserved in the archive at Fruitlands Museum. His prison diary records the words and actions of his often sadistic jailers, the experiences of his fellow prisoners, and his own steadfastness in resisting the efforts of the state and society to break him of his unconventional habits and opinions. Palmer's term in jail was extremely unpleasant at times. He was dangerously sick during his first few weeks behind bars. Later, he was beaten several times by the jailers, nearly starved for days at a time, placed in solitary confinement for several months, and physically threatened by other prisoners who tried to cut off his beard. But Palmer made life nearly as difficult for the officials who were keeping him in the jail as they made it for him. To Calvin Willard, Sheriff of Worcester County, he sent a constant stream of letters, complaining of the poor conditions in the jail. One time, to prove to the sheriff how little food he was receiving, he sent Willard a package containing every morsel of food the jailers had given him in one day. For such acts, his jail keepers, especially Hosea Bellows and Dorance Wilder, treated Palmer even worse. On September 22, 1830, after a little more than four months in prison, Palmer exploded in distress and fury at the treatment he and his follow prisoners were receiving. He paid for his outburst by spending the next three months in solitary confinement.  Throughout his imprisonment, Palmer insisted that he was innocent and that to pay a fine, even only ten dollars, would equate to admitting his own guilt. Palmers case became something of an embarrassment to county authorities, who realized that his jail term was far exceeding his "crime," and they sent several committees to the jail to convince him to leave. They offered to waive the seven hundred dollar bond, if he would only pay the fine and court fees. Palmer told one of the committees, "If I aint [sic] a safe person to have my Liberty I ought not to go out. And I am willing to stay in confinement til [sic] I am." It was not until David Brigham, the judge who had originally fined Palmer, came to the Worcester prison and begged Palmer to relent. Brigham also carried a letter from Palmer's mother, a woman well into her eighties, pleading with him to come home. On August 31, 1831, after more than fifteen months in prison, Palmer paid his fine and left the jail. Palmer publicized his case by writing letters from jail that were widely published after first appearing in the Worcester Spy. When he later visited Boston in 1840, crowds on the street mocked him.  **EDIT**: Check out his [gravestone](http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2015/04/16/joseph_palmer_beard_warrior_is_buried_beneath_a_headstone_that_shows_off.html).

Relevant text:  Queen had been working on the song under the title "Feel Like" but were not yet satisfied with the result.[9][10] David Bowie had originally come to Mountain Studios in order to sing backing vocals on another Queen song, "Cool Cat", which would end up being edited since he was not satisfied with it. Editing it out meant it delayed the release of the album by weeks as it was meant to be released only a day after Bowie was not satisfied. Once he got there, they worked together for a while and wrote the song.The final version that became "Under Pressure" evolved from a jam session that Bowie had with the band at Queen's studio in Montreux, Switzerland; therefore it was credited as co-written by the five musicians. The scat singing that dominates much of the song is evidence of the jam-beginnings as improvisation. According to Queen bassist John Deacon (as quoted in a French magazine in 1984), however, the song's primary or main musical songwriter was Freddie Mercury  though all contributed to the arrangement. Brian May recalled to Mojo magazine in October 2008 that, "It was hard, because you had four very precocious boys and David, who was precocious enough for all of us. David took over the song lyrically. Looking back, it's a great song but it should have been mixed differently. Freddie and David had a fierce battle over that. It's a significant song because of David and its lyrical content." The earlier, embryonic version of the song without Bowie, "Feel Like", is widely available in bootleg form, and was written by Queen drummer Roger Taylor.  There has been some confusion about who created the song's bassline. John Deacon said (in Japanese magazine Musiclife in 1982, and in the previously mentioned French magazine) that David Bowie had created it. In more recent interviews, Brian May and Roger Taylor have credited the bass riff to Deacon. Bowie, on his website, said that the bassline was already written before he became involved. Roger Taylor, in an interview for the BBC documentary Queen: the Days of Our Lives, stated that Deacon had indeed created the bassline, stating that all through the sessions in the studio he had been playing the riff over and over; he also claims that when the band returned from dinner Deacon had, amusingly, forgotten the riff, but fortunately Taylor was still able to remember it.

Davis Milling Company in St. Joseph, Missouri, to represent "Aunt Jemima", an advertising character named after a song from a minstrel show. Davis Milling had recently acquired the formula to a ready-mixed, self-rising pancake flour from St. Joseph Gazette editor Chris L. Rutt and Charles Underwood and were looking to employ an African-American woman as a Mammy archetype to promote their new product. In 1893 Green was introduced as Aunt Jemima at the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago, where it was her job to operate a pancake-cooking display. Her amicable personality and talent as a cook for the Walker family, whose children grew up to become Chicago Circuit Judge Charles M. Walker and Dr. Samuel Walker. helped establish a successful showing of the product, for which she received a medal and certificate from the Expo officials. After the Expo, Green was offered a lifetime contract to adopt the Aunt Jemima moniker and promote the pancake mix. This marked the beginning of a major promotional push by the company that included thousands of personal appearances and Aunt Jemima merchandising. Nancy Green maintained her job with Davis Milling (which was renamed Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1914) until her death in 1923, she was still working as Aunt Jemima at the time. A lawsuit claims that Nancy Green's heirs as well as other heirs from the other women used as Aunt Jemima models deserve $2 billion and a share of future revenue from the sales of popular demand. The federal lawsuit was filed in Chicago by another model (Anna Short Harrington) grandsons who claim that she and Green were the roots in creating the recipe for the nation's first self- proclaimed pancaked mix. It also states that Green was the originator and came up with the idea of adding powdered milk for extra flavor in the pancakes. Quaker Oats, who is the current owner of the brand, says this image of Aunt Jemima was in fact fake and never real claiming that there are no trace of contracts between the women who displayed as Aunt Jemima models and their bosses.

Relevant text:  Article 11 has been a point of contention in popular culture disputes on the doctrine of separation of church and state as it applies to the founding principles of the United States. Some religious spokesmen claim thatdespite unanimous ratification by the U.S. Senate in Englishthe text which appears as Article 11 in the English translation does not appear in the Arabic text of the treaty. Some historians, secular and religious, have argued that the phrase specifically refers to the government and not the culture, that it only speaks of the founding and not what America became or might become, and that many Founding Fathers and newspapers described America as a Christian nation during the early Republic.  **Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims]; and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Muslim] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.**  According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at Purdue University, the assurances in Article 11 were "intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers." Lambert writes,  "By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.  The treaty was printed in the Philadelphia Gazette and two New York papers, with only scant public dissent, most notably from William Cobbett.

So basically, the Taliban has to stay in the shadows, cherry pick some attacks when it makes sense, and just survive long enough for the coalition funding and popular sentiment on the homefront to dry up.  Not ragging on coalition troops, but that's basically the scenario.  **Edit:** by country I am referring to their land, not literally their country. I am not inferring nationalism.   I was out walking my dog one night. Everything is dark, and suddenly something lights up to my side. I yurn and look.  It's my neighbor's window, and his wife is on the other side, topless. It takes a split second to sink in what I'm seeing. As soon as it clicks I do a "OHSHITTURNAWAYNOW" but not before she looks up, sees me, and throws her window shut.   Basically, beef fat doesn't taste like much of anything. Pig fat (and schmaltz) taste great which is why they're frequently used in cooking. Beef fat is good for making soap, and making puddings (not in that order).  If you're worried the fat content is too low, add some pork belly, fatty bacon or even frozen unsalted butter to the grind.   I had the surgery when I was about 14. Sadly they grew back. Unevenly. It kinda sucks. Now 31 and while its not as bad (eating very well, working out regularly) it's still a reason to go swimming with a shirt.    This was something I was going to say. No one here knows what OP's sister's relationship is like. They may be in a long term open relationship and she knows already, and may even approve.   Thanks for actually answering and not rating me down for asking a question like some other asshole. The genesis only supported rf and rca which is why I asked.   Um, did s-video exist near the sunset of the snes?   Nono youre thinking of revenge.   3 ingredient peanut butter cookies. 1 egg. 1 cup peanut butter (use junky peanut butter, not natural). 1 cup sugar (usually I mix half white and half brown for flavor).  Mix until smooth. Roll into balls, roll in some more sugar. Put on a baking sheet covered in parchment. Press indentations on the top with a wet fork. Bake at 350 for about 8 minutes.   Are you sure you cured in pink himalayan salt? That's a finishing salt, not curing salt.  You need to use insta-cure #1/prague powder, aka pink salt. It's way less expensive, and it contains sodium nitrite for curing and color.  They're not interchangeable. You could actually make yourself sick using the wrong one when you're curing meats (normal salt doesn't kill bacteria near as fast, which means bad bacteria have time to multiply and create toxins that persist even after the salt eventually kills them).   Give this a shot - make it your way, but then refrigerate it for a few hours. Then steam it back up to ~200. You'll get your fall apart tender pastrami, plus it should be slice-able.  Edit: hey idiot who rated me down, this is the method used by Katz deli, home of the best pastrami on earth. Smoke til collagen is melted, refrigerate til cold, then steam for slicing.   Rape is no laughing matter. Unless you're raping a clown.   Do you have a shower at work? Changing facilities? If yes, do you have somewhere where you can store toiletries? To be as minimal as possible i usually carried combination shower/bodywash.  Make sure your bike has a rear fender on it, or you'll be covered in mud.   Also make sure you have a way to tie your slacks to your ankles. Getting slacks caught in your crank or covered in bike grease sucks. It's less noticable on jeans, but it can still shred them up something fierce. [Brooks makes these straps that are lovely, but a touch pricey](http://www.brooksengland.com/catalogue-and-shop/bags/other+brooks+products/Trouser+Strap/).  Put some cash back each week in case it rains really bad. If it rains, call an Uber/lyft car to take you home. Summer rains aren't too bad, but the day you get caught in a winter rain that leads to a chill and a cold, you'll be kicking yourself for not just getting a ride. A poncho isn't horrible but be careful it doesn't get caught in the crank/chain/pedal or it can make a mess.  A flat fix kit is always a good idea.  Make sure you have lights on your bike, and a damn good u-lock and cable if it has to be stored outside. Don't trust building security. I had a favorite MTB get stolen off a bike rack in the middle of one of the busiest squares in downtown Philadelphia, where there were security guards and cameras stationed the entire day.  If your commute is long, get grip extensions so you can move your hands if they get tired. A rear view to attach to your bike or helmet is helpful and I have friends who swear by them, but I always just prefer turning physically.  If you pass through any very slow traffic areas (10-25mph), get a cyclocomputer that can track speed. A cop WILL stop you for speeding if he feels like it, and the ticket will be just as bad as a car ticket, and can even add points to your drivers license.  If your bike has the ability, a good pannier or saddle bag should be enough to carry clothes. I usually just wear a backpack.   It's one of those movies that can be a slow burn for some people, but I was lucky to like it on the first go round.  What makes it so great is that they have all kinds of little bits of embedded humor that you actually have to pay attention to to understand. From single sound effects (the bionic man leap over a bale of hay), to meta stuff (the whole movie takes place in one day), there are so many different things that you miss until you have seen it a couple times.   Watch it once sober, and then when you're baked. It's an amazing movie.   I think the age difference is an intentional part of the joke. The original movie had so many subtle yet absurd things (like the fact the entire movie takes place in one day, the reactions to Shemper's comedy) going on, I think they're just adding that one on to the cart.   Interestingly, if you were to go with precious metals, I think silver and copper make the most sense. Think of things from an industrial perspective - silver is one of the best, cheapest conductors for making contacts and solder alloys. Copper is used in basically every wire, circuit trace, motor, etc.  Gold is a "meh" conductor (despite marketing from companies like Monster Cables), and made worse by the premium price. It's only really great property is how malleable it is - it can get pressed extremely thin. Great for making heat shielding, but nothing you'd really need for the mad max world preppers think of.  If I were to put money into a precious metal pile, it would probably be silver and copper. If you indulge in fetishizing the worst case scenario, in a post apocalyptic wasteland, being able to make motors and wire, and having the materials to do so, would be pretty darn valuable, you know?   One of the worst things I ever saw was when someone had uploaded a hurtcore pedo video on youtube. Someone threw the link on 4chan a few years back saying "PORN ON YOUTUBE!" and suddenly.... little kid being raped.   Reported, closed browser, formatted hard drive, threw computer out window, burned down wall.   But what does she say!?   That's what I needed to know, thank you!   That's what I needed to know, thank you!   I am a long time spotify user, but I keep seeing apple music come up on my apple devices. This would be the one thing that would make me switch - Spotify doesn't have any music from the band Tool (of Schism, Aenema fame).  Does anyone know if Apple music has anything from them?   I personally grow cascade. I had gotten a fuggles rhizome but I lost it in our fridge and it ended up rotting :(  Most home brew shops should be able to connect you with them!   Wherever you put them, you have to make sure you have a way to trellis them, or else you'll end up with a gigantic knot.  When you grow them, try to choose the healthiest 2-3 bines and prune everything else that grows.  They WILL spread. We started with a 4 inch rhizome, and they now cover the entire front of our shed.   Sometimes. Usually we either brew with them ourselves, or we invite over local brewers to pick what they want for free.   It looks like she's saying "pew pew pew pew"   Not without training they couldn't.   Do they still make all-terrain skate decks? I remember seeing one a long while ago - it looked like it had toy RC wheels on it.   FYI, if you maintain a fast walking pace of 4mph, you can walk this in 25 hours. The hard part is training your body to stay upright for that long. Even if your plan to walk it, you still should start by getting yourself to the point where you can jog 15-18 miles at a time before you even start training.   I am a man with a dog. Can confirm this reaction is legit.   You can usually find pre-owned Kia Rios that are 1 year old at most Kia dealerships for about 9k. I own one, and have about 140k miles on it. Bought it with 4k miles on it. It's been a great car so far.   Steel string or nylon string?  If nylon check out Yamahas intro guitars like the C40. They are cheap and sound lovely.   Try missed connections on allentown.craigslist.org?   I've found that hops grow great in areas like that. Folks say they need to be southern facing and get N hours of sunlight. I plant them in north faces where they get next to no light and they grow like weeds and spread like bunnies listening to Barry White. Only downside is you have to figure out some kind of trellis system, otherwisw they make a lovely tangle.   Remember folks, [you can't play Willie properly with a steel string guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_\(guitar\)).   The big players are rational. The muppets who trade on emotion? There's enough of them to make some waves.   I'd have to disagree. The last time there was bad news about Greece we saw a 44 point drop in the S P, and a 350 point drop in the DJIA. I'd wager we'll see more of that on sentiment alone.  Folks who are pessimistic are going to have cold feet, that's just their nature. The ONE reason I can think of that we might not see that happen again is there's a possibility that those who were going to get out have gotten out already.  I am curious though what this will do to the prices of cryptocurrencies since right now bitcoin is one of the few ways you can get money in/out of Greece if you have cash-in-hand.   Ugh, of course it defaults now. After I bought up a bunch of stock today. Now there will be a bunch of firesale prices tomorrow.  At least I can get some shorts in for tomorrow.   I almost never do all you can eat, but I would actually be ok with this. Usually I want everything I get but maybe something sits heavier tjan expected. I'd be just fine paying to take it home instead of throwing it out. 10 dollars a pound is cheaper than the grocery store hot bar (13-14 dollars a pound).   Data analyst here for an evil telecom here. Can confirm.   That's exactly what I'm talking about, thank you!!   Lol, funny thing is after posting that, I immediately thought "lol, I bet they're not a man," but I was too lazy to edit (it's a PITA on the app I use).   Simple question. Every day I ride the teain and I see piles of those beams, and I notice that they have metal plates on the ends. What are they for? Who makes them? Do yhe beams come preassembled? If so, who makes the beams?   This man weaves true tales.   Maybe not. Chuck's self esteem could be awesome if Lucy had been killed at birth. She'd never be around to call him a blockhead, rally the other kids against him, or pull away the football.    I just couldn't enjoy Prototype. I tried, but the game seems to go out of its way to constantly throw in your face how "angsty" the protagonist is. You end up playing someone you really just can't stand. It's like playing Infamous but only being able to make bad karma choices. The gameplay was fun but the cutscenes and story... ugh.  I liked Infamous way, way more.   It used to be EB Games in the US as well, and Electronics Boutique before that, not sure why they ended up rebranding.   The problem is, "good cops" don't do very much to stop bad cops. Where exactly were the "good cops" when Eric Garner was shown, on video, being killed by cops using tactics barred by their department? Where were good cops to say, "Look, maybe the Mayor has a point when he has to explain to his kid that encounters with police can be dangerous, we have problems we need to address."? Where were the "good cops" who stood up and said "I refuse to pay my union dues as long as union leaders keep meddling in judicial affairs?" Where are the "good cops" petitioning DA's to let "bad cops" face a real jury, and not a grand jury stacked with golf buddies of the DA, Chief of Police, and union leadership? Show me one instance of that happening. Just one, and I will shut up.  The reason the loudest group of people "refuses" to believe any of you are good cops is because all of these "good cops" seem to be perfectly willing to spend tons of cash to make sure not a single bad cop is punished. Hold others in your profession accountable and maybe we'll start thinking that good cops actually exist. Until then, you're no better than the bad cops you pay to defend.   I work in the tech industry, and my wife is a teacher. It honestly bothers me how much money I earn compared to her. I make 90k/yr, and I have a BA  in Clinical Psychology. My sole qualification for my job is being a lifelong computer geek, a handful of technical certifications, and several years of experience. My wife has a masters +30, 8 years of experience, and earns 67k/yr. Even if she got a PhD, she wouldn't earn as much as I do now. She also has tea party folks protesting anytime her bosses discuss paying her more.  I make sure people can make telephone calls.  She is responsible for shaping the future generations of our country.  Priorities are askew.   "No Russian."   This is such a muddy area. While in theory parents should be able to teach their kids whatever they want, it becomes a problem when you teach them lies and to deny facts to the point that it makes them unable to function in proper society.  Cursing a kid to never be able to succeed outside of extremist circles may as well be a form of child abuse since you are effectively handicapping your kid socially.   We had a psych prof who did that. He was a narcissistic douchebag who thought he was hot shit because he wrote a book. I called him out to a dean over it and threatened to alert the local media (with a copy of the syllabus, required book list, and required reading list that never referenced his book). To my knowledge the book was never again a required purchase for his classes. He always gave me nasty looks after that.   I can't believe I just downvoted someone for downvoting someone who downvoted someone for liking pepsi!   I always have extra withheld.  Yes, it is an interest free loan, but only for a period of 1 year. The fact that the cash would have trickled in means it likely would have been spent on incidentals through the year (as you have more cash you tend to spend more, even if you stick to a budget).  After seeing several people get hit with several thousand in owed taxes, I'd rather be sure I won't owe and get a nice windfall at the end of the year we can use to pay for a vacation or a home upgrade. The most I have ever owed was 50$ to the state. I consider the forfeited interest in the money as paying for piece of mind I won't get a massive bill.   Overkill by Men At Work. Freaking gorgeous song.   100% agreed. I still prefer the acoustic   Not a woods worker, just a farmboy.  A buddy and I made a fort out of pallets in the woods when we were little. We took a bunch of food and sleeping bags out there, and it became our play area. This was about a half mile out from his family's farm.  So we figure we will camp out that night. So we tell stories or whatever it is kids do, and finally lay down to sleep. In the middle of the night we hear this sound.... scratching, snarling, snorting, hissing. It gets closer and closer and closer. We both hear it and are scared shitless. When it sounds like it is right next to us, we both bolt from the fort and take off running through the fields back to his parents' house.  We stopped briefly to check what it was...  Fucking possums man.   I get your point, but at the same time I think it's the very same reason why tv show chefs always eat some of the food they make. People like to see that food is edible, and actually tastes good. Food that makes someone excited enough to take a bite before they remember to take a photo speaks volumes IMO.   Mushrooms, anchovies, marmite... basically anything glutamate heavy.   Bacon fried in duck fat. Because why not?   The problem is, people may as well be. The WHO recommendation is that no more than 5% of your diet be free sugars (sugars in things like fruit aren't a huge deal because fiber prevents insulin spikes). For most folks, that's 25g - about 6tsp total.   A single soda contains significantly more than that. Worse, it will make your insulin level spike to keep you from going into diabetic shock because of your high blood sugar level, and as a result, the excess glucose gets stored as fat almost immediately.   Butter isn't that bad for you. It's a hell of a lot better than margarine. Tastes better too.  Lard/bacon grease/duck fat is awesome as well, and is even lower in saturated fat than butter.   Interesting, where you use mustard powder I use garlic powder. I'll have to give that a shot.   Gotta agree. I make a dalmatian seasoning that I usually use on good cuts of meat: 3 parts kosher salt, 2 parts fresh cracked black pepper (get off yer duff and use a mortar and pestle for this! NOT a spice grinder!), 1 part garlic powder. All parts by volume, not weight.  It's simple, but amazing at the same time. Use it on pork, chicken, beef, rabbit, whatever. The only time I use more complicated rubs is for bbq.   You're lucky. My wife knows that this is a divorcable offense - right up there with scrubbing my cast iron or using my knives improperly. There are some things that *simply are not done.* ;)   Allow me to introduce you to my buddy hing. You will never associate cumin with powdered BO again.   I can't remember where I remembered hearing this - it may have been in an episode of the ATK podcast, or one of the Julia and Great Chefs episodes? Either way, they stated exactly what you just did. A lot of times food is missing *something*, and the salt level is right. Usually what's missing is acidity.  Keeping a bottle of lemon juice or citric acid around the kitchen helps in those situations.   Interesting. For me, too much garlic usually has a very bitter taste, not salty in the slightest.   Seven for a dollar? Seriously? Like, holy shit. Around here an order is about 5$ and you usually get about 7 total. A lot of money for pizza dough tied in a knot!   This begs the question - if you put a clove of garlic in your mouth and keep it there, will your vagina taste like garlic in a few hours?   Exactly what I was thinking. A dog escalating that fast makes me think that the dog was scolded for growling.   It should also be noted - a dog that is constantly scolded for growling may escalate extremely fast without much warning. That's why you should take growling for what it is - a "knock it off" sign, and not yell at dogs for doing it unless you have a damn good reason.  If you make them stop growling, you just lost one of the best warning signs you have that the dog is uncomfortable.   Hey everyone! Basically what the top question says. I am looking for a parlor-sized classical that I can pack up and take with me to the office, on business travel, on vacations, etc. Solid wood would be impacted by constant humidity/temperature changes, so I would be looking for something that is laminate/HPL.  I've looked at the Martin backpacker but the sound quality is horrendous. I've seen both Manuel Rodriguez and Cordoba offer "cadete" models, but they're all made with solid wood.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!   Exception is for BBQ or braising. Then you're aiming for an end temp at around 195 when the collagen has melted.   Pigeons are considered delicacies in countries like Morocco, and are raised specifically to be served as food. Here, we just call them flying rats.   Do yourself a favor - take her to a pig foster group. Most people see pictures of micropigs and potbelly pigs and think "oh, they're so cute and tiny!" Well, they grow up. And the majority of them get dumped off at animal shelters where they end up euthanized.  Taking her to a pig rescue will let her see what they look like after they've grown up. It's hard to imagine a teacup sized micropig becoming a 400lb porker, but they do.   If she still wants one and is willing to keep it despite their large size, go for it. Pigs are awesome animals.   Porn breakdowns are horrible. Especially when the cameraman or director are abusive about it. I mean, I get it, she's ruining your film, but at the same time she is a freaking human being.   I always thought it would be interesting if someone could make a strap on that went inside the wearer, and the dildo itself was filled with liquid or gel. That way sensations on one end of the dildo (like contractions, sucking, etc) would cause the other side to pulse and contract. Seems like it would be fun for both ladies.   Nor would you want to if it did happen.  Fun true story: when I was in college, I was walking from campus to an off-campus house party. Along the way I got passed by a bunch of freshman girls. One of them could barely stand upright, but she swaggers over to me and gives me a hug. I'm kind of like "???" but figure, "ok, she's drunk." She then proceeds to ask me if I was a football player, to which I respond no. Then she says, "Well, oh well, wanna go back to my room and fuck?"  Notsureifbonerisappropriate.jpg  Seeing that she is questionably 18, absolutely drunk, I lead back her over to her friends and tell them that they probably want to get her home and make sure she doesn't have any guys over.  I still don't know what happened to that girl, I don't recall ever seeing her on campus again so for all I know she was someone's guest. I still hope no other guys took her up on her offer because that had rape charges written all over it.   Unless the title has "hymen" or "defloration" in it, and honestly I'm pretty sure 90% of that is just girls who are on the rag.    If you have ever been with a girl who is a screamer, it is actually both a turn on and a turn off. It's hot and makes you feel like you're doing something right... until all of your other housemates are pissed at you the next day because they could hear everything she screamed.  From that point on, usually it makes you so concerned about waking up your housemates that you want to put a gag on her. And sadly, not all girls are into that kinda thing.   Could you imagine if someone like x-art, fantasyHD, nubile, etc (any of the artsy porn studios) decided to make something goofy? It could actually be hilarious.   Is it tight? Of corset is!   Fun fact, while the French are usually given credit for foie gras, it was a byproduct of Jewish efforts to produce as much fat as possible on birds and likely came from eastern europe. Forcefeeding ducks to make them plump caused their livers to distend and get huge and fatty.   Hing is weird. It smells putrid on its own. But when you add it to oil/ghee to bloom the smell and taste does really convert to something very akin to a mix of garlic and onion.

After 5 years of residence you can apply for citizenship.   YES EXACTLY! ALSO LOUD NOISES!  /cruise control for cool   Maybe now that it is a public health epidemic people will start to understand that it is a bad idea to charge the FDA with both pushing the interests of US agribusiness, AND establishing healthy diet parameters.  Fun fact: Sugars are the only nutrient on the nutrition label that doesn't contain a daily percentage as a direct result of the sugar producers of the country threatening the FDA with lobbyists. This occurred after the WHO released new sugar intake guidelines after a large amount of research points to processed sugars essentially being poisons in the human body.   Healthy and weight aren't necessarily related. I weigh 210lbs, and am therefore considered obese. Yet I can run 11 miles (and in fact did so earlier this morning), bench press my weight, and complete pretty much any workout thrown at me. Muscle weighs more by volume than fat does. So, someone who is extremely muscular could actually be considered obese by BMI. That's one of the known problems with BMI. Sadly, BMI is the only metric taken into account for this study.  I do agree with you that that isn't the norm, but it always bothers me when people mix up weight and healthiness. They aren't mutually exclusive.   *wistful sigh*  Belgium is where my wife and I plan to retire. Things like this just make me feel even more resolute. Beautiful photo.

Chill the fuck out, tight ass.  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/joke    That's not entirely true. I encourage you to read up on the Belyaev Russian silver Fox experiments. A random wolf would be a bad idea. Taking the most human friendly wolf and breeding it with a domesticated dog that has excellent temperament can absolutely produce a pet quality dog, and there is ample research to back it up.   Silver fox crossbreeding had pet quality animals produced in the very first generation as the result of selective breeding. The chance in the first generation is small, but by the 10th generation research saw 18%, and higher as more generations were bred.  Here's the applicable wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox   I'm 1/16 Cherokee.

Someone who is this rude and narcissitic being removed from the gene pool is a boost for us all.   But here's the problem: is he wrong?   Look how nasty the community was a year ago whenever anyone mentioned that a ton of stuff was missing. No meaningful player communication. A speaker who tells you about all of the things he could tell you about, and yet never actually tells you. No real story. No in-game lore. No meaningful matchmaking. To this day you have to use completely unrelated websites to find a group of people to play with. Guilds don't mean anything. No trading. No meaningful interaction with the environment or NPCs. I still have yet to participate in a single raid because I don't get any thrill out of playing with a bunch of randoms off a website somewhere who can and will screw me over if they get the chance (as posts on here frequently show). No real way to grow your character other than to grind-grind-grind reputation, pvp, and strikes. That's it. Not to mention a menagerie of animal-named errors, no actual meaningful support from the dev (to this day you're told to submit it on the support forum where your post will be ignored). Should I mention the constant reuse of in-game assets to avoid having to actually develop anything new and then calling it DLC?  Whenever folks pointed this stuff out, this sub would downvote them to hell. You know what that tells the Bungie peons who watch this sub, and the forums? It tells them that the majority of the crowd likes the game as it is. They like the lack of support. They like the half-assed approach to customer relations. They like the lack of substantial story. They like being taken over the barrel. After all, if they didn't, they wouldn't be attacking anyone who pointed out the flaws, now would they? Every single person who downvoted someone else because they pointed out a flaw: this is your fault. You refused to let people hold bungie accountable for their shit-tastic approach to this game. So enjoy reaping what you sowed.  Maybe in the future, we, as a community, should start telling people who belittle complainers to knock it off. But expecting humans to learn from the past is usually hopeless. Hell, I fully expect I'll get downvoted to hell for posting this.   But... but... don't you know pallet wood will kick your dog, turn your children into satanists, and give you scabies!? ;)  /s   Not always.

So it won't be *exactly* the same. Still, overall I agree with you.   Um, so, can I get this, and then have it drizzled with some really good bleu cheese dressing? Or with some bleu cheese crumbles wedged in between the layers of potato?   RIP 3rd street chicken and ribs. They were hands down the best in the valley. I haven't found anywhere remotely as good since.  Lehigh Pizza's wings are decent.   I have 3 raised beds that are going fallow this year and next while I redo the garden area of our yard. While pulling out the branches/weeds that were poking through, I found at least 4 mantis nests. I ended up putting them in strategic places around my yard and I've been trying to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't get molested by birds.  If I'm really lucky, they'll eat the damn vine borer larvae that make my life a living hell.   Really? With Corbett constantly fighting to ensure no one at Penn State was punished? Because it's way more important to make sure that people who play with footballs and their management never see punishment over raping kids than it is to seek justice.  Shit like this is why sports in general disgust me. Freaking Sandusky was in prison a year before Corbett started trying to sue to prevent sanctions against Penn State. God damn disgusting.   It's actually not that tough so long as it was powered off. Most circuit boards are coated in a layer of epoxy that prevents water from directly damaging them. If the power is off and the battery is pulled, being underwater would do relatively little damage that couldn't be fixed with rice or any other dessicant. If the battery is in place, it can cause shorts to happen anywhere where there is a junction point between circuit boards that is necessarily not coated in epoxy.   So how exactly does that change when you use a scuba system, or worse, a rebreather?  I ask because I've used a rebreather at about 90 feet. They SUCK to inhale on to begin with, even at the surface, yet when I am at depth I can still inhale without exerting much additional force beyond what I have to use on the surface.  I'm not calling you incorrect, I'm just curious how the pressure to inhale from a tube would change so dramatically because of pressure on your chest, yet the pressure on your chest doesn't prevent you from inhaling from something that is already difficult to inhale from.   Well, I was about to buy one. But then my wife reminded me that we're trying to conceive, and she can't do cat litter anymore as of July.

For some reason baroque music just rubs me the wrong way, and I'm saying that as a classical guitarist.

Supposedly Rite of Spring caused riots when it was first played live, so I wonder what it would do with a fetus....   This is one my absolute favorite desserts. Great job OP! Did the interior of the meringue stay nice and soft for you??   Choux're kidding me! ;)   That egg is a new one for me. I must try this - we usually make BLT's every few weeks during the summer and it seems like a fried egg would work perfectly. Great idea!!!   It is possible, but I'd think it would add a slight randomizing effect to when people would receive the signals. It WOULD give you the fudgy-ness but at the same time it would impact military use too.   I think we all use the same satellites, but that could be a key point if we use different ones.  Sounds like I need to talk to some of our more informed RF guys at work to get a better idea of how it works. I'm sure someone knows. I'm by no means an expert! :)   Suppose you know the geostationary orbit location of satellite A, satellite B, and satellite C. You know that each is broadcasting at 1000hz (obviously not correct, just an example). If you see that you are receiving the signal from satellite A at exactly 1000hz (indicating it is directly above you because the wavelength hasn't changed at all), satellite b at 1005hz (because your position on earth is moving away from where the satellite signal originated), and satellite C at 995 hz (because your position on earth is moving closer to where the satellite signal originated), the expansion/contraction of the waveform due to the doppler effect can give you timing without having to explicitly contain timing information in the signal. You're just measuring the shift in the wavelength from what is expected, and identifying the known coordinates of each satellite to do the triangulation  Note, I don't work on GPS systems, I work on HFC for cable companies using QAM and QPSK so there are obviously some differences. I'm just basing this on what I know - we manipulate the hell out of signals to add extra data. The way it was explained to me, it made sense without needing additional timing data but there could easily be more for me to learn, and I'd love to learn more.   Interesting - that goes against the explanation provided to me by Michio Kaku when I saw him speak. He stated that it was almost entirely based on the doppler effect. Maybe it's both? Or it could have been a simplification?   Charge for your time. There is no other way. The best is if you have a job doing tech work, because you can then say "Look, I will help you this time. But you need to realize that I get paid for doing this exact same work elsewhere, and I'd really appreciate not doing the same work for free during my time off."  Usually that gets the point across, and if anything lets them know that you are willing to help but you won't be taken advantage of. Let them pay you. If anything, it gives them an incentive to actually figure it out for themselves or pay attention to how you tried to resolve the issue.   Slightly OT, but how did the term butterfly knife come to be in modern usage? The knifes OP listed are actually called balisongs. They're Filipino in origin.  A true butterfly knife looks like this, and is Chinese in origin:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Wing_Chun_Hybrid_Blade_Style_Butterfly_Swords.JPG  So how did the two ever start getting confused? Does anyone know?   It's hard to fudge gps from the non-receiver side. The way gps works is the satellites maintain geosynchronous orbit and broadcast a simple signal. Every satellite has its own version of the signal to identify itself.   These signals pass through the atmosphere and get distorted due to the doppler effect (stretched out of the sat is moving away from you, compressed if moving towards). Your gps receiver takes the signals, triangulates your approximate location, then figures out whether the signals you are receiving are stretched out or shrunk,  and can then figure out more precisely where you are in relationship to those satellites based on that distortion.  For more precision you'd need access to more satellites, or you need a receiver that has better algorithms for analyzing the distortion of the signal. Both could separate consumer gps from military. But otherwise, military or consumer, gps works the same way. There isn't really a way to limit precision without doing it on the receiver.   If I had that much cash to invest I'd split between a high dividend yield closed end fund with monthly dividend distributions and an aggressive dividend earning mutual fund.  Then I'd invest free cash/leftover cash I make into bond funds for a bit until I get close to a 25/75 mix of bonds/stocks. Then just maintain that split.   I work for a massive telecom that everyone hates. My feeling gowards google is kind of how I feel about my employer.  The engineers at these companies are brilliant, and almost exclusively are doing their work to try and bring cooler things to market. We work on bodies like the IEEE and the IETF to try and improve open standards. We value the open internet. We don't like censorship. A huge number of us prefer alternative takes on copyright law (like copyleft and kopimi). We love FOSS and contribute what we develop.  But then you have the business folks whose sole goal is to raise stock prices for shareholders. They ignore infrastructure and sustained engineering because it is flashy and doesnt generate headlines. They are almost diametrically opposed to the things the engineers value. They focus the engineers' talent on things and usually keep them compartmentalized enough that very few get a full picture of what the company is doing. That full picture doesn't even have to be negative, but it's usually close enough that one good spin article and the whole company gets a bad image.  Also, a lot of these companies aren't technically doing anything wrong. Spun articles can rely on ignorant people not fully understanding the technology the company is using and its requirements.    Honestly, I have seen people of nearly every race/ethnicity have gatherings like that. Puerto Ricans, Greeks, African Americans, Filipinos, Indians (specifically Gujrati because showing off wealth and status is a big deal), Chinese, Italians, Irish folks, etc. Basically any group with strong family ties and a healthy amount of cultural pride. My Italian family has had family reunions with over 300 (happens when your grandparents were all from families with 7+ kids).   Replace the drive. You can get the parts for about 15$ and the screwdriver for 5. The wii isnt that tough to work on.   And nothing of value was lost.  /r/sothathappened   If you were bit by a brown recluse and waited several days, you'd likely see necrotizing skin at the bite. If your skin is darkening at the area, go see a doctor immediately.   I'm wondering if he means "property manager" instead of landlord.   You need a kitty eyepatch. He would make an amazing pirate cat.   So, basically as long as they steal from brown people and college students, no one cares. Sadly you are correct.   Also, nailing Amanda Fucking Palmer.   Hey everyone. This is not an immediate item for us (we have a first mortgage to get through, as well as a student loan), but my wife and I would like to purchase a beach house for both personal use and as an investment property to rent out when we aren't using it. This would be our first time looking at a second home (wow that's a clunky sentence) so I want to start learning early and give myself time to do all of the necessary research.  Our plan is to purchase the property, and hire a management company to handle finding renters and maintaining the property. The beach is about 3-4 hours from us, so it would be difficult to do all of the work ourselves. My original plan had been to buy a house in the Poconos (Pennsylvania) because I could potentially get more traffic in an area where there are tourists at all seasons, but my wife is more interested in the beach house as a possibility.  Is this too huge of a jump for a second home/rental property? Should I look at getting something closer and cheaper first to get my feet wet? Should I look into financing, or should I wait until I can afford to pay in cash? The goal is, if we have a mortgage, that it be low enough that there is no issue paying if we can't get renters for that week/month.  Are there any good books or reference materials I should check out first? I have several years before this happens, so I want to use that time to make a plan. I am still new to this so I don't know what I don't know.   As of now, I was supposed to have the first set of items delivered today, but according to UPS the following two messages have appeared:  * The sender requested a delivery change for this package. / The package will be returned to the sender. * The receiver has canceled the product order and refused delivery.  So, it sounds like amazon requested the delivery be stopped, and it also is saying the receiver refused delivery which would be odd since neither I or my wife are home right now to refuse.  I was contacted via PM by /u/PurseIO and sent a response to their questions, but haven't heard a response.  I requested support on the site both via the transaction, as well as via their help-contact us, but haven't gotten any meaningful response. All of my btc is still in escrow. I have no idea what is going on.   Hello! I hope my experience can help you. This will be a long post, and I don't intend to scare you, but I will urge you to be cautious. I'm not saying this as a parent, but rather as a guy who was made to go into ballet as a child for nearly a decade. Everything I say will be based on my experience. Your aspirations of social justice are noble, but you have to be very careful. Short story: try it, but if there is any resistance, let the kid quit. Otherwise you could seriously damage the kid's interest in the arts, their self esteem, their relationship with you, and their social life. You aren't the one who lives your kid's life, they are. Their peers are too young to understand social justice and gender equality - they grew up in a world of gender norms and anything outside of them will raise eyebrows and be a source of trouble.  When I was very young, I had an interest in the arts, including ballet. When my mom saw me watching a PBS filming of a ballet, she took that as a sign that I was in love with ballet, and that it would be good for me. So, she signed me up for lessons. She didn't ask me my opinion, I was just told that I was going. If she had, she would have realized my interest was limited to "look at the pretty ladies dancing so gracefully."  Those things folks are saying to you about what your kid will experience in the class? It's true. He will be ostracized. He will be teased. He'll be called gay, he'll be called a girl. Depending on your school, he may get beat up. Mercilessly. You will also be turning him into a spectacle as a show of your sense of social justice, so lots of people are going to look, and that will bring on even more teasing. His future interactions with women may get really screwed up because he will be spending hours every week being treated like he is inferior to his female peers because they will tell him that. To the point where even talking to a girl can be difficult.  So what was it like in ballet class for a boy? I would go to a lesson. The first thing I had to do was put on tights, which were uncomfortable, but on top of that, I was a chubby kid. It felt humiliating. Looking into a mirror in the changing room, I felt like I was squeezing a pillow into a tube. This did wonders to my self esteem - to the point where I stopped eating for days because I couldn't stand looking in that mirror. Next, I would go into the practice room. I was the only male in the entire dance school. All of the other students were female, young girls, mostly from conservative families that value things like ballet as part of a young woman's journey into refinement. Being the only guy there, I was immediately singled out, both by the girls and the teachers. Whenever girls would talk about "girl things" I would immediately be identified as someone not to be included in the conversation. Not being physically perfect, it made it even more horrific. So, there I was getting picked on, pranked, humiliated, insulted, by a room full of young girls because I was the odd man out. When I wasn't getting insulted or teased, I was completely ignored by everyone. The teachers were mostly from the PA ballet, and they felt a fat kid like me had no place in ballet, on THEIR stage, so they let the humiliation happen. Hell, they encouraged it by constantly pointing me out in the class about the way "men" are supposed to perform certain moves as apart from women.  I felt like a constant pariah. I hated it. I asked to quit constantly, but my mom used the same "it's good for you, screw social norms, there's nothing wrong with a boy taking ballet" thought process. She completely neglected the fact that it was making my life a living hell. So, I was essentially forced to participate in ballet for 8 years. Jazz for 7. If my mom had had her way, I would have gone into tap too. It wasn't until I crushed my heel that I finally was allowed to quit. My thoughts and opinions didn't matter, just my mom's feelings about social justice.  My elementary/middle school thought it was SO PROGRESSIVE, that they had to make a show of the fact that I was a boy in ballet. So, of course, they made a huge deal out of it. Announcements about the fact that I was in ballet went out over the speakers, I showed up in the school newspaper. My parents would invite out my teachers to see me on stage, who would of course go back into the classroom and parrot to my peers about how it was *so great* that I was a boy in ballet. Life in school was extremely hard because of it - I was picked on, humiliated, called a fag, etc. Incessantly. All because my mom thought it was important to make a statement about how socially progressive we were.  No matter how socially progressive you are, the rest of the world may not match. That's the world your kid will be living in, not the world as you want it to be. Especially not in the conservative ballet world, where you still have to squint to ever see a non-white prima.  If your son has an active interest, a REAL active interest, by all means let him go. But understand that your passion to make ballet a part of his life may not be his passion, and if he realizes that the chiding and harassment are too much, let him drop it. In fact, refusing to let him quit could turn his life into a spectacular living hell that will make him completely despise ballet, and dancing in general. Not to mention resenting your overstepping boundaries into his life. To this day I won't even step out on a dance floor because I remember how humiliated I used to feel being made to dance against my will. Now, about 20 years later, I am just starting to enjoy watching ballet again. 20 years of hating ballet, and refusing to ever step foot on a dance floor because my mom thought "it was good for me." Was it worth it?  So, like I said, give it a shot. But if he doesn't want to go, don't make him. Or he WILL resent it.  **TL;DR:** Ballet is brutal on a young boy. If he isn't really into it, don't make him go. If you do, he will resent it AND you.     	145

 That is the only reason I would ever try and make a post in this subreddit.    I signed up to be an 0231 Intelligence Analyst. My recruiter told me I would be like James Bond. Many other Marines told me this as well. I am far from James Bond or any other type of spy.    I can't lie, I didn't read EVERY single word. I tried to speed read through most of what you said and I understand most of the situation. However, in my opinion, I am in no way saying that I have any idea what it's like to be a victim or to be close to someone who was a victim. The story was just touching and I felt some obligation to voice my thoughts. Hopefully they reach you through the flood of comments.  I really think you made the right choice here. I cannot believe the lack of contact and respect her and her family have shown you. Granted, they are her family and they should be sticking by her side regardless of the crappy decisions she makes.  In the end, you did your best. You have to give yourself some credit, you did your best to make it work, to give her her own space, to let her recover and come back to you. I don't care if she needed to, "take her sexuality back," that sounds like a load of bullshit. I feel like an asshole for saying it, but someone needs to tell the truth. If she were to do that, she should've done it with you because she supposedly loved you and wanted to be with you. Being a victim does not give her the right to mush your face in the dirt. Not when you're supposed to be partners for a lifetime.   If she wants to communicate through her therapist then good, let her do that and leave the letter with her therapist. That's the way she wants to do things because she is too afraid to confront you and have a real conversation then so be it. How could she possibly have sex with another man and then treat you like a troll after you try and kiss her. How dare she?   As I said, I speak for myself and my own thoughts. My opinions are my own. Maybe the mentality is different as a victim. That is something I pray I never experience, or anybody I know should ever have to experience. I am truly sorry for her, you, and everyone surrounding you both. Best of luck to you both.   I told someone that I had just gotten out of the Marines. They said, "Oh, wow....And you're not crazy?!" Really no answer for that.    No, no, it was definitely as the fire hydrant.    Definitely understandable.    People take this too seriously. If I got hit in the face with a pie out of no where, the first thing through my head wouldn't be, "I'm definitely going have this man arrested." I'd be way too surprised at the fact that I just got pied in the face. Sheesh. That's too funny, I haven't laughed at something on here like that in a while.    New Bern, right? I didn't know him and his wife split. My girlfriend's aunt used to see her at the Walmart nearby all the time. Said she was usually very nice, never saw much of Nicholas though. I drove by his house a few times as well just for kicks when I used to live in the area.   I didn't realize so many people from Poughkeepsie were on reddit! I am waiting for the same thing as well, it has had its ups and downs. So far it's been hanging on pretty strong    Everyone recognized it right away!   Scarily thin!  	11

 Mcbob Ennis Chalmers  Anderson? Beas? Top 10 pick?   Good story. But it could have quickly turned into a TIFU by getting a lesbian  pregnant lol   Playoffs is going to be huge for these rooks. Going to leave that taste of wanting more and doubling effort in offseason. That's why making the post season is so important for me. I know we ain't going win, but we need it to develop that winning culture in the young ones.     Not doubtful enough....Wallace to vikings   Well done  	5
 That's a big argument my friend group is having right now. On one hand, 3D can be distracting. On the other, this is a HUGE movie and a really important first-time viewing experience for us hardcore Jurassic Park fans. IMAX 3D, maybe? idk yet.   I am so FUCKING horrible at the battles! I was stuck on Level 9 for like three weeks. I've been having to invest a ton of time into planning out my next battle because I realized I needed a new team, but of course it takes FOREVER for me to get enough meat   coin to level anything up! Now I'm out of DNA so I can't buy any more dinosaurs so I can evolve the ones I already have! GAHHH it's so frustrating, fuck this game. Give me Operation Genesis 2.   Pretty cool video. Not my favorite Kanye verse, but it was cool. The photothot line tho! hahahah jesus..   Rella by odd future   I get what you're saying. There are some songs by Kanye that I *really* don't like but I can turn around and find someone who thinks that song is a masterpiece.   This is probably what she meant when she said it was going to be a major SWISH   Cheers, mate! Been drinking and just started GoT as well. Lovving It! blessed be you, child   Haha too many spoilers. Just clicked on it and it was the finale of Jurassic World. NOPE! Didn't watch. What do you mean your worst fears are coming true? See something you didn't like?   ok   Oh my god, at 2:00 I almost felt like crying. That was beautiful.   Haha this is so bad, yet so amazing.   Still think it's kinda fun! I have a Jurassic Park in my pocket, I ain't complaining. (it's free! :D)   He doesn't mention anything about the wild raptors, leaving me to assume there aren't any. Bummer :(  I really wanted to see some vicious velociraptor stuff like in the last act of Jurassic Park.   It's exactly like in Jurassic Park, "The voice you are hearing is Richard Kiley! We spared no expense." On the tour.   I had that toy! It was an easter gift! Oh my god I'm crying    me irl   Hahahaha this is the best thing I've seen all day.   A student got to *intern* with him? I'm so fucking jealous. Goddamnit.   I think it's sus. He feels the Grammys are beneath him.   I think it's the I-Rex hatching as well as possibly it eating the sibling?   That was awesome. OH MY GOD IS IT JUST SPRINTING TOWARDS THE BATHROOM??  Hahahahaha I lost it, dude.  edit: when he spotted the bathroom... so relatable.    I'm really hoping that we've still seen only very little of this movie. What if the T-rex vs. I-rex scene is only halfway through the movie, just like the T-rex scene is halfway through the first Jurassic Park.  Ah, I doubt it. A boy can dream. The marketing on this probably has shown a clip from every scene of the movie.   Do you think Roshe Runs are ugly, too?   Haha I don't know if he drinks..but he smokes hella trees. That's all he really talks about.   I don't remember reading anything about Site B after Jurassic Park III. Has it been mentioned at all on the Jurassic World website? Any predictions on whether or not they'll talk about it in Jurassic World?   Mmm, my bad. Haha I thought I made such an awesome point.   Apollo flew too close to the sun. Got burnt. I'd say Kanye has pushed things too far many times, which is why public opinion is negative towards him. He flew too close to the sun.  	27

Yes I am sure they can but they don't. I am amazed you think I am the one doing the harassing. This person is getting people shadow banned every day in my subreddit. And I am the one harassing him? He is harassing people. He is abusing his spam rpeorting privileges.  I can contact them in regards to the shadowbanned person and tell them what is happening. Only the person being shadow banned can.    Actually that is not the case. he reports it. And their bot shadow bans them. No one is reviewing these cases.

What are we number one in? Shit what are we even number two in?  Or three. You can run around and shout 'murica until your face turns red white and blue. But the the facts and statistics has us in 30th, 40 and 50th place in the all the important factors. Those are called facts.

So what are we number one in? And by-the-way grandpa, I'm 58 years old. I lived in the days we were number one.

You claim we should kill the deal. So what is the alternative? Your solution will guarantee they will get a nuclear weapon now or that we go to war.     Exactly. The ones that condemn have no other solutions. They are not  here to say what we should do, only to condemn others who offer answers.   I did not ask what did happen.

 Thanks a lot. That was done on a Nikon D7000 with nauticam underwater kit in a local pool for a music video I shot. We only used one light above the pool and the grader brought down the exposure so to not got the tacky feeling of it being set in a pool. He deserves as much credit as I do.   Thanks for the heads up. I see those comments a lot as well and my work is growing ever so slightly so I am hoping to be able to craft a few variations of my showreel to show my experience in said areas.  I also see what you mean by coming across as amateur. At the moment I am still in film school and don't want to come across as too presumptuous by labelling myself as a 'Cinematographer' or 'D.O.P' especially as it is a title I have barely scratched the surface of. But in my next reel i'll cut it out. Thank you.      Filmed with C100 with 6 stops of inbuilt ND filters. 100-400mm Canon lens with 1-9 Variable ND filter as well.  Shot on ProRes 422 HQ. 25fps, 5.6 f-stop, 1/50      Ummm for black and white scenes and daylight dancer scenes I used a Canon Mk ll with a L series 50mm 1.4 I think. Underwater scenes I used a Nikon D7000 with a standard 50mm. The DJ gig I used a Canon Mk lll with 50mm L series 1.4. For the dancing event I used a standard 70-200mm 2.8 lens and 50mm L series with the mk lll and with the horse documentary I used a C100 with the 50mm L series and the 85mm 1.8. I think thats roughly right.    Haha yeah, I have been getting into projecting my videos at events recently and have had some good surfaces to work with. Thank you.   That means a lot, thank you.         	10
 Saw that your budget was 2k so CUB-01 is completely within budget.  So below someone mentioned planting Lavs around the car. This is a great idea, and with a recorder like the Zoom h6 (which has six isolated tracks instead of two on the H4n) you could separate each lav from one another in post, so when you go to mix your dialogue each lav is isolated from each other. You can definitely get a Zoom H6 and three lavs for under 2k. I find that the CUB-01 is great for planting right above the mirror of a car. Fairly naturally sounding and its definitely a great option for the front two passengers.    Well I think the dream for every indie filmmaker is to get good quality audio out of cheap gear.  I think one of the best mics for the job is the Sanken CUB-01. Renting it would be your best bet. However if we are going super cheap there are other options. But I want to make it clear, that cheap will not sound as good. And because everyone always says " well that's okay" the difference between good audio and amatuer is right here.  If you are using iPhones as recorders the Rode Smart lavs might be an option for miking talent.  If you are using the iPhones built in mic than put it back in your pocket because that will sound like shit. If all you have is the one Rode video mic your best bet is to plant it somewhere in the middle of the driver and passenger seats. If you have to plant them out of frame angled towards different seats. Do you have any type of recorder?   I'm new to the game of freelancing and the real world in general (I just graduated). I'm starting to get gigs fairly regularly, and I want to get my taxes in line sooner than later. Any advice on the subject?

As the years go by, comparative values are found to alter: Time, says Sophocles, takes many things which once were pleasures and brings them nearer to pain. In the day when the strong men shall bow themselves, and desire shall fail, it will be a matter of yet more concern than now, whether one can say `my mind to me a kingdom is'; and whether the windows of the soul look out upon a broad and delightful landscape, or face nothing but a brick wall."  -- [A.E.

Well, except about that "ending the war" thing, if you'd carefully read the article, he notes that Obama did his damndest to keep troops in Iraq:  The war indeed ended in 2011. But lets not forget that before (most of) the troops left, Obama begged al-Maliki to let U.S. forces stay beyond the deadline set in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).

It will never be right ever again   I even brought that mug in from home. I will skin them alive.   I won't post this in the sub itself because it's more of a personal discovery than an Asexual thing, but if you're interested, I did a bit of a longer post just now where I think I found out why I'm a bit.. confused  http://gettingmadatnothing.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/im-not-okay.html   Definitely, I usually have my freakouts in summer, the heat really gets to me and small annoyances build up quickly and I get broody and mean.  Luckily, I go to a lot of metal gigs so I just run in moshpits and get a lot of my stress out that way, but summer's always quiet.  But yeah, I have a hell of a temper, but it takes a lot to get me in full hate steamroller mode.   I was always certain I was just terrible at being Heterosexual, but for the last year I've identified as a kind of romantic Asexual, now I'm just not sure of anything, but I might be Biromantic or Demisexual or something  It's driving me fucking mental   I think I'll manage. I've got some understanding friends around me. It was just late last night and I had to get it out of me - rant blog was perfect for it.  Thanks though. :) I appreciate the offer.   I probably don't come across it in the post, but I had a little bit of a freakout last night.   Up until last year, I was pretty set on everything I was.. Then It's just been turned around a little bit, then the last few days have happened and I'm not entirely sure of myself anymore - at all.   It's been a bit of a crazy month, compared to my usual day-in-day-out monotony of the last 6 years, everything crazy just happened in the space of a week.      /r/asexuality  /r/writing  /r/UnitedKingdom  /r/britishproblems   /r/worldbuilding   /r/furry   Those are the ones I visit most often   add me on Skype if you wanna chat. : I'm zeiferrei on there, and I'm in the UK - Manchester to be specific    I'm in the UK and I'm Asexual. Drop me a Orangered and I'll drop you my skype :D  I'm in Manchester, looking for anyone really, local or worldwide. Just feel like talking and getting to know people a bit more. :3   I'm a writer, video gamer and bloody workaholic when I get into it.  [I'm on FA too](http://www.furaffinity.net/user/taernfastgrade/)   Quick edit: I guess I should add that I'm Biromantic Asexual.   To be fair, I barely skimmed it and I nearly left it out altogether. :P   I know there's a few of us. 3 Keep looking! :D   That'd get you a few reward points. Might even be able to get a new game!    I just found out where all the files I had stored (In my case, it's in a dropbox) and I just copied and pasted around to where I need it.  I've personally got it set up so if I modify and save at home, I can access it at work without changing anything.    The best me is a me sat in a dark-ish room, maybe with a lamp and a coffee and some paper and some pens.. Maybe a computer to write.  I'm a writer and I'm nocturnal, work best in the dark. I think about the future - I'm a Sci-fi writer and I'm a very speculative person. I get excited about technology and space and the future of society as a whole.   I keep trying but I keep getting tattooed so they won't let me. :(  I'm on the organ donor register though so I'm good on that front.   As I said in the rant, I don't want to impose anything on anyone. It just so happens the majority of the Fur Fandom sure does like their fetishes, and I'm not going to rise with the super-minority of the fandom to get them to stop posting their art.   But that was an interesting read, didn't know they existed as I only joined the furry fandom in ~2008/9 and "Full time" as of a few months ago.   No worries, could always use the criticism.  I do get a bit soapboxy at times, probably unconsciously. I did try to rein it in a few times but it appeared to get anyway anyhow.   As I said in the title it was a bit of a rant, and yeah, I'm a bit of an idealist - always have been. It just felt good to vent, pretty much why I set up that blog.   That being said, I didn't say that this sort of stuff should stop completely, I said at one point that if that's what you like in your media or like to talk about, feel free to like it, just don't talk to me about it when I've already said to leave me alone about it (and I don't watch much TV or listen/watch much media aimed at me for that sole reason)   I saw a tweet a little while back, and it made me think. I wrote this in about an hour, maybe an hour and a half about my experience being Asexual as a young white male.  Also, just generally jabbing at pop culture in general.      I use [Zim wiki](http://zim-wiki.org/), which I have access to via Dropbox.  I've got it installed at home and at work, with the files stored in dropbox.  You can also set up a local host webserver with it and access it remotely (view only) if you know how to port forward and know your IP address and all that.   Deadly 60 was on before the Dr who announcement. I thought it was quite interesting myself. Might catch it next time it's on.  Host was like an extremely excitable Steve Irwin lookalike   I'm not too sure what's worse. The Chav or the LAD.  I think I'm leaning toward the LAD. Can't tell if they are or not until they open their mouths. And by then, it's too late.   I love wasting their time. I like to think I'm biding time for the next person on their list if they're going out.  I just go with it then just as they ask for the login details I say  "Hey, you're asking the system administrator here that you think I've a virus on this system? The only way you could know that is if you either implemented that virus, have a listener in my system or you're just guessing. I'm guessing the latter. Piss off."   Ah. Fair enough.  Not a big 4chan lurker, I just go and lurk /x/ and /adv/ every now and again.   It's got a pinkish background, so it's on one of the nsfw boards. /x/ is blue   I got caught out in it.  and I didn't even run for shelter, I just stood there, arms wide open, embracing the rain.   I missed you, friend.          wow    such fish          amazing                          colours wow     wet           cold   Totally freaking forgot about it, and I've no money left.  Last year was mental. There was a Dalek just roaming around the place.   He is a Kangaroo.   Aaand, 9 hours later, I emerge from yet another Archive Binge.   Total bullshit. Foxes are so scared of people they won't even go into houses unless tempted by food.  I mean, yesterday I was out walking the dog and there was a fox running for a rabbit which had just crossed my path. A fox came running up not far behind it, saw me, and turned tail and legged it.  I wanted to see the fox. :(   Pretty much everywhere these days.  PSN: train_subject8542  Steam: Zeifer  Latest obsession is Sonic All Star Racing.    the guys in my area (Woo Manchester!) made the Ingress logo using links and fields  https://plus.google.com/111159937155311616739/posts/GugmW3Rqdgf   I had some severe dental pain on Saturday, and I'd already had 1 too many painkillers.  the official medial advice from 111 was to wait until the morning for the emergency dentist. I didn't sleep that night.  Always wondered if I turned up at A E if I'd be turned away or just left to squirm in the corner if I was willing to tear my jaws off to stop the pain   I've got too many 'sonas, but I don't think Taern looks like me, I mean hell, I'm 6'2", his race is on average around 9 feet.  I think I designed all my characters and races to look every way different than I do.      We're a "special" lot.    Lynx' are so awesome. I am in no way biased whatsoever. Nope.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/asexuality-the-x-in-a-sexual-world_n_3444417.html?1371476630 utm_hp_ref=fb src=sp comm_ref=false  Here we go, back at my computer now.  That's got most of it covered.   I can't really explain sexual attraction as I've never experienced it.  But I imagine it as "oh, I'd like sex with that person" whereas I'm quite happy to just cuddle on the sofa at most. There's a cool article on HuffPost but I can't link as I'm on my phone ATM   Hah, I suppose we aren't. :P  Ace is just the nickname for Asexual. We're not sexually attracted to anyone, but we can be romantically attracted. In my case (Grey-ace) I can be romantically attracted to anyone but only after I get to know them really well. Otherwise it's the same as the sexual spectrum. Hetero, Homo, Pan, Bi, etc.   As RandomPotato said, Sexuality can be fluid. Some people find they'll go from Straight to Gay over time, and sometimes even back.  I've been Grey-Ace for all my life, but for all I know in a few years I could be Gay, or Straight, or still be Ace.   Sexuality isn't a defining feature for humans. Those who care what you do behind closed doors need a new hobby.    Immediately - Sort myself out. House, family members houses, etc.  Short term - go a bit mental. Go to all the festivals, travel the world, see things, do things.  Long term - Be very Philanthropic. Startups looking for funding? Here you go - no biggie if it doesn't go anywhere. Invest in stuff. Start up my own silly little gaming cafe thing, just because I can. Giveaways every day.   Dunno, in short. Just attach a a little tap to my bank account which will inevitably spring a leak and I won't give a crap to fix it.   I was there. Fucking amazing show. Rammstein blew them out of the water through sheer absurdity though.   Hello there fellow UK Fur! I'm in Manchester and I'm a Lynx.  I'm thinking of heading to Confuzzled next year, I'm too broke to head there this year.   Not in the slightest.   Nope. I'm me. I hide nothing when it comes to the internet. If I didn't want anyone to know about it, I wouldn't post or talk about it to anyone at all. that includes anonymity.    Have you seen Bolton/Manchester?  The Enlightened can't get a swing in without getting beaten back into the ground a day later. :(   Sounds fun, I'm guessing it's in the US, Can you pay for my flights?! :D   Nope! I'm sorry. :(   Drunk!   Kid!   [Kid, I had this awesome set of like 5 guns and we played in this field behind my house. I fell down a ditch and lended shin first on a fallen concrete post.](/spoiler)   Depends where you are, I'd imagine.  Look for decent coverage in the area you play a lot in.  I run with a Nexus 4 myself, on the Giffgaff network in the UK and it does pretty well.   Matt Berry plays the perfect sex pest.  "Oh baby, I like it when you touch me there!"  "That's your shoulder, and are you not at all worried about the giant demon coming towards us?"  "Hey, I like it when you touch me anywa-- WOAH what's that thing?!"   Yeah, twitching out on my end too. My scanner was showing a portal I'd captured a day or two earlier only having 1 level 1 resonator on it. Even though I'd upgraded to 4 4's and 4 3's.  Friend's scanner was showing that. Force stopped the app, restarted and everything - still nothing. Hope all is fixed by tomorrow.   There's more of us than I thought!  I wub you too. 3   Could always have a wander at Castlefield. Heck, just stop with a butty and sit on the grass near the walls.   Pre-toast a little bit, not too much. Maybe a minute on low heat  Put the cheddar on thick as you can get without getting too silly  Put under the grill until cooked to personal taste. Pull out, drip on some Worcestershire sauce.   that's what I have, anyway.   As some of the posters have already said - there's no need to label yourself or just jump right into the deep end.   I made my first 'sona almost a decade ago now, but it's only within the last few months I've decided "I'm a furry"  I don't let the label dictate me, nor the fandom. I'm also a brony, writer, doodler, and Asexual.  All of those have all sorts of different stereotypes, yes, they make me what I am today, but don't let one label get you down if you feel you _have_ to use that label.   I'm Asexual. I'm narrowing down my romantic scope still, though!   TiA is just /cringe but poking fun at people on tumblr for anything and everything anyone posts.   I like to think that it could be more than 1%, just people who might be ace just don't know what it is. I was convinced I was heterosexual with a low libido and a lack of shits to give until I heard about Asexuality.   Nope! Both Connie and Sasha missed on the plan, but Annie and Mikasa (I think) saved their asses at the last minute.    You're going to ruin everyone's festivals!   Huh! that's an interesting option - I'll give that one a go.   I've got an idea for a huge arcing story, but some small stories based in the universe might be good to get some ideas flowing and set in stone.   I'm studying a Dual Course - both A+ and Network+  It's not going too bad, I'm taking the first exam for the A+ next month, then I'll do the second after that.. Should be done then for A+.   I'm currently focusing on one project at the moment, but I fear if I start focusing on this one, I might lose some details of the rest of it. Guess that's what I have evernote for too.   I've got a full universe (lots of galaxies and FTL travel and everything) with races and planets and space stations and multiple stories all planned out... in my head.  It's hard to get it all out onto a mind map or onto paper. ._.   23, a few years out of an apprenticeship that went nowhere. Worked my way up from Line IT lackey to IT Trainer - now on 15k p/a.  Never went to Uni and dropped out of college when I was 1 year in. Studying CompTIA and Game Design on my own time and money.   I guess because there was no active damage going on, the Titan's body had a chance to regenerate. Whereas ErenTitan had other Titans hanging off him and chewing, so he didn't exactly break combat.   Wow. Holy Crap. [I mean I knew Eren was the Titan](#spoiler)  But the way the episode was laid out, the pacing, the action and the tension, oh god the tension.  [I nearly cried for Sasha, I've grown rather fond of her and I hate to lose the "comic" characters](#spoiler)   Yup, cycled to work. Nearly fell off the bike going uphill.  Wasn't too bad on the way back though.   Depends, mine are currently only shared with who I have on Latitude, so only 4-5 people actually see them   My avatars everywhere are my Fursona. Even on facebook where I connect with family and IRL friends. Had 1 like off my ex-gf, who was a fur herself.  No-one's given me hassle since, I guess I'm just mad enough so no-one really cares. My previous photos were me drumming, and me crosseyed at a party.   Those ears. My heart can't even   I'm known for my "I'll enjoy anything" attitude to films and games.  I nearly walked out of the cinema.   Cereal in fridge, milk in cupboard. Mornings elude me and I always forget what I did. Consider me surprised when I get home for tea, open the fridge..   "Oh. Muesli.   What are you-- I did it again didn't I?"   Crikey. I'm at work right now, though I'm getting out soon. Right now it's very much a WIP and I'm still developing the world/universe/politics yet. But I'll keep yous in mind!   I did a little while back - I can go dig up the links if you like  I've nothing too serious going on, just a few stories I have in my head and want to get out.   Yup. "The Waldo Moment"    If you swim in the Sea at Blackpool or Southport, expect whatever body parts went into the water to not come out again.    When I get out of my car, I take the phone out of the cradle, climb out the car, then put it in my pocket. Seems about right to me..   My Border Collie is called Benny.  He will come when called by anything. Heck, even if you make a noise. He's right there.  Choice names:  - Grump - Butt - Oi - Ben-ben - Dog - Stink-butt   Some of that looks pretty Steampunk to me!   I'm Hetero/Demi-romantic and I masturbate. Purely for Stress relief, mostly. Might get the occasional urge like.. once a month.   I also accidentally a word. I feex.   I'm train_subject8542, and I cut my 3 feet of hair off to completely bald in a mental breakdown  [](/applederp)                              as long as is shibe should be okay             wow                                 where draw line                          so open                                 offensive    I think it was..

The etching was so cool! Too much time on my hands...   Heh!   Nice!   Fire it up!   Back in Black was my first tape too!   It does kick much ass! Good first buy.   Hell yes it is.

I listen to that one about once a month. The Who is probably my favorite band ever, pound for pound.   Pour some sugar on me!   Nice! Not nice.   I love almost all of their earlier stuff.   Who's your favorite spice girl?   Yup!   The amount of people ITT with the same answer is a testimony to its greatness.   Surprised I haven't seen a 918 around here yet...   Nice.

That song does still rock. My favorite Anthrax song is [Fueled.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMzWeV4Xf9A)   Hah! I received the Grease soundtrack for Christmas when I was 8 too, I believe. Sandy was hot in those black pants...   I loved the ladies in their videos...   Sweet!   What's the worst that I can say?   You chose...correctly.   I remember one year, my mom took me school shopping...   Smart move! My parents subjected me to the horrors of the remake of Sergeant Pepper by the Bee Gees. Agh! The Beatles version is the ONLY version.    I had Pyromania first, but Hysteria was a good one, too!   And you still rock it, right?   You and 17 million others bought that. It was way more than a feeling!   Thanks!   "Keep on Loving You" - first song I slow danced with a girl to.   I am off to listen to Big Pig.   Smash is good. I hope you discovered NOFX after you got into punk rock.   That's my mop bucket!   Heh. I hear you on the Poison thing.   Can't go wrong with that one.   Rebel.   It's good to respect various genres!   THIS is a great story. Thank you, you wild and crazy guy.   Damn I hated when my Walkman got hungry.   Nice. Good choice.   Great first buy for sure.   Never heard of them. Interesting sound, I must admit!  EDIT: How the hell have I never heard them? I love it.   Hold me now...     Noooooo! They're all gonna laugh at you!   Just the word "Free Willy" always bring a smile to my face.   As you should.   I still have "For those about to rock" lying around on cassette somewhere.   That's awesome. Pretty much the only tape in the deck my entire Junior year in high school.      Sleeping with the CEO.   Heh heh heh...   Oh hell yes.   Proudly!   Love this one. Only song I skip is "Off his head."   Nice! I was 11 when Dirty Deeds came out. I am old.   Buy it now!   Nice alliteration.   I love that one.   First one I haven't heard of yet!   That is a classic!   Good one!   Awesome!   Excellent first purchase!   That's solid.   Mine was AC/DC - Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. I still listen to it, it holds up.       WTF was that giant military truck doing over on the other side of the bushes?   I never really noticed this until now. I'll never be able to unsee it!   Boooo...      YOU chill out!  Edit: sorry, I'm on the rag.   No. I've been struck down, dammit.   Probably not going to get the answer you want here...   My fridge is so cold it froze a few of my beers.   Yup. But damn I am hungry.   Pee on it.   She weighs 550 pounds.   Getting my teeth scraped at the dentist.   But how else are you going to hit the brown note?   Did I say it was a bad idea?   Vuvuzela.   Helium   Bout tree-fiddy.   It took me three days to finish mine!   Because it tastes like motherfucking chicken of the gods.   You guys make some huge fucking plates of food. I had a burrito there once that was bigger than my pillow.   Mmmkay   Red Lobster for the plastic lover in you!   Church of the Holy Potato   That's how Dexter did it.   I'm dead,hit in the head ten times by a Fender strat.   It was my lame attempt at referencing your user name.  ;)   Are you trying to start a...flame war?   Yup. The tow hook is an option.   Freakin' beautiful.   Nailed it!   Where you at, OP?   Jesus Christ, that looks frightening. Glad you two weren't more seriously hurt. Automotive safety has come a long way!  Did the other car stop, or did they not even know what they'd done?   Your Mom.  	152
 I'd say that I'm more of a Dean Koontz kind of guy, but I have read a lot of King, and he is a member of the fellowship.   I've never heard it said that way. One alcoholic death, however, can have a profound effect on many others. Truly "dying of alcoholism" - not including accidents - is gruesome. Unfortunately, I think that a common number bantered around right now is that 1 out of every 24 alcoholics ever makes it to the rooms. Of those, I'd guess that 1 in 10 is serious enough to survive. Most of the people I see in the rooms are only there to get their court papers signed to stay out of jail.   You can check out some of my short stories on http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Creepypasta_Wiki or http://www.inkitt.com/  Some are a bit farfetched and not as close to reality, though.  	3

Not following instructions can lead to disaster! Some disasters can be yummy though!   [This](http://i.imgur.com/d9rtLfn.jpg) for a long time. Recently switch to [this.](http://i.imgur.com/rvsdTIs.jpg)          Ah! Caught a picture of you on Saturday! http://imgur.com/Nf9WtTL Great job, btw!   Thanks! Your costume was great!      [Heres](http://i.imgur.com/Pdix44Z.jpg) my favorite picture I've taken of them. Cracks me up every time.      Gotta go fast!   Looks like "She's so drunk" to me. http://i.imgur.com/26ij3SZ.gif   I would suggest skipping over Walmart brand paper towels entirely and getting a large pack of a higher quality paper towel like Viva. Less air in the packaging and much more durable and useful for cooking. Anytime I buy a lower quality paper towel, I immediately regret it.   I lived in Tallahassee for 4 years (2009-2013) and have lived in Jacksonville before that and currently live in Riverside (4 months), so I think I may be of some help. If you're looking for nice walkable areas to enjoy outdoorsy stuff, both cities have their charms. Jacksonville has the beaches and the restaurants and bars in and around downtown/Riverside are great and improving at a very high rate. Tallahassee's downtown/Gaines street/midtown areas are also seeing a lot of improvement at a similar pace.  I feel that Jacksonville's Riverside is definitely more conducive for family activities with things for children and adults to enjoy, while in Tallahassee it is much more catered to those in their 20s. There may be some areas scattered around Tallahassee but not at the density I think you're looking for.  If you're interested in music and culture, both Jacksonville's Art Walk and Tallahassee's Railroad Square First Friday are both very similar events, but I really enjoy the intimacy of Railroad Square compared to the downtown event in Jacksonville.   Its definitely a tough choice as both cities are seeing massive improvements and have their drawback in terms of size/neighborhood selection.   Very few things qualify as "Fucking bonkers." This is definitely one of them.

 All mice, as with humans, are susceptible to cancer to some extent....and I guess some research suggests mice are generally more "susceptible" than humans to some types of tumors. The cool thing with the mice is that you can use targeted genetic mutations to make the mice far more susceptible to certain types of cancers, and then look at the effect of stimuli on that rate of tumor development. That's what the researchers did here: they took a strain of mouse known to develop a certain (mammary, in this case) type of tumor, and had a control group and a group exposed to a disruption of day/night cycle. Then they compared the two. Whether or not the mice develop tumors faster/more often than humans isn't so important...at least, not to this study. That's the beauty of the mouse studies -- taking genetically-identical mice and subjecting them to different conditions. I know it might not ultimately apply to humans, but it's a start.    That's an interesting premise I'd not considered...would the high HR and the resultant increase in blood flow be to defend against the rapid heat loss, or a result of compensation for the more rapid heat loss?   Some yes, some no. In this case the venom breaks up clots, not causes clots. The title is wrong.   They seem to make the implication that this new anti-thrombotic has a reduced risk of bleeding -- without testing that at all. If you can't clot, you're going to bleed...right? So that danger is still present.   To me, the novelty here is the ability to produce heterodimeric proteins in yeast in a balanced way; this opens up a LOT of novel methodologies for investigating new therapeutic agents that act as heterodimers instead of monomers or homodimers...and also as a screening tool to find small molecules that can interfere with heterodimerization in a now-measurable (and better controlled) way.  I find THAT part of the study extremely interesting and promising.   	4
 Yeah, and I never posted why I quit /r/Technology or publicly took credit for it and revel in the fact that the automod rule set I created there is (1) still mostly used by /r/Technology right this second and (2) it spread to more than half the current default subreddits.  Oh, wait..... I did publicly post all that info and revel in taking credit for it.    Considering I take credit for all this stuff, cause I like my badges of honor..... you're problem isn't that I did something bad.  It's that I did something good.  That others are seeing how my previous mod work was very good and are using it as the basis to stop you and your little nazi-wanna-be friends.    You calling me pathetic is such fun.   Because it's truly meaningless coming from you.   [Goodnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2dnfAJlUwo).     If your subreddit has to actually publicly post the "No Murder allowed" rule, you probably have a bit of quality control problem on your hands.     You are going to find this oddly fascinating.    Earlier tonight we had a user in mod mail explain that he was a Nazi, and not a NeoNazi.   As if there was some hair spiting difference I cared about in relation to that.  I guess the extremely violent (wanna-be, we hope) right wing cares about minor distinctions of that nature though.     And I'm sure it's a big coincidence that the hate-mongers who aren't regularly users of /r/Documentaries all found their way to that thread all at the same time too.   That isn't suspicious at all.     Oy vey.     The mods of /r/Europe are still modding the same way.   Heck, they are probably now even stricter than I ever was.    But then, I think the mods of /r/Europe are doing a fine job.      The /r/European user-base is all Stormfront wanna-bes and related idiots.   A good number of them took issue with [my comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qt8e?context=3) when Spez did his AMA.  All while they were unwittingly [Proving my point](https://np.reddit.com/r/european/duplicates/3d4tnh/infamous_power_mod_utrain_subject8652_linked_to/) with their every objection.    The mods are removing stuff there because those people are trying to turn their subreddit into /r/conspiracy, complete with a lot of Antisemitic comments and other crud.   The mods are doing a good job cleaning it up with locking the comment-thread.    Meanwhile, users from other subreddits are witch hunting the mod team there.   [Undelete](https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3dsi69/massive_censorship_happening_within/), [Conspiracy-1](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dskoq/the_mysterious_case_of_deleted/), [Conspiracy-2](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsq68/uss_liberty_documentary_reaches_front_page_with/), [Conspiracy-3](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dsmjd/watch_live_as_all_the_comments_on_a_rdocumentary/), [Conspiracy-4](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dt2kb/israeli_murders_rdocumentariescomments3dqwsathe/), etc.    Calling them complete lunatics would be putting it lightly.              Are you sure Fox News isn't in the service of Mephistopheles?     Only seven of them?    You need to follow all the religions, including the ones that contradict each other, and especially the ones that contradict themselves.        We got a note from a user and I looked at this and removed it now.    In then future, when you have a concern that something that might not be an appropriate submission, please message the mod team and we'll look at it as soon as we see the mod mail.   Thank you.          Excuse me, but I was under the impression that Tortoises were actually in control of levels 328, 418, 428, and 665.    And the less said about level 913 the best.  Those rabbits scare the crap out of me.     How does Pluto fit in with the Mickey Mouse head Earth theory?     I wonder if he fired small model airplanes going 600 mph into his stack of blocks?    His mother probably drew a line in the sand and told him he couldn't do that though.     Mr. Pibb does not have a degree from a prestigious university.   Which means that he is lazy good for nothing soft drink manufacturer.     Pepsi owns 7up outside the US.  But in the US market the Pepsi counterpart to Sprite is Sierra Mist.        You picked the wrong one and they let you live.   I doubt it was an official Pepsi Challenge because of that.   Or maybe you're a double agent.    Nobody even brings up RC Cola anymore.   Royal Crown is pretty much all but dead.   Oh well.   Still.... it was the best.           It's the drama that tastes the best.                       You should have run run people over with your very large tank fleet.     I thought about saying "Actions speak louder than words" to that,  but I figured my point would be missed entirely.     And they don't really care about facts so why bother sometimes?          Oh, I've earned about 600 comment karma from it.  I know that.   Because they are brigading, their down votes don't count really.    And more than double that again now.      Yeah,  I have gotten dozens of usernames mentions from there.  The comment was at about +120 and then they linked to it.   I'm sure somebody will be by to tell me how that isn't a brigade very soon now.     If we are lucky, the press will force him to change his mind.     I did ready my comment ahead of time.  But it was based on four or five comments I had written over the last couple of weeks.   I just edited them all into one comment.  Mostly because I knew there would be tons of comments in the thread.   And now after about an hour it's gotten over 8500 comments.   It's on it's way to 40K or 50K+ comments in there probably.   I assume several other people did the same thing.     The comment was at about +120 then they linked to it.   I'm sure they will be by to tell us how they aren't a brigade at all.    Don't bullshit me.    The *ethics in journalism* line is total fucking bullshit of the highest order.   It's a lie you guy's KNOW is a lie but say it anyway.   That subreddit lacks all ethics.    What is /r/KotakuInAction about:  See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv31/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1qs7n) by /u/str1cken.  It will tell you want that subreddit is about.    I'll cut and paste the comment here.     gt;I haven't seen any personally "nasty stuff" about Pao   gt;Nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race.  Hey there!  I was curious about this myself, so I did a little bit of research.  Right now 16 of the top 20 posts *of all time* in KiA are about Ellen Pao directly (the post includes her name in the title) or indirectly (either about policies she has made or holding her responsible for things happening on reddit).  Weird, right? This sub is 10 months old but 80% of the top-upvoted posts in the subreddit are about Ellen Pao. Huh.  I know, I know : It's actually about ethics in games journalism.  Here are some choice net-positive-vote-total comments from just the top 5 Pao-related posts on KiA:  "[Arrogant bitch defines Ellen Pao quite well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c2e68/ellen_pao_to_nyt_the_most_virulent_detractors_on/csrq9ha)" [+222]  "[ekjp... ellen kj pao...

The best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.    For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine BS and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.  The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.    Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.    There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in their attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Homophobes, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.    These radical nuts run subreddits like: /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European,  /r/Holocaust (holocaust deniers), /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc.   Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    If they don't take care of it, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.      Another point that largely gets  ignored in this debate:  Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist and hate-group users generally strive to drive out the non-racist users.      Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) try and only talk about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.     Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.  And it will become a bad-user reinforcement-cycle with more and more bad users driving out, they hope, all the good users.    These groups even know this, and count on the non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing*, as they are actively attempted to take the entire site over.  That is their goal.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into more racist bigots.     If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.      Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).  Other web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups. It's high time that Reddit did the same.   I also want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means "Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on "Free Speech" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly.   In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to make Reddit into a hate-propaganda site.   Hopefully the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.   * https://xkcd.com/1357/                        FPH was never a top-20 subreddit.  It had about 150K subscribers.   That would, rounding up a bit to assume it had nearly 160K, had made it the 220th largest subreddit.    http://redditmetrics.com/top         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6jgkcANRE      He's claiming I'm evil.      /u/Blackstar9000, good to hear from you again.  And good to hear that you generally agree with me.  I didn't see this thread until just now.   Next time maybe shoot me a PM please.    I see most of the other points I would have made in response to you already made by some others in this thread, so I won't bother repeating them.     But I do want to reiterate one point that I think was large ignored.   Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist users generally drive out non-racist users.      Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) talk try and only about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.

And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.    These groups even know this, and count on non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing* when it comes to what they are trying to do.    They want to take over.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into racist bigots.      If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.      I want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means "Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on "Free Speech" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly.   In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to eliminate people they disagree with.      It could have been harsher.  I could have invoked Turtle Power.     Is that the one guy created all those fake accounts?    I would have thought he would still be sleeping.    https://i.imgur.com/P1WZMpC.gifv               Commie bastard.  :-)                     Excuse me, but "open and honest discussion" never includes calls for mass genocide.    And anyone who thinks it would doesn't understand what any of those words mean.  Period.      Except that the best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.    For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.      The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.    Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.    There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in the attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.    These radical nuts run subreddits like /r/Holocaust (holocaust denial), /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc.   Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.      /u/Spez's post here gives me hope that, at long last,  the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.    Okay.    Yes, and it's a poorly managed bizzaro land at that.     Daeres is a very good moderator.  He's not some kind of crazy guy who sends in 5000 tanks to crush the bones of his enemies beneath them, like georgy_k_zhukov.   He's more interested in utilizing highly controlled air power to bomb out a city center and then secretly poisoning the local water supply.   And that is when he releases the genetically modified killer hamsters with lasers on their heads into the ecosystem.      From a mod perspective, it's never a simple banning.  It really can be a thing of pure beauty.                        I would see anti-brigading measures as something important to moderators.    I'm pretty sure that I am not the only one.    I am not sure if it's priority #1, but it's certainly important.    [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgzbvef?context=3).  Good night, Alice.    I'm sorry, but equating /r/Atheism with people calling for mass genocide of X-ethnic group.    Holocaust deniers are not part of any "bastion of intellectualism".    You are purposely being colossally intellectual dishonest and undeserving of any more response.  Full stop.        /r/Technology was removed as a default by the admins after I resigned in a very public way from the mod team.   It was the lack of actions by the mods who refused to improve the subreddit that caused the admins to remove it as a default subreddit.   [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3) for info on what happened.   As to the Automod config that I helped author at /r/Technology, it has ended up being used at more than half the current default subreddits.   You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this: **I'm proud of that fact**. It was and still is a great configuration. Heck, /r/Technology is still using the majority of it right this second.   The other mods there with me, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, TheSkyNet, etc. all of us resigned in protest at the inactivity of our then fellow moderators.   Fellow mods who refused to discuss anything at all about how the subreddit should function.    Of course, we were of the opinion that a subreddit called /r/Technology should actually be focused on technology, not ancillary topics like business, marketing, politics or simple news.    Stock price fluctuations are not about technology.   A simple car fire is not a r/Technology story.    News stories have a large subreddit called /r/News that exists for them.   And political stories have a large subreddit called /r/Politics for them.   My degrees are in computer science.  Software and hardware are technology.   Stock price is not.   An article about how a new type of electric car works is technology, where as an article about the current stock price of the electric car company is not.      Heck, the haters figured out we were doing the right thing after we resigned.  That was why lots of people demanded the resignation of the old do-nothing mods and many of the new mods after we left.       Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.    When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.     Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).   There are many things were there are NOT two sides to the issue.   There is just the correct view, and the wrong view.    For example, evolution does not have two sides to the debate.  Instead what you have people who believe in science and complete and utter morons.  The anti-science idiots have no right to their opinion.   Period.    This is true of several issues.   Evolution is is real.   Climate Change is real.  The Holocaust happened.  The US Civil War was about Slavery.   Anti-vaccine hysteria is bullshit.       /r/Science does not allow comments from people who don't believe in evolution, spread anti-vaccine propaganda, or deny climate science.   The same goes for other science based subreddits such as /r/askscience and /r/Biology.      [An article](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) written by /u/Nallen on why /r/Science does not allow Climate Change deniers.   Likewise, /r/History and it's fellow history-based subreddits such as /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory do not allow Holocaut Denial, Ancient Aliens BS, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crap, Neo Nazi propaganda, and other forms of history denial.   And I'm sorry, but these are not topics that the mod-teams of these subreddits are going to open up for debate.  Because there is no debate about them by anyone except hate-based groups who are knowingly pushing hate-based agendas.    If you do not like these mod-policies, then you are free to unsubscribe from our subreddits immediately.    [I'm familiar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c8cdm/the_rmodtalk_clique_is_not_allowing_new_mods_to/cstaed0?context=3) with their partial brand of idiocy.   There are many of those types of subreddits.  I was not attempting to create an all-included-comprehensive list.    I have been very disappointed in the reddit community for a while now.   There were often submissions to backwater hate-based subreddits about Ellen Pao that had comment chains which were all comments about her sex and race.  This was well before the blow ups with the mods.  Nominally the news story submissions were about her law suit with her former employer, but they were all nothing more than excuses for idiots to gather round an make  sexist and racist comments.    Subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/SubredditCancer, /r/Undelete, /r/KotakuInAction, /r/Redpill, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/GreatApes, etc. all made common-cause in the effort to say nasty stuff about Pao.  Then when the ruling about FPH was handed down, they made sure to invite all those hate-based users into their idiot-clubhouses.    When the mods of the defaults acted, independent of of any of that crap, those idiots pored out of the word work again.    Mod teams wanted to make sure that our users and the press knew that we didn't care about Ellen Pao's lawsuit or be thought to be in common cause with a bunch of hate-based idiots.  At /r/History we threw together a [wiki-page to explain our reasons for going dark](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/timer).      Now something that needs to be addressed very quickly are the various hate-based groups which are actively attempting to *colonize* (their word) parts of reddit.   Several hate based groups of white supremacist, neo nazis, holocaust deniers, etc. are setting up shop around Reddit.     Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    As such, the admins need to directly address the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for pure hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.   I've been saying this [since before](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/3c7pj1/rmodtalk_seems_like_a_very_levelheaded_community/cstg9jt?context=3) Ellen Pao resigned.   I'm saying it now.  I will continue to say it in the future.         I'm surprised this story doesn't claim he killed them all and was instead about whether he was legally entitled  to keep the dead bodies.     Do you think Trump could type more than 140 characters?     A simple alternative might be some kind of thread-trigger (similar to when a mod flags a thread as nsfw), that automatically causes a stanza that locks the thread to be added to the subreddits Automod config.   Then it could be a simple extension of how automod already functions.   But without the mod needing to know how to code it directly or edit Automod config.     Just going to leave [this here](https://xkcd.com/1357/).    Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.    When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.     Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).   It's one thing to see a good and bad side to various issues, but there are some things are primarily one or the other.   And by vast orders of magnitude.   For example,  white supremacist hate groups are bad.   I think we can credibly say that without worrying about extraneous factors.     The same goes for similar groups that espouse holocaust denial, proponents in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crazies, believers that all-Muslims are terrorists, etc.   One also finds that these other fringe groups all have more than a small amount of overlap with the white supremacist racist groups.   So much so that I think we can begin to speak of them as one large hate-feast.   Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.   This is something that the Reddit admins need to immediately address.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.           /u/Maxion and /u/dzneill used to be good at that too.   /u/Il_Shades, for about two weeks until Anu and Max drove him to quit cause he dared to think that the rues applied to everyone.             My second link explores our arguments with him about that.  /u/Rolmos and /u/Creesch are in that thread showing the screenshots of do-nothing Qgyh2 from the modlog.     The automod configuration wiki page from /r/Technology ended up being used by more than half the current defaults.   Right this minute.    You act like that is some kind of shame for me, but get this:   I'm proud of that fact.   It was and still is a great configuration.    Heck, /r/Technology is still using the VAST majority of it right now.      Go sell crazy somebody place.  We aren't buying it here.     You saw who the applictions were from and HOW they were collected.   And you know I was not the one who was adding anyone as a moderator. /u/TheSkyNet, /u/Agentlame, /u/Skuld, etc. were the ones inviting the new moderators after they were voted on in the backroom.   But then, you just don't care what the facts were, then or now.     Except the fact that Qgyh2 wouldn't let /r/Technology recruit new mods to join the team, and when we decided that we had to do it because we desperately needed more hands to help run the subreddit..... well, that blew up big time.   [See here](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3).    Also, he's famous for doing nothing.  [See here](https://np.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pkb2b/sorry_reddit/).   You sound like the kind of guy maybe I should try and recruit to mod /r/Food.        I didn't remove those for personal grudge.  I removed them because those idiots were using /r/Ideasfortheadmins for their personal grudges.   And I would remove it again today for the same reason.    You want to believe BS, you can believe it all you want.  But it's still BS.  If people want message mod teams, there is a link of the sidebar of every subreddit that does just that.   It's very easy for them to use it.   But they always want to act like it's something only rocket scientists can figure out.              He was fried.  Let him stay fried.     It's not just /r/AskHistorians, but a whole bunch of subreddits, from /r/History, /r/science, /r/askscience, /r/Biology, /r/BadHistory, /r/HistoryPorn,  and even none history or science topic subreddits.   Places like /r/Politics, /r/Bestof, /r/GetMotivated, /r/Apple, /r/AskReddit, /r/IAMA, /r/todayilearned, etc.  All have varying rule-sets they use for comments and submissions.   Some remove not much more than the rules of Reddit require, but all will remove a bit more than the admins require.   Even if it's just blatant mass-postings of profanity  (Things like the word "FUCK" repeated hundreds of times), to racism, trolling, etc.    Mod teams get to define these rules.   If users don't like it, they can discuss it with the mods or use another subreddit.  There are thousands of subreddits out there.   But /r/History is never going to allow Holocaust denial.      And while Spez has now said the didn't mean to effect this, some undesirable users are going to point to his comment to play bullshit rules lawyer games.     Just going to cut and paste what I just posted in /r/Modtalk.   ---    /r/History removes hundreds, if not thousands, of comments on a daily basis.  This is true for several subreddits.  We also ban people a lot for breaking our rules against history-denial.   Holocaust denial is just the #1 form of history-denial.   There are several other types.    /r/AskHistorians is the same way.   Same with /r/HistoryPorn, /r/BadHistory and several other subreddits.    /r/Science bans science-denial, be it climate change denial, creationists, anti vaxxers, etc.   Same with lots of other science-based subreddits.   The mods of these subreddits use all the tools at our disposal to deal with these idiots.  Regular bans, Automod-bans, automod rule sets for both comments and submissions, and we even have more specific bots that enforce rules where automod can't.   And we still have a lot of mod-work that needs to be done to keep our subreddits properly clean and curated.   If /u/Spez thinks moderators are going to have to tolerate these assholes ruining our subreddits, and their agenda-pushing political bullshit, then he should just cut to the quick and resign as CEO right now.    ---  I will say that Spez is now trying to engage with moderators, but it's just beginning.        One thing that I think the admins are going to need to directly address is the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust and others there exist solely to spread hate.     Right now, [/r/coontown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shitholes on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylann Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    This info was brought to my attention by /u/PraiseBeToScience in another discussion.   I didn't know the problem was that extreme already.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit. Or any other corporation for that matter.   This is something that they need to address.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully the media pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.       What was it - more than Four years ago?   This place exploded into a bunch of shit.   I'm still not exactly sure what happened then and I was there for it.       This place has been quiet for a while.           Well, having the Spez back makes up for a long of things that have been happening.  Welcome home.     Karma is meaningless.      I miss /u/cupcake1713.      So, when I mindless suggest 666 stickies, you're saying maybe.                    I have a theory that all mental hospital patient used computers have /r/conspiracy listed as the default browser homepage.    I believe that conclusion is supported by all current evidence.                                The Confederate Constitution forbade states from ever amending their constitution from interfering with the institution of slavery.  The Confederate Constitution made slavery a forever pact that could never be removed.   They loved states rights so much that at the beginning of their attempt-a-country they limited the power of states rights.    I'm sorry, but there were no other real issues involved in the American Civil War.  All the other ancillary issues are the slavery question in disguise.          The reason Lincoln eventually became anti-Slavery late in the war is that he realize it was the root cause of the Civil War.    The country couldn't exist with it and not fight Civil Wars.  If you ban it, then you get rid of the root problem of the war.     The Confederacies own leaders said they were fighting the war for slavery.   The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens explains point black the the Southern States were attempting to found a new nation based on ""upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition".    So Lincoln decided that to win the war for real, Slavery had to be eliminated.   After the war, the former Southern leaders took to rewriting their own history to say that they were fighting for other things.   Normally bringing up States Rights, but also talking about the Southern Agrarian Economy, Tax issues, Tariff policies,  etc.   But each of those alternate explanations for the war are all really just the slavery question in disguise.    Southern Economy was based on slavery.   Tax issues, around profits made from goods produced by slavery.   Tariffs on products again produced by slavery.   States rights, to own people as farm animals.    Slavery is the core issue the war was about.    Every other issue involved in the war was, at it's heart, also the slavery issue.    After the war, Confederate General James Longstreet was asked what the Civil War was fought over.  His response was simple:  "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".   He knew what his war was about.  Saying it was about anything else is outright lying.    Frederick Douglass became one of the people who helped turn Lincoln into the *Great Emancipator* after his death.    Douglass understood that Lincoln had figured out that the root cause of the war was slavery and that he then fought to destroy the very institution that caused the war.     Sadly, they think laws against murder are also being required to do something. Well, not do something, but laws against murder clearly limit their liberty to murder people.   And once you have placed limits on murder, then it's just a slippery slope to real crimes, like lying to an insurance agent.     The one where you confess to being the gnome on the grassy knoll.     What are you going to do when people find out how messy your desk is at Warlizard central?   Zathras?    	150
 True, however...  Men's haircuts generally take much less time, say 20-30 minutes, and to keep a hair style you generally have to go twice a month at $20 a pop. My girlfriend on the other hand goes once every 2 months and each cut/color take like 3-4 hours and costs her about $140.   So the hourly rate for both sexes is about the same (~$40/hr) and the overall cost is just determined by how often you go.   1. Cough. That feeling where you're constricting your throat right before any air actually comes out. That's what you're going for.  2. Take a quick, deep breath while constricting your throat and force the air in. Weird noises should happen, and changing the pressure in your throat will modulate the sound.   3. Continue to make sea gull/pterodactyl until you get absurdly light headed.   The "pre-cooked" on the sign was referring to the weight of the steak before it's cooked, as there is no way to tell how much the steak will be after it's cooked. Many places that sell meat use this nomenclature to advertise the weight of meat.   In this situation, the steak was 3.5oz BEFORE you cook it.    Only Mac Pro's use ECC RAM. All their laptops use non-ECC. Actually, you'd be hard pressed to even find laptop ECC RAM for any system.   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148609     Um.. yea..  That made me feel uncomfortable   2 reasons why this is silly:  -There was a special edition CoD Xbox with a 1TB hard drive  -You can use an USB 3.0 external hard drive (min 256GB). You can pick up a 1TB external for like $40-$50.   http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/AT-T--Nokia-Lumia-635/productID.307447800  Select the no contract option, and its $49!!   You can get a much better phone, the Lumia 635, for $49... They make great GPS, MP3, Point-and-Shoot cameras, etc.   If you're feeling generous while at dinner, find a couple that may be out on a date night, and secretly pay their bill. If you move to the bar after dinner, you might be able to see their fantastic reaction when they find out! Also, tip the waiter nicely (if deserved)  I did something similar to this once... It's an incredibly feeling being candidly nice to strangers   MY dog would destroy those bottles in a few minutes :/   Its not that they are downvoting him for owning a CRT, it's more that he is known is this sub for evangelizing the benefits of a CRT to an almost delusional degree... Many people consider him to be a troll on the matter.  Look at the title of his post for instance, "...344Hz Gaming Rig". It's only 344Hz @448x336 resolution which is on par with an old cell phone. Also, a walkthrough of his comment history is "interesting".   Pshh... You're getting downvoted lol  I completely agree. I don't even understand why you would post here instead of just contacting Amazon about it. Also, you're factoring non-business/shipping days into that. Yes, it is still longer than their promised 2 day shipping even without the weekend. They have amazing customer service and I frequently get emails asking if my packages arrive on time. Instead of ranting, be proactive.   I've dealt a lot with MakerBot's and I would personally never buy one. There are many comparable alternatives for almost half the price and the newer 5th Gen models have AWFUL extruders... they clog like crazy and are not nearly as easy to disassemble and clean as other models. Also, their support is a joke. I called there sales line asking how much an additional extruder (the newer models have easily detachable extruders) would cost, and the guy seemed confused. I explained that I wanted an extra so that I could quickly swap it out when one clogged, and he in a shocked voice told me that sounded like a good idea, but they weren't selling them at that time, but his "guess" would be somewhere around $200... wtf?!  They have name recognition and Thingiverse (giant scam), but make a inferior and more expensive product.   So, what exactly does go into a PROPER detail? For they layperson who may want to detail a car themselves, do you have any tips, tricks, or specific products?  Thanks!   What kind of fryer is that?? It looks like a ceramic bowl    As others have said, this is probably ground loop noise. An easy way to test this, assuming you're in the US is to use a 3-prong to 2-prong adapter on power sources. If that solves your issue, look into getting a power conditioner or a ground loop noise filter.  Good luck!   So what your saying is, if you do it wrong, it wont work?  Sounds about right. :P   I suspect he was under-trained. If you notice, he dropped the gun in the video because he was not expecting kickback from a taser.  He's 100% responsible for his actions, but I highly doubt his intentions were to straight up shoot the guy, especially in front of a bunch of cops and cameras.   I lol'd. Nice title :)   Thank *you*! Feedback is so important!   Phones are a different story as Microsoft JUST acquired Nokia, so they were technically an OEM, not first party product like the Surface at the time.   Definitely not piles of anything lol. They *try* to keep a few on replacements on hand, but anyone can use myservice.surface.com for any Surface product to get a warranty replacement if deemed necessary.  Just to clarify, these are anecdotal references based on my personal experiences and do not necessarily reflect the opinions or procedures of Microsoft.   Haha, glad you're enjoying it.  Personally, I have a cheap "weatherproof" Bluetooth speaker that I just keep in the bathroom and connect it to my phone or Surface before showertime!   This wont work. There is a large back stock of S2's for warranty exchanges. Depending on which model you have, you're looking at about $60 for a Surface 2 trade-in I believe although that fluctuates constantly  I work in a MS store.   Possibly? I honestly don't know as the optical stack on a SP3 is so small. That being said, you can purchase desiccant on Amazon for not too much. Keep the Surface in an unsealed container completely covered in silica desiccant beads for several days and see if that removes moisture.. If you have the original box, the grey outer sleeve might work well.  Alternately, if you have a MS Store near you, you could try to replace the Surface there although it may be deemed user damage and not be covered under warranty.  Let me know how it turns out!    Couple things to try...   1. Run all your updates, including the optional ones as they frequently include driver updates.  2. You can download the SP3 driver pack from [here.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826) Download the latest available version an install them.  3. You can try a "Refresh". This essentially removes all programs and re-installs the OS, but leaves all your settings and personal files. If you're willing to swap the device anyway's, this could be an easier solution. To do a Refresh, simply start typing the word "refresh" on the Start Screen and choose the appropriate option on the right hand column. Alternately, you can go to Charms Bar  Settings  More PC settings  Update and Recovery  Refresh.  Seeing as the unit actually works when you re-enable the driver, it seems like a software issue rather than a hardware issue and could be fixed at home. Let me know how that goes!   I deal with Surfaces a lot (hundreds) and I've never seen this before. It's highly unlikely, but is there a chance liquid got under the screen, especially condensation? If you kept in in the bathroom while running a hot shower kind of situation?    I work for Microsoft.  Go to www.microsoftfeedback.com and fill out the survey. They are taken very seriously and seen at the store level and higher. Also, Samantha would most certainly be recognized by her managers if you copied this post.   If there is a Microsoft Store near you, then yes. You can also arrange a new one to be shipped to you via myservice.surface.com, but the Store would just be easier.   ?!   This is true, a majority of the marketing shows the keyboard attached. There is almost always a * stating the keyboard is sold separately, but your point is valid.   You don't have to catch the dust, but I have both the blower and the vacuum and use them in tandem... vacuum on one side of the PSU/heatsink/etc and the blower on the other. Works pretty well, but you could just take it to your garage or outside.   I don't see anyone mentioning that webcams almost universally have an "active" light on them, so you know when your webcam is actually turned on. IIRC, the light and camera are essentially on the same circuit, so you can't have the camera on without the light being on making it EXTREMELY obvious...  	32

 TNTD so good    I feel so bad for this guy.    Just wondering if people think it could/will.    What would you do, where would you go to survive a zombie apocalypse?    I agree, he's the greatest, I mean Titanic and Avatar were everything.    It's because he has a good personality on set, that's the only reason he's taking over all these blockbusters.    Titanic is my favorite movie.    Bug (2006)   Warcraft   I know Whiplash and John Wick are two of them. What are some others?    Mine began with Armageddon, Titanic, Pearl Harbor, The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 96/97/98.    In, The Village, when Bryce Dallas Howard is running through the house to get away from the monsters and the music is going, it's so beautiful.    Warcraft   Tron 3   Jurassic Park had better graphics than Jurassic World.    I saw a movie Extinction came out in 2014. I know Disney's Dinosaur was good...is Extinction good or any others?    The theme for Titanic was popular.    The scene where Arwen is slowly dying and Elrons like "your hands are cold."    Titanic   I agree with you ... JP, TLW, JW, JP3   When Chris Pratt had to stop her from screaming for those kids...homage to JP.   I just don't see the flaws and am wondering what they are.    When the raptors take the side of the Indominus Rex...what!?! Major twist    That old girl T-Rex man she stole the show...was a little disappointed we didn't get more of her but what a twist there at the end.   The face off at the end was everything we could have hoped for, the raptors were awesome.   Now what? Sequel? :) I hope so.    James Cameron    I enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd too. :)    He/she will I think   	27

 And any one of you would do the same exact thing given his situation. Akron Beacon Journal, or ESPN? Please tell me you wouldn't. I don't blame him one bit. If you can forgive LBJ, then you shouldn't hate Windhorst at all.    What did he actually say? Anyone have a link?   There was a post that Broussard made earlier that has since been deleted that said LeBron was going to Cleveland. Wish I would've screen grabbed it.    There was multiple posts from Broussard and @Probballdraft that have since been removed. Wonder why?   There is dialogue between Garen and Darius. I know that much at least.   No need to be an ass   I used to have an account at Torrentleech from back in 2008 and had it all the way up until last year when after a few months of inactivity got it deleted. If anyone has an extra invite to spare I would forever be in your debt. Thanks.    I've actually had it happen to me only once, and it was $20 after making a withdrawal from the bank. They must've realized their mistake because it was taking out of my account a day later.    Did not expect to hear anything about the vestibule for the rest of my life. That place ate up a lot of my time when I was a teenager.    Ben Tate is also a Cleveland Brown now. Can't discount that.   He was talking about Vi, not Yi.   How long does it usually take for them to finish?   For some reason your link isn't working for me.   Am I missing something, because I thought the WiiU wasn't doing very well as of right now.

Also, your boyfriend looks like a skinny/hairy version of Ryan Gosling. Also, I hate cats. That is all.    Stardust is a pretty good one to watch in almost any situation. Also, the Star Trek (2009) remake.    I understand that spreading it across the menu is a better idea. I was just stating that raising the price of one burger on the menu is not a good indicator of how to compensate for the raise increase.    I am for raising the minimum wage, but I don't like this argument either. By raising the cost of the Big Mac $1.28 on top of what it already is, you cannot expect the same amount of people to buy it. Then, you would have to raise the price of other items to compensate even more.    Hello everyone; first post here. I recently purchased a home theater setup and was looking for some feedback. Haven't even installed everything yet.   * Center: Polk CS10 * Front: Polk TSi300 Floorstanding * Surround: Polk TSi100 Bookshelf * Sub: BIC America F12 * Receiver: Harmon Kardon AVR1700  I just noticed this sub today, and was looking to make sure I made the right choices. Any help at all is appreciated.    I am confused as to why this is funny? Help?   I am still undecided between the SC-2010 and the Remington R5. I'm glad to see though that the grip actually does something in this game though compared to previous ones.    What kind of dog is that?   Unless this is offset by a reduced retail price, I will most likely not be getting this game.   Anyone got video?    ...what thread?   "Allahu akbar"  A lot of people would flip their shit.

 3 guesses in which country it is native!   Isobel Carmody - Darksong   That dog is having a great time!   I don't think bitter would be accurate to describe how I feel. Sure I wasn't singing its praises, but I wasn't exactly being hateful about it. It bothers me and I said so. Can't a person express dislike for something without being bitter? You seem determined to pigeonhole me as some bitter, twisted man-hating feminazi when that is not me at all   What he meant was "because...boobs"   And I spent it curled up on the couch in my PJs, watching movies, eating apple pie and playing Pokemon with my husband :D   I'm a poet and I didn't even realise!   Ok ok, calm down. Just making an observation. And not that it means much to you, but I have never once used Tumblr. A woman can make valid social observations and not be labelled a man-hating feminist   Yeesh. There is a problem. Wanna talk about it more?   There it is!   Personally, I had no emotional attachment to him either, so I am not too broken up about it..but some people might have seen him in that light (well, maybe not as much as Robin Williams. That man was a global treasure)   :(   Well when Robin Williams died I legitimately wept and mourned, even though I had never met him. You can mourn the loss of a great person, because it is not only your loss, but the world's loss   All aboard the Carousel of Crazy! Ring a ding!   I'm sorry?   Ugh, buses. Travelling insanity boxes   Hey not towards me! Go creep out someone who isn't me.  And honestly, I've heard creepier   Uhhh   Knock yourself out   That's the spirit!   For some reason I figured you were goig to "try again" with her tomorrow.  But now I realise you might mean to move on. Nevermind. Not creepy.   Man, I'm just here for funny pictures and scary stories   Only a nark would ask such a question. Don't commit your hate crimes here, nark!   ...I'm sorry, it means bad-tempered. British term   He has gone to the big gaming room in the sky where no cartridges need blowing and every score is a high score   See, where I am, it's Monday afternoon. Plenty of reasons to be narky   Good motto for life. Keep at it!   But don't...y'know, be creepy about it   Noted.   Is that your crass answer? Or have you got another one?   Let's hear your gripes!   You are right. What's with that? It seems like half of their energy is spent lamenting their lack of girlfriends and the other half is spent being sexist.   ...   I am sensing a correlation here   You are right. Exaggerated titles are a Reddit staple....and they bother me. They shouldn't. It's petty. But it bothers me because some people actually agree with the exaggeration   Personally, I think dressing yourself and your kid up and going out in public isn't really something to warrant so much praise. Sure it's cute, but it doesn't make anyone the World's Best Parent. If I had a kid and my husband dressed up with him and got unending praise, I'd be a bit bothered because it's not really a great sacrifice to do that.  And I know this may just seem like I am trying contradict you but I fully intend to be that type of mum. Mostly because I will get fun out it too. But I would hate for people to think that *that* makes me a MOTY   These guys don't have to do much it seems to be FOTY, yet I rarely see a Mother of the Year. Literally all a man has to do is talk to a child and he is FOTY but mums would probably have to jump in front of a bullet to be MOTY...and even then it would probably be chalked down to "but mums are supposed to do stuff like that!"   Sarcasm is way too hard for me to detect on Reddit. I once ripped into a dude for being rude and sarcastic but he was legit, and I felt so bad. Now I take anything ambiguous as non-sarcastic just to be safe   I didn't say that was the reasoning for everyone. That is my reason   Shit yes. Being nekkid in your own house is the best feeling in the world. I especially loved it at my family home. We had lots of verandahs and were in the middle of the bush so there was no one but the trees and birds to see me.    Who doesn't?!   We found the idiot driver!   I took the safest option today: stayed in my PJs on the couch all day and watched movies.  100% safe!   Yes   Very   I know you are being sarcastic, but it was a bad breakup and seeing someone who looks so much like him makes me uncomfortable   Ugh. I couldn't imagine a more painful movie to watch. What's the point?  Plus, my ex looks like Channing Tatum, so I can't stand that dude  Edit: I'm sorry?   And there are a large group of women who don't like Magic Mike   Not pregnant. No excuses   Maybe later. Too busy eating pie right now      Because they can   It's the brand-name tinfoil. Great quality   Was...was the mayor a stripper?   I wanted to be either a Palentologist or an Egyptologist.   I couldn't be an Egyptologist coz I would have to move to Egypt and I decided I couldn't be a Palentologist coz I thought all the dinosaurs would be discovered by the time I was older   ...is that better?   These clinics are hubs for human trafficking in the form of "surrogacy". Shame shame shame on you!   Fuck off, this does NOT belong here!!!   Well you did call your son Wolf...   Lol. Actually it was more like:  "Penny! Penny! Penny, come here you idiot! Don't just stand there looking at me you little bitch. Get out of the goddamn garden."  My neighbour angrily popped her head over the fence from amongst her bushes and had to take a few moments to figure out my deal   Wrangling beauracracy is my hidden talent   I'm sorry you are in what sounds like a troubling situation but this is not the right sub I think.  You might be after r/askdocs   My neighbour had the same name as my dog but she didn't know until I was out thr front one day and yelled at my dog for some reason. My neighbour was also in her front yard and got really confused when I started yelling at her   I got it done first try! The lady said people rarely get it done first try :D   Turns out they don't like colour copies. She had to redo mine, but dodn't charge me :)   I'm confused. My husband does this all the time (he is the ticklee, I'm the tickler)...are you saying I should film it and can reap karma?   "I'm smart you're dumb  I'm big, you're...err..."   In that case I will bring in my colour copies :)   And people say Australia is expensive! Jeez! My course was 6k a year but I didn't pay a cent til I was out of uni and working in a job related to my field   Great, thanks :)   butch  Nice try New Zealander!     Hi,   I am applying for my passport and on the application form it requests you bring photocopies of your documents but nowhere does it specify that they be certified. Does anyone know if you need to get them certified before attending the interview?  I know you need your photos guarantored but this is just the birth cert. and stuff   I loved it there! It was very pretty. We definitely want to go back and explore more   You would think that would not need pointing out but...here we are.  I might have made my meme better by saying "turn on your indicator *sooner*"  The guy who inspired this turned it on as he turned   But...but...I moved here from QLD and I *like* the cold   Ha ha yes! Exactly that place. To be fair though, it is one of the most beautiful places in Malta and it isn't a very large island.  I ended up leaping at him and hugging him so fiercly that he almost fell off the edge...oops :/      Maybe he thought you said Honey Pigeon and thought you were going to eat it?   And set the ocean on fire, just to be safe   ...yay?    Ha ha that's why he is my Hall Pass! He is just so *nice*!   Ridic  Short for ridiculous.  Just fucking say the word!!!   I say hubby because husband sounds too formal and old. I hate wifey though, don't have honey to do lists and our sexy time is usually whenever my...hubby....grabs my hand and puts it on his junk   I dunno. Probably equally as pathetic as someone who is able to recognise everything as a repost or deliberately goes out of his way to find one...   Aka a Hall Pass.  Mine is Dwayne Johnson and his is Natalie Portman   "...this fucking guy"   Pot.  ...not the good type. The mundane type that you put flowers in   Sassy Harry is my favourite Harry. If we were nice all the time I jut wouldn't like him as much   Unless like most religious surprises, the cake is a lie   And so God said unto Abraham, "Woof!"  And Abraham said unto God "Who's a good boy then? Who's a good boy?"   Oh good! I like surprises :D   Quite smitey   Uhh...yes?   If you believe in that sorta thing, of course   Just because someone thinks it is art doesn't mean it should be appreciated. So much crap is done in the name of art that just makes places look stupid.   It may be art, but I don't like it either. Looks trashy   I saw it (or its twin) in Flagstaff gardens the other day!  If it is weird and out-of-place but looks kinda deliberate, just assume it is art.   If I don't want to hug someone (I'm not a touchy feely type of person) I just pretend to have a coughing fit just beforehand. I manage to pull off a really good death-cough when need be. I know this isn't a long-term fix, but keep it in your back pocket for emergencies   I was hurrying to uni one day and one tried to hook me by saying "Do you want to save the animals?"  I loudly and rudely said "No!"  As I passed, he quietly said behind me "...you *don't* want to save the animals?"  It was probably his go-to line when people answer him like that, but dammit, I laughed.   I know I have this pattern buried somewhere in my computer...but are you able to link it? I love these!   Dogs are the best. So trusting and loving. All they want is cuddles and ear scratches and in return they give you unending love. No human in the world is like that   Lucky everything was in black and white back then. I mean, in colour they might  not have been able to pull this off   I dunno. Put a dog in a sweatshirt and he looks tough and awesome...but put a cat in a.tutu and suddenly *that's* weird. It's not to my taste but I don't think it is creepy   What?    Selfish reasons of course. I want the experience of having and carrying a child.    You are probably right, but either way, I see no point in shattering the illusion now   Smmmmmokin!   r/reallifedoodles needs to get involved   Honey badger don't give a *fuck*   Right now?   He brings up the bracelet every now and then, asking if I still have it.  Of *course* I have it Dad   He was very against me taking it to school in fear it would break.   ...I ended up breaking it at school.  At first I didn"t tell him because I was worried about my own hide   All of this.   You summed up my feelings exactly   What a silly assumption to make   He was serving in Afghanistan at the time and we had a holiday in Italy organised during his leave. He bought the ring over the internet (through a reputable site) and had it mailed to his mum. His mum opened the package when it arrived to check that it was all good. She then repackaged it, popped on a different name and sent it to me.   He told me to expect a package and it was for a friend serving with him. It was somehing he needed over there and he couldn't get it sent over any other way. This was a pretty normal thing as a lot of his army friends lived on Base and hated getig things sent there, so they used our address.   Anyway, I was going to pop the package in my luggage, but he very non-chalantly suggested I put it in my carry on, just in case.   When I got to Rome, after our reunion, I gave him the package and he casually tucked it into his bag. Throughout the rest of the trip he kept putting the package in plain sight, making it seem unopened...but he had taken the ring out and hidden it.   We went on a cruise and he was coy about me using the safe, always making me guess the combinations...which I never could.   And, as we went from port to port he always asked me if I was having fun that day, trying to pick the perfect day. Malta was definitely one of the best days and it was made better after he popped the question in a beautiful garden overlooking the bay near Valletta.   And the rest, they say, is history.  Edit: He didn't count on me checking his mail for him. I saw the credit card statement a week before I left   He does care. He thinks he hoodwinked me into carrying my own engagement ring halfway across the world to meet him in Rome.  He came up with an elaborate plan to make sure I was oblivious.  It didn't work   Awesome, thanks :)   I couldn't imagine ever feeling truly content with life if I knew I had given.up everything to have kids. I mean, I know you have to sacrifice a fair few things but I would need to keep a few aspects of myself or I will just end up resenting the kid, I think   Thanks :) It works on so many levels   My dad bought my sister and I matching bracelets on a holiday once so we would always remember the fun time we had.   I broke mine a couple weeks later and it took me years to find a replacement. I never told him and I just pass the replacement off as the original.  I think he would be heartbroken if he ever found out I broke it   My husband thinks I never knew about the engagement ring before he proposed. He thinks he pulled off the greatest trick in history by me not knowing about it.  I knew.   Just as long as it is arbitrary hate just because they are kids and not because of my bad parenting, then that is OK. They will be my kids...strangers don't need to like them, just be able to tolerate them   I do agree that adoption should always be an option in someone's mind if they chose to have kids. If I can't have any of my own (I want the experience of bringing a child into the world, sue me) I will most certainly adopt if I can. I am also keen to foster   My husband went fishing on Friday/Saturday so I got some McDonalds and some ice cream, sat on the couch watching TV and playing Pokemon on my DS. On Saturday I went to a market and ate brunch with a friend, then went and got a massage and bought a pot so I could transplant all the gorgeous daffodils blooming in my yard into it. Sunday, my husband and I sat in our PJs all day playing Pokemon together, got KFC for lunch and hen walked the dogs.   Life without kids maybe be "selfish" but fuck it...it's fun!   I have always believed that it takes a person to raise a child...not a parent. Don't let "parent" be all that you are. Be a good person first, and use that to be a good parent   Ugh, I am highly (silently) judgemental of peoples' parenting. I hate it when parents just don't *try*   I can only hope that when I do have kids (if I am able) I will use my hatred of other peoples' children to sculpt mine to be somewhat bearable little people.   I tried watching the Rugrats in Paris movie the other day and couldn't make it more than halfway. It was awful! I *loved* that movie as a kid   Ahhhh! I can't take them but can I just come over and rub my face on them a little? They are too cute!   Yes. But that is OK! Keeping riding that wave!   Nope, all dead   He really didn't seem "pompous" to me. It was just a description of himself to add context to the ridiculousness of him yelling at a chess game   Yes! Sometimes when I reach that point I just stomp on it and tell it is can just *live* on the goddamn floor if it loves it so much, then leave.  But jokes on me, because usually my dog will then come along and rip up the paper, making a mess which I then have to clean up later...   Temper tantrums at home are a great way to relieve stress. As long as it isn't at your family of course.   I swear at inanimate objects...like, a lot.   "Get in the fucking bin you cunt of a piece of paper or I will murder every little shit that you love!"  It really helps   I just realised something. No wonder teenagers are so apathetic about everything. They are making that transition from pure joy to hatred   In probably just 1 or 2years time they will look back on the best day of their lives and think "what the fuck were we thinking?!"   People keep trying to convince me to call my son Luke.   My last name is Walker.  But that isn't the worst I could do. I really like the name Annika. Annika Walker. Middle name, Skye   My sister sorta made up her eldest daughter's name. She was going to call her Amity...but I didn't like the way she pronounced it so she suggested Emity and that stuck. It gets shortened to Emmy now but I still really like it   I don't know what your plan is for it but I found a great use for flowers with big crntre holes like this. I made a beanie for a friend's daughter and made a bunch of different coloured flowers just like this. I attached a button to the beanie so she could switch out the flower depending on the rest of the outfit. She loved it   Awesome! They all sound great. I am so keen for chicken and waffles!   It's almost as if there are other people from other countries who just might have different experiences than that guy...woah   Zzzzzzzz....ploop....zzzzzzz   I used to study in the cemetary at the end of my street. It was peaceful, nice and cool on a hot day and no one disturbed me.  I loved it.  	137
 The backpack? Tighten the shoulder straps up real nice.    Gotta go with the other guy on this. There's nothing innovative about Tipper's music.    I always thought it was diplo because he wants girls to dip low haha   How are the offset abec 11 flashbacks? Looking at the 81a amber in 70mm for the maestro I'm getting   E: for trucks I'm getting paris v2 50 180mm   My finance prof was also an investment banker. She retired at 40 to become a part time professor.... still has enough money at 65 to go to Europe every year.    Isn't Canada in like, North America?   So I'm following Diplo on snapchat and on his story he played a version of lean on that sounded just plain dirty. It was amazing. The first time I heard it on his snap was a few weeks ago when he posted a video of his son dancing to it, and the second time was later that day at what appeared to be a show. The thing that stood out to me most was the bit that starts at 00:49 in the original version but it was louder, faster, and had more bass in this mix.  I've listened to all the remixes on soundcloud and none of them sound right, pls help!!!!!!!   How do you like them? Worth the price?   Set up an E*Trade account or an account with another discount broker. Do some research and see what suits your needs. Pay attention to their fees. Make sure you understand how much their transaction fees are and whether they charge you for both buying and selling or just one or the other. When you set up the account and they ask you how you want your money to be stored when it's not invested in a stock you want to go with a sweep account so that it incurs interest even when you're not investing.   If you want to invest in a mutual fund that's fine it's a relatively low risk way to do things but mutual funds are usually diversified to the point that they don't offer high returns so definitely make sure you look into the fund's historic returns.   Another way to invest is to put your money into a Roth IRA which is a form of retirement account. The money is taxed when you put it into the account so there's no penalty if you liquidate the account before retirement. The returns are going to be higher than what a standard savings account will give you but they're not going to be crazy. I think the current return on a Roth IRA is like 8% so if you put in 4-5k and let it sit for a year you're going to earn somewhere between 300-400. So nothing crazy but for not having to do any work other than deposit some money it's not bad. A Roth IRA is the safest type of short term investment I can think of so if you don't want to risk losing money this is the way to go.   I was at 240-250 when I got my first board. I got a tugboat which held my weight fine but it's not really a true longboard and it might be too short for your height. The main thing at weights above ~200 is you want to look for a board that's not designed to have flex because those are designed to have flex for someone that weighs 130-160.   Daddies Boardshop has a section of boards designed for heavier riders:  http://www.daddiesboardshop.com/longboards/230lbs-and-up  Also look into the Bustin Ibach and the Maestro Mini.  That Modela should hold you fine. The main thing is to just stay away from super flexy cruisers and penny boards.  Also good job getting in shape brah! I was where you are not too long ago.   You got a link to a news article or some search terms I can use to find one?   after that event that road is 90% pavement 7% thane 3% skin   Let me know how it is    It's on spotify now   What the fuck happened here? This kid had his youth taken from him because someone decided that it was okay to violate the speedy trial clause of the sixth amendment. Whether it was done with intent or it was an error in the system someone needs to answer for this.   The absolute maximum amount of time that a trial can be delayed in NY is six months unless the defendant has been accused of murder. The only conceivable way this was legal was if Kalief Browder agreed to delay the trial, in which case his lawer needs to be disbarred for incompetence. Jesus fucking christ.   It may just be me but so far college has been a slice compared to high school. Yeah the work is harder and there's more pressure to perform, but you're not surrounded by all of the immature douchebaggery of HS and you don't have to deal with helicopter parents as much.      YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  E: Louder,  Harder, Better is great   Landyachtz dinghy is really good, as is the tugboat which is just a slightly wider version with a slightly longer kick.   Normally I wouldn't advocate for a Santa Cruz board because they're usually not that great but I actually think that the SC Landshark is a really good mini cruiser. I have one that I use to get around at my college and a lot of my friends use them. We like them because for a ~27-28" board they have a pretty long wheel base and the kick is functional for pivot turns, though you're probably not going to be able to ollie with it. Amazing if you need a compact and lightweight commuter, not so great if you want to do anything else.  Arbor also makes a few cruisers. They just dropped a new one called the Rally which is 30" long and comes with reverse king pin trucks which tend to be pretty carvy. The other two are the pilsner (31") and the pocket rocket which is really short, I want to say it's like 25 or 26 inches.   I was confused too so I googled it. Apparently it sounds kind of like win    I think socal should get one of these. Certain parts of Oregon might also work. I'm sure longboard parks are much cheaper to build and maintain than skate parks.   You really think a junior in college is still carrying a crush from 10th grade? Idk man people change a lot in college   Y'all just ditch him after he took that spill into the curb? I saw one guy kinda turning around but it looked like the rest of you just kept going.   How are Bustin Swift wheels? Think a set of 70mm 82a swifts would be good on a Maestro? I'm getting a maestro to commute on campus but eventually I might want to try sliding. So far I've got about 4 or 5 months of experience on a mini cruiser. Bustin is saying I should put 78a bustin premiers on it. I've narrowed it down to those and Sector 9 78a topshelf 9 balls, Sector 9 butterballs, and 80a 69mm arbor vice wheels.   I got some solid advice on wheels and bearings in yesterdays thread so I thought I should present you guys with my new wheel list   I assume NYC is #1 what's #2?   This album is so good so far!  [Also here's the soundcloud for one of the guys that makes up Galantis. He has some pretty fire stuff too.](https://soundcloud.com/styleofeye)      Galantis 3   Also like 99.99999% of fighter pilots come out of the AF academy    Really the deciding factor between the two is your shoe size. I'm US 10.5 and the Tugboat is perfect to slightly too wide for me, but I like having a bit of heel and toe overhang on small cruisers.   "Shoplifter." he fired on police as he was escaping he's no longer just a shoplifter.   Ah yeah that makes sense   The last set of beastos I had didn't last that long. Rode them for about 2 months before they started slowing down on me and I had to replace them with some reds I had laying around. Maybe it was just a fluke but that's why I was leaning towards zealous    Maybe learning to slide eventually but riggr now I just plan on using it to get around.   They need new merch. I wanted a galantis shirt but all they have are four shirts in weird cuts with the seafox which is a cool mascot but not something I want on a shirt tbh   If you go on their website www.wearegalantis.com/pharmacy you can listen to one song a day but it cuts you off 2/3s of the way through    What would you say the max rider weight for the Maestro is? I've been fluxuating around 180-190 recently and I'm worried that it may have a bit too much flex. Also for wheels  I was originally thinking  Kegels but 80mm might be too big, so 70mm 78a bustin premiers, 75mm 80a orangatang durians, 69mm 80a orangatang cages, or 70mm 86a orangatang stimulus?   I want to order everything off bustin's site for simplicity's sake and because it's slightly cheaper than muirskate but I guess I'm not opposed to getting the deck and trucks from bustin and the wheels and bearings (zealous rather than bustin abec7s) from muirskate if you guys have a better idea for wheels.  This'll be my third board but first true longboard.   Even if it is paid advertising we get to hear a fire unreleased song and good edm is what this sub is all about. Much love brah    Coachella and an unreleased song? You lucky sonofabitch   Shit now I need to find a girl to fall in front of    What shoes are you guys wearing? Just wore out my vans   Did that in front of a couple girls a few weeks ago...... Pride was hurting real bad.   Fred Meyer and the internet.   Bustin Maestro!    Maybe it's a numbers thing. Try it enough times and it's bound to pay off occasionally.   Manning was kind of a weird case tbh. He didn't really have a purpose behind the leaks like Snowden did. He kind of just grabbed a random assortment of classified documents  that covered a pretty wide variety of topics and said fuck it lets leak this shit. None of the manning documents really had anything to do with American civil liberties.    The back channels are definitely cool to explore but I've never seen any crawdads   Watch the video a few more times. And pay attention to the moments right before the shooting. The kid stares at the officer for a good three seconds then says "nah fool" and lifts up his shirt and has his hand near his belt buckle in a manner that resembles that of a pistol being removed from a waistband, Yeah, the cop was too quick to draw but in this case it's not as simple as the cop executing an innocent kid for no reason. The kid has previously had suicidal tendencies, it's a very real possibility that he knew what he was doing.   A car doesn't provide cover. Any round larger than a .22 can cut through every part of a car but the engine block like butter.    Are they not in a higher position in the company than people in their first year or two?   Yes they are but our original discussion wasn't about new bankers it was about the IB career as a whole and whether the avg GS investment banker eventually breaks seven figures. This is my final comment because this has been going in circles for quite a while now.   Sounds like the kid had previously experienced clinical depression. It's a very real possibility that he knew what he was doing and committed suicide by cop.   Same parking lot is definitely the way to go. The one I learned in was like 200 yards long and almost always empty. Had a subtle gradient too so I just had to push once and off I went learning to carve.   Bustin Maestro is kind of a do everything board as long as you're not planning on bombing any super gnarly hills. A complete is $200 from their website.   But laws like that don't prohibit people under a certain age from using it for medicinal purposes. Iirc in all the legal states kids w a script can still get weed.    Like nuts and screws or bearings and bushings? They probably carry nuts and screws in the size you need. But I'm not sure about bushings or bearings you should probably just go to a skate shop for those.   Edit: Just checked the guide and saw that you're talking about nuts and washers and screws. If you're looking for speed rings for your wheels I doubt they'll have those, but they should definitely have the other stuff. Just make sure to either figure out what diameter and length screws you need ahead of time or bring your setup so you can ask them for help.   To be fair according to his wiki he studied econ in college but ya this is a joke   Down a dry waterslide?   What LEDs did you get? The only lights I could find that didn't need to be plugged in had a big bulky battery pack attached.   You can buy light up wheels and my guess is that for the blue he glued a couple LED strips to the underside of the board.   Sector 9 also has light ups but idk if you can buy them seperately or if they only come on the mini 80s boards   No they turn on as soon as enough friction is being generated by your wheels spinning   almost took a stop sign to the dome haha gotta wear those helmets   Yeah idk it's confusing me too haha     Your first statement made me think that you didn't fully know what a partner is. Maybe you can see why in the context of the conversation I thought that. Maybe I read your comment wrong.   You:   I never said that the higher ups, like partners, arent paid that much...  Me:   The partners they're talking about are not equity partners, but rather salaried partners which are essentially just senior staff members.  You:  Why do you keep assuming I dont know this shit? ... you think I don't what a salaried partner is  But whatever bro I'm done because this conversation is leading nowhere and you're being a bit of a jerk. I'm sorry I came across as condescending but education is a part of any argument.   Teebooooowwwwwwww      I'm not being condescending unless disagreement is now considered condescending but whatever fuck it I'm done.   Your comment about how I'm just embarrassing myself (by stating the truth?) was unquestionably condescending though.   I believe the only scenario where breach of an NDA can lead to jail time is in the case of corporate espionage.   The infinite scrolling is just annoying though. I like having pages I can quickly jump to.   Off topic but what does the * denote? I've seen it before when people talk about trans issues.   Well now you're just being an asshole but I see where the misunderstanding is coming from. It sounds like you don't fully understand the terminology of corporate America. Partner =/= to owner or executive. The partners they're talking about are not equity partners, but rather salaried partners which are essentially just senior staff members. When it comes to law firms and investing firms all roads lead to partner and if you don't get there you fucked up somewhere along the line. If we're still discussing the original topic, which was whether the average GS investment banker eventually breaks seven figs, then the link is correct. From your comment I gather that what you believe is that making partner is to finance as getting a managerial or rare promotion is to other fields. In investing it's essentially a title given to employees that have made it past the probationary (analyst) and junior (associate) phases of employment. Think of it not as a title for a department head with the same powers as the owner or equity partners, but as a title for a project leader that answers to the equity partners. They head up a team of analysts and associates to facilitate IPOs, mergers, etc.   No such thing as a stupid question around here. Yeah a hit is one inhalation of whatever you're smoking out of, so one draw on a joint, one bing rip, one pipe pull, etc   I think the bigger problem is that it's an awful fire hazard    Dude wtf does it take to appease you? That very article I just linked shows the earnings range for investment bankers, 500k-20m. Analysts and associates are not IBs that's why they're not making bookoo bucks.    The bonus is just something they get. It's not guarunteed, but there's an expectation that they'll get it. The commission (.1-7% depending on project) is written into their contract. They're seperate things. Think of the bonus a sort of pat on the back for getting through the year without burning out and the commission as an earned augmentation of their salary that's guarunteed if they complete a deal.  http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/salary/investment-banking-compensation  An analyst is hired fresh out of undergrad, an associate is someone that is either promoted from an analyst position or hired from an MBA program. They have more power but they're still doing grunt work. After a bit associates are either promoted to managing director (investment banker), to vp of a dept, or they decide investment banking hours are retardedly long and they make the transition to brokerage or hedge management. The pay range for all those positions including bonuses and commission is in that link. Bare in mind that GS is one of the most lucrative firms in the world so their employees' earnings will be on the high end of those.   But again that's before commission. Obviously wall st as a whole does not average seven figure earnings but within the  premise of this thread we'retalking about investment bankers because the dead guy was an IB analyst. Investment bankers are the rockstars of wall st. A single IB can bring in more money each year than a high traffic brick and mortar branch of the bank. Investment bankers at top firms do usually take home seven figures *after commission* because they are the bank's top earners. When looking at how much people in finance make you have to look at the commission because that's usually the main source of income for bankers and brokers.  The base salary is just a contingency for if the market crashes.  But now picture the investment banker: he sells companies for millions, hundreds of millions, or even billions of dollars.  Deals worth less than $1 billion might come with a 1% commission, while deals worth more than that will scale down to around 0.1%.  But even 0.1% of $50 billion is $50 million.  So thats part 1 of why investment bankers make so much money: high-priced items with high commissions.  http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-bankers-make-money/   http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/03/13/how-much-do-wall-streeters-really-earn/  A firm is going to know if a VP shares their salary with a site like glass door which would be a direct violation of their NDA and get them fired or transferred. They wouldn't risk that. That's why it's inaccurate.   Because they're wrong and slightly deceptive. You can't honestly believe that a VP of any dept at one of the largest banks in the world is pulling less than 200k can you? That's ridiculous..... Anyone in the industry will tell you that's horseshit. The analyst figure is deceptive. Base salary ranges from 65-90k a year, but the industry standard is to also give them an annual bonus that's usually 70-100% of their salary, so even if their base salary is only 65k realistically they're making no less than 110k a year. A top performing recruit from an ivy school might make 180k their first year. After you get bumped up to a full IB position you might make anywhere from 100-250k base plus the yearly bonus plus 7% commission on every project you head up.   Capitalism is good, theres nothing wrong with it. Banking is constructive to society because it helps to move the economy and facilitate international trade. The problem isn't banking, but the people that do it. When the greed is successfully kept in check the finance industry is very helpful to society.   An analyst is essentially an entry level position. After you do a few years as an analyst you get bumped up to a job that'll pay seven figs like being a full fledged investment banker, but if you spend your entire career in an analyst position you're doing something wrong.   *A small fraction of finance majors pull millions. If you actually get a job at a top tier firm like GS, which only a small fraction do, and you stick with it you're basically guaranteed 250k + commission and bonuses by 25-30 and seven figures by 35.    He knew exactly what he was getting himself into when he took an analyst job at a top tier bank.   Yeah banks are starting to recruit at semi-target schools more often especially for their west coast offices because Stanford and berkeley grads keep dipping out after a year or two to work in Silicon Valley   Adderall and modafinil tend to be more effective in a work environment.   Industry standard on wall st for a first year IB analyst is a salary of 60-80k a year  with a bonus that's usually no less than 60% of their annual salary.  To get a job as a GS analyst he probably did an internship their at some point and interacted woth analysts. As much as I want to feel sorry for him this guy knew exactly what he was getting himself into. Anybody that can get a job at a top tier IB firm does    Because cops make a habit of killing people for their shoes? How about I give you a reality check. There are upwards of 14,000 civilian-on-civilian murders every year in this country. In Chicago 80% of murders are gang related. I have to imagine the stat is similar in some parts of LA. By comparison there are usually about 400 police shootings on average each year. Your line of thinking is the result of a profit driven agenda because the news has realized that cop shootings get people riled up. Couple that with the extreme bias and echo chamber effect of reddit and you've got a bunch of people acting on emotions rather than logic. If murders made the news at the samerate that police shootings do and you reacted the same way you'd think the US is a war zone.   I'm looking for a nice carvy drop thru set up to use as a commuter and for carving some mellow hills. So far I'm thinking Paris 180mm V2 50 for trucks, not sure on the wheels 78a or 80a, and then for the deck I've looked at the Arbor Mindset, Bustin Maestro and Maestro mini, and the Landyachtz Battle Axe 35. I found that I tend to prefer boards with a width of less than 9.5ish inches so that's why I'm looking at those. Since it's a commuter I def want to keep it under 40" but I've never owned a board longer than 30" so I want a true longboard this time. Any help with the setup would be great.   Damn bruh don't they have like 2000 calories? Haha   California?   The manslaughter trial would be but the family suing for damages, loss of income, emotional distress etc is civil.   Oh yeah OP is golden I was responding to the scenario where you gave someone alcohol and then they drove and killed someone and the vic's family was suing    In that scenario I believe it would be a transferrence of civil liability because we're talking about law suits. Civil law has a bunch of different rules including a different burden of proof requirement.   If it's just you it'll be a bit of a waste to use a blunt because you wont smoke all of it. Literally only one or two small bong or joint hits will be enough to get high. I would avoid the blunt/spliff too unless you have a good tobacco tolerance or it might make you extra dizzy.   And blocks the hippie grenades a bit   If you don't have a pipe screen then take a small piece of nug and press it into the bottom of the bowl, then put ground or torn weed on top. If it has a carb hole put a finger over the hole. Take your lighter and hover the flame over the bowl and then take a nice long hit. Hitting it should suck the flame into the bowl. When you're ready to inhale take your finger off the carb hole and suck.   I was watching a video of a NK tour and apparently they have a weird McDonald's type chain in Pyongyang. Idk if it's only open to tourists or what but ya   Ah I gather you're the business owner. I was originally gonna ask how you talked your boss into this but it all makes sense now.   http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_14_justifiable_homicide_by_weapon_law_enforcement_2009-2013.xls   No worries. So each figure listed on [this infograph](https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates) has a small number at the end. The number corresponds to the study they're citing to get their data. Tge studies are listed by number at the bottom of the page.   There are 400 police shootings a year on average. The FBI keeps track of these things so fear mongering people like you dont make up fake statistics to back your claims. Smh....   Yes it's strange that the people we send out with guns to defend the general public from criminals kill more people than the general public most of whom, statistically speaking, will never witness a shooting in their life.......  Edit: also that stat is wrong by a gross overestimation there are 400 police involved shootings a year on average.   No it doesn't. The article was debunking  [this infographic](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/files/2014/12/rapist_visualization_03.jpg w=480) that had been circulating Facebook and then shares the correct statistics, the ones I shared.   Yall are bad at making hot pockets    The large soda with so much ice that it's not even floating so it take like 2 good gulps to drink it all   Data is [compiled and placed into a graphic here](https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates). Sources of data are mentioned at the bottom and the sources include methodology if you're so included to check them all. Here's a [WashPo article that talks about the stats](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/09/the-truth-about-a-viral-graphic-on-rape-statistics/) that I mentioned.  Edit: forgot to mention that their sources are reputable. FBI and DOJ    Right but reddit seems to  believe that a false rape accusation is somehow more life ruining than any other felony. And a shocking number of people on this website express that they fully expect either themself or someone they know to be falsely accused and convicted of rape at some point. The reality is that out of every 100 rapes 32 are reported and of those only 2 lead to a conviction. It is one of the most underreported felonies in the US and it has one of the lowest conviction rates of any major crime.   The reality is that maybe 7% of rapes make it to trial and only 2% of rapists are convicted. The likelihood of a false rape accusation getting far enough to make the news is so low that it's almost funny how big of an issue reddit seems to think false rape accusations are. Most real accusations don't get that far.   Never experienced that or heard of anyone tipping gas station attendants in my 20 years in Oregon.   What? Trading on margin is the riskiest way to do it for all parties. Nobody that's established enough to have made a name for themselves in investing is trading on margin.   Witnesses are corroborating his story. For all intents and purposes this officer is a grade A douche but he's currently being backed up by multiple witnesses so it seems clean.   Marines get hundreds more hours of training and work in units of 4+ ?    I've still got love for Aoki. He went to my school, UCSB, and lived in a sort of multicultural hippie commune thing while he was there. UCSB is a big party school with a decent EDM scene and word is that he initially started making a name for himself by DJing parties out here. UCSB is a pretty good school too so that's why he sounds so... literate in his article about himself. I also heard that even though his dad owns the benihana fortune they cut him off when he became an adult with the exception of paying for college.   So there are some departments that do a shit job.  Tbh I wouldn't even say that. My guess is that most police shootings occur either in areas that border mexico/southern florida or large cities like Oakland, LA, NYC, Detroit, etc  which for certain socioeconomic reasons have more violent organized crime.   You're making the assumption that every single person killed by a cop is innocent and therefore needs to be made up for. In reality it's more likely that less than 5% of people shot by police didn't deserve it.   I think he's asking for proof from the guy claiming that he has a police brutality issue in his white suburb.   I didn't dv you but I'll bite. I think neon future has two distinct styles, two upbeat mood songs (I Love it When You Cry and Home We'll Go) and an outlier (Youth Dem Turn Up, not a big fan tbh). The first style is hoise but has some sort of trancy elements and includes Heaven On Earth and Light Years. The second style is closer to what you'd expect from Aoki, deep repetitive bass hits, fast, the type of shit you rage to, Hysteria and Lightning Strikes. Then there's Darker Than Blood which is another one of his linkin park collabs and I've never really known what to make of those.   I usually prefer lyft as a rider because I've found that the drivers tend to be happier but the few times I use lyft or uber usually ends up being during surge times so whichever has lower prices ends up dictating my choice. Consistent prices and setting a time ahead of time  are the only two things I like about actual taxis.   The news is not supposed to be feel goodery time. It's supposed to be news.  This line of thinking is a product of the invention of the 24 hour news cycle. The news isn't supposed to make you feel any particular way. It can make you feel good, like if a cure for cancer was discovered, or it can make you feel bad like after 9/11, but the idea that you need hard hitting stories all the time kills the importance of actual news. The fact of the matter is that what most people think are hard hitting stories wouldn't even make the second page if news was actually filtered rather than posted one story after another in rapid succession only to be forgotten by the public domain in a matter of hours.   Everything you just wrote from the first word reeks of brainwashing by a news cycle with an agenda. Do cops need to be held accountable? Sure. Is there any evidence that these so called "executions" are increasing in frequency or that there's an epidemic of police killing people? Absolutely not. It's just the latest in a long line of things that gets the public's attention so that's what the media is catering to. A few years ago it was school shootings, before that it was terrorism, before that drugs.   I'm not a conspiracy theorist I don't believe that the media is evil, but it is profit driven so it has an agenda. Once you understand that and filter out overhyped stories accordingly you will understand the reality of the situation. The reality of this particular situation is that recently any police shooting from every town in the US that isn't 100% cut and dry is plastered on the front page of every major news outlet. If you were as quick to form a conclusion with everything as you are with this issue then within a week I could do the same thing and have you believing that every suburban white boy is destined to become a rapist, but you wouldn't believe that because it's not a rational line of thought. But for whatever reason a good chunk of the American public has decided to forego their critical thinking skills when it comes to this particular issue.   /rant   Lawless was fire   Even worse is that it sounds like just a year ago maybe even more recently they thought he was cancer free so this particular bout had to have hit him pretty hard and fast. He was a good man. Would've made a good governer, maybe even a good president.   For variable A choose united states total for variable B choose violent crime rate. There ya go raw data.  http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeTrendsInOneVar.cfm    So 110/100,000 FTE is possible.  No it's not. In mathematics and statistics when people say rate they almost always mean %. When talking about losing a physical object, ie a person, you cant have a rate that's greater than 100% because ot means that youve lost more of them than physically exist. A 110% fatality rate means that for every 100k workers 110k of them die. 110 deaths per capita, yes, that's possible but that's already listed on the left column so it doesn't make sense for them to put it in the rightmost column under rates.  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-violent-crime-1970s-level-20141110-story.html  There's an article confirming the violent crime rate. We're currently at 1978 levels.      His dad saw his vinegar strokes, he saw into his soul, and at that moment he realized what type of man his son would become.   That stat on crime rate was just for violent crime so any affect the introduction of any new drug laws had on that crime rate is indirect at best. The data you linked is compiled weirdly. They've got a profession with a 110 fatality rate which is simply not possible. My hunch is that the software they used didn't account for the # of workers column standing for X thousands so the raw data is actually the least accurate way of looking at it. The graph in the article I linked was based off of the BLS data you linked but they normalized the fatality rates.    You're arguing what ifs. The statistics say that being a LEO is one of the least lethal careers a person can choose. Hell an officer worker has a higher fatality rate/hour worked than a LEO does.  Utter, utter, utter, bullshit. This statement is categorically false no matter which way you look at it. [Law enforcement is the 15th most dangerous career in the US based on deaths per 100k workers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/). The only reason law enforcement isn't in the top 5 is because LE agencies take precautions to protect their officers like having them work in pairs, giving them EMS training and combat training, and giving them protective clothing. You'll notice that almost every single profession that's more dangerous than law enforcement (notice that no office work is included on that list) is in a field where time is money so managers are more likely to try to skirt safety requirements so that they can increase their profits. LEOs are also unionized so they have someone that advocates for more safety precautions.    Society is not violent. In fact society is becoming less violent each day that passes. The only area where violence is increasing is violence committed by LEOs.  Again this is bullshit. In the United States there is:  * A murder every 35.6 minutes  * A forcible rape every 6.2 minutes  * A robbery every 1.4 minutes  * An aggravated assault every 40.5 seconds  * A burglery every 14.6 seconds  The crime rate may be going down but that just means we are in a transitional period. Today's world is very much a violent one. Gangs in LA, Baltimore, NYC, and Detroit initiate middle and [high schoolers](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-12/news/bal-md.ci.arrest12mar12_1_gang-initiation-gang-member-bloods) by having them kill someone, a stranger, a cop, [a friend, these people don't give a fuck. They are animals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_PtJwNu3Q) Don't pretend that we live in a safe world. Don't try to downplay the danger involved in police work because statistically it is more dangerous than firefighting. And don't kid yourself about the crime rate going down. Yes, it's low compared to recent years but that's because the crime rate shot up during the crack epidemic. The current crime rate is still higher than it was in 1970.   Honestly I don't plan to vote for Hillary based on her politics and character alone, but I'm pretty sure old Bill is what's going to end up keeping her out of the White House.   Cat.   Would you mind explaining why it's moronic? We live in a violent world. It's foolish to think that cops should never have to kill someone.   Your people also haven't had a line of duty death since 2013 whereas we had upwards of 50 last year alone.   According to [this](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty) there hasn't been a line of duty death in Britain since 2013 so they're considerably lower.   Other G-7 countries don't have 88 legally owned firearms per 100 people. The US is a unique case. It can't be compared to other countries. The only other country with a similar rate of gun ownership is Switzerland but there's a fundamental difference in gun culture that makes them impossible to compare.   Well according to ODMP.org, in 2014, if we exclude K9s, there were 47 line of duty deaths by gunfire, 10 by vehicular assault, and 2 by assault. And according to OPs article so far there have been more than usual this year, but usually about 400 people are killed by officers each year. Obviously this is by no means a perfect way of measuring this but the ratio of cops killed to criminals killed by cops in 2014 is 59:~400 so 1:6.78. When you consider that cops are trained and criminals usally have no formal weapons or combat training it seems like 6.7 criminals killed for every 1 cop killed is a reasonable statistic. Especially considering the FBI estimates that there were 14,196 murders in 2013.   It's not always possible to restrain them. In fact I would say that in the case of most police shootings it was not possible to restrain them. Your use of the word execute sort of implies that you believe that when a cop kills someone they are choosing to be judge jury and executioner, and not simply defending themselves. You are wrong.  * [Example #1](http://i.imgur.com/o8Dmo6K.gifv) Warning NSFW, very disturbing shows an officer being killed.  * [Example #2](http://i.imgur.com/y2OaBox.gifv)   * [Example #3](http://i.imgur.com/cYtUMHk.gifv)   But why do you think that is? Perhaps it's because police departments take precautions to protect their officers, all are given guns, generally work in pairs, backup is usually nearby, bullet proof vests, etc and police are unionized so they have people advocating for them.  [Here's the list of the most danferous jobs in the US](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/28/charted-the-20-deadliest-jobs-in-america/). Police officers still make the top 20 ahead of fire fighters soeven with all those precautions their job is dangerous. The jobs ahead of them are things like fishing, electrical work, logging, and construction. If you've ever met anyone in those professions they'll tell you that things are made dangerous by bosses that want to keep costs down by skirting safety precautions.   Also I think just measuring by deaths per 100k is a poor metric because who's more likely to be stuck with a used needle and contract a disease? Or hit by a car and paralyzed? Or get PTSD, or depression, or alcoholism, or any of the other mental illnesses that have a higher prevalence among cops than the gen population?       Cat.   Cat.   Cat.   Cat.   Cat.   Cat.

I now know he ordered a hitman to try and kill people. Even so if you look about the net you will see similar cases of people who didn't get life for the same crime.  I mean not really, maybe very rarely. Under federal sentencing guidelines murder in the first degree carries a minimum sentence of life in prison. Six counts of attempted first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder most certainly makes him worthy of life. If he had succesfully carried out a hit there would be no debate, but somehow because the hits were fake reddit believes that he should be free and clear.    DPR was the one to bring up the idea of using a hitman. He was talking to the guy about someone that owes them money and then DPR essentially said "he's a liability idgaf if he gets executed." Then while negotiating the price of that hit DPR mentions that he paid 80k for a previous hit. At one point the hitman asked if there was another solution because murder draws a lot of attention and DPR maintained that a hit is the only solution. He's a stone cold killer and deserves no sympathy.  	165
    How precisely do you splinter a vote before a primary?   It was obvious he was kidding.   No, he doesn't change his mind. He changes the words coming out of his mouth. Hes a politician.

Ask anyone who claims he can win what his wife's name is, where was he born, what is his position on drone strikes against American citizens, how much is he worth, what is his stance on Israeli apartheid practices towards Palestinians, who does he think would make a good secretary of defense, what's his position towards affirmative action, what will he do to loosen big banks grip on commodities... You get crickets. Just like Pauls supporters. They couldn't tell you anything about him except he'd audit the fed which most couldn't tell you what that even means and he likes legalization of drugs. Don't hate me for passing this message, it's just the way things appear right now to me.   Exactly this. I'm not buying any guarantees in this election. We are one justice away from a major conservative majority. I'm not comfortable enough to say who I may vote for, let alone who could certainly win. Name recognition in reddit cj's aside, where is the data to support these claims?   Riches buy the companies that build the machines that count the votes.

They are going to listen to us or they're going to collapse faster than they can say "oops".    If it can be demonstrated to have likely prevented any shooting this year, I'll consider your moderate approach. Otherwise all cute freshman year 101 Pavlov name bombs aside, no amount of regulation is going to address the real crisis, an emerging human condition that relies on libido and base desire and anger and violence when reacting to the world, instead of genuine concern for others. Infringing on a right our Supreme court supports as a constitutional one is not only the wrong approach to fix the issues, it's the issue that specifically led to Maryland failing to elect a shoe-in Democrat governor, Colorado to demonstrate effective recalls against Democratic reps.

This is the thing, if you live in a fair-sized city you'll have some choice, and you can usually find one store differentiating themselves from another in just this way. Or, you can always try a Chapters which seems to have a fairly big comic/graphic novel section these days (at least in my city) and has a bunch of kids' stuff. The linked story was just some guy establishing his feminist bona fides. "I get it! I really get it!" Yeah, because patriarchy. Not market forces or anything like that. Hey, I'm going to go to Gamestop. I bet they have a bunch of games that are just about killing and stuff! Won't someone think of the children!!!   Exactly. The comments section in the linked article lists half a dozen comics for little girls, but to expect every comic book store to carry them is absurd. They have limited shelf space and thousands of titles, they choose the ones that will sell to their customers. No conspiracy against girls required.    So...you learned that the majority of comic books aren't for little children and that the large corporations that create them cater to their target demographic in order to maximize their profits? Oh, no, you learned about the patriarchy.    Here's a town called [Swastika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika,_Ontario) in Canada.   konichiwa, sayonara!

Obviously if you just got the job, you're not going to quit right away, but I very strongly suggest you start looking for another job immediately. The thing about this kind of environment is that it's an emotional minefield and if and when you slip up (and sometimes, it's got nothing to do with you), it can blow up in your face very quickly and very badly. Start looking for another job pronto.  EDIT: Another point that probably should be added: Find out who the Queen Bee is and start kissing her ass. You won't beat her in this kind of environment, so CYA.    [The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by Emmanuel Goldstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Oligarchical_Collectivism)   "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another."   "the only thing in the way of the long-awaited fight occurring is Mayweather's approval"  So...absolutely nothing has changed?    D'oh!  Uh, maybe he dies and then gets resurrected?!?    It's on!

"For Three Men The Civil War Wasn't Hell. It Was Practice!"    Sigh.  In the last four years, blacks have held community protests against violence in Chicago; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Saginaw, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. Indeed, theres a whole catalog of movies, albums, and sermons from a generation of directors, musicians, and religious leaders, each urging peace and order. **You may not have noticed black protests against crime and violence, but that doesnt mean they havent happened.** Black Americanslike everyone elseare concerned with what happens in their communities, and at a certain point, pundits who insist otherwise are either lying or willfully ignorant.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/black_community_is_concerned_with_black_on_black_crime_suggesting_otherwise.html   Here's one from 2011:  http://www.teamstersjc25.com/news/2011/080411_JC25_MarchAgainstViolence.html  Here's one from 2013:  http://progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2013/09/26/community-elected-officials-march-against-gun-violence-northwest-side-  Google is your friend.    It's a debate my friends and I love to have because there is no answer.  One day it's one, the next day it's the other.  SPOILERS:  One of the big differences between the two is that GBU is a comedy, whereas OUATITW is a tragedy. In GBU, they kill the bad guy and get the money, in OUATITW, even though Harmonica gets his revenge, he will still carry around the tragedy of his brother's death, he doesn't stay with Jill, his friend dies and he doesn't get any money. There is some peace to be had in the revenge, but it's still a bummer of an ending. I think for that reason, GBU is more enjoyable, but I'd have a hard time claiming OUATITW isn't a better film. Just the shootout with Frank at the end with that music and, quite possibly, the greatest reveal in cinematic history.   It's not a racial issue, it's a drug issue. Legalize drugs, remove the profit motive from the trade and the violence would disappear.    Right here:  http://wgntv.com/2014/06/05/students-march-against-gang-violence/       "I can only give you an answer that is, I think, utopian, I think its far too optimistic, its Pollyannaish: yes. But I dont think for a moment that its going to happen."      I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that this has nothing to do with the movie. The hackers, whoever they are, have some very, very incriminating information on Sony execs. and those execs. will, obviously, do anything to keep that information private.    Gary Webb was right.    "For 200 years we have said to the Indian people who are fighting for their land, their life, their families and their right to be free: ''Lay down your arms, my friends, and then we will remain together. Only if you lay down your arms, my friends, can we then talk of peace and come to an agreement which will be good for you.''  When they laid down their arms, we murdered them. We lied to them. We cheated them out of their lands. We starved them into signing fraudulent agreements that we called treaties which we never kept. We turned them into beggars on a continent that gave life for as long as life can remember. And by any interpretation of history, however twisted, we did not do right. We were not lawful nor were we just in what we did. For them, we do not have to restore these people, we do not have to live up to some agreements, because it is given to us by virtue of our power to attack the rights of others, to take their property, to take their lives when they are trying to defend their land and liberty, and to make their virtues a crime and our own vices virtues.  But there is one thing which is beyond the reach of this perversity and that is the tremendous verdict of history. And history will surely judge us. But do we care? What kind of moral schizophrenia is it that allows us to shout at the top of our national voice for all the world to hear that we live up to our commitment when every page of history and when all the thirsty, starving, humiliating days and nights of the last 100 years in the lives of the American Indian contradict that voice?  It would seem that the respect for principle and the love of one's neighbor have become dysfunctional in this country of ours, and that all we have done, all that we have succeeded in accomplishing with our power is simply annihilating the hopes of the newborn countries in this world, as well as friends and enemies alike, that we're not humane, and that we do not live up to our agreements.  Perhaps at this moment you are saying to yourself what the hell has all this got to do with the Academy Awards? Why is this woman standing up here, ruining our evening, invading our lives with things that don't concern us, and that we don't care about? Wasting our time and money and intruding in our homes.  I think the answer to those unspoken questions is that the motion picture community has been as responsible as any for degrading the Indian and making a mockery of his character, describing his as savage, hostile and evil. It's hard enough for children to grow up in this world. When Indian children watch television, and they watch films, and when they see their race depicted as they are in films, their minds become injured in ways we can never know.  Recently there have been a few faltering steps to correct this situation, but too faltering and too few, so I, as a member in this profession, do not feel that I can as a citizen of the United States accept an award here tonight. I think awards in this country at this time are inappropriate to be received or given until the condition of the American Indian is drastically altered. If we are not our brother's keeper, at least let us not be his executioner.  I would have been here tonight to speak to you directly, but I felt that perhaps I could be of better use if I went to Wounded Knee to help forestall in whatever way I can the establishment of a peace which would be dishonorable as long as the rivers shall run and the grass shall grow.  I would hope that those who are listening would not look upon this as a rude intrusion, but as an earnest effort to focus attention on an issue that might very well determine whether or not this country has the right to say from this point forward we believe in the inalienable rights of all people to remain free and independent on lands that have supported their life beyond living memory.

What a fucking surprise.       [Who taught you to hate yourself?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRSgUTWffMQ)            I really, really, really recommend his autobiography...give the Spike Lee flick a watch if you want a tl;dr...    I don't know where you're getting any of this from, but my youtube channel has lots (and lots) of clips of him, none of which include what you're talking about:  https://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978?feature=watch    Again, he advocated self-defense. If someone tries to hang me from a tree and I fight against the person holding the rope, only a fool would accuse me of violence.    After he rejected the racism of the NOI, he expanded his view to oppose injustice of all kinds, regardless of color. Here are some quotes along those lines:  We will work with anyone, with any group, no matter what their color is, as long as they are genuinely interested in taking the type of steps necessary to bring an end to the injustices that black people in this country are afflicted by. No matter what their color is, no matter what their political, economic or social philosophy is, as long as their aims and objectives are in the direction of destroying the vulturous system that has been sucking the blood of black people in this country, theyre all right with us. But if theyre in any way that compromising, dangerous type of person, then we think that they should be dealt with.  And:  "In my opinion, the young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there's got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it's going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will joint in with anyone -- don't care what color you are -- as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth."   Considering he is largely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of black America, his autobiography was listed as one of the most important works of non-fiction in the 20th century and he wielded immense influence globally at the time of his death, your dismissal is simple-minded and betrays an ignorance of his actual life and work. I think if you were to learn more about him you would change your mind.   *This doesnt say its intelligent. But whoever heard of a sociological explosion that was done intelligently and politely? And this is what youre trying to make the black man do. Youre trying to drive him into a ghetto and make him the victim of every kind of unjust condition imaginable. Then when he explodes, you want him to explode politely. You want him to explode according to somebodys ground rules.*   Malcolm X never advocated violence. Ever. He advocated self-defense at a time when black people were being told to turn the other cheek as they were being hung from trees. He said it was criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he was the constant victim of brutal attacks, and I agree. He also said: "I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense; I call it intelligence." And I also agree.    Having studied Malcolm X for over ten years, your criticism of him as insane, violent and a racist is, simply put, completely and totally wrong. Malcolm X never advocated violence. Ever. Not once. He advocated self-defense in an era when black people were being hung from trees. While much has changed in the last 50 years, much also has not and I find his analysis prescient. Yes, there were looters and criminals among the rioters, but I find Malcolm's analysis quite a bit more interesting than your (not to be rude) typically simple-minded offhanded dismissal.   On the other hand, Malcolm X understood the root causes of the violence 50 years ago:  *In America, the black community in which we live is not owned by us. The landlord is white. The merchant is white. In fact, the entire economy of the black community in the states is controlled by someone who doesnt even live there. The property that we live in is owned by someone else. The store that we trade with is operated by someone else. And these are the people who suck the economic blood of our community. And being in a position to suck the economic blood of our community, they control the radio programs that cater to us, they control the newspapers, the advertising, that cater to us. They control our minds. They end up controlling our civic organizations. They end up controlling us economically, politically, socially, mentally, and every other kind of way. They suck our blood like vultures.*  *And when you see the Blacks react, since the people who do this arent there, they react against their property. The property is the only thing thats there and they destroy it. And you get the impression over here that because they are destroying the property where they live, that they are destroying their own property. No. They cant get to the man, so they get at what he owns.*  *This doesnt say its intelligent. But whoever heard of a sociological explosion that was done intelligently and politely? And this is what youre trying to make the black man do. Youre trying to drive him into a ghetto and make him the victim of every kind of unjust condition imaginable. Then when he explodes, you want him to explode politely. You want him to explode according to somebodys ground rules. Why, youre dealing with the wrong man, and youre dealing with him at the wrong time in the wrong way.*   Better than The Phantom Menace.   I actually want a subway from Toronto to Waterloo.

Not on the internet!    There is a very good documentary about the topic called Wings of Defeat:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZNy4l2j-Yc  The link is an interesting essay, but I think it misses a key fact about the Kamikaze. It was an unsuccessful, desperation tactic where recalcitrant Japanese generals sent young boys to their deaths because they couldn't accept the fact that they had lost the war. After the first few strikes, the Americans simply changed their tactics. Only 19% of Kamikazes actually managed to hit a ship. Having said all of that, I certainly don't question the bravery of the pilots themselves but there's a tendency to glorify them and ignore the cowardice of the generals who sent them to their certain death for no good reason.       Unfortunately, history teaches us that sometimes revolutions are necessary to overthrow a corrupt regime. Whether the Russian Revolution or the French Revolution or the American Revolution or the Spanish Revolution or what have you, after years of trying to work "within the system", eventually, after all other methods have failed, it's time to pick up a brick. The corruption has spread so far in Mexico that I don't see any alternative.    "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."      WTF is up with France?

This is the only thing I've agreed with Margaret Wente on in the last ten years...at least.            New York Times, March 15, 2010 By WYATT MASON  ...By the time The Wire reached the end of its run, commentators went from posing the coy question, Is The Wire the best show on television? to making the bold statement,  The Wire is the best show on television boldness that soon seemed spineless once seemingly everyone defaulted to calling it simply, The best show in television history. In the two years since The Wire concluded, a pitched battle of ongoing praise has upped the comparative ante. If likening Simon repeatedly to Dickens and Dreiser, Balzac and Tolstoy and Shakespeare  hasnt proved adequately exalting, Bill Moyers lately freshened things up by calling Simon our Edward Gibbon, while the literary critic Walter Benn Michaels went so far as to suggest that the beauty and difficulty of watching The Wire in English  the multifarious 21st-century English of Baltimore detectives and drug dealers  compares with that of reading Dante in 14th-century Italian. It should go without saying that Duke; the University of California, Berkeley; and, next term, Harvard, are offering courses on the series, seminars focused not merely on the sophistication of its storytelling but also on its sociological and political perspicacity...

The only reason I still think it could happen is a) Mayweather is all about his legacy and he knows that even if he retired at 50-0 or 51-0 or even 55-0, if he doesn't fight pac in the next year or two, he will always have an asterisk next to his record saying he wouldn't fight the guy EVERYONE wanted him to fight and/or b) this is just a strategy on his part to wait until Pacquiao is just past his prime.   My bad...why do I always think it's 50?    I could almost see it...but I'm assuming he wants 51 victories to beat Marciano's record.

Plus, you can get your life together and become an inspiration to so many more people. And ultimately, you can change my life back.    Just found this subreddit. Anyways, my name's Daniel, Jewish (wasn't hard to guess), not religious though. I did have Brit Milah, which generally means some Rabbi cut my dick when I was a few weeks old (just like any other Jewish child in Israel), so... yeah. Not the best kind of introduction, I guess. Anyway, I use WhatsApp so if you wanna talk send me a PM.    Just discovered this subreddit. I'm sorry for my terrible fucking English, I'm from the Middle East.   Anyways, I'm 18, been in love with my ex since 13, and never really got over her until this year. I wrote about her, saw her in every fucking song, every fucking girl who I compared to her and failed. I've so many things to tell you guys - how your mind plays tricks with you and makes everything appear more nostalgic, more beautiful. How you're in love with your ex because he promised you a mutual future, one which you obviously aren't living right now, and you think that he could give you that future.   Your mind is lying.   Trust me, and if I'd hear this a year ago I would never believe this, but you're going to get through this. You're going to get through this. You're going to get through this. You're going to get through this. You're going to get through this.  I found a new love a few months ago, and I just opened up, and slowly and gradually, I forgot my ex. Yes, after five years I realized I'm worth more than her, and that someone loves me better than she did, so why the hell should I make myself look pathetic and chase her? I found someone better, and so will you. Trust me.   Once again, sorry for my terrible English. Love you guys.   I hope I'm not too late. Came here from a google search, and I just felt something while reading your story.  I see  that you're clearly moving foward, and the fact that you made progress is really great to hear because I'm sure you understand that it ain't easy. Second of all, as someone who called people fat in high-school, I can tell you that these peopel are 99% unconfident of themselves and while it doesn't show when they bully you, when they return home they just wanna have confidence in themselves.   It's like a nicotine addiction, when you gotta gain your confidence by destroying others, and making yourself stand taller because they usually back down. I, personally, always felt lonely at home and saw all these great people who get laid and I wanted to be like them but couldn't, so instead I picked up on people to get myself confident in myself. I didn't make progress in that area only until recently (18 years old), and you, young man, you certainly did. Be proud of yourself.   Anyway, don't give up. Continue being a fucking legend and losing weight, live the life you want and fuck the bullies. Don't let their pathetic 'addiction' affect you, just look at them next time they laugh at your face and rememebr what I said here. Remember me. The man who suffers alone and usually doesn't make progress, the man who's so fucking pathetic he needs to bully someone to feel good and confident with himself.   You're awesome.    r/bioshock Pedro II looks like Zachary Hale Comstock.   r/okay   Fuck, how did I never use that? Fucking amazing.    Well, if it would be the perfect crime you'd probably give it to some maniac in your order to save your five-year-old sick daughter or to find the cure for cancer. You get my point.   No, the perfect crime would be putting a replica of the Mona Lisa in the museum, and having the original one at your living room.    Makes sense. My depression began two years ago, and it's been getting worse recently.   The reason I asked you this is because sometimes when you think about the origin of your depression, in my experience, it makes you understand that the situation today isn't as it was back then. Things ain't what they used to be. You're left with the emotions you experienced back then, but if you think about that experience, you basically challenge these thoughts. Hell, you can even replace them with new ones.  I feel it doesn't help anyone, but I encourage you to take some fifteen minutes today to run memories backwards and think about the origin of your depression. Do it in a comfortable enviorment and let me know the results.     Like it was a mistake. But for me, a fortunate mistake  I wanna see you write.    Nice. I've always done #5 unknowingly by talking about ADD, and asking if she has that.   [I gave her these 'symptoms'](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/20-things-remember-you-love-person-with-add.html), and usually they go like 'OMG THATS TOTALLY ME', then we talk about her best/worst trait and stuff like that.    I think he was joking.    true savage  how old are you OP   Happy birthday you beautiful fucking bastard.    Watch a movie. Play an instrument. Learn to play an instrument. Sing alone, or at least in the shower. Find yourself role models, not just beautiful ones - but ones who inspire you. Read. Write, at least a journal. One which will have your bad experiences and delightful ones, and you can't imagine how uplifting it will be when you're down. Learn a new language (Duolingo). Go for a walk, send me a PM, etc.   Can you explain how your depression began? What's keeping it?   First comment on Reddit, 119 karma. Neat.    Text her out, just the two of you.    As I said, everyone has the right to smoke and do whatever they want. whether or not people are aware of the risks when they smoke, that's their thing. However, you can't blame people who TELL you the risks, without actually doing the drug (that's OP's rant).   Still happens.    People speak what they know. However, you can't ignore the facts. Would you say smoking is healthy, for instance? You look at the numbers.    Each year, an estimated 443,000 people die prematurely from smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke, and another 8.6 million live with a serious illness caused by smoking.  Now, of course, everything is deeper than numbers. Sometimes numbers do lie, as there's not a single recorded death of someone who died of marijuana, but people did jump of rooftops while they were high.   Don't think I'm an old conservative about drugs. I'm seventeen, and while I'm still inexperienced in the area I think ignoring so many numbers and studies, and basing your opinion on a drug STRICTLY on your experience from it - well, it's kinda ignorant.   Sorry if did sound like a conservative at the end. Overall, I don't think my argument would matter to someone because everyone has the right to smoke and do whatever they want.      TIL one second has one million microseconds.   Why won't you? Women find these more playful than offensive.   Most Russians these days who live in the distant Eastern towns look very much alike.    Why doesn't it show contrast? A nuclear bomb, an amusement park. So maybe it's not particularly for a nuclear weapon but violence, wars, and I don't know what kind of message he wanted to deliver but this image shows both the connection and the contrast between the two.   Plus, no art, even a chilidish one, is supposed to make sense on first sight. Yes, you can say it's poorly done and it's your opinion, but I don't think this kid should be laughed about for this.  Btw, sorry for any English mistakes. I'm not from the US. I'm seventeen, for the record.    It's actually pretty good. Obviously it's very amateurish, but it shows how children are living in a world where nuclear weapons are so common, and it just shows the contrast between the two. I don't know, I think it's kinda nice.    Just do pushups man. I promise you that if you do 10 reps every time you go to the bathroom, you'll start seeing difference VERY quickly.   And obviously soon enough you could do more than 10 reps.   To eat healthy, you must first see the outcomes of not eating healthy. For example, I noticed every time I eat these salty snacks, my skin gets just plain awful. Therefore, my brain automatically rejects it and searches for something else instead.   	33
 first bahahahahaha   (text gold)   They were trying to say that comedy can still be written within the context of the show correct?   "I'm just a Q-tip!!!"   thot walk   what the fucking fuck man?                                 Don't write off the possibility of demonic involvement. I remember experiencing this multiple times, having a feeling of another presence within the room, and only alleviating when I called upon the name of Jesus. It also would happen right when I started feeling courageous about my faith and considered stepping out further than my comfort zone. I know /r/christianity likes to take the more naturalistic approach to most topics like this and psych related topics, but remember, we battle against not flesh and blood, but the principalities of spiritual darkness. So, never discount the presence of Lucifer and his minions and look to Jesus in prayer and humility, as his authority is above all - and we are His children. Fear Not.       I like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98                  Don't worry brother. This is the exact subreddit that shares your views. well said.       God's probably more offended at you harming your body (his temple) than expelling liquid onto a religious icon. You're fine, quit smoking.    I don't get why the jews didn't just have some land in the godforsaken mid-west of the united states. At least there they would only be squabbling with Native Americans, of which we've more or less already got locked down in reservations. There must be something REAL special about that shit middle east that someone far wiser than I was able to visualize way back after world war II. Maybe its the highest concentration of stargates in the world. Just a guess. Cuz we got some of those in Arizona too.    oh...decent story either way   I dan't get it   Because then everyone would know about the Sons of God and the Nephilim and their rule during the Great Flood and their rule they still have to play prior to Christ's return.                     half life 3 confirmed   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjIqQBsPjk   It's called 2001: Space Odyssey                Was gonna post this to /r/bestof but that subreddit does not allow posts from here anymore. Strange...          Link to Audio Story - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmCQ1-kzpZk  Winning the 2015 Hugo Award, This story first it intrigued me, then it amused me, then it gripped me then I laughed out loud. Once complete immersed into the world of the story, I next shared the creatures curiosity, their fear, and finally their awe. I relished every transition, every change in tempo, every interaction, the precision in each characterization. And in the end when I finally understood just what was happening and what it meant I experienced that rare joy that only the best science fiction stories seem to offer: that feeling of a gradually increasing cognitive dissonance due to my assumptions not quite matching up with where the story is going and then the aha moment when I finally understood that the scope of this subcreation is larger and more nuanced than I first anticipated. Its positively rapturous when all the parts that seem out of place just suddenly fall together.            https://vimeo.com/123274659   You're missing the point, friend. You must first ask, did he do anything at all? Or were the Boston bombings a government orchestrated event created to continue to disarm the population and control through the instinctual sense of fear? Luciferian at its core. This boy, and his brother, were simply what they call "fall guys", whom the blame is placed, to divert the true narrative away from the masses. The news reports and we listen. What's to stop satan from polluting that aspect of our life equally so. May God give you discernment.   How do you actually know? Do you really know anything beyond the fantasy that exists within your television set? You know nothing more than the streets you walk and the people you speak with.    This man is innocent. Lucifer, through the agent of the mass media, has duped us once again. The only Kingdom that we should trust is a Heavenly one, and I feel its pretty clear that our "great country" no longer holds the interest of "we the people". False Flags are prevalent throughout history and there's always a need for a "fall guy". Notice how we never even heard an appeal from this man. He never once had a voice. Your prayers should be directed towards the mercy of this mans soul for he is dying for a lie. How sorrowful this world is.   Friend, you have no idea what has occurred outside the narrative that the media has published to you. Your prayers should be directed towards the individuals that have wrongfully accused this man and that God have mercy on an innocent man. I advise you the only government that should reign truth into your heart is the Lord and His kingdom. All governments and their contrived perspectives of "their people" are simply and undoubtedly under the hand of the Prince of all Lies, Lucifer.                         I think maybe I mean't to say MSAA, turn that off and just use FXAA   maybe turn off SMAA, not shore   I would also install OpenIV too if you haven't already. And make sure you make backups for all your files that you may alter ;)                                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3gDcLCs-mM  Delves into the mind of the cleric of the healing church, Martin, and his transformation                  oh ok.    You are loved, friend. Never give up. We truly have no other option or hope other than Christ. Lean solely on Him and know that He will complete His good work in you. It is finished :)   Touched on often, but still a continuing question. I've always been curious about how other Christians feel once they've sinned again and knowing they may repeat that sin in the future? Will Jesus continue forgiving us? Or is there a cut off where someone was never saved in the first place? Is this question far too legalistic? Thank you for your responses ahead of time :)                  like when Michael Ironside didn't voice Sam Fisher and they let a 30 year old take over a 60 year old character. *sour taste*               Link to audio reading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmtynRB_278 index=23 list=PLvC0iydiKnCjWECWGAPRf-j7qgfqObjDZ  "I deliberately shot to death Laurence Connaught. So they mean to execute me. Especially because Laurence Connaught had saved my life."    has any achieved a state of being where they no longer consider themselves or worry about achieving the goals of the self or fulfilling the perceptions of others? Has anyone freed themselves from the endless need to please others and just sat and allowed themselves to just BE. Has anyone stopped constantly judging themselves and just accepted their lot and stood content? Please pray that I will no longer be ME but be Christ and understand that I am you and you are me and rest in peace that is found in the unconditional love of the Son and father and spirit.                      What do you think happened to the skiers on that mysterious day? Avalanche, aliens, or governmental cover up have been only a few of the theories surrounding this infamous case.       You didn't answer the first four examples.    What about modern day exorcisms? All hoaxes and fabrications of the mind? Satanic cults? Actions bearing no unhealthy spiritual fruit? I really feel that your interpretation of the scripture is just grammatically incorrect. There is far too much evil within this world to blame solely on human imperfection.    Do you believe that the demonic forces are still hard at work today to deter people from coming to know the freedom found in Christ?   CAN'T CRITICIZE THIS!!! It has everybody's favorite TV show referenced and everybody's favorite propaganda all within one easily digestible .GIF!!!! Wow, thank you so much ADHD, you've done wonders for the hivemind   oh well...   What about Revelation? Satan is referenced there and that is commonly considered prophetical, as in the future.       It's so weird watching people getting and feeling threatened/angry about a competitive *GAME*, that they created. It's like me creating a trend where I hang pig intestines on the side of my house as a "sign of dominance" and now everyone must have the best pig intestines on the sides of their houses and Jane Jackson kills Betty Fooktaker because she said her intestines are of the amateur variety...   white people are so weird   Imagine doing those good actions of a christian, but putting your trust and faith into an all powerful, loving and gracious spiritual entity that has redeemed you from the power of evil (Sin) that will separate you from that paradise for all eternity. A good place to begin is to read the gospels written of Jesus and to talk to real life christians about why they became christians and how they found truth and spiritual freedom in that belief. YouTube is also awfully useful for good testimonies :) God bless friend! God has already blessed you enough to be curious :D   If only mining could just happen on asteroids and random planets rather than our own   The world looked alive and the foliage was nice.

It's predecessors just didn't stray from the formula and the novelty was lost, especially after the 6th installment.           Comedy, much like any skill, requires practice. Boys, from a very young age, are encouraged to hone these skills. That's why a woman would dominate a man in interior design, fashion sense and any other activity that a woman is told is normal from the time they can walk. It's 95% societal. Girls get dressed in pink, boys in blue. While subject A is amazing at coordinating outfits and applying eyeliner, subject B is fantastic at making dick jokes. It's all learned behavior, and sure, it may be minutely biologically to some degree, but stand up comedians and runway models don't just WAKE UP on stage one morning.       can you make a few extra capsules that go around the arms, legs, body and head of the character to decrease clipping?

Yeah, from what I gathered from his videos is that he hails from a small town in Central Pennsylvania and picked up a rather distinct local dialect.

And maybe, it was a mixture of actual and fake injuries.    a montage of 70s scifi elements that might cohesively mesh well together on a YouTube banner with the appropriate dimensions and ratios. Maybe with enough space within the center for the title of the page. Possibly with horror elements as well!  Thanks! :)                           Yeah, it's called propaganda. It runs rampant through the US mainstream media and very prevalent here within the hivemind of reddit. Especially against anything Opposing Israel... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GauZzyiwPh8   What are some ways you've seen it in the past?    Maybe just let the dreams be a demonstration of who you are without Christ and be a pre-lesson to your desire to turn from Sin throughout your day. God bless you, friend.    8^O   "Rut-roh, Raggy"      What's everyone's actual stance towards marijuana use as a Christian? Just curious.                                 It's amazing when you watch a video, have no previous notion of the context to which the video is about (the show, the singers, the judges), and suddenly, after 30 seconds, I have developed a full fledged raging opinion that MUST BE HEARD!   Your perception of racism is racist   Bonus question: What would have to happen for said Planetoid to drift through space without directly physically affecting planet Earth or any other celestial body within the solar system?

Solid point. The media is already starting on Bernie. However, we have more of a voice as citizens today than did people back then. We can set talking points and decide what is important.       Will South Park create any presidential politics episodes? There will likely be some good material once things start getting heated.         when you have no girls texting you #lincolnchafee  when you get no call backs for job interviews #lincolnchafee            Bernie has maintained a consistent position being against big money. He can ask the person to stop and say he doesn't support it, but in the end under the law the person can continue.      They almost certainly do coordinate but just not enough to be called out on it. But even when they do, nobody polices it. I think the Sanders campaign would be the only one who doesn't directly coordinate. **Usually the PACs are run by the candidates lawyers or staff members. This person is not affiliated with Sanders. Big distinction.**   Are there any other people big in music, tv/movies, sports, etc who would want to continue this trend of endorsing Sanders?    It wouldn't be donated. They'd be voicing their views with their money.   It was only a matter of time until one formed. But the name of the PAC is pretty hilarious I will concede.   Demand? This is America. Money talks and people can spend it how they want.    There are actually a few billionaires out there who think they have enough and want everyone else to have. I know it sounds like a unicorn, but there are a few of them out there.    Some people like to disparage Lil B but  he's a generational leader.    exactly   It's not Sanders' doing.

The gate was 7.1 million.   I'm not sure if it's a wig made from his own hair or the world's most elaborate comb over.    Dear sir or madam, in reality increasing a minimum wage [creates more jobs](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/job-loss). The lowest earners spend their money unlike the wealthy. When they spend their money this creates more economic growth and more jobs. The economic data is out there and it concludes increases in minimum wages increase the number of jobs in the free market. If we can supplement that with additional government created employment, it would create even more jobs and give us a strong economy.          People are naive and vote for the wrong reasons.   The right reason: voting for your own economic interest and for the greater good.         i hear that         Bernie Sanders represents me as a Democrat more than anyone else in the Democratic Party. He is the ideal Democrat. He's what every "one of you" should be.

I love track and field but I realize almost nobody really cares about it except for a month every four years.    so what happens next? how long before there are new districts that aren't fixed?   touche   [Arvydas Sabonis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9q-0x2gu8), more that he came late to the show than bloomed late, but close enough.   new new new new world order   we don't want a bandwagoner like you    whatever he says clinton will say me too   you don't like the hair plugs?   meh   i'll give you 13  	139
 The question is intentionally ambiguous.; it targets the post communist society but certainly the process off surpassing capitalism in order to find ourselves at Communism or even Anarchism. Humans are greedy and even if we are satisfied on the surface,  I like to ask if we ever will be satisfied? All we do is strive for the longevity in benign emotions which really brews tension in our subconsciousness on happiness, but once we've achieved a utopia (in theory)  what happens next? Where do we go when we're fed up with a utopia? However, maybe we won't be.      Good point on the whole longevity of emotions. Have you ever seen the movie memento? It's like our short term memory is continually erasing our emotions, not they actually are very real to begin with: just products of our imagination and some hormones. Of course this is biological: I mean no one wants to have to continually feel pain, but why do you think it is so common for people to feel negative emotions for a longer period of time? Additionally, for those who can find happiness: I think a great philosophy to live by is to be happy. So I think it's fine to have a cascade of temporary happiness, but what about happiness for a society. Do you believe it holds the same philosophy?    I'm definitely addressing left-wing ideologies for this question and in theory, eradication of a government will foster benign human nature because the government, in theory, is the cause of all of our inhumanity and immoral behavior (morality is a whole other conversation in itself if you're up for the convo). So let's say we live simply, basking in our interests and fulfilling the life we want that will provide us with the most happiness. We all have the same resources and there is no private property. Civilization no longer suffers from the all so consuming evil brainwash of capitalism, materialism, injustice, etc. what happens next? What happens when we really we are happy and want more? I'm not asking what is the point of trying to be happy (I mean what's the point of anything really) but what happens next? I'm not looking for a reply that essentially says "why not? We've made a utilitarian society that's given equality to all." (Or something along those lines) I'm really open to a lot of views on this; I'm just looking for a really great discussion.   Private property can exist in anarchy, but that's right-winged anarchy. I assume you're talking about left-winged anarchy.   So you're asking about how individuals could survive and function in a society with no regulation. Right? Well, in theory, no government would cause individuals to be pretty benign and humane beings. There would be no desire for stealing or murder because (for the most part) this is the product of the government (and materialism, religion, classism, etc.) with this said, people would likely form communes in order to achieve a utilitarian society. I like to think of the Kibbutz as a great example of this (of course there was government and it modeled socialism thus no innovation ) but for the short term this community definitely seemed to model anarchy moderately. They had a democracy, no private property, and even children stayed together and were parented by all of the adults.    Edit: patented to parented and human to humane   I walked alongside some tall grasses and flowers this morning. It was beautiful in a fulfilling way. Ya know? Here I am alive, well, conscious, and alert simply immersed in so much beauty. I like to think this was a moment where I felt quite a bit of clarity. Like, yeah I'm insignificant but to me this is real and honest: I can feel life all around me: it's breathing and it exists to me. Who cares about the reality of the cosmos or God, I'm a human being who does not have the capability of fathoming such the complexity in their nature. So screw it. God damn I'm alive and that's sick. So I picked a flower. I picked a flower and realized that I will always be greedy. Even in a moment where I felt fulfilled, I wanted the beauty in the flower to be mine forever. I needed it. Here I am thinking for a moment that I am really happy. I felt happy, and I was happy on the surface for sure. But i didn't want to let go of it. Is it possible to ever be happy? Could we train a person and his subconsciousness or a society to achieve some sort of fulfilling happiness? Do you think it's needed? Because I do think most of us would pick the flowers in a utopia.   This is terrifying   	7

 Now that's a comment I like. It even better because it's from a girl's perspective. Great comment really. I agree with everything. As I said I am willing to do the FWB thing, just didn't know what to do. And I was thinking about the cuddling thing. Damn that's my favorite thing :D Too bad As Roosevelt's wife said: "Every day do something that frightens you" and since the FWB is something new to me I'm a bit scared really so that's why I am looking for comments like this one. Thanks :)   Well in my case we still chat, be friendly you know. She told me I can do everything just without the relationship and feelings. Personally I am not scared to commit. Maybe it's she who's scared. We are behaving like we are friends. But there will be benefits. Like in that movie. Even though life is never like that :D   If he didn't have those coins we wouldn't be able to see your hand right now. Science :D  	3
 Ok i read the Desolate Guardians and I'm a bit better about understanding now   *except they cost more*   The marines arent a branch known to want to spend a lot on their equipment.   Kittyhawk. Don't ask why because I don't know either.   Mind you the Huey they are using is modern and up to date with standards...      I read the portal in the forest, but for some reason these things arent connecting for me.   Ill be honest, after reading part one and two i can safely say, I am incredibly intrigued and incredibly confused as to what the fuck is happening.   It's funny how even with all of the photography effects you can tell they aren't from the 1800's because they aren't malnourished.   *grumble grumble america grumble grumble*   I couldn't relate to this more. And with wargame's super-zoom technology and good vehicle models It is impossible for me to avoid.   Japan owns us!   	11
       jesus /r/moviescirclejerk I am disappoint    oh yeah teenagers in europe are totally responsible with booze, totes    You are literally anti birth control.  You literally break birth control.      nice   small fish there   Here's my question: Why are so many people bitching about this show?  I think it is better than the first season.   same with todayilearned  yeah no you didn't, you knew that already     there is a longer article about this somewhere, been psoted few times, interesting read   just like my dead mom      we had this monthly or something for a while but it seems to have petered out   Some will, of their own accord, that's it.  Simples.            ta!   Sure... totes...    that's fucing crazy   oh fuck yeah, i mean pogba has loads potential sure but fucking 71 million ??   Just have to laugh, imagine if this went viral and got onto NBC or CNN or something.  *"Redditor /u/PussySlaying420King posted this uplifting video..."*   who upvoted this piece of shit post?   cool beans man  there is a lot of comp there and I get the feeling a small bit of who you know (just saying like)   Yeah imagine reddit doing something again good instead of just hating shit, wouldn't that be a nice change.   [I love it when you are playful...](http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h341/bellaisafinefrenzy/tumblr_lj5st3x9tW1qb7eqw.gif)   I'd take Turan over Pogba   Fuck em least you are offering new ideas.   I'll say yes but I won't actually do anything   Pride only because they won.  As I said, patriotisium    Except it isn't.  There seems to be a specific type of plastic just for the states. I think it is called Patriotisium    uh-huh   Sure, no doubt.  But looking as a neutral you see this spread all over the site. If they hadn't won I would imagine the vast vast majority wouldn't give a shit.   Belgium winning the world cup would get less coverage on reddit than this.  One of the top teams in the world does well at a tournament they were amongst the faves to win = second coming of football jesus   I am not trolling at all mate. My account stands for itself.  I'll even explain it to you, which I shouldn't, because you are being rude.  I never said the people making the jokes spoke for all americans as you suggested  I never once mentioned it  I never once mentioned the twitter jokes   All I said was, as you cut and pasted, "Americans are bad winners and sore losers."  That was it.  So there it is as clear as day. There is no trolling, no attempts to disguise my comments or change them in anyway, that is it, quite clearly.   It's all getting a little bit cringe now to be honest.  There seems to be more about this than the copa america.  I know demographics come into it but jesus christ.      I like him a lot.   You are cutting and pasting my words which confirm what I just said.  That's pointless.  Deep breath and think about it. Look at my words, look at your responses, and think about it before you reply.     never said they did, and I am not particularly referring to these jokes, just americans in general      recipe?    yeah but I didn't, I don't speak for other people   this needs to go on /r/foodporn mate    to suggest that America is uniquely xenophobic   I didn't.  WTF   Your point being?  Did I mention absolutes ? Worst of the worst?  No.  And I stand by my comment.  Americans are bad winners and sore losers.    I'm Irish   k   Americans are bad winners and sore losers.    much passion   jesus the downvotes  sad really   cynical me - one of the biggest stars in asia - looking at that chinese box office   top kek   cuts his hand so hard he dies   a double bill on a 14inch tv on xmas day when I was a young kid - all quiet western front and lawrence of arabia   give me a tremendous failure over an overrated shitballs success any day   I turned it off the first time.

There are only so many slots for big films in the year and many are taken by these.  At least Btman Superman looks actually good, but it will prob suck too   I think Sonatine. If you like that go with the others. Great film.   I have to go rewatch some   I think Gangs of New York would make a great TV show is handled correctly.   I never any of your work!   how are those onions rings made   write what the fuck you want man     Played well though, jesus that guy has some stamina     Comments don't make the person.  You don't argue circlejerk.  I am not sure. Oh the hyperbolic.  It doesn't need one.  Talk later, pizza beer now   I never said you were part of the hive. Quite the opposite.  And your comments were pathetic, not you.  No it was cirlcejerk stuff.   No you actually meant it. Be honest.  As for why I reddit the way I do - as it is my choice.    f you look hard enough you can find paragraph after paragraph of me discussing how much I hated certain films that reddit loved.  Good, we need more redditors like you.    Yes, you are resorting to insults.  No I did not insult you off the bat - you sure you got the right user? Care to point that out?  I'll skip the middle part because it's just circlejerk stuff.   I'm aware that I might cause you a whole lot of butthurt by asking you this, but why won't you just explain it?  Why would it cause me 'butthurt'?  Bizarre comment.  Why won't I explain it?   As of now - because I don't believe you don't understand it. It would mean you are probably the only person on the thread who didn't get it (watch as people come out of the woodwork now).  Note: Try as you might what you wrote in the end was undoubtedly cringe material. Not le cringe, or anything like that, no, just clear cringe.   It's basically become accepted fact by now.  Ow.   Again, if you don't ever want to explain yourself that's fine, but when you refuse you better have some tissues handy, because you are going to be downvoted.  Oh no!          Simple rule I have:  modern (2011-) black and white is ok  any of the ancient shit (Pre MCU/Nolanverse) is not   Ah resort to insults. How wonderful.  No your comment is wrong. It doesn't matter how much you explain yourself. I've said this dozens of times on reddit. [I found one of my drunken rants about it too](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2odqj4/the_sorry_cynical_state_of_movie_fandom_today/cmm6hq1)  Yes you are demanding, you are still demanding. You are trying to be superior and claim that you don't understand how my succinct (heh) response actually encompasses the main faults with the film in the eyes of the detractors.  It's hysterical.  Just admit you know exactly what I mean by that sentence. It's so simple.    Look buddy, we all know you can't explain that nonsense you typed out initially. It's basically become accepted fact by now.  Cringe.  I'll excuse your post pao insults and be the bigger man.     Trust me I am offering no services to anyone and am doing it purely for myself.  Well in fairness if everything that is popular is shit what can you do. I liked Fury Road, that was good, if it is good I say it is good, I don't leave anyone dictate my opinion one way or the other.   crazy stuff      test over word still allowed    Yes, 99% of the userbase on here do, whether they will admit it or not.  [I of course don't because I don't watch English language movies. I pick a new language per season and watch as many as I can. This summer it is Danish.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/82yHd99YxnY/maxresdefault.jpg)   You really need to be more succinct. Truly.   I've written in tremendous detail about the concept of opinions on /r/movies, trust me you are adding nothing to it.  Your comment about the upvotes is just wrong. No matter the detail of the response you are not in any way more likely to get upvoted.   And back to the main:  Your lack of understanding of the phrase is really painful to read. And if you genuinely believe I am incapable of explaining why that short sentence perfectly sums up why many regarded the film Fury Road as overrated then I don't know what to say.  A fucking infant could.  I choose not to. As I already explained, just because some fanboy demands it doesn't mean you have to do shit.  But if you do, because you will just get downvoted or ignored anyway, save your energy and always be succinct.      in fairness some people deserve it  it's like:  "I didn't like that film, thought it was a bit dull."  "Oh really - how many films have you directed? How many oscars do you have? None - then shut up!!!"   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1628841/   *'I'm not lovin' it'*   Rumoured the new blue ray that will come out right before ID2 will feature some of his 'personal videos'   Schumacher in his day.   curry   I watch crime documentaries    that's a personal decision  think for yourselves people   google says there is   has the dream really changed?  that's the interesting part  despite owning the house and having the stable job and no college debt like a generation or whatever ago the dream still remains the same     oh god that's just too big of a question   probably   len - steal my sunshine   so close!   Sometimes perhaps but what I wrote there is not edgy, just the standard observation that many of us (I assume you do to an extent as well) have about reddit and its sacred cows.         I get fucked drunk and blackout   I wanted to be cool  It worked   How can anyone know   Need a new cover though   St. Hubbins, The Patron Saint of Quality Footwear   that does look really good mate   There is nothing in what I wrote that is in anyway 'edgy', and what is more, you know there is not.   Well it's unfortunately a fact of being on a default sub where the hivemind (which does exist as we have seen the last few days) latches onto certain things (QT, Nolan, McCon) and basically does not allow any dissenting opinion, no matter how much it is backed up.  This came up yesterday as well. And easily thousands of times before. I even wrote lengthy rants about it in the past  But just ignore the reality and throw in the term 'cute' and maybe that will make it all better.     Sigh.     #iamverysmart          Did I mention blockbusters?   Some are sure. Still need a name to carry it. J.Edgar with James Frain in the lead might not have got the budget, or got made at all, and would have limped into nowhereland.   Is it? I really think he is at best average.   That I am right, without a doubt.  Neither. But to say you are not a fanboy is hysterical. You obviously are.      He's a big movie star, one of only a handful left, Hollywood is a tight community, you don't get your huge budget without a name.  But go on with the pathetic snark you little fanboy snowflake.    I just miss karl malden    I am not a marvel fan in general, found most of the films to be shit, so who the fuck knows - I might end up liking this one   The old marketing ways work man   Uh-huh... totes...    It really doesn't. About 90% of the hive think the same thing.            Leo is the most middling actor, nothing he has done as an adult has been anyway above average, the hivemind fanboy love on here is just tragic    woah harsh   He's not funny. Never has been. On screen anyway.    , he's done very little work, producing semi-good super profitable family comedies, while being a family man first.  Seems to work a bit, his films are shit and many of them are not that profitable (he has some ridiculous deal or something IIRC) and who gives a shit about being a family man.  I'm actually shocked that /r/movies doesn't like him   Cool   How many films have been released so far in 2015?  How many have you seen OP?   It's grand. Leo was the worst part about it.  He is often the worst part about the films he is in though.  I still think Infernal Affairs was far superior.    No oscar nom that year, makes you think   strange connection  great film though    Yep, and I explained why not giving answers is stupid, damaging, and childlike.  No you didn't. Simple opinions are perfectly valid in many contexts. It's never about the simple opinion.  And yes I did explain quite succinctly the general reasons why people think the film is overrated - it just have went over your head.  Which is disturbing because it was quite simple.  And as for your last paragraph - oh christ it's like you never come to /r/movies at all. Yeah I upvoted him when he was in the negatives, some others did too, wow, it discounts nothing since the other 10000 posts doing the same didn't.  Don't make me fucking laugh.  But back to the main issue - you don't see how it is succinct?   Really?  Be honest, not just internet argument (which unfortunately once again you really think you are right about this, and that I am wrong, which is just fucking disturbing), be honest - you don't understand how that response is succinct?      oh it comes up after you submit something, automod   I never said you did any of those things.   I just told you why I don't normally give answers.   it's just unnecessarily cryptic  No it isn't. It's pretty succinct.    So yea, if you don't feel like explaining why you disliked a movie that's fine,  I repeat this - I never said one way of the other   but you add absolutely nothing to the discussion by doing so.  Except I explained why some people don't like it.   If all you care about is wether you get upvoted or downvoted for your comment, then don't even bother commenting in the first place.  Really? This is all you got now?  Hysterical.     one of the best films the year it was released imo   Oh right.  No just a submission statement of sorts after you post.   You've been on reddit 2 years?     I dont get it   I never said anything one way or the other about my opinion.  In fact I rarely respond to users demanding to know the reason why someone disliked their precious, I think it is fucking shitty behaviour, every time a film the hive likes is treated negatively it gets downvoted - even when explained in detail etc.   Yet if I was to write 'Fury Road is awesome' I'd get 200 upvotes.   Truly pathetic.  And as for your second point - explain to me why it makes no sense.   No, it is the condensed version of many who do not rate the film as highly as /r/movies users.      Hello, yes I would like   ... full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.   sorry you are getting downvoted  the hive on here is not that bright   	148
 Amen brother!   Do you think that car is anything like the show.  You can drive around for hours but not get anywhere?   Ya I always thought of it just as an honorary title.     Blue beard in the fate/zero killed little children.     Ooooo Hannibal lecter would make a great servant.  When he starts feeding you oysters and walnuts I would start to worry though.   I haven't gotten that far in dark souls 2 yet so I guess.   I understand it's like a running theme but yakno it did seem a bit overused.   Ya I always thought they overused the world Blood.   Yona of the dawn?   Videogames.  Buy a ps4, play The Last of Us.  It will change your life.   If I get excited the world might explode.   Ohhh I'm sad now.   He should go threw with it.  That'll teach them queers.   Same here.  That was the first anime I watched and I was blown away.  Didn't see that coming from a mile away.   Parks and Recreation.   Ooooo nice ass.   HA! I just spit water all over my computer screen.   I just finished it acouple days ago...I don't know what to do with my life anymore.   Spotify.  I absolutely love it.  $5.99 per month and no adds.  Yes sir, use it every day.   Needs more cowbell!!!   I DON'T EVEN HAVE A LAST NAME.  IN THE SHOW I WAS JUST CREWMAN #6!!   I don't think I've ever felt "sexy" but I have felt extreme confidence.  I would guess that's the male equivalent.   What is table-kun?   Is it really as horrible as I've been led to believe?   I just started reading blood meridian.  It seems good im just having a hard time getting into it.   I would do what I did in skyrim.  Collect every wheel of cheese.   He was the only good character in the show.  It was still shit though.   I was just about to ask if this show got any better.  I have my answer.   The Hobbit.     Ahhh I'm so excited but I'm really sad now.   American cops have something like that.  It's called a bullet.   Sausage, mushroom.  Only toppings I'll ever get.   I don't know man, most bars are gonna be showing the hawks play.   They should do the show and have Clarkson in the audience.  Always in view of the camera, in disguise just chilling.   I'm about half way through hunterxhunter.  This is my first time watching it.  This show kicks SO MUCH ASS!   Fma:B but sword art online was the first show I picked out for myself.   I love to dance.  Am I good at it? Absolutely not but I love it anyways.   Blues, alternative, soul.   I love the voice acting for the rock trolls.  Makes me laugh every time I listen to them.   Oh ya, in the epsidoes if you pay attention in almost every scene it's counting up to 100.  I was so excited to see what happened when it did get there.  Man, was I upset.  	40
 Just a short video of a tornado in Port Talbot - Wales, Nothing spectacular but the only video of a tornado in this area i've ever seen. No amount of web searching came up with anything else!      When I saw him he was very jittery and seemed very stressed out and was on the phone to his publicist talking about a flight from Manchester airport the next day, wasn't till later on the next week I found out he was going to the jungle and why he seemed so worried haha.      Well thats the thing, i spoke to Danny in March and he denied anything, spoke to Robert in May he confirmed, spoke to Norman and Chris in October they both confirmed and finally spoke to Craig in November and he also confirmed. But when i spoke to Robert and queried why Danny said no, he stated that back then they weren't allowed to confirm but since then they have all been told they can say it's happening.  Spoke to all of them in one year, was pretty proud of that!   no probs velixie, love it   Last time i spoke to one was Craig Charles in Cardiff at the start of November and he confirmed for end of 2015 then.  	7

 Bingo!  Crabs, too.  Who could have possibly figured out that steaming/boiling such an unholy looking critter would result in such deliciousness?  How did I'd a guess a Stone Age human figure that out?   I'm sure it's a fine film but don't you think you are Micheal Bay lite?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWBUl7oT9sA      (I have altered the deal....)[http://ebb.org/bkuhn/talks/LinuxCon-North-America-2014/vader-altered-the-deal.jpg]  *edit crap I can't get this pic to display.  It's Darth Vader.   Oddly enough, the title of that song is [We Won't Get Fooled Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp6-wG5LLqE)    Well at least he was on the proper ballot.  The next time I see a Twins fan, I will cross the street to avoid them.  Thank you for the explanation!  I feel less angry now.   I live in DC and have always wondered why somebody didn't put a timelapse camera on our snow farms.  We'd melt off much earlier than this and it'd be fun to see say the last remnants of Snowmageddon die!   Oh it was fan voted?    I think the Senators sucked in DC longer than the Twins have sucked in Minnesota though.    But 1924 seems like it's been erased from history.    Was Johnson on the Minnesota ballot or the Washington ballot?   This truly pisses me off.  The Nats get only Expos players yet the Twins don't list the Senators' Walter Johnson?!  At what point does the MLB decide what records go where?   Nah.  A puppy conks out wherever it is when it runs out of gas.  He wanted to play.   As young as the doggie is, you could see him beginning to understand the cat batting at him.    They'll be fine.     The next time we fly past it all will be well.  Pluto now knows we truly love it.  It just needed a sign.   Well the heart looks to be broken....  Sorry.   That's an unusual place to find a lost dog.  I hope it's not a tourist's dog who got loose.  Please update once he/she's been scanned.     Toyota cars of that era simply refused to die.   Well have you ever tried to hail a cab in Paris?  Even in the worst pre-Uber/Lyft days, DC had a better cab network.    Bus/taxi-only lanes wouldn't work here.     I've never heard of this movie, but am so glad I did now -- thanks!  She went from Nixon in '68 to Nixon in '73.   I bet if he left it that way for the winter, come spring, it'd sprout.   Ah the simple pleasures of a porch and a nice rocking chair on a hot day.   This is the look of a bulldog in final abject defeat.  I did not know this was possible.  He will however have his revenge.  Bank on it.  He's plotting it as the pic was being taken.   What this video doesn't convey is how noisy the NYC subway is.  Her voice couldn't carry over the racket.  The man in the blue shirt was likely the only one who could hear her.  Plus, it sounded like all she did was a snippet of gospel.     I'm amazed the co-host chimed in with the Bo Derek point that spontaneously.  I saw that movie as a teen and still have fond memories of this look:  https://bloggojane.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/bo-derek-nude-bathing-suit-10-1979.jpg  I thought the modern world had forgotten about 10.  It's a great film!   That's precisely what's going on.  He's a vanity candidate.  Pat Buchanan did this in the 90's.     That was pretty cool!   That's a fair point.  It's not like the racists pop up anywhere else.  In fact, I didn't know they existed until I read about them elsewhere.  Still in the immortal words of Jake Blues: "Nazis.  I hate those guys."   The bullying kid was named Aspen or something right?  Is that a boy's name?   They really do have a lot of affairs and are more elastic about it.   Aw dammit.  Who do we blame for this?   Really good summary of the recent important articles too.  I'd never heard the Biker Bar argument before.  I like it.   Alright McCutcheon!!!   Gotta feed the teenagers summer blockbuster machine somehow.   Holy crap somebody really wants us to see Ant Man. So many commercials for it that I feel like I've already seen it.    Oh I missed the ad -- was the reprehensible Briefcase show?  No argument.     Truth be told I don't hear him call a lot of baseball, but all kinds of football.  I simply remember that he doesn't annoy me in baseball.     They really do scrape the barrel.  I love their old spoof RTV shows though.  Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire and so forth.   I don't think he's that bad of a baseball guy.  I mute him on NFL games though.     Nuts.  Anticlimatic.  Beer run now.   I went to school with a Norfolk native.  He pronounced it Nawfuck.     It's happening tomorrow?  Why are we hearing about this just now?   Well it does look exactly like that photo above.  But thanks.  I have no intention of selling them.  They're sort of a fond memory of late, beloved cousin.     Dickbutting and saying something mean about Ellen Pao.   I've heard that on Navy ships, the captain orders all rings off while the ship's at sea.     It is a huge law school, true.  I've always thought that getting in is the toughest part.  I've known plenty of HLS lawyers and they are across the board all very good, but have heard lots of anecdotes that after first year, they coast.     That's my question, too -- don't negotiate salary until you have the offer.  Who knows, the offer could be perfectly good.     Unlike any of my friends' fathers, he always worked out.  If not tennis, running, and doing that well before the running craze broke out in the early 80's.    A knee replacement has knocked him back a bit now, but he's still got it.     /r/BestOfLiveleak    I was 18 in '78 and can shed light on '75 and '85.  Both of the guys are dressed for a night in a disco or for '85 at a New Wave concert -- Thompson Twins or something.  Nobody wore that stuff on the streets.  '75 girl -- I think I might've seen that a few times, but it wasn't popular.  '85 girl however is in a high school prom dress.    DAE watch The Leftovers on HBO?  http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/06/30/leftovers.jpg  Should I suddenly see 1000 people in white, I'd freak.   My computer's messed up so no pix of it, but I found what appears to be it via Google:  http://images.europeanwatch.com/images/21/21542.jpg  The numerals on mine seem to be slightly smaller and crisper but that might be the perspective of the photo.  On the back there are two symbols under the IX and a teensy 18K at the bottom -- almost unreadable.  It's in really good shape -- no major scuffs on the lens.  I have very little reason to believe it's a fake.  My cousin had way too much money and the executor of the estate had everything of value appraised.    The Rolex meanwhile is a Submariner with black dial, steel casing, and no date bubble.  I'm 100% certain it's real.  It came with the box, certificate, receipt, and the little anchor keychain.    Thanks!  Edit: I then remembered to check visit this page and there are more photos and a valuation.  Is that accurate?    http://www.europeanwatch.com/21542.html#  All of the other photos stack up except that Patek Philippe is not embossed on the inside of the watchband.  The clasp is identical though.      Will do!  Thanks -- I'm always on the lookout for a new show.   No you now have the bestest bartender available.   Seriously -- is this something that's been made or a funny trailer for soemthing not to be made?   It's pre-Iowa.  The GOP is the opposition party so anybody who thinks he/she has a credible shot has to do it now or wait 8 years.    Any one of them could be the Jimmy Carter coming out of nowhere.  Except for Donald Trump.  He's a vanity candidate.     The Omen.  Damien was a lot easier to take when I could get out of the car and go play with the other kids on the playground.   Really?  I grew up in SW Virginia and saw a funnel cloud once.  It landed and I think knocked over some lawn chairs, but it was confirmed to be a tornado.  Tornadoes in mountains don't do so well.   I don't think it had so much to do with Snowden, but with her cooperation with the Taliban.  I don't like this woman one little bit.   I've never tried acid in my life and it's freaked me out while completely sober.     Me, too.  I guess Curiosity and the seven minutes of terror has made me an immediate gratification type.   Really?  Oddly enough, it's my favorite.  The Rolex feels like I'm wearing a brick on my wrist.  I never understood the appeal of the big diving watches.  It's still fun to wear with a polo shirt though.     73?!  I'm 53 and frequently fell like I'm the oldest guy on reddit.  Nicely done, good sir.  My father's 83 btw and has the same build as Harrison Ford to this day.     I hope the other side of the bar is at ground level for ease in getting the empties and crates back into the system.   I inherited a couple of really nice watches.  A Rolex, a Patek Phillipe, a Movado.  Dunno how much they're worth, but one of them is probably it.     It sounds like she'll be using an American accent.  I don't know that my brain could handle seeing Lady Mary speaking 'murican.     That harpy on the left is showing way too much wrist.  Slut.   Yup, his career didn't last long.  I read he'd get written up for being "lazy" and spending too much time with his guitar.  I think he twisted his ankle on a jump and the Army decided it was best to let him go.  I'm pretty sure it was an honorable discharge.     I love how the orange cat is all "oh not this shit again."   53 here.  I don't think the millennials could comprehend the crap us teen boys in the 70's had to put up with cults trying to recruit us.  I was fortunate in that I have naturally high cynicism but I figured that they were fishing for the one in 100 that didn't.     Thank you SO MUCH!  I was this game and forgot to record it!      I remember in April 2007 it rained for a week straight.  I don't think we saw the sun once.     I saw that ep.  Kevin Costner was the pilot, right?   I've always thought those rooms are for visiting heads of state.  I live near the Four Seasons and it's frequently got so much security outside it looks like an embassy.  I think they actually block off 29th Street from M down to K so they can park their black SUV's.     I was adding traffic and clearing customs and a safety buffer.  3.5 is a little too long, though.   Did you all think she -- Meryl Streep -- was aware of this and adjusted her accent accordingly?  At that point she was known as the queen of accent roles.   Poor thing.  Taking a nap and bam!  Orcas aren't whales though, right?     My God what a crappy movie that turned out to be.  That kind of talent on the screen and they screwed the pooch?   I just don't see anybody stepping into Yul Brynner's shoes.   Over the air and FCC-compliant, I think The Good Wife is awesome.        Gotcha.  Thanks!   I read you all got snow outside of Sydney today.  Oh how I envy you.   So it was basically like a thick US Southern accent?  Deliverance-class thick?    a Lindy Chamberlain accent  I'm intrigued by this.  What's the difference?      WHAT a great story!  If there is ever a top 100 selfies list, this deserves to be in the mix.   Not following you.  Clarify?  What was on the cassette?   Is it just me or does this look like an aluminum GI Joe in a faceplant?    Crappy way to memorialize the fallen.  I guess this is why Scott did it without NASA knowing about it.   I've dined with plenty of Catholics and have never heard a prayer in a public space, especially with a stranger.  It just doesn't happen.  Now if you're having dinner at their home, that's fine.  I'm calling BS.   Those of us in the DC area got completely clobbered by one a few years ago.  I'd never heard the word before that, myself.  I've been through a couple of Cat 1's and dying tropical storms, but have never heard the tree canopy around my house make that much angry noise.  Seriously -- it was caveman-level scarey.  Here's a video taken inside the Jefferson Memorial.  It doesn't fully capture how bad it was:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxMIfVS9d4k   My pleasure.  I once flew KL to Newark via Stockholm, and then a regional flight to National.  I will never do that again.    Stay hydrated!     And this is why I haven't touched tequila since college.   Following that link led me to this:  http://www.plasma2002.com/blenderdefender/  which is possibly the funniest thing in the history of the internets.   Oh it had to be for himself to lounge with the kitties.  My cat only pays attention to TV during Formula 1 races.     On #4: this is in New England?  It sounds like they really needed some company.    How urban was it?  I went to college in Vermont and the rural to the streetlights could change within a hundred yards.   Well that explains that...   Oh Jesus, your jet lag is going to be epic.  Cabs are I think $65 or so to downtown.  For Dulles, the only service is Washington Flyer.  If you can afford that, absolutely take them.  Super Shuttles are less but take longer and are in a van, but also charge per person, so maybe a Flyer is better for two travelling together.  The point is both will carry your luggage with you.  Easy-peasy.    Just ditch your luggage in your room and go wandering.  Just get a hotel within walking distance of the Mall.  Your time is too short to learn the Metro.  If you have lots of money, the Willard is the absolute best choice.  Hotel Harrington is near it and more price-conscious.           Whoa.  I live nearby and haven't heard any sirens all night.     I don't understand -- where are you staying overnight?    Regardless, call the Hotel Harrington.  Stay there if you need a hotel room, but if not, I'm pretty sure they have a baggage room that's amenable to tourists needing to park their bags.  It's right off of the Mall.  Kinda shabby, but perfectly nice.    You're not going to get into the District until 7pm-ish and will need to leave 4pm-ish.  Dulles is way out there.  Take Super Shuttles each way.   Here's the DC Metro.  I couldn't break it out from the site, but press start and you'll see it develop from 1976 until now not unlike Shanghai's.  http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/14214/evolution-of-metrorail-animation-now-with-rush-plus/  Frame of reference: keep your eye on Metro Center, which remains the heart of the system.  It's three blocks east of the White House.  This animation also stops too early.  There's now a Silver Line going into Northern Virginia.   No he's not.  He's just saying he keeps taking roles and working rather than being a prima donna.   He made up for it for the year where he won over Haley Joel Osment.  That was the most gracious acceptance speech I've ever heard.   That Omega looks embarassing.  He had to know.  Omega doesn't make over the top watches like that.   Exactly.  It kind of made a little sad.  Cat's expecting play attacks, the dog's expecting a tug of war over the toy.    I'm sure they later figured out a mutual language to mess with other.   I've met Scots and have had no clue what they were saying.   I'm from SW Virginia but spend a lot of time in the Low Country -- my family has a beach house there.  Frank Underwood definitely sounds to me more like an educated Charlestonian.  I was surprised when I heard that his district was elsewhere.   Meryl Streep in the dingo ate my baby movie?  RDJr in Tropic Thunder?   It's got to be.  There is simply no way to train a cat from entering a room.  They'll engage in a battle of wills and the human will lose every single time.   Emily Lakdawalla is to my mind suddenly becoming THE space reporter of her generation.  Or maybe it's because her name is so cool.  Either way, I read her article anytime I see her byline.     I've never been drawn to hunting but after reading this article about wild boars in Texas, I'd be doing it all the time if I lived there:  http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069/?no-ist   According to this, it's called The Australian:  https://www.iorr.org/talk/read.php?1,1022821,1038034  I think it's in Chelsea.  Edit: Here's some background:  http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/stories-behind-rolling-stones-and-beatles-767074   His agent told the casting director that he'd done Shakespeare.  What he didn't say is that the play had been translated into German.    edit: word   He later played for Harvard.  His roommate?  Al Gore.   The story I heard is that he got this ticket driving around a Porsche 911 that he'd bought with early MS money.  He apparently had a lead foot.     Well his mother was a redhead.  The late also hilarious Anne O'Meara.   I've given up on George Will.  I used to think people saying that he cherrypicks were political opponents, but then he wrote an article about something I had participated in personally, and holy crap he blew it.  Some of the things he said happened not only didn't happen, but could not by federal statute happen.  Simple PACER printouts could refute him.     Plus Lena Headley is heavily tattoo'd.   OMG who would post such pictures?  And where?  I mean there are so many sites like that.   This article sounds like it's right down your alley -- renovation mortgages:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/in-the-market-for-a-home-in-dc-but-dont-have-a-mint-hello-fixer-upper/2015/07/02/f6ff153c-1142-11e5-a0dc-2b6f404ff5cf_story.html    Even if they fail you, you 30 days to fix it.     I grew up in SW Virginia, Roanoke actually, which is at the other end of the Roanoke River.  I remember somebody excavated some helmets of the era near Danville.  The idea was that it's almost conclusive evidence that they moved way inland and assimilated.     Halfway right!   Huggla!    Nice to see Henley still unafraid to send the runner, despite yesterday's first inning.   I was in high school in '79 and don't remember hearing much about Voyager 2.  I knew it was happening though and the pictures were cool.  I know more about New Horizons.  It could be just because I've gotten more interested in the space programs since then, and also I was in a boarding school at the time, so little access to TV.   Cool.  I once drove between those cities.  I didn't know.    It's a super modern three lane comparable to US Interstate.     Mondern Mengeles operate more sublimely in mondern t9mes.   One of the best things about the NYT is how transparent they are at making corrections.  This article however shouldn't have been published in its first form.  It needed the two hours of edit time before release.   How could possibly NOT notice the cheekbones of Carice van Houten?  What, was she wearing too much clothing?  Sexist bastard.  Gilli I'd give you.   Found Ser Meryn Trant...   No kidding!  I knew they were having to uglify her for shooting, but dayum!   Hurley found a stray Dharma food drop and kept it to himself.   Los Angeles + Audi driver going backwards = Hollywood stuntdriver screwing around.  This is some Mission Impossible level driving.   Sometimes the only time I know for certain that I'm not shadowbanned is waking up to a raft of downvotes.   Jesus.  I just went through his comment history and it brings to mind that poor whale in the Pacific whose whale calls can't be heard by other whales.   There's nothing wrong with cross-posting.  In fact it's a good thing.  I don't know how he does it.  But he or his collective has an eye for good stuff.     No, I bet the whole axle needs to be replaced.  You don't want the weakest link to be the point where the tire attaches to it.    I was a little boy in '69 and it must have been awful.  The people looked cool, but you don't know how they smelled.  I remember encountering hippies at the local drugstore and holding my nose -- literally.  They stank.  80's girls had awesome hygiene.    Plus nobody was getting drafted to Vietnam for my generation.  Things were a pressure cooker for kids in '69.  Those were dangerous times.    snapping the axle  I probably should've written "snapping it off of the axle" -- the axle itself is probably OK.  Still, I hope MPD is looking into the circumstances of this incident.  It's got drunk driver written all over it.   Born in '62.  Sucks to be you.  You have no clue how much fun you missed!   Well, not to worry.  It could've been 1980.  That year was mostly the 70's.  The 80's didn't start until the Fall of 1980.  Source: I was there at age 18.   Gotta love the high shorts on the girl to the left.  I think this might be late 70's though.  I grew up in the period.   This is precisely why Sam Altman is on the board.    If he wasn't there, I'd bet reddit would be crashing everytime Anna Kendrick sneezed.   Yeah.  It should be like that Dirty Harry movie where Det. Callahan thought he was being followed by the mob but it turned out they were trying to protect him because if he got killed, some stooge he'd hired to kill the mob boss in case he died got the mob very worried.   My bet is going too fast and hit the curb exactly wrong, snapping the axle.  Looks like it's already got a parking ticket.  Maybe a drunk from last night?  I hope this isn't the tight single lane service road just above the Circle paralleling the tunnel entrance.  A drunk killed a pedestrian there maybe two years ago.     ThingstodoDC.com is absolutely the best if you're into the embassy circuit.  There's much more than that, though.     Me, too.  It'd insufferable, approaching Red Sox draught territory.     **Submission Statement**:  An examination into why parole boards are scared of actually releasing prisoners into parole supervision, with the chilling result that those who serve their sentences in full are released with no supervision at all.      I thought I heard on tonight's broadcast that Sunday starters could volunteer to play, but were not required to.     Here is Bill Murray getting hit by the HR derby ball:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcnVdXV2XzM  Meanwhile, stop walking these guys Blake!   You say that like it's a bad thing.  I'd watch that.   OOOOH that felt great!!!  Espi!!!   Dayum.  They're really into that walk-off sandwich.     He's got a great voice, though.     No it's different.  FP is prone to Yogi Berra malaprops.  This is where we collect them.        Oh so they've got the local team on Fox?  Why the DC crew and not the home Baltimore crew?  Or is FP getting his shot at national fame?  Dayum I'd hate to lose him.    Edit just looked at the time and tuned in.  Yup, there he is!     I've always wondered why the Nats haven't adopted some of the show-stoppers.  You Gotta Have Heart for example is terrific.      Who is the Fox announcing team?  Please be better than the ESPN crew.   I only vaguely remember reddit.com but I think it was a catch-all for items that didn't belong in a specialized r/.  /r/all is everything on reddit.     Making friends with sparrows didn't work out so great for Cersei Lannister.     ... and now I'm hungry.   Is this the same view of where they now have the NYE ball drop?   I had a ceiling just like that, too.  I ran a line of red masking tape down the middle to separate the Pacific planes from the European.    I haven't seen Germany mentioned so a shout-out to it.  The Alps, the Black Forest, the architecture, and all the beer makes it even prettier.   I love travelling there.   I spent a week hiking around Saas Fee once.  Breathtaking.     I think he appeared only in the inaugural season.     Just wanted to stop in and say WAHOOWA!  It's great to have a pair of Virginia grads living large on the internets.  I'd imagine that your colleagues come mainly from the great STEM schools.  Did you ever feel like an outsider amongst them?  Or did your years in Charlottesville perhaps give you a fresh perspective?  Regardless, welcome back.  Your appointment as CEO is the perfect resolution of this sad incident.   That's a fair point.  The first week of sales would be the early adopters who've been anticipating the release.     Give us your strangest personally witnessed story not invovling a dinosaur asking for tree fiddy.   Dunno what to ask you but dayum there are that many Hawaiians in the Northwests?  Now that I think about it -- were you young enough to be there when the grunge thing happened?  Your thoughts and recollections?   I used to doodle mushroom clouds in my elementary school notebooks.  One day, I realized how screwed up this was.  I was so happy when the USSR tanked.  The stress of Mutually Assured Destruction played a key role in messing with us children of the era.     It was a civil war to my mind at the time.  I'm Virginian so the US Civil War surrounded me growing up like oxygen.  Why we stuck our snouts into it eluded me.     I was just kinda/sorta messing with you.  "Student in university" betrays you as being British or Aussie or not American.  So I threw the extra U into favorite for fun.  I grew up in the 70's.  The proxy wars were confounding to my young mind.  I got the domino theory concerns about communism but what I didn't get is why the heck anybody cared about Vietnam.     Favorite war vs. favourite war?   "I'm learning German!  So I can pretend to be a German in Thailand!"   Yup I read Apple's sales dropped 90% this week.   There are specialized flutes that have a little X on the interior base so that the bubbles go up in a straight line.     http://img.ifcdn.com/images/404e157febf98a11f3298fa2cc94441f337eaf3d9c01d0ee785851ad2fdc5f66_1.gif   He's 94.  The man's earned the right to cuss out anybody who annoys him.

He loved it.    He's now running the Firestone vinyards and brewery.     How old are you?  If in college, target your studies to getting a job with USAID.  Those people are amazing.  It's tough work, but rewarding.     Same here.  She's a terrific interviewer.  I sometimes DVR her show when I see a guest I'm interested in will be on.     The only Nats jersey I will ever wear is his.     Carole King's Tapestry.  Perfect from start to finish.        Noah lives in Madison, Wisconsin.   Many thanks!  I should be ashamed of myself as I consider myself a WW2 airplane geek.  Who were the Italian pilots shooting at?  Allies or Axis?      Were you here during Snowmageddon?  I went to college in Vermont and it was an honest Vermont-class snowstorm.  I still think the 1996 blizzard was worse.  Anyhow, when we get clobbered, Chicago's used to the recovery, but we dig out after a few days just OK.   Oh.  Then that's fine.  I get annoyed by American theaters using theatre to make themselves more important-y.   Agreement.  I don't get YouTube fame.   Is your friend named Tommy, Lee, or Junior?   That bikini would be fashionable even today.   Based on this it doesn't seem too funny.  He's basically Rupert Gee without David Letterman in his ear.   Go slow and stay in the right hand lane until you have things figured out.  Yield to traffic in the circle -- those already in it have the right of way.  If you're going around Dupont Circle, just follow the car in front of you and hope for the best.     r/rightiemasterrace    	199
 Disney World Pass   This might be better in /r/AskRedditYesNo  since this is a Yes/No question.   Perhaps people are posting FIFA games because the game is fun. Maybe they didn't pay for the game. FIFA is corrupt..but what am I going to do? Stop watching soccer? Or playing video games? Nope.    Bat country   Oh okay. Still today that is what I learned.    No there is not because the actor(s) don't appear in the film so that is the reason basically. A lot of people wanted scarlette johannsen nominated for "Her" but she wasnt in the film.   No dude. It is not. It is YOUR OPINION. You have already lost because you think an opinion is fact. I know the definition of a fact. What you have stated is not a fact. It is your opinion. Trying to give your opinion weight by calling it a fact is disingenuous    That's not a fact. That is your opinion that it can. It is not FACT.   Opinions can be supported by facts- but what you have said is not a FACT, it is an OPINION. A fact would be listing statistics (ex: The results of the statistics are...) - the opinion would be the interpretation from those statistics which is "Age disparity can create a power imbalance" The key word being "can"   You can keep calling it a fact all you want but it is simply your opinion. Calling it a fact doesn't add any more weight to your sentence. I'm not saying I disagree with your opinion, I agree with it kind of, but it isn't a fact. An opinion is defined as indicating a belief, view, sentiment, conception, which is what you are doing.    It's a common problem people do when they are taking to give more weight to their opinions they say "The fact of the matter is..." or "The fact of..."  They are trying to give more weight to their opinion by stating it as fact- it's not though. It's just an opinion. It's an expression in the English language and a bad habit as it misinforms people to believe the follow statement is fact rather than the opinion that it is.   Now before you argue further, I have a degree in English. I taught literacy and I most certainly know the difference between fact   opinion- but what you have said is not a FACT.   I'm not disagreeing with the content of what you said, it just bothers me when people say something is a fact when it's just their opinion. Kind of like how some people get bothered when someone misspells their, they're, and there.    ? /s   You've never met Tuba Gooding, Jr then. He's the Sousaphone player for The Roots   that's not a fact. that's an opinion.    he gave my keynote at college graduation.    What does wut mean?    I like the thief bit. You can tell he's being punched right at that moment when says thief   Which is ridiculous Andy Serkis was in motion capture suit and acted out the role with wood/astin so they had someone physically there      Because Gollum is considered voice acting.    damn cuccoos.    We call him snowball   It's a damn shame andy serkis couldnt be nominated for an oscar because he did fantastic as Gollum   No..lol It's Santa roasting a potato over a flame roasted fire so I can be unbanned from /r/AskReddit   im with you. I still can't walk in mulch because of the lava monster   instructions unclear. have grizzly bears everywhere.    Maybe.    Yes..congratulations!!!!   Okay. Sure. Lots of things CAN happen, but that isn't representative of ALL.    I don't think so. Some people have questions that are yes/no and close ended questions. Sometimes it's good to see people's explanations for their answers and maybe give the person asking the question some clarity. Of course someone will always be yes or no, but that's okay.    Yes. I have. I live here. That's why I posted it. I don't disagree with what you said.    Yeah I get it, he's a dudebro douche. But regardless it doesn't make him a pedophile       It sounds like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6oXW_YiV6g   I don't know who K Rodgers is.   I said [K-Rogers](https://www.kroger.com/).

[Well it sounds like this probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cun-LZvOTdw)   [EXAMINE FLORIDAS ROMEO AND JULIET LAW](http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/Session/2012/InterimReports/2012-214cj.pdf)    The guy was 21 and she was 17? What's the big deal?   Gas stations, grocery stores, candy stores, malls, amazon, ebay, chocolate stores on the internet,   Reese's website.    K...I'm alive...now pet me human    No. The word 'need' is no where in that sentence.       When I was 15 and worked as cashier if a customer says that was 2.98 and it rang up as like 4.98 or something I always just changed it for them. In fact, any time anybody ever asked or said they thought the price was lower I always lowered it for them.   HAHAHAHAHAH TAKE THAT K-ROGERS   If she asks to meet up for kisses, that's a good sign.    [No...no...no..nooooooooo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV4zcuF2fe8)   Ugh WoW. I have such bad memories of wow. It reminds me of this time I was dating this girl, we'll call her wolverine since she liked to scratch my backs while fucking until my back was bleeding. I didn't mind, but it hurt when I showered.   Anyway, her roommate, we'll call her Cynthia, was dating this guy named Steve who liked to play WoW a lot. No problem there, I played UO and Dark Age of Camelot, I like MMORPGS, we even all used to play Munchkin card game together- lots of fun.   Anyway, The issues I have with WoW are that Steve, when we were all out getting to know each other bowling or some random double date, he says he has to go because there is an all important raid to do.   This is why I dislike WoW. You're out in the real world with your girlfriend who wants to give you some pussy and you have to go on an emergency raid for some random item you might have a chance at getting.      cigarillo    Go smoke a cigarello thugz bunny   Caturday Furbruary 10th, 2016 (but might get pushed back, it's on CAtlantic Records...or maybe never see the light of day)      Haha...proof   geometry jargon !!   probable   Saw this when I signed in... (Also, for you grammar nuts out there he didn't say irregardless ...yay!!)      I'm a Cat Coaster. I also feel vindicated. Winning the battles does help!!   thunder buddies   Wow. So Bush used his own party's racism as a tool to get votes?    or hips   that's crazy    And the dirty tricks...wow. In the 2000 race, when George Bush was running against McCain, Bush's people called up a bunch of voters in the south and told them that McCain had a black baby. It worked, support for McCain plummeted.  What? lol    pretty sure Bone Thugs were among the first rappers to sing/rap together in the early to mid 90s and become successful off of it.    Oh so they fake executions? And then they finally do it for real   I just like MMLP because he absolutely destroys ICP, almost the entire album. It's hilarious.    I liked No Love    interesting.       Why don't people who are about to have their heads sawed off fight back and put up a struggle? They're going to die anyway, why not try and cause some havoc?   these comments remind me of the everyone here is a bot except you fiasco    makes sense.    That's what I thought. I thought he was setting someone up for a run.    Well they got Axum right in Africa with Christianity.    Oh nice memory foam! I was going to say those cushions look terribly uncomfortable. That's a wonderful job you guys did on that.   How wide is it? If he is 6.1'' and can lay down with legs stretched, it is about 6 feet wide?    How is that possible is there a bed? I didn't see a picture of the bed when it's complete can you upload one? Or have someone lay in it for scale?    interesting you would have figured seaosn 7-9 the newer season would have been first      I started watching some of my favorite Season 3 episodes and I noticed it's widescreen now, it fits my entire television screen, and the quality isn't as fuzzy. When did this happen? I thought they only had Season 1 as HD   It's pretty gross, I'll admit.I keep thinking that when your father was 24, she wasn't even an idea yet.    You think he's damaging them or making them look better?    Is he, by being so out there and insulting John McCain for being captured, being so out there and insane that when people look at the rest of the candidates they look awesome? Is that the tactic he is using here to help the GOP or something? It confuses me.    It's important to express your feelings in a healthy way to your father. Let him know how you feel about this and your concerns. It's okay to judge people, it's natural, but I would wait to meet her first. Does your father have a lot of money or something?    out of curiosity, can you sleep in there? Or is it too small?       it's not cheating...because ITS YOUR DOG ....GET IT!?!?!?!?!   Booooo Wendy Boooooo    Um ...no it's interspecies erotica    Boooooo   What? lol. I was being sarcastic. I was saying "Good job for looking for for all the misspellings out there [on reddit]. I upvoted you for it, buddy. It is hard work fixing everyone's grammar these days."   Most people can spot whether a word should be plural or singular. I was making fun of you for pointing it out. I do not need to go to school for grammar, I teach it. I'm also not a stickler about it in unprofessional settings when I know what the person meant.    I feel like whenever someone goes against the grain they get upvoted.    sounds like a mild coincidence    Holy Crap that's my Pepe! I originally posted it to /b/   Looking out for all the misspellings out there. I upvoted you buddy. It's hard work.     Just because random white guy A wears anything with a confederate battle flag doesn't mean he's a racist or ignorant bigot  Yeah it does. Well, I don't know anything about the media...I don'thave cable but I've always not liked the Confederate Flag, I respect people's right to have one, but if I see someone with one I pretty much assume they are racist. Kind of like seeing a guy with a Nazi tattoo on him. I pretty much think he's a racist asshole.    Yeah I'm just not gonna play till they fix it.    Had this problem with last splatfest. 6 out of my first 10 matches my team had someone disconnect or the other team did. I had this problem with splatfest on the 5th of July as well. Not sure what's wrong with Splatoon but I don't think I can play splatfest anymore, sorry team rollercoaster!!   It's just too frustrating.    Yeah I just won 25-0 for roller coaster so i wouldnt say water is maiming    427,238   No i wont.    Well you can't play the extra bonus levels if you use it i dont think ? or there's something you can't get if you use it.    What's the regular leaf in the game called then?    Ahh..didn't know it was called that. Is it a cheat if the game provides it? I don't think it's bad. I never used because if you use it you can't get certain bonus things to open up.    Was unaware it was called Tanooki suit. Why is it called that name? I never used it. But I did die enough for one a few times haha.    427,236    I don't get it.    are used for.   Some statistics are sure...not all, but what you're doing is making a racist generalization based on statistics. I use statistics in my job as a school counselor and not for generalizations...not in any way.    I'm watching Season 3 in HD right now though on Netflix.    It's more a stereotype and you're making a generalization based on statistics. Most importantly, we don't even know if that is his dad lol.    One of my earliest memories of playing video games was playing Tecmo Bowl and soon after Super Tecmo Bowl. In Super, it was the only game i could have the Browns win the Super Bowl, which I know will never happen in real life because of God.   Anyway, I used to play my brother in Tecmo Bowl ALL THE TIME. Every day after school, Tecmo Bowl. Homework done? Tecmo Bowl. Can't sleep? Tecmo Bowl. I also had a black and blue arm for about a year of my life playing this game because every time I scored points my brother would punch me as hard as he could for every point I scored to deter me from winning the game or scoring points. He was five years older than me. I was conditioned into thinking I'd be punched for scoring points. So much so that when I grew older and tried to play Madden online I'd flinch if I scored a field goal or touchdown against someone.   At this time, this is when I realized that people suck and there is no hope. So I played RPG's instead. Where I could solve puzzles instead of scoring touchdowns. This is my story of Tecmo Bowl. And fuck you Joseph.    **TL;DR   Brother punched me for scoring points. Fuck you Joseph.**    Yeah that's what the new Wii U Mario World 3D game is like. If you die enough in a row you can get the super leaf. It doesn't make you invincible and you can still die, BUT, it does help you out immensely so you can beat the level.   Still Super Mario World 3D is probably one of the better Mario Games.    There's a book of them if you google this passage you'll see results for a google book with stories like this.    There are a few versions of this story I've read. The other version I remember has a note pinned on the dog which says, "You are the owner." Meaning the owner has Alzheimer's and someone has been helping take care of the dog for him, but it always returns to him every day.    blocked   A good example of machinima would be South Park's Make Love, Not Warcraft where part of the story was done using Warcraft.   I would love to be able to use this with Ocarina of Time or other games like MegaMan in my counseling and large group teaching lessons.   Using story invention as a way to help students retain information is wonderful I think. A lot of people knock on those who spend too much time with video games but it can be a great way to teach students.       Uhh...no   what's happening   I am bi   Yes   No. Anal sex doesn't feel good to some- those on the receiving end of it.    For some people, it doesn't feel good or they just don't like it.    I [already have](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delightfullychubby/comments/3bm78w/brian_12_years_old_24_pounds_of_awesome/) a few weeks ago :)    I was ways tell women that.  ....what?   ....why didn't he stop fucking with them then? Obviously, this case is a bit ridiculous for going to court, but fuck...when someone tells you to leave them alone i don't understand why people don't just drop it.    Oh okay. It's just I remember my elementary science teacher told me once when a kid asked what Pluto was like she said, "Ice mountains and ice everywhere"    my cat loves me. fat lovable fur thing. he's too fat to run away. he has to cuddle me when i want. HAHAHAHAHA ^^^^^HAHAHAHAHAHAHA   They said, "Who would have supposed that there were ice mountains?" project scientist Hal Weaver said. "It's just blowing my mind."  I don't understand this. I thought we've known for a while that Pluto was icy because of its far distance from the Sun, so wouldn't it be normal to assume there were ice mountains on Pluto? I mean, I'm assuming lots of people thought this. Was he joking or being sarcastic?    Well, why would you have to get Plan B if you were gardening the Butt?   My pharmacy Plan B is only 50$ :)    [because no one has posted it yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3JkCCQ2EFY)   What have I got in my pocket?    Yeah. But one of the co-founders when he first started the site, /u/spez, banned racist/homophobic stuff. So, one of the founders is again CEO of Reddit, and he's pretty much telling you this is how it's going to be, tough shit. There's nothing wrong with that- it's his site, he made it he can do with it what he wants.    Song of Storms sounds like Game of Thrones       I originally commented that you should have left Reddit. I would like to apologize and say that Reddit users got the best of me. I like what you did with Reddit.    But you didn't sit this one out. You just stood up and put yourself in....   they got a penny from you.    /u/spez banned racist/homophobic shit when they first started reddit...im not sure how this is different   The co-founder can do whatever he wants.   I saw it. Mine doesn't.    sometimes i go to shadow, get hover boots, then go to spirit.   	134
    I'm from the era of the chess pit, gypsy bar and impact records.   My mum told me that "Canberra has Melbourne style cafes and laneways now."  Nice try mum.   Same reason I moved to Victoria.      Me too. He's a great actor.   Perhaps she's suffering from a case of the Vince Vaughns?  Vaughn did a lot of great work until Wedding Crashers was a hit and then he became the go to schlub next door and churned out crap like Four Holidays, Couples Retreat, Fred Claus, The Watch etc.    She's being pushed into wacky broad comedies (Identity Theft, Tammy, Spy) when she's actually a talented actress. (Gilmore Girls, Bridesmaids, St Vincent.)     I never liked her.   This is the first film adaptation that will suffer from a faithful adaptation. Otherwise we're looking at 2.5 hours of Matt Damon doing math.   It doesn't matter. OP suggest feminism was a joke. I.e. it's dumb. The rest of thread made it seem that feminism proved him a wrong. i.e. he learnt something from it.  It could have been anything really.    The joke is that the original poster implied with his one word post that "Feminism" is a "joke."  The three posters below twisted his attempt to change it's meaning.   "unpleasant"  Yes!    I'd like my site to feature only SOME tweets from my twitter count so that my website is only filled with useful tweets.  Is there a way to make the site only stream tweets from my account that use a particularly hashtag?    I'd described them as awful people rather than terrible.

I might buy a $20 replacement Australian Behringer transformer just in case.    I have a BEHRINGER Podcastudio which I bought online. I've just realised it is a Japanese model which is 100 volts.

Looks great. Hope it finds an audience.    Don't know. Insensitive comments?    That sucks. When I was teenager, my hair was a big part of my identity and, as I slowly lose it, I feel a real loss of control over my body. It's not vanity, it's just a sense you can't make decision about how you look.  I can't imagine what it feels likes at your age.  If you've still got eyebrows etc. I would consider growing a beard. All my female friends agree that that look is fucking hot.   If that's not an option, I'd look a various hat options but I would try and avoid making it look like you're trying to hide it.   Depending on your head shape, have a look at glasses as an option to break up your face.        I'd love an open world game in which you get to play a cat, bounding across roof tops, escaping dogs, stealing food.      Five years ago quoting an Arcade Fire song would have gotten you run out of town on by an anti-hiptster lynch mob...   Best answer in the thread right here.   There is strong sense to define yourself as 'other' in a hipster community. I listen to this obscure music because I do not listen to mainstream music.       It's already posted in this thread but check out the hipster relativism comic.    I forgot about him. He's the worst.    Hipsters discover music, food, fashion and make all the stupid mistakes so we don't have to.   They're mostly harmless, at worst snobby but usually quite friendly.  Why all the hate?  TL;DR Answers from the thread.  1) They are pretentious and snobby toward non-hipsters  2) They a parasitic, consuming instead of creating.  3) They create small, exclusive cultural ghettos.  4) There behaviours are based social pressure and not real love or passion for a topic.  Full Disclosure: I have a beard.   I'm more concerned about the fact that it is 11 films in and we STILL haven't seen the Thanoscopter.  http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/thanos-copter.jpg   It's also contributes the myth of the hyper sexualised pre-teen who 'tricks' the older man.   It's the same story told in Lolita and, to a lesser extent, American Beauty.  (although, in American Beauty, he realises she is a child before it is too late.)  It's a defense used by pedophiles the world over.   I have real misgivings about the church scene.   I rewatched Leon: The Professional at the behest of you guys. That movie has barely dated at all.  I find the sexualisation of Portman very uncomfortable, particularly knowing she received A LOT of 'fan' mail after the film came out.   Al Pacino in The Devil's Advocate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGR4SFOimlk   Just The Two Of Us.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WamkRSDeD8   This is something I really struggle with. I work at a lot of Bar Mitzvah's and it is very rare I come across a kid who is even close to being an adult. In fact, being labled as adults so early seems to turn them into immature little shits.  Can someone explain it to me?    Fist?   I wish I loved anything in this world as much as you love Ice Age.  And I have an 18 month old daughter.   Raiders is very much inspired by Quartermain so I can't imagine it holding up in court.      Watch The Road Warrior first. If she likes it, show her Mad Max followed by Thunderdome.  The first film is a low budget ozplotation classic and not a reflection of the series as a whole. It's very much a product of it's time and place.    The Departed! Both great films.   The original is fantastic.   God yes! Both films are excellent.   Is it really a remake? Or just a homage?     There's three remakes of that one isn't there?   I loved the original 1988 Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDA0K_dIhxk  Ocean's 11 has all but killed the memory of the Rat Pack original.  The 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers is way better than the 1956 original.  Same with True Grit, The Fly and John Carpenter's The Thing, that all outshine their 1950's originals.  There's also a tonne of French films that have been surpassed in popularity (if not quality) by their originals. True Lies, The Bird Cage, Three Men and a Baby and Down and Out in Beverly Hills.      King Solomon's Mines is a pearler. There's half a dozen film versions dating back to 1937 but my favourite has always been the post Raiders of the Lost Ark with Richard Chamberline (the first Jason Bourne) and a very young Sharon Stone.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7VEheWX2tg     I'd watch the shit out of that.   John and Joan Cusack in Grosse Point Blank. Ben and Casey Affleck in Shakespeare in Love The Wayans Brothers in pretty much everything....   Unlike tekylasunrise who will be in our memories forever.   YOU'RE delightful and charming.   Winona Ryder as...spock's mother?   Check out this version of Brock:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YDYL6oECjU   Ah, I'm just razzing ya.  Enjoy the movie.    How can you be a full grown male if you use words like "beta" and "Nickelback"?     I have no idea! It's quite thick but soft.   What colour dress shoes for a midnight blue suit?   Thinner cotton would wrinkle easier yes?    That's a good point. They wrinkle around the buttons so they might be straining.      You mean *without* right?   Being a bit larger a wrinkled shirt looks terrible on me, particularly around the buttons.   I have a superfine cotton shirt that doesn't easily wrinkle.   http://www.turnbullandasser.co.uk/white-herringbone-superfine-shirt-229  Any other hints?   How does that work with public liability insurance and workers comp?    The Late Show (australia) from 1993.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3ENQT3le7k  (all of the jokes are horribly dated and very Australian)   Yeah, I know Brian a little. :)   He's more of a magic teacher than I am.   I prefer the history and writing. http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22404984-chasing-the-ace  Plus, he has better hair.   Richard Linklater sure did.   Boyhood.     God yes. And such a cynical attempt at hipster cred.   I am a professional magician, published author and collector of on cons and scams and that movie offended me as all three.     Good luck with that.   You should hang out with my Jewish friends. I've never heard them agree on any subject.   Some form of religion is practiced by the vast majority of this planet. The idea that, regardless of the validity of their beliefs, that those people get no sort of benefit from their rituals and practices is hard to believe.  These rituals, ideas and beliefs were not created by a magical man in the sky but by real people with real needs and desires.   The stories we tell and create reflect who we are as people. The evil that religions do is created by people, as is the good.            Brilliant. Thanks.   Getting together with your people who are NOT your friends and family on a weekly basis.   Brilliant. Thanks.    I don't think anyone asked you to.    They're under no obligation to be objective so long as the facts are there. It's not a news story. It is the story of that man's life and struggles.     What kind of nuance do you want?   I regretted it as soon as I clicked submit.      How so?   What was that old Atari game with the little cars on the tracks? Like Mashed two decades earlier.   I want 15 friends      Thanks! I've been pronouncing it Tree-el.   Would I stress the TREE or the LAY?   It's the spanish name for the Shell Game.  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trile   I was obsessed with the Empire Records soundtrack as a teenager. I hated the film and everytime someone calls it 'our generations Breakfast Club' I want to punch them.   I'm not sure. All the actors have American accents though.   FCUK t-shirts are often 2 x $40 and they're great quality. They last longer than cotton on.   Wow. That became a thing quickly   Mr Nice Guy was shot in Melbourne.  It's not the most famous film (that would be Ghost Rider or On The Beach) but it is just so clearly my city that I get great pleasure in watching Chan destroy it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUEWCf3IJN4   At the end of the film, we see that so much of his problem with Marla is in his own head and that he's actually been in a relationship with her the whole time.  He's made her into the villain in his own delusional way.   No shoes, no service?   I never said the movie wasn't any good! It always though it was a brilliant piece of satire.  I'm sure the redpill and MRA douchnozzles are trying their darnedest to find some sense of male identity. But, like so many douchenozzles before them they are doing so by creating an imaginary enemy.   In my day, you just jerked off and played Doom until three in the morning. But these pricks, that's some tyler durden level delusion.   EDIT: Never mind. Had a look at your profile. I didn't realise how deep down the rabbit hole you were. I hope you find some peace in the world and work through your problems without hurting too many people along the way. All best.          There's part of me that wants to be Ron Swanson. My wife wants me to be Andy.  We both have to accept I'm Ben   I prefer the film's ending. The book feels like a cop-out.   what was the point, to your mind?         Ooh, you're right. I just spent the last hour reading about the imitation game!    no one! It's closing in a fortnight!    http://bcove.me/fny660bo   They did yes.   By the time we reach the end any resemblance to the Turing Test is long gone.    Not really. A turing test requires the tester to know there is a machine. The pilot had no reason to doubt her humanity.   Technically, there was never a proper Turing Test.  The tester is supposed to know that there is 50/50 chance they are talking to a machine and be fooled.   Caleb always knows she is a machine and so it could never be such a test.   I was also fascinated by the gender politics of it. All of the humans were men and all of the robots were women.    I was more fascinated by Kyoko and what her story was. Why did she stab Nathan? Did she understand her surroundings? Why did she peel of her skin for Caleb?  I found her far more interesting than Ava.   Also, a better dancer.   I kind of wish we had Fight Clubs in basements instead of the whiny shits of the MRA, Gamergate and PUA communities trying to assert their masculinity in the pettiest of ways.   Wall Street (1987) inspired a generation of brokers. Micheal Douglas is approached by people daily who say he inspired them. :\   I always thought it was a satire, poking fun at modern masculinity and consumer culture. Today, in an age of MRA and redpills and rapey frat boys it is more relevant than ever.  But I know so many young men who take it seriously. Much like the stockbrokers who love Wall Street or gangsters who quote Goodfellas.       Where did you see it?   A new film about being a geek from some of the coolest people in the world.   More empire state buildings!   If someone is going to be executed, then they should be executed. It's a brutal and barbaric form of punishment that solves nothing.

 Or a golden tuffalo.   I think the real question here, is why aren't trolls our first army?  For me, it was cost. I was able to get around 75 points of Cygnar *and* about 75 points of Dwarves to go with them for about the same price as a 50 point troll list. As fun as trolls looked, when you don't know what is really worth what getting into the game, it's hard to make that kind of commitment.   After a while, though, trolls just become irresistible. For me, they are the only "comical" faction, so they were really the only choice in the end. I mean [this](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/file/view/pyg-keg-carrier.jpg), [this](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/file/view/blitzer.jpg/32362787/blitzer.jpg), and [these](http://privateerpress.com/files/products/trollbloods/solos/whelps.png) are pretty much must-haves for me, even if I didn't play the game.  Oh, and let's not forget, we have [Troll Moses](http://privateerpress.com/files/imagecache/product_image/products/Runebearerp.png).  These are models I'd buy even if I wasn't a fan of Warmachine. Being a fan of Warmachine means that I get to use them in a tournament to kick your ass.   Point costs in Warmachine are based on sort of the "big picture" of the miniatures abilities. Warmachine is a game of synergy, and the stats on one model aren't really representative of the power it brings to the table.   Also, not every ability is going to be worth the same amount of points to different models. For instance, a back-up ranged weapon on a mostly melee model is going to be a lot different if they have decent RAT than if they have garbage RAT. Or if they are super slow and it actually gives them several solid inches over charging, or if they are in a faction with tons of range buffs, etc.   This is not to say that they do this perfectly by any means. But it does mean that they can control the power of a model much better, because they can test it, see it in action, and then assign a point value based on it's performance in game, rather than needing to perfectly price every ability in the game (which is not possible anyway).  Also, Warmachine doesn't allow you to build custom stats for models, so there isn't a need for it.   It's a sort of "trouble" for your character, something that drives them to keep working, something that is essential for that Firefly-style *rogues in space* game. But, not only can you use it to tie their character to the world, it also is an actual score.   Say you have an obligation of Family, which is that you have ties to your family and you have to spend time taking care of family things. You have a number to go with that, let's say 30. You add your number together with the other players' numbers, and the GM rolls an obligation check for the session. If it fall within your range, *your* obligation is an issue that session.   The book recommends that this is just you stressing out about your family (which is represented by effecting your dice rolls), and not necessarily having specific issues coming up, but I like having little side quests that deal with that character when I can fit them in.  I don't just use obligation for Star Wars either. I've use it any time I need to give the characters a reason to work, like when they are mercenaries in Iron Kingdoms, or P.I.'s in a noir game.   edit: Oh, and I forgot, your obligation score can go up or down as you play. Do a big side quest to take care of that family? Your obligation goes way down, and you're not as worried about them for a while. Been blowing them off for months? Your obligation score is going to get higher and higher, demonstrating the strain of worrying about it it's causing you. You can even get new obligations. Make a deal with a cartel for future "favors"? They get added as a new obligation that can be managed, but never really goes away.   I might as well set up a direct deposit for my paycheck into PP's account at this point.   Obligation from Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, and the playing card initiative from Savage Worlds.   [Ramshackle games](http://www.ramshacklegames.co.uk/) is a pretty cool little miniatures company. It mostly deals in post-apocalyptic minis. They have a lot of really cool stuff, especially the vehicles. A nice bonus is they have free world-wide shipping.   I've gotten some great stuff from [Cobblestone Castings](http://www.copplestonecastings.co.uk/range.php?range=FW) before as well.   [ThunderChild Miniatures](http://www.tcminiatures.co.uk/) is a super small, super focused company that recently did a kickstarter for a wargame based on their stuff, [Wasteman](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2032267828/wasteman-a-game-of-desperate-conflicts-in-a-desola/description).   I'm also a bit in love with [Bombshell Miniatures'](http://www.bombshellminis.com/search/label/Counterblast) Counterblast line.   On the upside there, their all-in-one box is coming out in a couple months, which gives op time to pre-order one.   Well, 1" = 6', and I've known several people who have just used a grid. I personally can't stand grids, but to each their own.   One thing I do, is stop measuring. Just eye-ball it, and if it looks like it's in range, it is. You don't actually need minis, or measuring tape, or anything like that, but I usually use minis just because I like the easy reference of relative distance and position.   What combat systems are you used to? I can probably give a 100% conversion guide if you wanted if I knew what you were looking for.   It might be a copy-paste of the wargame, but the wargame is just a copy-paste of D D3.0 (shhhh, don't tell anyone), though it's actually streamlined quite a bit.  But I've ran IK-Fate, Cypher System IK, the old 3.0 IK, and the new IKRPG, so let me know what you need.   I'm just here to second recommendations for anything Cypher System related, like [Numenera](http://www.numenera.com/), [The Strange](http://thestrangerpg.com/), or even the upcoming generic [Cypher System](http://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook/) book.   I'd argue, but I think you aren't talking about tabletop rpgs, which is what this subreddit is for.   See for yourself: The free quickstart stuff is [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery).  If you want to check out Full Metal Fantasy instead, its free quickstart stuff is [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf).  I love it, but it's not for everyone. It's an expensive book, but it's also huge, and beautiful, and full of great stuff; exactly what you'd expect for the money.  It's a fully standalone product, and you don't need any other books to play. However, it's also compatible with all the other IKRPG books. I'm running a FMF game, and Unleashed is basically an enormous Monster Manual for me.   It does indeed stand alone.   I've heard of the setting for Eclipse Phase a while, and I've known I like the premise. I finally started seriously sitting down with the books trying to learn the system (so I can run it).   How do you people do it? I've got the books downloaded (ordered a few of the hard copies, and ordering more when I get paid again), and playing the game isn't that bad. It seems pretty much like BRP or any % based system really as far as mechanics go.   But the character creation, jeez. It took me about 3 hours to make a character *by rolling randomly for everything on tables*. I didn't even take the time to pick and choose anything, just rolled a number and wrote down what I got. For my typical group, it's going to take me months to get each of them a character set up (especially when one asshole is going to work up a character, see what someone else made, and then change his mind).   Granted, I'm probably going to start out by just throwing pre-mades at them, but at some point we'll have to sit down and work up characters, and I don't know how we'll get through it.   Is this like, some sort of ["Great Filter"](http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Great-Filter1.png), done as a joke by the designers to keep filthy casuals out of the game?  I tried to think about converting the game to another system to make it simpler, but damn I'd lose more than half the substance of the game in the process.   I love this kind of thing, but don't count on your players loving it. In fact, I've had quite a few be absolutely pissed. And that was in an instance where it was a subtle difference, one that didn't actually affect anything beyond their perceptions of things.  On the other hand, I've done it and had everyone love it. In fact, some of the players from that game still say it's the best they've ever played in.   One big difference between the two was the successful one was with friends, the other was with pickup people. When people trust you, and are willing to forgive you a bit, it makes it a lot more successful.   Well, I know I've kind of lost interest in books and movies, but that has a lot to do with the social aspect of RPGs. I'm getting to the point now that anything worth doing, is worth doing with friends.   Gamma World can go this way, especially the most recent official edition.  Also, /r/StraighttoVHS/ is pretty awesome for silly games.   I'd say your analogies are pretty close. I'm mostly a Deadzone guy, and one of the nice things about it is that it has some boardgame-like qualities that make it a lot easier to just pick up and play with friends who don't know anything about it. You can have a lot of fun with just the base game set if you wanted to get a taste for Mantic's stuff, and they have a lot of crossover with their models (you can use some Dreadball stuff in Deadzone, and I think most Deadzone stuff can be used in Warpath).   Iron Kingdoms. In fact, put it on there twice, once for Full Metal Fantasy, and once for Unleashed.  You are going to have a lot of fun. I'd do this too, except I've pretty much been doing this my whole life.   Cypher system is best system. Seriously. You can check out Numenera or The Strange that's out right now.   All the time.   Every once in a while, I'll have an idea that just blows my mind, and I'll go with that instead, but if not, I tend to make better characters when I'm working with randomly generated parts.  I think [restrictions fuel creativity](https://joblivious.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/restrictions-fuel-creativity-and-thats-why-stealth-games-were-invented/), and making truly unique and special characters is actually easier when you are given the components to a character, rather than picking them out yourself.   It's especially fun when you roll up two conflicting things. I play Iron Kingdoms, and one time I was rolling up a character to play, and I rolled a Fellcaller Mage Hunter (Fellcallers are exclusively Trollkin, and Mage Hunters are exclusively Elven). Instead of scrapping the idea and trying again, I thought about maybe a Trollkin's kriel was attacked by spellcasters, and so he trained to kill those kinds of people (maybe even was trained by an Elf Mage Hunter, which is an interesting relationship that GMs love for players to have). Then I thought, maybe an Elf found that they had a unique ability of "screaming like a banshee". They could possibly be the only elf who has ever had this ability. How and why could be a mystery left up to the GM. Maybe they were some kind of arcane experiment, or maybe all races are capable of it, but it's extremely rare, or maybe he was possessed by an actual banshee. These are all really amazing character ideas, that give the GM lots of opportunities to tie my character to the world, and none of them would be possible if I just made a character normally.   Also, even for stats, I like random generation. Something people forget is that the dice can tell a story. If I put the stats where I think they should go, the character is probably going to be pretty predictable. If I roll randomly, all of a sudden my charismatic bard is also a weightlifter, or maybe he's "adorably" clumsy. Instant character traits that make him unique, without me having to do anything but look at the stats.  Some people are like, "Yeah, but what if I roll something I don't like? I'm not going to want to play that for a long campaign." Play that character even harder than you would other characters then. Story time: A friend and I were playing in someone's game who had us randomly roll for stats, in order. I rolled amazing, my friend rolled garbage. My friend wanted to reroll, but everyone agreed before hand that that wasn't going to be a thing. So instead, my friend had his character charge in every combat, figuring that when he died, he'd get to make a new character. Except he couldn't die. Not by the rules, the rules definitely said it was possible for him to die. But every time he got shot up in combat, he managed to roll for some kind of disability instead (which was hilarious). Some of the other party members even ended up dying, but his character just became this grizzled, crazy, deathwish-having sonovabitch that was more machine than man. His character had a reputation as being fearless, and a badass, and it was only about a month of playing before my friend started saying how much he loved his character. If he had gotten the rolls he wanted, he probably would have just stayed in the back, and not had near as much fun.   Is that going to happen every time? No, but if it doesn't, you die and make a new character. Make their story as great as it can be and then move on.     I have a decent amount of terrain from Warmachine that I use sometimes. I also have a ship-ish thing I built for my group (they were pirates, so they needed a ship).  If you are looking for absolutely beautiful and easy to transport terrain, the [Unleashed Adventure Kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit) has some amazing map tiles, though they are pretty much exclusively wilderness. I've actually been using the forest tiles from this in my Warmachine games because I haven't gotten around to making any yet. The new boardgame, [The Undercity](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/board-games/the-undercity) is coming out next month, and it will probably have some great city based tiles to use. Both have a lot of great minis to use too.   For Steampunk: Iron Kingdoms RPG is amazing. There's lots of rules "crunch", but it's also very streamlined. Combats are usually fast and deadly. The world is probably my favorite published setting of all time. There are two free quickstart adventures available for it [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery).   For Sci-Fi: [The Strange](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129405/The-Strange-corebook) is pretty awesome. It's a rules light game (though crunchier than most rules light games) and it's simple base mechanic makes running it as the GM a breeze (a joy, even). The premise of the setting is that the players are travelers through other dimensions, and they take forms appropriate to the worlds they find themselves in, along with new and different powers.   Kinda trying to run before you can crawl, arntcha?   Numenera/The Strange/Cypher system. It's my favorite system for running games, and is probably the crunchiest of the games that will make it into this thread (still a really light system, just not as light as others).   I have an MMA fighter/trainer friend who was working on a system exactly like you are talking about. It's really good, but I don't know if he'll ever finish it. I'll ask him if he has a current version of his rules that he's alright with being out on the web.  There aren't any super good martial arts games out there that don't go into the extremely abstract rules-lite style.    I would run it using The Strange, but that's me. They are even going to have some starship rules in Worlds Numberless and Strange (not out yet, but soon).   It was shortly after they released the reprint, any that weren't new were going for almost nothing.   The rules are plenty simple. It's also pretty simple to see this was a bad idea to make. It's *not* simple to make light of the massacre of innocent people. Or terrorism.   You are genuinely making the world a worse place than you left it. Is that really who you want to be? The guy who takes his shittiness and hands it out to other people? I mean, I get it, you probably have a mental disorder, which is a symptom of the life you've had, but get some help. Not all therapists are very good, but a great one can do amazing things to help. Medications can be hit or miss, but there are a lot of different ones to try, and you might get lucky and have one work for you.  I know you probably don't want pity, because you're angry, but I feel bad for you.   If you are talking about a video game maker, you are in the wrong sub.   That high? Really? I remember when I was looking to sell mine and they were going for about $4 a piece.   Are you not in USA? Cause that would explain a lot.   The Cypher System (Numenera/The Strange) have a nice system for this sort of thing. So does IKRPG.    "simple"   I'm thinking about combining it with [The Strange](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129405/The-Strange-corebook), and having different players exist in different recursions. Eventually they'll be able to pull each other into their own world, but at first they'll only be able to travel there through "visiting".   I'm glad I'm not the only one with this idea. It's interesting to see it in Storyteller, as I'm not super familiar with that system.   I had a homebrew rules system that did something like what you are talking about.   Everyone had 3 "hit points". You could soak damage point-for-point, or you could lose any and all remaining points to completely avoid an attack (as long as you had at least 1 to lose). By taking a round to "regroup" you could get them all back, but you had to be behind cover, or otherwise out of reach of your enemies (sometimes two melee people would just step back, and both take an action, it was cool as hell). I also allowed you to spend a point to add a die to a roll (it was a d6 system), as it represented pushing yourself to the limit.   I'm just being a smartass. It depends on the light around you, both sources of light and things that are reflecting light. You only gave two qualifiers, so it's hard to give you a real answer.    Does [this](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/storymaker-best-hubble-space-telescope-images-20094-514x268.jpg) answer your question?   I'm a huge fan of Fate. I just can't play it on its own, or with certain people.    You are kind of talking about two different things.   Percentage health is a hit point system where everyone has 100 hit points.  Also, hit points are perfectly realistic if you stop thinking of them as physical damage done to the person. Hit points are an abstraction that represents dodging out of the way of attacks at the last second, scrapes, bumps, and even just energy level. You don't actually take *real* damage until you hit 0 hit points. Most games explain it this way, but it's glossed over.   This means that any attack is potentially lethal, since it's about getting a person to go from 1 hp to 0 hp (or -1, or whatever for the system).   If you just want a more lethal system, lower the number of hit points or don't have hit points increase with level, depending on the system.  I actually think the Star Wars d20 system handled this really well with its Vitality/Wound system. Stars Without Number is a good example of a normal hit point system that is pretty lethal. Fate is actually really good about this, changing the meaning of what damage is. IKRPG is a great lethal game with a better representation of the abstract nature of hit points. The Warhammer40k roleplay games do this pretty well. Numenera/The Strange does this well, and really gets the idea across that hit points =/= damage by letting you spend them to boost your actions. I've made a couple homebrew systems that do this really well too.  Oh, and RuneQuest (or BRP or whatever it's called) does it pretty well too.  Really the only game that sucks at this sort of of thing is D D 3 or 4, and only because hit points bloat to ridiculous levels really quickly.   I did the opposite. The players destroyed the world and when they rolled up new characters, I made them play in the destroyed world.  	41

If you can get a decent differential between renting out your main place and renting an efficiency, it can be a pretty sweet arrangement.  I know that couple, and even though they do not need to do that because of fiscal hardship, it is still a really great way to monetize their home.  Just look at how much your house would rent for vs how much you could rent a one bedroom for.    I know you live in a cheap COL area, but I know people that are grossing an extra 2k/month from this if they have a nice house.  That would give you a lot more cash flow and equity on your home, even just in a few years.            This is a huge achievement.

Your mother is so corpulent, when she sits around the magnificantly appointed Tuscan villa, she sits *around* the magnificantly appointed Tuscan villa.   Not a lawyer, but I like stepping in.  Parents are charged with the upbringing of their children. Making sure they are safe, don't leave the house at night, that they go to school, etc.  Because of this certain rights normally afforded to persons are less available.  Children have the right to free speech, without much interference from the government, but certain speech (like standing on your desk and cussing out the teacher) is disruptive to other students. As such, you may be punished for such behavior.  But parents have the right to punish for practically any behavior, as long as that punishment is not abusive. If you don't want your child to say the word "moist", you can tell them no dessert when they say it. You can also refuse to let them wear certain brands of clothing, certain styles, or makeup,  as it is up to you to raise them properly.  You should probably sit down with your child at some point to calmly explain why you don't want them to wear a Marilyn Manson shirt, though.  As for privacy, they have certain reasonable expectations of privacy, such as not being watched while they shower or not putting sensors on their bed to see if they have a lover with them or other creepy stuff. But you have to be able to do things like see if they are hiding pornography or drugs, and many parents do things like laundry and cleaning, so going through his underwear drawer every once in a while is allowable. Promise him that you will treat him more like an adult and limit such searches to when you have a reason to think something is wrong.  Tell him that you can't allow him to lock the door with anything more than a privacy lock (like they have on bathrooms, where you can unlock it with a coin or something), just in case you need to help him, and promise that you won't barge in needlessly.  You son will want more and more privacy from you, especially as he matures into sexuality, and it is your job to make sure he understands that you will give it to him within reason.  ~ a son of a single mother, who probably made her just as tired as yourself   If we are number 2, I weep for the rest of the country.   Actually, it's a wearable suit, so it is basically 1:1   [I like you, Joker!

Technically coffee is much cheaper. I'd be more angry if they were to charge me $9 on the off chance I want a latte, but I don't drink coffee, so there is that aspect.   I'll be honest. I've never actually seen how much the tanks of CO2 and the bags of syrup cost.  I wasn't privy to operating costs at the restaurant, and the hotel I work now (where I do see a lot of these expenses) doesn't order fountain sodas.  Http://Pdco.com/node/88289 uses a $50 estimate for a 5 gallon Bag in a Box, but they forget to include the carbonation.  Their estimate is that a 5 gal BiB will yield ~3780 oz, at a total cost of 1.32 cents per oz. A 20 Oz soda, with ice costs about 12 cents, plus the cost of washing said cup, if at a dine-in, or the cost of a throwaway cup in fast food. Their final estimate, without refills, is 22 cents.  *But*, when people fill their own drinks, they are more likely to put less ice and more product, increasing that estimate.   You might not be winning, but you are gaining. So at least you have that going for you.   Maybe, but when the drinks are literally free for you, you don't keep track of how much you drink.  Let's assume that one drink costs them $0.25 (syrup and carbonation). If you work 10 days and drink 4 drinks a day, they are losing money on your $9.   They are making electric cars right now, with the biggest hurdle being the lack of charging stations for them. Easily less than 75 years.  Fast charging, recyclable batteries? They are working on them now, and it's just a matter of scale. Maybe less than 75 years.  Asteroid Mining? If we could get a space program from barely getting humans above the atmosphere to landing on the fucking moon within a decade, then the only reason we can't figure out asteroid mining is pure laziness.   That's the problem. The climate change advocates are saying shit will start happening in not just our lifetime, but our generation... in the same decade.  How are we supposed to take them seriously, when they do this?   I guarantee you that everyone you know today, with very few exceptions, will be dead before 2115, barring a major technological leap.   Of that were true, why bother trying to convince us they are right?  Or is their ego just that big that they would rather be the one saying "I told you so" from Hell rather than "I was wrong" from Heaven (metaphorically speaking)   Well, isn't one of the biggest problems in the world overpopulation? Sounds to me like that problem will be solved in your scenario.   When I worked at Denny's, a long time ago, they instituted that kind of policy.  Why? Because everyone from the bus boys to the cooks was ordering "mistakes" on the meals. It wasn't "a few scumbags", it was the whole crew.   If you drink one 20oz soda a day, 5 days a week, you are spending around $15-20 a paycheck. So, $9 isn't bad at all.  Are they still profiting? Yes. Is it "gouging" you? No.   Do any of the individual actors *need* to be there?  If even Carrie Fischer was unavailable for some reason, could she not have been either written out or recast?  If Daniel was available, why not put him in the movie?   Everyone seems to forget that the original Obi-Wan was glad he got to die in Episode 4 because he hated the dialogue.   No, that you included that travesty "On Her Majesty's Secret Service"  But seriously, the joke for it was solid   I wish I had that option. So many of our cash paying guests are literal whores.   What is your take on global warming?   That is true.  But there is a huge difference between changing things like place names, dialog (Barret's *was* very "angry black man"), or even subplots, but the very basics have to remain the same.  Cloud is a Sephiroth Clone, Sephiroth wants to destroy the world with Meteor, and Aerith dies.   Yeah, so they're on a plane, and the plane goes down, and they wake up on an island.

And that's why they called it Lost.   The best part about fucking twenty one year old girls?  There are twenty of them!   Tell that to the Pirate Bay people.    Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people.  I think this is the problem many people have.  Hardcore feminists look at anything spoken by a Men's Rights Activist as bullying to women, including calls for true equality.  Similarly, MRAs find it to be bullying behavior for Feminists to call for men to constantly "check their privilege"  Ultimately it becomes a pissing contest over who is the bigger bully, resulting in a lopsided ruling on one group being okay and the other group being banned.  Take the fat people hate sub. If you are offended by people making fun of fat people, then why are you looking through /r/fatpeoplehate?

"I may not like what you have to say, but I will *die* to protect your right to say it."  So, my question is this. Can you not make it so "hateful" subreddits are not visible on /r/all or /r/random, and limit the bans solely to material that is against the law?     If the only witness was a cop, you can bet dollars to donuts that it was the arresting officer.  If the prosecution called any other cop *without* calling the arresting officer, then there is something wrong with the case to begin with.    I've never heard of the OnePlus One.    Why don't you just *get it*, man?   Yeah, but he wanted me to hold the room with his first name, an incomplete address, and a promise to pay cash later.   Best Samsung mobile device ever!    To be fair, asking questions is a part of research.  They haven't bought the Samsung yet, so they don't know if there are games. Most mobile game commercials hype the iOS version, with a growing number stating it is on Google Play.  If this is his/her first smartphone, then it is reasonable enough to ask. And the appropriate answer is "yes". Not "let me laugh at you".  Now, the dipshit that got pedantic about whether she meant "Android" or "Samsung" (then talks about high-end, similarly priced to iPhone, Android devices, which are mostly Samsung).

Me: Okay, can I get your name?  Idiot: Idiot...  Me: Last Name?  Idiot: Idiot...  Me: Your whole name, please?  Idiot: Idiot Guy, sorry.  Me: That's okay. What is your address?  Idiot: (rattles off fast) 1234 San Antonio 78230  Me: I'm sorry, what was the street address?  Idiot: 1234... that's my apartment number.  Me: I need your whole street address, please.  Idiot: NW Military 1234.  Me: (you can probably see the vein in my head) What is the street number?  Idiot: Oh, I don't know. It's "Some Apartment Complex I've Never Heard Of"... here let me give you the address on my ID. (Gives an address that I can actually send mail if I need to.)  Me: Okay, and what kind of credit card can I use to guarantee the room?  Idiot: I'm just going to pay when I come in.  Me: No, we need a credit card.  Idiot: Okay, can I use my friend's card for that, I'm just going to pay cash.  Me: That's fine, but we will be authorizing that card in the morning before your arrival.

If it is a scam, then it will be a shittily made watch that costs less than the shipping and handling fee. If it is real, they probably are only giving away a small number, and the others will be sold at a premium.   Just ask yourself a simple question.   Did I call or email myself recently?    The spirit of Super Sentai is what makes them a sentai.  The thing that causes me pause is whether the Extra Heroes, like Mele, Rio, and Hyuuga, are "sentai" or not. The wiki lists these persons as sentai-like heroes that are similar to Rangers, but aren't.  But, at the same time, they *do* have Ranger Keys, or are otherwise tied to Sentai Grand Powers.  The one thing that they share with Jin and Juicy is the fact that they are mostly either alien or mechanical. Jin being an extra-dimensional Avatar and Juicy being a robot indicates that they *might* be Extra Heroes, and not Rangers.  However, they call themselves Rangers, so maybe that's enough?  It's maddening. Maybe it's just a thread that shouldn't be tugged on too hard.   He's quoting the movie in a funny way.   I don't know. I remember hearing about that capability, but I am having trouble finding the specific article now.  But it isn't like I'm saying something controversial, and we know at the very least that Windows 10 devices will stream to each other.   Jury Nullification is a very necessary part of our system.  But for conviction, you need a unanimous verdict. For acquittal, you don't. While the prosecution can retry the case, they won't do that if they think the same result is likely.  And because of the way Nullification works, judges and prosecutors generally won't ask you about it during voir dire, as it can inject the idea in your mind.  If you have a convincing reason as to why you should be let off, and the crime was light enough, *and* you convinced a jury member already, then they aren't likely to continue pursuing the case.   Obviously, if you can convince the entire jury, you're just out Scott free.   Most users don't *require* either. Let's get that straight.  I want one so I can effectively slap a big screen TV on the wall without the problems associated with buying and installing a big screen TV.  And both systems can do big screen equivalents. The difference being that with HoloLens, I can see when my roommate walks into the room.  HoloLens will be able to do VR with a single, simple upgrade... a black visor to blot out surroundings. Oculus would require some doing to get AR, but it isn't impossible.  I'm not saying that these are identical products. But one is [this kind of toaster]( http://www.kirbysupply.com/Images/APW_Wyott/AT_Express.jpg) and the other is [this kind of toaster](http://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6636079/6636079/Black-Decker-Stainless-Steel-Six-slice-Toaster-Oven-P14200190.jpg)  Both will make toast (act as a way of interfacing directly with a computer), but they will do it differently. And you'll probably only buy one of them.   The problem he has is the fact that many people *want* to work full time, but their bosses don't want then to.    But they never realize that ~~tattooing~~ treating people like cogs is exactly why they have a huge turnover.   Edit - stupid phone keyboard...   That is part of it. Black Lady is a combination of evil intent and childish aspirations.   I can tell you what *doesn't* happen.  The entire crust of the earth is not going to suddenly and violently flip around in opposition to normal plate tectonics.   The point of Jury Nullification is to say "the crime shouldn't be a crime"  You could technically get away with murder if you can convince 1 juror that you were justified, or simply that you're too good looking to go to jail.  For a case like this, it is very easy to convince at least 1 older person, who knows or knew someone with a dibilitating illness, that what you did shouldn't be a crime.   Just a winning ticket in the Genetic Lottery.   TIL people *really* hate geese.   Jerry had such great hair. Not anymore.  I'm just glad my hair will never leave me.    Soooo... that's a No for Baka and Test?   There is always Haruna and Michiru.    It would be an excellent tension breaker.  Have Goku call a time out in his fight with Frieza, set up a dainty tea table with some scones.   For me, Flash has been dead for centuries.   Actually, the HoloLens will be able to interact with a Laptop or Desktop PC to act as a display, in that situation, the on board processors would work with the PC processors and make a more powerful unit.   No, they're removing all EU material from canon, and only reintroducing elements that fit the new canon material.   The Yankees are kind of ingrained in the area.   It isn't that NYC became a No Man's Land, it's that New Jersey took it over after World War III.   But saying that Juliet's father's name is "Capulet" is like saying Stan's father's name is "Marsh"   I had to scroll down so far for this answer.  That man could be describing the flavor of toast and it'd be interesting.   I agree with you that Oculus will be quite inferior in the field of Augmented Reality, but the fact remains that the companies will be competing with each other.   If it costs $10M, and literally 10 people need it in the whole world, then yes. $1M a dose is a valid price.  But there is no disease that I've ever heard of where only 10 people in the entire world have it.  Giving a more realistic "low-ball" number of 100,000 people (we are including people in the future that might need it), that means each dose would be worth about $100 in R D.  The few people that need a particular drug, the more likely it will either not be researched or given away for free as an act of goodwill (and subsidized by higher costs on a drug that is needed by more people)   You shouldn't go that route.  You should go with Jury Nullification.  You force a jury trial, get up on the stand, and your lawyers gets to ask you questions like...   "what do you need this medicine for?" I have chronic asthma, and if I don't have it, I'll die.  "What is your prescribed dosage?" 500mg   "What is the dosage you ordered?" 500mg   "why did you choose to order this way?" Because this medicine would have cost me $300 a month with insurance. I bought it from a European market that was selling it for about $30.  "Why do you think this is okay?" Because I shouldn't have to go broke just to stay alive.   I guarantee you that because the Oculus will be operating using a PC, and the HoloLens *is* a PC, they will share a not insignificant amount of uses and content.  And I'll be willing to bet that within a year there will be an Oculus-mounted camera attachment that allows for AR gaming/programs, modded by fans, if not made by the company.    Hell, I used to read Shakespeare, and for the life of me, I don't think they ever *told* us the names of the Capulet or Montegue patriarchs.   Because 9 times it of 10, the statistics used to make those lists use false numbers anyway.   Super Sentai is wholly about whether they have a Giant Robo.  Himitsu Sentai Goranger and J.A.Q.K. Daigenkitai are Sentai, Battle Fever J was the first Super Sentai.  But I'm not talking about the Meta-reasoning as much as the in-universe reasoning. What makes DekaRed, GokaiGreen, Clover King, ToQ-3gou, or MammothRanger "Sentai", but not Kamen Rider groups, like Kabuto's Kamen Rider System?  Do individuals, like Space Sheriff Gavan and Kamen Rider Black share the same connection to the spirit of Super Sentai? Is it something inherent to the group dynamic, or is it the desire to protect others?  It's not a simple question to ask, let alone answer.   While I'm not a fan of rap albums, these covers are well done.   Well, a guy who has gamed for a long time might use anachronistic slang. It'd be like how we use catchphrases from Psych, Evil Dead, Spaceballs, or Star Wars.   It is a competitor, even if they are going after different userbases.  Just like the Xbox One is a competitor to PS4, despite one system focusing on games like Halo, and the other focusing on games like Watch_Dogs.  The primary uses of both the Oculus and the HoloLens will be game playing and watching movies... some of them will involve people wearing clothes.   That would be pictures of your own hooters, shot from above.   I should name my band "Naked 15 Year Old Girls"   Not only that, but a 17 year old engaging in sex acts on camera and sending them out is distributing child pornography.   I hate to say this, but if that's how you interpret this image, you are the one that has a problem.  But, even if this was a racist attempt at saying that Jews are pigs, it isn't saying "men are pigs", nor is it saying "men should be slaughtered like pigs".   But there were other instances of Extra Heroes that were not considered Sentai that fought with the teams.   Ninjaman, BullBlack Hyuuga, Signalman, and others were undoubtedly part of the team, but were not classified as members. Some were human (Hyuuga), some were monsters (Rio and Mele), and some were robots or golems (Ninjaman).  The confusion comes from the fact that there isn't much difference between the main members of a team and an Extra Hero.  Reading further into it, it is possible that the power to transform is something that can be claimed by anyone, but that it is a connection to the planet that makes them Sentai (at which point even the Extra Heroes would count)   http://i.imgur.com/9uj0w.gif   It's just a thought I had regarding the characters. Beet Buster (Jin) is an Avatar projected by a Buddyroid (Beet J Stag). Because of this, his transformation sequence is linked directly to Stag Buster's and he can not transform outside of his presence.  So, is there even a need, outside of aesthetics, to transform? Does the power of a Sentai come from some mystical planetary force (as shown in Gokaiger), from the power of the human spirit,  or is it something that just can be created, taken, or duplicated at will (as Enter seemed to be able to do)?   Saliva is mildly antiseptic, so there is that, but with your mouth you are able to get in close to where the proper place to cut is where a tool might be guessing at it.  Though, yes. They probably could develop a tool that doesn't involve goat teabagging.   RemindMe! 10 hours "Not really."   I would argue that the flux capacitor *has* to be some sort of alternative to a regular capacitor for one reason.  The bolt of lightning from 1955 to send Marty back to the future had to be funneled directly into the FC for the time travel to go off.  My thought is that the time circuits set a direction and power for the flux capacitor to discharge, giving the appropriate amount of power into the quantum drive (they never explain what exactly allows the car to travel through time) and allowing it to pinpoint it's arrival time to the second.   The only thing that truly matters.   Everyone else talks about how she looks, you talk about fashion...  I hate to tell you this, bro... But I found the gay one.   I think I have a problem... the part that ticked me off was when Ginny and Hermione got to their beds in the same dorm room....  They're in different years! Their beds wouldn't be in the same room.   I simply assumed that a flux capacitor was an engineering device, designed to hold and discharge the massive amount of energy required to engage the quantum drive, and go backward or forward through time.  As for Biff dying, it was confirmed by Word of God (Bob Gale) that Lorraine shot and killed Alternate Biff in 1995, after she learned that he killed George.   When people care about Warcraft? ^^I ^^kid, ^^I ^^kid.   Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back...   A Jay and Silent Bob *Movie*? Who would pay to watch that?!   *Ben, Jason, and Kevin look derisively at the camera, Kevin grins wide*   Partyman! Partyma-an! Rock a party like nobody ca-an!   Yes, it does. But because the narrative toward girls is that they have to work harder to catch up to boys (whether it is true or not), they tend to study harder and follow directions more closely.   From [the abstract on this study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00629.x/abstract)... "Gender and Ethnicity Differences in Freshmen Engineering Student Attitudes: A Cross-Institutional Study"   Definite gender differences were found on the pre-survey for five of the attitude measures. For all but one of these measures, female engineering students' initial attitudes were more negative than those of male students. Across the sample of institutions, female students consistently began their engineering studies with a lower confidence in background knowledge about engineering, their abilities to succeed in engineering, and their perceptions of how engineers contribute to society than did their male counterparts. However, those same female students were more comfortable with their study habits than were the male students. The post questionnaire data indicated that differences for three of these five attitude measures persisted. Most important, female engineering students continued to maintain a lower confidence in their abilities to succeed in engineering as compared to male engineering students. When the PFEAS data were mapped into EC 2000 outcomes, comparable cross-institutional gender differences were observed that paralleled those found for the attitudinal measures.  The study in question showed girls lacked confidence in their knowledge of the subject compared to boys, but (not paradoxically) were more confident in their study habits. My (admittedly layman) assessment is that girls compensate for perceived weakness in a subject by studying harder, which naturally boosts their final performance.   Though, I'd be wanting to give a kid more tutoring if his answer was 123 "because Maleketh, the Destroyer of Worlds, deemed it so."   I love comics, since they have a unique ability of fueling the imagination by seeding the mind with the imagery, but leaving the voice and interactions to you.  A good comic book is much more concise than a good book, as it is generally less bogged down with descriptive exposition. It also lends itself easier to episodic release, allowing the reader time to reflect on each part (at the pitfall of ruining the enjoyment of marathon reading.)   Spider-Man *does* dodge pretty much every bullet, with most exceptions being, well, shenanigans.  And the Flash *glorifies* the idea, since most of his powers are things like vibrating fast enough to rip a hole through dimensions.  But let me be clear. I *love* Superman. I don't care that some of his powers [don't make](https://youtu.be/FGVyXmiLOVc) [any sense.](https://youtu.be/XiN0Lwvi7CA) I enjoy them, but I enjoy pointing them out.  I'm there to have fun, and enjoy the show.    Ultimately, some of the techniques used are valid, and some of them are not. Some are only better in certain situations (addition of strings of larger or more complex numbers, like your example, is one where that isn't bad thing). But some people just have a knack for numbers, and they don't need to completely separate the tens place from the ones place when they do their subtraction.  Our classes need to cater to the *student's* learning.   If I run through a mental shortcut for that problem, I'll do (37-20+1), which yes, is part of the basis for common core math, but not really the same thing.  It was just a shortcut. We used to basically memorize simple number interaction. 17-9=8. Not 17-9=8 because 9 is 1 less than 10, so 17-10+1.   It was just one of the first articles I found on a search for "common core math"  The point is there was nothing wrong with "adding" and "subtracting", there was nothing wrong with "borrowing" and "carrying over" a ten... there was nothing wrong with the old math.  But they needed to justify new text books, and here we are.   "Google Incorporation"  US company paying a lottery to a Danish citizen in British Pounds?  A lottery you never entered in the first place?  Seems legit.   Who is Abby?   It was actually a very good episode.   Yes. That's a thing.  [And it is stupid](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/373840/ten-dumbest-common-core-problems-alec-torres)   Just remember, the more you buy at the lower rate, the lower the price has to reach for an overall profit.   Yes, but one of those ripples would be the removal of the Almanac from the timeline, because Biff wasn't able to take it from the garbage can in 2015 and bring it back to himself. In fact, Marty himself should have disappeared because Doc in the alternate timeline was thrown in a mental facility and therefore never invented the time machine.   It is trackable. That's what the blockchain is.  It's actually more trackable than paper currency and coinage. The only "problem" is the hurdle in adoption by non-techsavvy individuals, who fail to grasp concepts like millionths of a coin.    Worse is this common core nonsense where you have to run through hoops for simple subtraction. (37-19, so 30-20=10 and 7+1=8, so 18.)   One of the goals of bitcoin is to become a global currency, meaning each individual coin would be worth not thousands, but millions of dollars.  So, a $315 current price is a lottery ticket.   Is no one going to mention the witchcraft of an animated advice animal?    You aren't wrong there, but teachers use it as an excuse.   Always a good choice. Totally expected because of the pop culture acceptance.   Income inequality isn't the problem. The problem is the fact that many people are below a living wage, and there is a difference there.  If only the laziest of fucks gets less than a living wage (as opposed to the hard workers that *are* out there working 40+ hours a week just to not be "poor"), then who gives a shit about the Warren Buffetts of the world?  The left is too invested in greedily clawing at the rich and not invested enough in improving the lower class through *meaningful* reform.  It isn't enough to tell my boss, "You make $100,000 a year, and I only make $18,000." You'd need to be able to get into the meat and bones and show him *why* $18,000 isn't enough.   Here is what bothers me.  BTTF - Marty goes back in time, changes history so his mom and dad don't hook up and almost immediately starts to disappear  (starting with his brother in the picture).  BTTF2 - Old Biff goes back in time, gives himself the Almanac, somehow makes it back to the original 2015 before he disappears from the timeline.  The problem is, the very act of going back in time and giving himself the almanac should have created the universe-destroying paradox that Doc was worried about. Because if Old Biff never existed, he never could have brought the Almanac back to 1955.   It's more basic than that. Women and girls increasingly are held to be in more need of help than men and boys, so in subjects where girls already outclass boys, the boys are held to the higher standard and fail for it.  Even some Math and Science classes grade on a curve, and use rules like showing your work as an excuse to mark boys down a little more. Boys, after all, are more likely to cut corners, and girls are more likely to follow direction better.   Pimp Vader   Yes, but would you be willing to accept the caption, "ran into a bunch of Warfs at the library"?   That's what the average person would call them. Only the nerdiest of people would worry about the different classifications of Imperial Stormtroopers. So, that would be forgivable.  Thinking that "Darth Vader" was the imperial name for anyone wearing a masked helmet, and not even getting that name right? I'm not convinced that this is even real.   Canon. Not cannon   Yes, but how many of them have the power of "whatever we feel like giving him"?  Most of the time Supes gets killed/defeated it's because of shenanigans. Why didn't he just fly up an blast the guy with his heat vision from a mile away, like he did in issue XX? Why didn't he vibrate himself fast enough that Whoever's weapon passes through him like he did in issue YY? Why would he be stupid enough to walk near any lead-lined case within a block of Lex Fucking Luthor, knowing that the madman has access to an impossible amount of kryptonite?  On that matter, the whole "can't see through lead" part is just silly. He's been shown seeing through dozens of heavy concrete walls, halfway across the country, meaning he is not actually using x-rays for his xray vision, but lead just happens to have the right configuration of atoms to stop it?  Superman is OP as fuck, but because of that he gets Worfed from time to time.   Spider-Man 2 was so good it belongs on that upper list.   It's about a 70% on the Tomatometer.  I don't think anyone expects this to be Captain America: The Winter Soldier (a movie so good that Honest Trailers straight up admitted it was a great film), but this is gonna be a fun romp.

 Which anime has a good atmospheric and exciting soundtrack?   Television and film have a lot of things that novels don't, like the actors' portrayal of the characters, the cinematography, the soundtrack, etc. What do novels have?   Not "plot", but plot.  A good non-anime example for me is *Arrested Development*, mainly due to how the narration ties the different plot points together. Is there anything like that in anime?   Thank you, and [may](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/KAk3PDW.png) [the Stu](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/iXqzR9j.png) [be](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/prp74Qd.png) [with you](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/crJcSZh.png).   I guess AniChart is succinct, but to the point.   I use the synopses in anime previews in deciding whether I want to pick up an anime.  Here's Steins;Gate from [AniChart](http://anichart.net/archive/spring-11):    Steins;Gate is set in the summer of 2010, approximately one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara.        Steins;Gate is about a group of friends who have customized their microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past. As they perform different experiments, an organization named SERN, who has been doing their own research on time travel, tracks them down and now the characters have to find a way to avoid being captured by them.        (Sources: VNDB, Wikipedia)  From [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate):   The eccentric mad scientist Okabe, his childhood friend Mayuri, and the otaku hacker Daru have banded together to form the "Future Gadget Research Laboratory," and spend their days in a ramshackle laboratory hanging out and occasionally attempting to invent incredible futuristic gadgets. However, their claymore is a hydrator and their hair dryer flips breakers, and the only invention that's even remotely interesting is their Phone Microwave, which transforms bananas into oozing green gel. But when an experiment goes awry, the gang discovers that the Phone Microwave can also send text messages to the past. And what's more, the words they send can affect the flow of time and have unforeseen, far-reaching consequencesconsequences that Okabe may not be able to handle...        (Source: Anime Planet)            Have you read any novels just for the [wish-fulfillment](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment) value rather than to be enriched?   I'd like to know if you know of any novels that are introspective where you really get to know what the main characters are feeling, but preferably without someone suffering from physical conditions, mental conditions, or tragedies, or being a coming-of-age story. Ending on an optimistic note would be a bonus.   I keep reading that being introverted is not the same thing as being shy, but most examples I come across are when one is introverted but not shy. Is it possible to be shy and not introverted?                       	19

 Is that so? Then I was badly informed by my peers. Reminds me of a guy I know who flooded his apartment because he didn't know that he didn't know something significant in regards to water pressure on a higher floor. You don't ask if you don't assume that you lack knowledge.   Any more lurkers around? Let me tickle you to make an account after all: "GeorgeLurkas"   Too bad, the article doesn't say. I guess not. But marred, probably.   Yep. This is a glorious example. From the article:   The court heard that the father was concerned that, once his daughter began showing an interest in boys, there was a risk she would have sex outside marriage, which he believed was a sin under Islamic law.   He felt that a "solution" to this problem was for his daughter to get married so that she would not be living in sin if she had sex.  Islam - religion of "SUCK IT, FEMALES!!1"  ...  Epic. (emphasis mine)   Some months later, *against the strong objections from the girl's mother*, the father arranged for his daughter to marry the student in an Islamic ceremony at  his home in the Hunter region of NSW.   Yes, I'm just saying that this is not how people tick when they see bacon.   Context doesn't matter. Bacon is to be upvoted.   https://i.imgur.com/7FkNaXO.jpg   Your comment I replied to was ambiguous. I read it to mean "This post here already has *a lot* of upvotes."   Alternative title: "OK, you got me. Now what."   Yet another example that *for me* at least shows how right it is that I never use anything but .nextLine() for System.in. I know that it's probably against the spirit of something in someplace, but I want to be in total control and don't want any surprises. .nextLine() gives me 100% predictable behavior - and you *do* have to press ENTER to input stuff on the console, anyway, so I don't see any considerable advantage for the other methods, they only get in the way.   It's probably quite tasty.  https://i.imgur.com/Mpxflml.jpg   [Super Motherload](http://store.steampowered.com/app/269110/) only requires arrow keys and the occasional other key. Even has local multiplayer, e.g. two people over keyboard (afair). 15 full price, but I got it on Steam Summer Sale, probably for 3.74  http://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/info?plain=supermotherload  It's one of the many 2D digger games. Well done. I always play it before work or when I get home, so when I have small time slices of about 10-30 minutes to fill. It has a bit of a story arc, kind of, and I'm looking forward to seeing where this is heading.  It's not great, it's rather a casual game, but it's also not bad at all.   That ... is great! It made me look up the entertaining German movie "Die Bluthochzeit", which I would directly translate as "the blood wedding".  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382572  But nope. They failed. The English title is: "The Wedding Party". There's no "Bloody Marriage" title on IMDB yet. Man, such an opportunity.   Sounds like a witch test.   Good karma, I guess.   Is that so? Because I just did that, kinda, while being German no less. In case some wasps are still asleep, let me add that I don't like Greece all that much.   I Googled a bit (because I wanted to, anyway).

The ability to make some positive out of it doesn't make it non-negative.   [Life Is Strange](http://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/), all episodes (Basically required.) were 16 during Summer Sale.

Really, if you dismiss this game, you should at least have taken a good look at it to be sure that you didn't make that decision lightly.   Rather by 40 60 year old officials.   Committees are possibly in a position to put others into cells.   This fire alarm photo comes to mind:  https://i.imgur.com/7FkNaXO.jpg   If the alarm hasn't been set off, the firefighters might also not yet be on the way. (Assuming that the alarm has a direct line to the FF.)   Incidentally, my first thought when I saw the thumbnail was: "A Google Deep Dream image."  For those who don't know what it does: https://www.google.com/search?q=google+deep+dream safe=active tbm=isch  (A GDD version would probably look almost like the original.)   The true character of man, I suppose.   Let me guess. Poland?   Well, he's an idiot because he believes that Jeshua of Nazareth walked on water, performed miracles, rose from the dead, and is really God, the creator of the universe.   There needs to be a mod that allows to do that in-game.   Pictured: Climate change.   Yes, and more, according to  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cbhyr/iama_video_game_attorney_its_still_a_thing_i/cstz5sg?context=10  /u\/VideoGameAttorney giving advice. The whole post is by them, lots of interesting stuff.   Because the more people are on such lists because they clicked a link, the less it will matter.   Nit-pick: The black hole has little immediate impact on a galaxy's gravitational configuration. The high density of the stars at the center is what causes the attractive power of the center.    At least, according to our latest theories.  Hypotheses. Right? I mean, the things you're referring to would be reasonable falsifiable ideas based on one or more scientific theories. They'd require testing etc., until they eventually could become part of an already existing or of a new theory. Or are disproved.    Its like if you are at the gun range; you can improve your precision to a great amount, but if you're shooting at the wrong target, it wont help much. But you can definitely say that you are missing with great precision.   That applies to *your* whole approach / world view. The irony is funny.    modern science does not contradict the makers word.  Incompatible with science: Resurrections, miracle healings (e.g. gluing the ear back on), miraculous food multiplications; and the Adam Eve story can't even be taken metaphorically, because the first homo sapiens (sapiens) didn't occur in a vacuum, they evolved like everything else. There's probably more, but I don't care enough about the Bible to know.   The fucking POPE accepts evolution. Not that he *should know* - but he would have some reason to say that it's not true. So, him accepting it says something about the massiveness of the scientific consensus.   Most characters are the same, but you get an interesting new perspective on at least two of them. You fight *for* Handsome Jack, so the things you see and hear of him are of different categories, and the Claptrap DLC is a whole campaign that takes place *inside* of Claptrap, which deals a lot with its past and psychology. The humor is alright, imho on the same level, but my memory isn't that clear.   No, but now I do. What's your point?   I have seen a few games that darken their borders and especially corners like this, and the feature is called "vignette" in the options, so I guess it's a known term at least among gamers.   The holes in your logic are as big as the incompetence of the majority of the voters.   Gone.   "Leonardo DiCaprio (The ..." This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Miramax.   Sorry about that.    I think vignette effect is the official term for this, but I'm not sure.    This video is not available.   Sorry about that.  Germany. But this doesn't sound region-specific.    Five teenagers graduate high school and go to a house in the woods to celebrate. But there, they encounter an evil presence. Dressed in tights.  The user reviews say that it's good, and the title doesn't do it justice at all.   While we're at it: *If* I were to go out and buy a Geiger counter, would this cover Alpha Beta Gamma rays? And what brand could you recommend, or rather what are criteria by which to decide for a product? Not to measure with laboratory precision, but to test a location or object roughly for such radiation. (I don't plan to go anywhere special, I'm just curious.)   Pink paint?   It's a simple choice: Do you want to live, or do you want to risk a very painful decline into death? Maybe you need it like this.   Waiting on go dot?   Excuse me, Sir, do you have a moment to talk about the money you owe us?   So, it's a DECent post.   Its a art.   Rolling aircraft carrier. Nice. Haven't seen that yet in a movie. (Could use harrier "motor cycles" instead of drones. In the movie.)   For a proper terror attack, no bomb is required. You could just fly a drone over a tightly crowded place and spray sulfuric acid or something like that. Much more terror, much more suffering.  I always wondered why the oh so chemically inclined terror-Muslims (Like, the terror-version.) don't just damage and crash a tanker truck full of acid atop a small village. That has never happened before and would be remembered for a long ass time. Would also be rather easy to achieve. Such an act strikes me to be like 9/11: When you think about it, you wonder why nobody has done this before. Then someone does it, and it's like nobody was able to imagine the possibility for some reason.   "Only enough so that the green light goes yellow. The red light would coincide with the explosion, so we didn't implement one. ... Do it already!"   "Hey, whatcha readin' for?"[.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76449-i-was-in-nashville-tennessee-last-year-after-the-show)   Kills me every time the weird mods in /r/askscience approve the same stupid questions for the millionth time (e.g. "If I look at a mirror, what is the optical distance of my mirror image?" SERIOUSLY.)  "Why can we take photos of distant galaxies but not of Pluto?" BECAUSE PLUTO IS NOT A BILLION STARS! Also, angular resolution.   They probably did that so that it doesn't look too much like CGI, which this thing from (I think) an advertisement totally is. But yes, as an example for perfectly stationary, it doesn't quite work.   WTF, a link works, but plain text with numbers gets flagged as spam? Crazy pills.   From the sidebar of /r/movies:  `[Star Wars spoilers](#s "Yoda gets Darth Vader pregnant")`  Results in:  [Star Wars spoilers](#s "Yoda gets Darth Vader pregnant")  I think the first bit (#s) is arbitrary.   On second thought: What happens if you visit the link directly? Does the "hide" button say "unhide"? :)   Sorry, no. I know that my knowledge isn't solid, plus I know that opinions in the churches, denominations, etcwhatever, vary - you'll always step into the trap that you're not omniscient, that you don't know the whole world in this regard. But what you *can* know with almost objective certainty is *your doubts*. Nobody can enter that territory and tell you that they know better.   That can backfire. I don't think your atheism will fall, but your assumption that you can swat the guy might be very premature.  In any case, try not to get sucked into the labyrinth: Don't let an idiot pull you down to his level, then beat you with experience. Arguing Bible-details is like kicking water uphill, because the guy just has to make up an ad-hoc re-interpretation, which is what religious people like to do because they care about the holy truth of God so much (Sarcasm. That was sarcasm.), or the guy already has working interpretations, ultimately letting you look like you don't know what you're talking about.  The main guns are:  Lack of evidence. Competition-religions with same kind of evidence. In case he says "Ye, but same God!", mention alien abductions and contemporary miracle-performing saviors with tons of witnesses as additional examples.  Religion damages the mental health of society, and the good that is being done in the name or by religion (e.g. by the church) could be done secularly as well.  Morality can be derived properly from Evolution and from the base assumption that suffering is wrong. One could argue that it is not objective - but it's good enough. One can *certainly* argue that God-given morality is not objective at all, because the user can't know if it is from God or if they received it properly, which can e.g. be seen by some Christians accepting LGBT while others say it's a sin.  But don't think you're a Bible scholar.   It seems that you submit a lot of links like this to various subreddits. Some of those are about different games. I only checked two of those games, they are by the same studio: CYSCORPIONS  In case you are part of that studio, please do not make any post about those with titles that give the impression as if you're just *someone* who thinks that those games are worth a look. Because it would be a lie. Just *someone*'s opinion is based on their experience, while yours is composed a lot differently, this is why this information matters to readers, so please don't distort it. (And, I mean, you want potential success to be *real*, right. Not made-up.)   Hi\*, I'm God. When I read that witnessing-part, I detected that you don't really mean it. Which is good.   There's also a Tabasco sauce that smells somewhat like bacon. I recently stumbled over it and now use it way too often.

Since I have it in my clipboard, here you are:  Poly Bridge http://store.steampowered.com/app/367450/  Early Access. 12   You usually put variables and everything else in the most restrictive scope possible/reasonable. So, if you don't need the variables "outside" a method, put them inside.  And don't worry about variable declaration taking time: The JVM is very well optimized. Instance creation is a different story. But just *declaring* your variable e.g. during every single loop iteration doesn't cost you.   Yep, you can even just freely make a `{}` block out of thin air and it'll do that. (And I mean in a method. You could also make such a block on class level. That would be executed like a constructor, but before all other constructors, afaik. Similarly, you can make a `static {}` block on class level which will (afaik) be executed as soon as all class level variables have been assigned.)   This one time, at band camp, I got to play.   Looks a lot like Carey Mulligan (e.g. [Drive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/), 2011) with that haircut. That's a great photo. If the post wouldn't be a year old, I'd comment there.  https://www.google.com/search?q="Carey+Mulligan" safe=active tbm=isch   Good thing OP didn't. *Just in case* you're out of the loop: Please do read the edited post. :)   Security, though. I *heard* that it's a lot easier to get an unclean app on an Android phone than on an iPhone. (I never had a smartphone.)  Question: Colleague of mine keeps buying a new (used) iPhone and selling his current one, making a profit, and getting his data from one phone to the next / resetting a phone seems to be perfectly easy and uncomplicated. Does Android do that, too?  All that said/asked: I am quite the opposite of an Apple fan, but I don't ignore facts.   I, too, agree. Just don't forget to intently read negative reviews, too, even if you have to change the list selector for that.  They often contain facts that are good to know, e.g. "very repetitive boss fights", or technological facts that might be relevant.   I, too, have to object to give this more weight: These crap-"reviews", marked as "helpful" by 80% each, are *all* over the goddamn place. Everywhere.  I can't say that Steam's review system doesn't work, because it's easy for me to find useful information and make an informed decision. But the crap is e ve ry where.   We know a lot so far about material science. Ultimately, it all comes down to nuclear binding forces. Can we predict that space-elevator material will never be possible / maybe possible / likely possible somewhen in the future?   I am sure how to feel about this. Atheism is the saner choice, definitely if it's the "I don't know, but I also don't care." kind, and most definitely saner than Catholicism.  So, someone who is stuck in insanity reads your possibly sanity-inducing blog, but you don't read his God-fan-fiction blog. It's not the symmetry you make it out to be.   Doesn't matter what kind of milk it is, I don't drink it. I don't mind products using milk (e.g. cheese, yumm), but I never drink that stuff. Eww.   Depends on the way the jaywalking takes place, and I have no idea how (or if at all) it took place here. When I do it, and I do it all the time, it's in a perfectly safe situation, and I mean even regarding "communication" (People seeing and deciding accordingly, e.g. approaching cars etc. - I don't do it when such an effect takes place in any way)  People who do what I do are on the safer side, anyway - because I check whether the situation is safe, no matter if the light is green or not. Reminds me of when I ran over a green pedestrian light in primary school and got run over by a motorcycle.   Well, if they would run away, they couldn't move their arms for efficient running, and they would have to get rid of the cuffs. E.g. their parents could see it and ask unpleasant questions.  I *think* that the cuffs are an efficient and harmless measure to prevent someone from actually running away. (Plus, think how dangerous a chase near traffic can easily become.)   Sure you didn't click "hide" at some point? What does /r\/announcements look like from a different browser (aka logged out)?   "Sing it into this text box."   That might be surprisingly unpleasant, though. The pieces fit so neatly together, they might not have the wiggle room required to "fold", so they might mostly insist to stay one wall. Since the same applies to the outer-most places, the whole "door" might not move away at all, you might end up running against a wall whose pieces almost don't get displaced. And then you're mainly confronted with the pieces' form-stability, not so much with their lightness.   Possibly this one: https:\/\/reddit.com/user/pi-to-tau   Well, I replied here because I didn't want to make essentially the same statement but spawn a new root thread.   Part of the reputation would be that any theist stuff (posts and comments) gets downvoted here - most of the time, that's true, and I think that if a comment clearly aims to answer a question without having a shitty tone, too low effort, etc., then people should *upvote* it, that's how the system is supposed to work!  This would discourage theists less to post here, and this subreddit is clearly strong enough not to suffer upvoted theistic statements.   http://uneddit.com/  Never got it to work for me, though. Just mentioning it because maybe it does work for others.  Oh, just found this (untested):  http://www.resavr.com/  And finally:  https://github.com/IAAAC/reddit-undelete-bot/blob/master/undeletebot.py   reddit-undelete-bot/undeletebot.py  (Don't know if it works or what it does.)    I also find the current policy great. Only the most extreme cases of obnoxiousness, offensiveness, repetition and such should go.  It's awesome to have a subreddit, that basically doesn't have any rules in theory and in practice, and still works out just fine.   I'm currently on [Borderlands 1.5](http://store.steampowered.com/app/261640/) ("pre-sequel"), which I find to be at least as much fun as 1 2, though I have to admit: I cheat this time (didn't before). Infinite money (savegame editor from GameCopyWorld). Because you just get killed too much, often seriously not your fault, because of spots you can fall into. I also rather found that aspect frustrating than stimulating. Also, the loss of money is quite significant, and you just don't make enough money in BL1.5, imho.  And for the short time before work or right after coming home, to cool down: [Super Motherload](http://store.steampowered.com/app/269110/). (a 2D mining game with a bit of story arc)   No, it's rather "You feel dirty? Wash yourself.", and we're pondering whether you're rather a funny pen drawing on the forearm instead of actual dirt. My stance is the former. Let's keep you around.   It's also intuitive for people who have seen various phases of the Moon many times. The association of a sphere comes up. The brain does derive shapes and distances via a lot of other factors *automatically* (Not a process requiring immediate consciousness / thinking.), and similar things would apply to Earth: How far can you look from *this* mountain? Ok, now what do you see from *that* mountain, thousands of kilometers away? etc.  Someone who infers that the Earth is a "sphere" might just have a very strong Occam's Razor aspect in their mind, something we all have, it's part of our base functionality. "First, assume that the other similar thing is indeed the same thing with changed properties." Applies e.g. to the coexistence of beings.   Come on, do you really think like that? That's hilarious. If you would not believe in the outside world, evolution would kill you. Brains that did accept the outside world properly were obviously favored.  You have to bend over backwards so far that you break in half if you want to assemble logic that calls serious doubt on what I just said.  Now, to bring God into the discussion: You can't observe him, only via interpretation, and that interpretation may well be incorrect. But it is *sure as perception itself* BY FAR not on the same level as the obviousness of the outside world.  Axiom my ass, seriously.   Side-note: All there is *is* empty space: All matter is made of point-like particles which themselves are just a stable construct of energy. When we experience matter in any way whatsoever, all we're experiencing is forces. Solid stuff like we interpret everyday life matter just doesn't exist.   I would have said "appeal to gullibility", but not a malicious one: Obviously, OP is gullible themself.   What about the already mentioned Texas sharpshooter fallacy? Someone makes 100 claims, some of them are right, then you only look at the right ones and say: "Wow, this guy has it all figured out".   If a person does not believe that at all times when they are not looking, a 5 meter tall demon stands behind their back, then they are not an "a-....-ist", because that's such a singular weird claim that it doesn't have importance. Also, it's easily disprovable via peer review, or the person would have to have quite a few more extreme beliefs (quasi solipsism).  But since theism plays a significant role in human society, not being a theist *does* deserve its own term, and that term is "a-theist". Let's not go over the historical definitions of this word but instead use the logic I just presented: "I am not a theist." is equivalent to saying "I am an atheist." (Any specifics, e.g. "I am convinced that no god(s) exist.", have to be communicated in addition.) It just *makes sense* to have a word that describes "Not part of this set." if the set is important enough.  And not being part of that set is not a belief. The fact that you don't believe in that weird concept I described in the first few lines doesn't make that a belief, right? You only think about atheism as a belief, because *theism* thinks about something that affects the nature of all of existence, so to a theist it seems as if not sharing that belief is itself a belief.  But if you think about it: That demon-concept above does have huge implications for the whole world. What if half of mankind would have that belief? Bang, same situation.  You have to realize that people who try to believe as many true and as few false things as possible are just *reasonable*. They just have a much stricter filter than you. Calling that a belief isn't just wrong, as pointed out above, it's even the opposite of what would be appropriate.   Let's make this short: You should have said "equal options". E.g. if there were two identical doors in a room I suddenly find myself in, and one leads into a broom closet, the other lets me leave, and both doors look exactly alike, then the chance that I pick the correct door is indeed 0.5  If the broom closet door looks like one while the other is central in the room and big and decorated, then the chances are not equal.  But this is all just semantic stuff. You did have this in mind when you wrote the post, I assume, so let's move on.   Yep. By this guy's ill definition, someone who does not have a religion has a religion, too. How obvious can the error get?   Man, this sucks. My post was 8 hours earlier but didn't show up for hours.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Superbowl/comments/3dd6gq/8_xpost_from_rgifs/   Well, the reason I wrote this wasn't just to point out the obvious mistake - I also hadn't seen the comment in question yet because it is ... *somewhere*. The two comments I objected to, however, knew precisely what they were talking about. Thanks for the link.   IS or ISn't - WE decide!   I am God and will kill you.   Doesn't exist. Source: I am God, the creator of the universe.  (Hint: Judgment time. The way you respond can be fatal.)   Wow, this one isn't altered, it's completely fucked-up! (Crop/distortion.)   I am God and will kill you.   That looks like they were trying to emulate a quasar.   I guess that if they'd be bought as much as PC processors, they'd cost 1/10th.   "If we do one slingshot less, we can stay 2 years longer!"   I wonder if DMC has ever been shadowbanned. :)   Cassini, most controversial mission because of the Earth-slingshot with nuclear material on board, seems to have delivered *the most* awe-inspiring data to the public.   Regarding responses to idiot proselytizers, everybody is God.   None, because the photo   will be of the largest moon, Charon. --SJR   I'd tell them that I am God, and they should stop slandering my formerly good name.   I'm sure the person has sufficient scientific data for such a broad claim.   It's all ridiculous, anyway. We know that Europa is habitable. It's just another publicity stunt, just like the fake Moon landings.   TIS-100 Steam store link:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/   No idea, and I did 68K assembler around 1990 on Amiga. I think it's a mix of circle-jerk and cock-sucking (like "oh, Mr celebrity Sir, I must find everything you do wonderful").   I would say that it just needs you to start on a much lower level, but at the end of the day, you're just stacking subroutine layers like in any other language. The lowness of the level you have to start with is indeed removed from intuition, but it's not like you have to try to XOR (and such) bits with each other all day like it happens on chip level. The most important part is that you need to have knowledge of the machine itself you're working with, but I guess it's relatively fun to do for a probe because you're really starting at the bottom instead of having to learn the operating system's stuff first. Of course, NASA's requirements for code are a different story altogether.   Was quite normal to use on Amiga for game programming. Though Motorola 68000 assembler is relatively luxurious. No idea how it is with today's processors / with the processors NASA used.   Pretty sure that its claws inadvertently stuck to the thing, which caused modulated behavior, which resulted in the straight two-paws throw.   Space elevator confirmed.      Mod ideas? Is this /r/GameDev? I thought Java mods were called "libraries".  *opens thread*  Ooohh.   For those who haven't seen it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cbhyr/iama_video_game_attorney_its_still_a_thing_i/cstz5sg?context=10  /u\/VideoGameAttorney giving advice.

People need to sign it, too, though.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A64ZMKvU9M4  ^^^Postal ^^^2   I think this is somehow a shitpost.   E.g. it might have rotated a bit. Whoever has sat down in such a situation learns that even this unimportant seeming change easily leads to very macroscopic consequences.   https://i.imgur.com/88MDptc.jpg   That's kinda ironic, because a shit-*post* would rather be a *post* (Not a *comment*.) that has a useless title and/or blatantly ignores the most obvious subreddit rules.   Wouldn't it be easier to allude to what the hunch is instead of making OP go through the trouble of selecting what code to post and then to post it?   There are probably better answers to your question. But still:  What's wrong with using String? Max length is 2,147,483,647 characters.  Of course, if you're changing the text (e.g. adding bits to it), you should use StringBuilder because it doesn't make a new object each time.  Another way to store a bunch of data is a byte array. There are even methods to directly convert to and from byte array (e.g. from/to String).   There are like 90 bazillion variations of Christianity - you can be sure that not all of them believe that homosexuality is a sin. But even without using this logic, I am pretty sure I know of such Christians, I'm currently just not sure of my memory.  But what I was actually suggesting is that there are *other* god concepts out there which don't say "God has a problem with homosexuals!" at all, and your original argument does not touch those.   The Bible-god supposedly does not accept homosexuals. If that's the only god you do not believe in, you're merely not an Abrahamic believer. There are sooooo many god-ideas out there which do not fall under this category.   The big hole in your logic is that this just makes the existence of a god not accepting of homosexual people unlikely. Doesn't mean that there is *no* god. If that's the reason you're an atheist, then you need to think about this.  	138

            Believe it or not but honey brought in from overseas contains bacteria and spores that are very harmful to honeybees. If you leave a honey jar outside it encourages honeybees to feed on the remaining honey. There is a good possibility that this will infect the bee and in turn the bee will infect the rest of the colony resulting in death of the colony. Always wash out honey jars and dispose of them carefully.  ______________________________  From *The Guardian* article: [Ten things to do to help honeybees](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/13/wildlife.endangeredspecies)   It was in their manifesto   It's not unusual for lefthanders to learn how to play a rh guitar upside down.

Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, the great leader of the Dalits, was determined to liberate people from poverty, injustice and caste oppression. Between 1923 and 1956 he worked tirelessly in the Indian political system as an advocate for human rights, and rose to become the first Law Minister of the new Indian nation and the chief author of its Constitution. The new Constitution made untouchability illegal, but Dr. Ambedkar came to believe that true social change could only come by leaving behind the cultural and religious beliefs that justified the caste system. In 1956, shortly before his death, he initiated a wave of mass conversions to Buddhism  a spiritual tradition free of prejudice.  http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=42,11654,0,0,1,0   ?      yourself  and others.

See what Buddhist temples and/or centers exist in your area, do your research about them and pay them a visit.   The [World Buddhist Directory presented by Buddha.net](http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/) might be useful for this. Keep in mind however that it is not exhaustive.       Video 45 is private.   This software won't eradicate the harm but it ought to reduce it: https://justgetflux.com/   Perhaps:   What started your interest, and what's maintained it?  How would you introduce/teach standing meditation to a meditator who is new to it?   I trust this will be helpful if you relate to this sort of thing. [Here is a picture of Amoghasiddhi with his hand in the mudra of fearlessness.](https://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m34lcbMuRm1r2ejc3o3_r1_500.jpg)   Thank you. I love hearing all these differing approaches - it vivifies, and is vivacity itself. Were you inside or outside doing this? Barefoot or in training shoes?   Thank you. I found the contextualisation of it within walking meditation illuminating. I appreciated the tips for the walking meditation too. I hope to be able to try some of those approaches.  Thanisarro Bhikku. I'd been aware of some of his translations on Access to Insight but didn't know he has written on meditation practice, let alone so lucidly. The canonical works are very good for the Buddha essence yet it is this sort of Guru giving practical advice that is so valuable for the West/English speaking world which has less of a tradition in meditation compared to the East. The Buddha/buddhists of old were part of a yogic milieu that I believe 'shorthanded' canonical meditation advice. Teachers and writers on meditation should be treasured - particularly those using the language one speaks!   Thank you very much for sharing. I shall revisit this and hopefully assist in some way to passing on the merit. Sadhu, ZFree2013!   Would you like to share more about about your experience?   Have you ever tried standing meditation in a more formal setting - as you do with your sitting meditation?   From my cursory research on the subject it appears that there are some traditions that use standing meditation as a way to transition the awareness and mindfulness gained 'in the midst of stillness' to awareness and mindfulness 'in the midst of commotion'.   There are two modes of Son Buddhist meditation: "Son in the midst of stillness" and "Son in the midst of commotion." I like to refer to them as simply the "quiet" and "active" modes of meditation. Quiet meditation commonly refers to traditional seated meditation but includes any meditative form where you're not moving. Active meditation refers to meditating while in motion in the midst of daily life.  Active meditation is considered more advanced and confers the advantage of not having to set aside a special time and place to meditate. Another great benefit is that once you have mastered being able to meditate wherever you are, you can begin to use meditation as a therapeutic coping mechanism to recover from unexpected surprises right on the spot and as a method of improving your way of communicating and behaving. In a word, active meditation is both healing and empowering.  Practically speaking, however, in order to get to this level we first have to learn how to meditate in a variety of physical postures. So today I'll share with you the method of meditating in a standing position.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hwansan-sunim/how-to-meditate-standing-_b_6273180.html   Would you like to explain more? Does your practice of mantra recitation differ when standing to alternative postures? If so, could you say how?   Thank you, that's all very helpful. It's something I'd like to focus more on though I don't believe it is much practised in my particular sangha - it certainly isn't taught at a formal level to the extent of my knowledge. I was just looking to accrue any information on the topic so I had some more sense of the tradition/context before broaching the subject with my fellow sangha members and/or exploring the practice by myself.   Thank you again - I shall be investigating further. My interest was sparked in part by someone I met on retreat who said that when meditating outdoors he felt he got a lot of merit from a process of engaging in sitting meditation followed by standing meditation followed by walking meditation and repeating this once. Furthermore, there will be a retreat next year with a 'theme' of the archetype of the king and I thought that  a practice of standing meditation could in some way contribute. I believe my intuition came from how Nelson Mandela wrote in his autobiography of his experience seeing Haile Selassie:  The conference was officially opened by our host, His Imperial Majesty, who was dressed in an elaborate brocaded army uniform. I was surprised by how small the emperor appeared, but his dignity and confidence made him seem like the African giant that he was. It was the first time I had witnessed a head of state go through the formalities of his office, and I was fascinated. **He stood perfectly straight**, and inclined his head only slightly to indicate that he was listening. **Dignity was the hallmark of all his actions.**  The head inclining is contrary to the Buddha's 'elephant look' but I believe the rest could be evoked in a way congruent with right intention and I hope right view and action.   Feel free to comment further if you'd like.   Thank you. That's helpful. That's not something that I would have noticed. What is obvious to some is not obvious to others.  Also fog does appear at Beachy Head. That this particular image was touched up does not repudiate that. Though of course these are two separate issues.

From thy projecting head-land I would mark  Far in the east the shades of night disperse,  Melting and thinned, as from the dark blue wave  Emerging, brilliant rays of arrowy light  Dart from the horizon; when the glorious sun  Just lifts above it his resplendent orb.  Advances now, with feathery silver touched,  The rippling tide of flood; glisten the sands,  While, inmates of the chalky clefts that scar  Thy sides precipitous, with shrill harsh cry,  Their white wings glancing in the level beam,  The terns, and gulls, and tarrocks, seek their food,  And thy rough hollows echo to the voice  Of the gray choughs, and ever restless daws,  With clamor, not unlike the chiding hounds,  While the lone shepherd, and his baying dog,  Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock.  *  The high meridian of the day is past,  And Ocean now, reflecting the calm Heaven,  Is of cerulean hue; and murmurs low  The tide of ebb, upon the level sands.

From [Caroline Lucas' interview in today's Guardian:](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/28/caroline-lucas-im-not-playing-about)  In May, she might well make trouble for the mainstream political parties. Lucas knows that if the Greens have a good election, it could be bad news for Labour and result in a Conservative victory. She says that a second Tory term is the last thing she wants, but, in the long term, it could be the best thing possible for the Greens if Labour lost. That wouldnt be the outcome I wished for. But I would think, Now, for heavens sake, Labour, you have to embrace electoral reform because we are operating under a voting system that is creaking at the seams, that is not fit for purpose. This would probably come in some form of proportional representation, which could only empower the Greens.  I can see the logic and think it might galvanise some former Labour voters toying with voting Green.          There are references to the color blue throughout recorded history.

 You just summed up the logic of every Empire player in Star Wars The Old Republic haha!   You bastard and your sick reference. Have a damn upvote.   20 yo as well checking in. Used to come home after middle school and watch it.   That's called the "Steve Jobs" lifestyle   My girlfriend is actually the true definition of curvy, with thinner waist and round hips, but she wants to lose some weight still.  Honestly I hope this fat acceptance craze dies down and people realize that leading a healthier lifestyle will better them. Im not saying everyone has to be a supermodel, but knowing the health risks of being overweight and trying to make a healthier you will lead to better happiness.   Thats why its so much easier to be an individual. Its kinda like "piss on you guys, I'm gonna go be not judgy over there."   Growing up as a kid who took technology and gaming quite seriously and competitively, I can confirm. I'm in culinary school and I remember jack shit on the job, constantly asking questions on stuff I know I should have memorized. Working on retraining a proper memory sucks.   Now I'm a bit of a fanboy for J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson, I loved all the movies for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (the last is a better book though), but it will be a veeery cold day in hell before I read Fellowship of the Ring again.  Let me summarize; rolling green hills of The Shire, birthday party, Frodo gets the ring, rolling green hills of The Shire, walk around The Shire, rolling green hills of The Shire, Ring Wraiths, rolling green hills of The Shire, Tom Bombadil, a freaky forest... rolling green hills of The Bloody, God Damn Shire.  It continues like this for nearly the entire book. For anyone that has seen the movie before the book, you will get a third of the way through it and start getting annoyed that they arent out of The Shire yet, but wait, there's more of it!   I met Michael Buble at a bakeshop near my college last year. He was placing an order for an afterparty for his concert the next day, all the staff were posing and he had a bakers hat on.  Dude looks hella old when he has no makeup and a week's scruff on his face.   Even so, that'd be a cool urban legend for a music legend.   *Red October, shtanding by.   I have 4 knives I commonly use. And it's a nice little French restaurant   Being a cook at a restaurant, I'd rather have 10000 spoons than 10 knives. Spreads sauces so much faster, and I'm always running out of spoons.   600 000 population of Vancouver? Is The Guardian only counting West Vancouver?? We have more that than over here in Winnipeg; the Vancouver most Canadians think of includes Surrey, Burnaby, etc.   All that screaming is just for cameras. Chefs can be sued now for unhealthy working environments and abuse.  Also, as a cook in the fine dining industry, to hell with competitive cooking. That is not what food is about. Every level headed chef will tell you all food has a time and place.  Duck confit? Delicious French cuisine. Shitty McBurger? Good drunk food. It doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it. One of those cooks might brew up the best recipe for braised cow tongue, but if no one wants it, who cares?   I hate elo hell!!!  No, I did not steal your kill with my rocket grab, I secured the kill you couldn't be bothered to aa for the kill!  I've taken a liking to playing balls deep aggressive Blitzcrank support, and the last few games have been nothing but adcs with zero follow up. I literally set up double kills and all the adc has to do, but doesn't, is show up, use an ability and aa, and bam, time to kill a turret.   With so many issues with bad cyclists, bad drivers not respecting cyclists, and everything, I can't see how jurisdictions haven't made it law to regulate ALL road transportation, including cyclists.  Example, last year there was a cyclist that caused and died in a three car pile up during busy traffic near the city football stadium because making a left into incoming traffic is always a good idea.   In the same vein, if you're not on a major unlit highway, turn your damn highbeams off. I'm sick of being in parking lots and side streets late at night and being half blind the whole time.  Unless there's a catastrophic storm worth of rain or snow pouring in the city, regular lights work just fine!   Anyone else remember the heavy compaigning by Bond fans to replace Craig as soon as they announced him as the new 007? When Casino Royale was released, Craig nailed the performance and won over a ton of angry fans.   Even though they stole them from great mother Belgiumland!!   I love hanging out with my friends and playing some games, watch a movie, get some takeout, whatever. Sometimes we split a few bowls, chat, and have a great time. Never once has anyone talked about how much they did/could smoke or harassed the others about doing more. Its entirely about the social experience for us and we love it. And we don't get together for the high, usually its to hang out or have a barbecue, fun stuff.  Edit: we aren't even typical stoners; I'm in college to be a chef, my best bro is a entertainer, and our friends are university students for engineering, music, etc.   The girl I'm seeing did this to me, or so I thought. I found out days later she was recovering from a minor heart attack (gotta love those health conditions) and otherwise loved that I was so concerned for her.   Even some of the microbrews can be hit and miss on the prairies. Personally I prefer European imports, except Guinness, that just tastes like tar.   Of course my mind imagines this as a thing between Carol and Krieger and his van...   I dont know if the mind would register the pain different when pushing out a 6 or 10 pound ham.   Getting a new car changed my life.  Spend a day in my life, what sounds better? 2 hours on a bus that smells like alcohol, piss, and wasted lives? Or 15 minutes (exact same route) jamming out to your own music like you dont care?   Manitoba checking in. Storm drains finally cleared of all the snow melt.

Ive been binging Archer lately and read that in Sterlings voice.   I have no sources to support my thoughts, but i think boys and men generally lack a creative mind without training it. We prefer preset objectivesthat are achieved in a stimulating manner (the classic "whats the job/task/quest/whatever and how do i do it in an awesome way?). I think this is partly why the gaming community is so dominated by guys.   I must be the only one having a good time with Bell. I got my plan upgraded, cut the price to student rates, an extra year of insurance, and i got the phone i wanted for zero dollars. I will never go back to MTS, with their awful customer service, failed tech support/repairs, and overpriced/useless data plans on cheap brands no one in the western world has heard of.   I have never seen such a misinformed post in my reddit experience.  Yes climate change is a big deal, but its definitely not very big as to why US is running short on water.  Many of the surface water sources are polluted, aquifers are nearly drained to sustain cities that shouldn't exist, such as Las Vegas and parts of California.  Whenever a governing body deems there is an excess of a water source (there is no such thing when it is one of the few things sustaining life on earth), they sign really shitty contracts to sell to Nestle for next to nothing.  The US is running out of water because of decades of corruption, greed, and mismanagement.   Ugh, can pop/rap/hip hop finish its phase so real talent can be mainstream again?  I've rocked out so many times to the likes of No Doubt, Paramore, Save Ferris, etc.   I'm 20, not like I've had a few shirts with his face on for a couple years...   How about we trade Minnesota for Alberta?   Back when warcraft 3 was a thing i met a guy from atlanta that didn't know north dakota existed....   My guess is Havanese (spelling?). My aunt has one and he's just adorable and full of energy.

Journey has way better in their catalog than Don't Stop Believing. And none of it is so called arena rock garbage.  Lots of ballads actually, with some randomness thrown in.   Went to see a movie this week with a friend. I was distracted and just followed her into the theatre room, found seats, sat for half an hour before realizing we're in the wrong room.  Sidebar, what are those rooms called? We don't really have a word for it in my area; the whole building is a theatre and each room showing a film is a theatre.   Which aren't even French. They're Belgian.   I'm always tired, cut some slack   As a cook, thi... wait, wrong thread.   Playing both league and wow, I agree. 10% margine of error isnt terrible. Same for wow, so many people complain about nerfs to dps for certain classes/specs every patch, but nearly ever time all specs are within 5% of each other, so all specs are viable to an extent.

       Yesterday I thought the OP and many commenters had said everything that needed to be said, but then my half-asleep musings in the night brought up some more.  He needs to know how important humor is, both in relationships generally and in sex specifically.  In both cases there will be little awkward moments and laughing is the best way to get trhough them.  Talking openly is really key to both relationships and sex.  Being able to say "I've never done this before' or 'I'm pretty nervous, let's slow down and talk for a while' will stand him in good stead.  Also 'I really like it when you move that way' and 'Would this be even better if I were a little slower?'  Without getting too technical and jargony, an acquaintance with the stages of arousal,  la Masters and Johnson, would be useful.  He needs to know that women are for the most part more varied in their sexual response than men.  Many don't orgasm from PIV sex alone and it's unlikely with a girl during her first time.  In fact, he would do well to see that she orgasms first and waits to enter until she invites him in.  Frank talk would help here, telling her that that's what he wants, that they have plenty of time, that they can wait for another time.  You could watch some movies with him with those scenes of ripping off clothes, falling into bed and having stupendous simultaneous orgasms, and let him know how unrealistic they are.    You're doing a great job and I hope his first time is wonderful for them both.                  Start with "Spanish" then "Advanced".  I haven't used the others.               Michel Thomas is not just about teaching phrases.  His is very much a grammatical based approach.  He puts it in context much better than conjugation charts.

So is the bot in error?  Could the bot be made smarter so as to allow original content from Salon?

You may want to exclude the politico-economic aspects of technology from this subreddit, but others of us don't.   Michel Thomas teaches grammar in useful ways, without concentratiing on rules (at least in Spanish).                        The comments haven't addressed the issue that the exchanges are in breach of contract by not providing timely or accurate information.  What about that aspect?         No, I'm just referring to languages that don't distinguish inclusive from exclusive, such as English and Spanish.  I'm sure there are gender differences also in whether a person says *I* or *we* when their partner is not present.  What I'm wondering is if the language used influences this.   For example, I leave my wife in our room and go to the hotel desk where I say 'We need such-and-such."  There are regional and cultural differences in using the singular or plural in such cases but I also suspect that different languages may be more inclined to use one or the other.  Is this true?  What is this phenomenon called so I could research it?               Other quotes from the 'conversation':  *  When you write you should pretend that you, the writer, see something in the world that's interesting, that you are directing the attention of your reader to that thing in the world, and that you are doing so by means of conversation.   *  The controversy between "prescriptivists" and "descriptivists" is like the choice in "America: Love it or leave it" or "Nature versus Nurture"--a euphonious dichotomy that prevents you from thinking.  *  Overcoming the curse of knowledge may be the single most important requirement in becoming a clear writer.   *  You've got to show people a draft.

I don't think the mask does any focusing.  At 3:45 into the video, Professor Merrifield says "... by the time you get to the hard x-ray end and gamma ray end of things, nothing you can do will focus the light effectively ... All the mask does is throw a shadow."  So the mask only tells you what direction each x-ray or gamma ray point source is coming from.  They must use some sort of deconvolution algorithm that processes the multiple copies of the overlaid/shifted mask shadows striking the sensor to determine the position of each source.  I imagine without the ability to focus, the telescope's resolution is limited by the sensor's pixel size and is not very high.

The incoming call data from Nomorobo users powers the detection algorithm.    That being said, your personal data is never shared with anyone else. It's only used to detect when one number is calling LOTS of consumers. Then Nomorobo knows to blacklist it.    Did that answer your question in enough detail?    Aaron  Sounds like a credible business model.  I signed up and it was a fairly easy process.   That sounds like a great service (it won the FTC Robocall Challenge).  But I wonder what their business model is.  Are the users the product?                                                                        When you get your watch, open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, go to Privacy, select Motion   Fitness, then toggle off Heart Rate monitoring.     Apple was very careful about power conservation in designing the Apple Watch.  The Watch activates infra-red LEDs to measure heart rate during normal (non workout) activity which requires additional power and reduces battery life.  Apple probably made a trade-off between battery life and how often heart rate is needed during normal activity and arrived at 10 minutes as the balance.  Still, it would be nice if the user could set the heart rate sample interval.        Yeah, it does seem odd.  During workouts the green LEDs stay on continually even though they are sampling heart rate every 10 seconds.  It may be that the sample window is 10 seconds long but every 10 seconds the watch repeats the sample so the entire timeline is filled with sampling, it's just updated every 10 seconds.    I have found that if I forget to end a workout and accidentally leave the green LEDs on, the battery drain is significant.  The only times I have run out of power in less than a day is when I've forgotten to end a workout.   Regarding your statement  I agree that if it's inaccurate that this would be a wise move. However, I do not see why this would be the case if we are relying on the heart rate sensor during work out.  Your first sentence makes sense, but the second sentence implies the heart rate sensor used during normal activity is the same as the one used during a workout.  This is not the case.  The heart rate sensor used during normal activity is a pair of infra-red LEDs that sample heart rate every 10 minutes while the sensor for workouts uses green LEDs to measure heart rate every 10 seconds.  The latter method is designed to be more reliable in measuring heart rate than the first at the expense of drawing more power from the battery.  Edit: Correction that the infra-red LEDs are not passive - they emit infra-red energy that is detected by the same photodiodes used to detect the green LED energy.                                                                                      	159
 **1775: Rebellion** isn't necessarily gateway, but it's actually pretty light and a lot of fun. It's basically a move and battle game with good tactics. And it's history based. The rulebook offers a lot of history behind the cards and events too which is great.    **Pandemic** is a very popular game that is lighter and cooperative so can help with the community engagement. The dice version, **Pandemic: The Cure** is great too.   **Takenoko** is a great gateway game. Light, has some depth of strategy and is beautiful looking. It's one of very few games I can get my SO to play. Appeals to a large demographic.   **Bohnanza** is one of my favorites. Very easy to learn, social trading game. Lots of fun.   **Hanabi** is a great social game. Very cheap too.    **Lords of Vegas** maybe. Just a fun game. Some strategy, but mostly just a fun, crazy time of building casinos, gambling and rolling dice.    Some other party games like **Wits   Wagers**, **Time's Up!**, **Concept**, **Mascarade**, **Pictomania** and **Snake Oil** are all great options too. Tons of fun there.  edit: pandemic mix up   /u/r2d8 getinfo   You're going to have to narrow it down a little.

Haven't played it myself, but it has ships that do ship things I guess.    **Le Havre** technically has a port/nautical theme, and regardless of theme it's a phenomenal game.   **Amerigo** is a great Feld game where you discover new lands and develop trade routes etc.    **Black Fleet** is also a lot of fun, and a little lighter if you want.   /u/r2d8 getinfo   "NHL To Seattle" doesn't sound like a biased website at all.

Not sure why I'm being downvoted lol   I don't think I have ever seen a "the team that wins Game X wins the series Y% of the time" that was not in their favor. Every single time the winner of a given game has won the series more often than not. I'm sick of these stats.    After Game 1 all I heard for Blackhawks was "the team that wins game 1 wins the stanley cup 284456% of the time." After Game 2 for Lightning, "the team that wins Game 2 has never allowed a goal ever again." After Game 3, "any team that has won Games 2 and 3 of Finals is automatically given the cup and enshrined in Valhalla for eternity."    I wouldn't even break it up into sessions. You'd still have to sit through 2-3 hours of video to watch someone play a game. People won't do that. Even Rahdo trims his down to under an hour and then gives a separate link if you really want to watch the extended gameplay. Look at what TableTop does in a lot of their videos...at some point they typically have an 'In the interest of time..." cut montage. And in the normal span of the video, they've edited out down time in the gameplay.    If you want people to watch your videos, just a bit of advice for you...   No one has ever woken up one day and said "I'd like to watch a two and a half hour still cam video of someone playing Smash Up."    As soon as I saw that run time, it was a big nope. Need to learn to edit and trim it down to a manageable viewing experience.

Have expensive shipping: people complain  Negotiate new low-rate deal with Fed-Ex: people complain.    All good games, but personally I'd absolutely lean to **Eclipse**, especially with 4x. It's a beautifully designed game. It scales well, you can feel the game escalate as you go, there are lots of different viable paths to victory. Battle is a lot of fun, and the alien races really help to further mix it up and add variety.    Thank you, this was the answer I was looking for.    Rule #14 - if your artwork displays non-white people, someone somewhere will find a way to think it's a racist depiction of that race.       How is your beard?

But I have some friends that I just can't get to sit down for those, and Stone Age will fit a nice medium niche for me. I have lots of heavy stuff.   That's a sweet old card table. Great find. It's a card table so any kind of 4P trick taking game would be perfect...**Ticchu**, **Diamonds**, **Chimera** (3P). Small 2P games would be great too: **Jaipur**, **Targi**, **Battle Line**, **Hive**, **The Duke**, **Race For the Galaxy**.  Other 2-4P games that don't take up much room that I can think of quickly...**Blueprints**, **Dominion**, **Bohnanza**, **Love Letter** (or any micro game), **Forbidden Desert**, **Hanabi**, **Scrabble**, **King of Tokyo**, **King of New York**, **Spyrium**.    /u/r2d8 getinfo   Great point.

The game objectives and secret objectives mix it up so much, and the group dynamic has such a high delta, I just roll with it each time. Have fun, mix it up! Enjoy the crossroads, doing new things.

You can find plenty of comparison threads in this sub on all the expansions. and www.dominionstrategy.com as well has tons and tons of info   You're factually untrue.   ^^nailed ^^it.   I think Intrigue is the better game. Slightly more advanced cards, ~~more player interaction~~, a bit more depth to strategy and variety in the kingdoms. You won't go wrong either way, but I'd give an edge to Intrigue.    edit: not more player interaction. I'm wrong. Taken from the Dominion Wiki...   "Intrigue developed a somewhat unfounded reputation as a highly attack-heavy expansion: in actuality, Intrigue contains fewer Attack cards than the base set and fewer than the next expansion, Seaside. This reputation arises in part from the fact that the Attack cards Intrigue does have all have a reputation as particularly annoying attacks to get hit by (even the relatively weak Saboteur, which is unpleasant out of proportion to how effective it is), and in part because it has some non-Attack cards (Masquerade and Tribute) that affect players in ways that occasionally make them feel like they're being attacked."   the fuck is motivating about this?

Instead of just having 'Tokyo' as the board, the board is all 5 burroughs of NYC, and Manhattan acts as 'Tokyo.' If you're not in Manhattan, you have to be in one of the other burroughs, so everyone is always on the board. Each burrough also gets 3 stacks of 3 tiles that act as buildings on one side that you can knock over (the dice are different in KoNY). You can get points/energy/hearts for knocking them over but once you destroy a building, it releases military vehicles/tanks/planes that can attack you, so it litters danger for your monster all over the board (you can also defeat these with die rolls).   It adds more strategic decisions besides just "to punch or not to punch" and "get points." It's great.    You know you can spend 2 energy to clear the current cards and draw new ones, right?

             People are loosing their minds over this issue. Whatever you beliefs are you have the right to express them regardless if I agree with you or not. For example, recently there was a group of individuals who beat up a man carrying the Army of Tennessee flag. Here is a link to the video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REM54O04KXE   nbsp;  It is a shame the people that cheer on this kind violence and destruction of property that isn't theirs.    If you make a poster that I disagree with and consider rude, because what is rude is subjective, do I have the right to assault you and destroy your property. Funny how left-wing extremists such as yourself only support free speech when it is something that you agree with but not for others with whom you disagree with.   	6

Even something as normal as a party is pretty weird if you're tripping and around a bunch of sober/drunk people. I can't even imagine what the Oscars is like.   Dude I can't believe they did that.

Going a step further, it might be possible to convince people they will be safer using it when they aren't really high risk for getting frostbite. By convincing parents to use it to keep their children playing outside in the snow safe or convincing skiers they might regret not using it, you might be able to get a much larger market.

Yeah for sure I'd love a couple song suggestions for each band. Since I already listen to and love Arcade Fire, Grouplove and Bloc Party maybe not those bands. All I know by Miike Snow is Animals so I'd be down to listen a different song by them(him?). Anyways appreciate it always love finding new music.   Any specifics songs you could recommend to start with? Loving The High Road right now thanks to /u/aesthetic-as-fuck.   You can throw Phoenix, Matt   Kim, Citizen Cope, Noah and the Whale, Death Cab, and LCD Soundsystem in there too.

I'd love to hear some recommendations of songs along the same lines as New Slang or these songs.   *  Vampire Weekend- especially [Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mDxcDjg9P4)/[Unbelievers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIcjA5ykloI)/[A-punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XC2mqcMMGQ)/[Oxford Comma ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g) * The Kooks especially [Naive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkaMiaRLgvY)/[She moves in her own way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pquhYpGHrlw)   * Cold War Kids especially [Hospital Beds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyhkQzPLjcA) or [Louder than ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRFo2GvpSCs)   I'd place so hard all over that girls face   Instead of bridges and public works my vote would be to move the money into education. We need to start giving teachers a reasonable salary. Granted this wouldn't be creating new jobs but I think our education system is absolutely horrid compared to many developed nations.        I agree 100%. Airlines would rather not pay for security than have to pony up some money and they're not losing any money because of the TSA so they're not gonna fight it. Any senator or congressman who brings up abolishing the TSA is going to pay a heavy price in the election when their opponent spins it into saying they want any other 9/11 or don't care about America. Its not gonna change anytime soon unfortunately.    Terrible dance moves and creepin super hard on Katy Perry is just so Place.    the most successfully performing passenger screening program weve had over the last decade  Isn't this the **only** passenger screening program we've had over the last decade? Its also the least successful performing passenger screening program of the past decade too...   I disagree. We need a bit of airport security, like what it was pre-9/11.   I would not trust almost anyone who works at the TSA to build a bridge that is safe honestly. Maybe with competent supervisors but most don't seem like the type to do physical labor. Not too it wouldn't be a good thing for them, a lot definitely need the exercise.    You're just all over the place with your apostrophes here. You only need to put one of those when you are signifying possession, not making a word plural.     Yeah man, I'm a somewhat quiet guy, I've only been asked this like a single time luckily.   I think you just gotta answer confidently with something like this 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'. or 'I dunno man, guess I'm just one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'.   If the person who asks you is an asshole who talks to an excess and it seem like they are insulting you this one is a bit less nice  'Well I'm one of those people who only talks when *I actually have something to add to the conversation*'     It's probably the best answer. You can say it in one of two ways, 'I dunno man I guess I'm just one of the people that only talks when I have something to add to the conversation'. Or if the guy who's asking the question is a loud asshole that talks excessively 'Well I'm one of those people who only talks when I *actually have something to add to the conversation*'      And if you do try to jump in and someone else starts talking over you don't take it as an insult. This is just how group dynamics work. After that person is done talking and if your question or thought is still relevant try again in a bit more of an assertive manner. Odds are no one is actively trying to be rude to you, they are much more concerned with themselves and getting what they want to say in than being rude to you.   Asking this isn't always done with ill intentions. There's a possibility they legitimately are trying to include you in the conversation and just don't have the social graces to realize this is an offensive question. Since they're not quiet people the fact that this might be rude just never crosses their mind.    This is all contextual. If the person who asks you this is kind of an asshole who is one of those people that talks to an excess and they seem like they are insulting you you could say 'I'm one of those people who only talks when I actually have something to say'. This might make tensions a little high so be careful with that.   If you're in a group of people many of whom you don't know well you might say 'I'm one of those people who will talk your ear off if you get to know me but it takes me a little bit for me to warm up to groups of people'.   It you want to make a morbid joke that will make people really uncomfortable unless they realize your joking which they probably won't say 'Been like that since the accident man'. Actually don't say that one.   Really option number 2 is your best bet unless you feel really insulted in which case I'd go with number 1.      Now we are getting into semantics but the way I see it in this case they are one in the same.   For me it was Charlie from Its Always Sunny  Obviously from that court episode where Charlie and Frank are caught naked and stuck in a chimney after trying to break into the Rodin museum. They were hoping to consult The Thinker when he comes alive that night to settle a domestic dispute. To explain why they weren't breaking and entering of course they tell the court a fantastical story.   Like any other night Charlie and Frank were hanging out under the bridge after a long nights romp in the sewers. Charlie is given a book of spells by a friendly ghoul while Frank scavenges for bird eggs to eat. As Frank and Charlie begin to feast on the scavenged dove eggs, Charlie reads a spell that just so happens to be written in drawings and scribbles. Due to the eggs they are eating and Charlie's expertise for bird law the spell turns both Frank and Charlie into doves. They fly around the city for a while until a hawk, who obviously does not give a shit about bird law, starts hunting them. Fleeing for their life they find the nearest chimney to hide. The spell soon wears off and since their human clothes fell off when they became birds they are trapped naked in that chimney. Obviously they are completely not at fault and not dismissing the case would be like endorsing black magic. Charlie motions to counter sue the city of Philly for allowing black magic in the city limits and also to sue the hawk for flagrant disregard of birdlaw.   Just noticed this but your username is actually incredibly relevant.   This is possibly the worst thing you can ask a quiet person. People have no empathy a lot of the time and really never consider other's point of view.    People... What a bunch of bastards.   Its scissors about to cut off some dudes dick.   The prk probe hybridized with a metaphase chromosome in slug larvae, confirming gene transfer between alga and slug.  That is from the abstract of the paper. I'm not sure exactly how they confirmed it was lateral gene transfer though. I'd like to see just how similar the gene is between the slug and alga because you can't rule out this happening from a mutation of a already present gene in the slug.   I don't understand your point, that is completely irrelevant.   We are going to be able to do things in a decade or two with genetics that we can barely fathom right now. It will be like someone from 1995 trying to imagine this smart phone I am using right now to type this response. I'm convinced what the digital revolution did to our lives, a biological revolution will do to the younger generation.            What really convinced me was the guy who **worked at area 51** and spoke 7 languages telling OP to stop investigating! That dude is obviously completely legit, this is reallyspooky.^(twilight zone music) My internet conspiracy sense is tingling! That definitely justifies severely harassing the poor owners of some shitty daycare center who may very likely have done absolutely nothing wrong.   This reminds me a bit of the boston bombing...             I think we found a sympohorophiliac.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphorophilia   Looking at the preview of a wikipedia link with noembed, that looks like exactly what ReddHub uses to accomplish this.   Yeah I had the DK2 as well, unfortunately we had to cannibalize it for a senior design project but I got to play around with it for 2 months or so before we did that. Got reimbursed for it by my school too!  I can't wait for something like Pixar movies that are compatible with the rift, its gonna be fucking awesome to see an ACTUAL 3D movie.   Hasn't Musk mentioned he has an idea about how to pre-manufacture stretches of highway or something like that to cut down on road renovation times? I think its all because he has to sit through traffic construction on a highway near him all the time and it annoys him. Saw this mentioned in some other SpaceX thread.   I know but many times it is not the highest upvoted reply to the comment so it is fairly far down the line from where the link was posted. This would just make things a bit more streamlined and when I saw the feature in ReddHub I thought it would be really cool in RES too.   Just wanted to confirm that it is in fact ctrl+left click on Windows for anyone wondering.   The ReddHubV2 app for Windows 8 has a really neat feature, a Wikipedia expando that is very similar to a video or picture expando. It displays the text of the linked section or if the entire page is linked  it shows the article summary in-line with the comment but in a box of its own, kind of like how the self-post expandos work when you are browsing the frontpage of a subreddit. It is incredibly useful and I just thought it would be very cool in RES too. The presences of /u/autowikibot shows that Reddit users like to be able see the wiki text without actually clicking the link and it makes a lot of sense to have something like this.   If you ever have wanted to know how to build a farm on Mars out of a little bit of earth dirt and your own shit, this book is the way to learn it. Seriously though amazing book. Coolest part is its scientific accuracy, Weir is already smart as shit already and NASA scientists sent him proofs outlining why some of the things in the earlier edition of his book wouldn't actually work and these things were changed so it is incredibly accurate.   I realize that, I'm just saying its not like they're gonna have no idea what  is going on on the surface of mars.   If(when? I have faith!) Musk can get humans to mars I guarantee NASA will at least be able to get a couple satellites there by then.    Atlanta, the only place I have ever been rear ended and gotten a little sorry wave from the driver who proceeded to then just drive away. Granted it was in bumper to bumper  traffic on 75/85 at less than 5 mph and there was no structural damage but still what the fuck.    For example if I posted a comment which netted me 53 karma right before I went to bed, when I load up reddit the next day I would see a green (+53) next to my current comment karma in the display at the top of each reddit page. If it was -53, it would be red. Same deal with each refresh.  Not sure if this would be possible but I figure you could maybe store the current karma client-side at each page load and then do a quick calculation to see how it has changed. If reddit's fuzzing algorithm would mess up the small increments of 1 or 2 comment karma maybe just make it so it only happens if a sizable karma change is detected.   Not to mention we are just now starting the 'biological revolution', what with understanding (kind of) how genetics works and with the abilities to interface machines and our bodies. At least as a biomedical engineer with research experience in bioinformatics and computational genomics I think that this will be the next digital revolution and right now we can't even comprehend what will be possible in the next few decades in this field. Kind of like how many people in the 60s and 70s could not possibly have fathomed the smartphone I am using to communicate to people halfway across the world right now.    All their children, who were 7/8ths white  I assume you mean Thomas Jefferson's children's (from the slave) children? Even then wouldn't that be 3/4ths though unless the slave was only 1/2 black as well? Just confused where the 7/8ths came from.     Not sure if it's the same everywhere but in America we call it 'grounding' not 'earthing'. Somewhat pedantic but just wanted to let you know in case you're not a native speaker. If I'm wrong and this is the correct UK terminology ignore this post.    He meant "boy" as in friend, not "boy" as in son just to clear that up for you.   Power through the gore in GoT, its worth it for sure and maybe you can take solace in the fact that its just acting and special effects, although that doesn't really help me sometimes. It, along with House of Cards, is in a whole other league than any other shows when it comes to TV series quality.    Why not couple a parachute with thrusters to achieve zero velocity on landing and make the trajectory somewhat predictable?   Yeah I'd say its by far easier to adjust the barge than the rocket   Good point, if you can land on a not quite stationary barge in the middle of an ocean you can do a land landing with ease. It's a test of sorts and lets them tweak the process to ensure the safety of landing that are near cities and populated areas.   What if you drained the "ball pit" and had some sort mechanism to either move the rocket to a launch pad nearby or made the ball pit the launchpad and elevated the bottom to ground level before relaunch?      Out of curiosity how to they plan to land it on land eventually? Different orbit trajectory or launch site or both? Or is this info privy to only Elon Musk and his team.    Out of curiosity how to they plan to land it on land eventually? Different orbit trajectory or launch site or both? Or is this info privy to only Elon Musk and his team.   What? You don't necessarily need a soft landing on a stable surface, you just need a landing where you don't break a lot of shit. That means either slowing the first stage down to 2m/s as the plan is now, or /u/clarkclarks's idea where you distribute the impact over a longer period of time and thus have less impact stress on the landing. It's not a bad idea although I'd be surprised if the people at SpaceX hadn't thought of it and ruled it out for some reason.   No plan survives contact with the enemy?   Here's a link to start at the right time just to make life a little easier for those lazy shits like me.  http://youtu.be/M-lOh2fwD0c?t=5m45s   I haven't watched the video since yesterday, so I might be wrong but doesn't he run immediately through the door to the right?   As others have said the plan was probably to have two people enter. That guy was the first and would have moved along the wall towards the right side of the room. A second person would enter and move along the wall towards the left. This is to establish tactical dominance and multiple lines of fire. This obviously fell apart when the officers encountered immediate fire and a clear line of sight to the fucking human piece of shit terrorist. This was the outcome.   Zojack Quasith      I'd say phase I and II are the biggest hurdles and where most treatments get weeded out, so I'd say there's a definite possibility this gets approved. Good to hear.   Before any type of treatment can be made widely available, it's efficacy and safety must be proved. This process occurs through the following phases and can take years or even decades:  * Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.  * Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.  * Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.  * Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use.   I'm not exactly sure what phase this trial was, but it is either I or II and although it looks promising the long term effects simply are not definitively known yet. This treatment is especially extreme, very expensive and taxing on the body. It would be highly irresponsible to start treating a large population of patients with something that has not been proven safe or effective yet. Like you mentioned, there is a high probability that this "miracle cure" doesn't pan out for whatever reason and if this is because of serious health side effects, you want to find that out before you give it to a bunch of people who are not in immediate life-threatening danger. Unfortunately this is just how science and medicine work and sometimes it seems pretty callous. Maybe you can take solace in the fact that others may not have to suffer the way your cousin did due to treatments like this one.   For sure. I'm not quite finished yet, I read ~240 pgs in just two sittings. I've got a degree in engineering and the science is incredibly accurate as far as I can tell too. Overall amazing book.  Edit: Removed spoiler just in case. Sorry I hope I didn't ruin the book for anyone, didn't even think about it!    Just curious, how does this relate to chiropracty?   Agreed. I now know to make a farm on Mars with a little bit of earth dirt and my own shit.   The times they are a-changing      The sad thing is he probably knows how to do this kind of stuff but is Ryan place and of course won't help           	108
                            Here is some explain from Google http://www.businessinsider.com/what-happened-to-google-plus-2015-4     	11
 My ex-fiance's mother used to wear the same perfume all the time. She was a bitch, but I had a thing for her, so every time I smell it anywhere I get an odd mix of feelings surface.   Three times- the first time I met my newborn baby brother, and he grabbed my little finger with his tiny fist, and when I went for a random snorkel off of the boat tour I was on- a shark loomed straight out of the gloom, circled me a few times, then disappeared. Was amazing. The last time was at my Aunt's farm in outback Australia- a confluence of five storms met over the valley she lives in, and we were surrounded by lightning strikes all around- spectacular and terrifying all at once.   Smartphones, genuinely.  People would be more aware of everything around them, information would be harder to come by and therefore more rewarding to discover, and finally, I'd have never been cheated on if the ease of a smartphone's apps and Internet access hasn't made it possible for online relationships to blossom between strangers.   Fair enough- thanks for replying. I just started wondering after reading all of the CreepyPMs if women would have been put off by the constant jerks (no pun intended).   Are they mutually exclusive? I.e. If you liked their picture, but they had little or no writing, or if they had great writing content but no picture, would you still message them?   I know there are thousands of examples of CreepyPMs out there, so was wondering if you ever go on the offensive, as it were, and if so what would make you decide to reach out and risk it.   And given the number of creeps out there, what on a guy's profile makes you reach out? (More in comments)  Edit: Forgot to add qualifier; besides that person meeting your physical preferences.   Go to the police- report it immediately. No one deserves this; don't believe any of it for a second.   You are beautiful and unique, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.   Wow...just wow. Smoothest of the smooth! /s   Kudos on your responses OP! Seems like he was a young one, and rather inexperienced on the whole creeping thing. Give him time...   "Im not a creep" ...said every creep ever...   I hope he's here to see just how many people disagree with his warped point of view.  Seriously; you don't like me, therefore you're a man hater.  No my (and I use the term loosely) friend, I believe the derivative we can get from this exchange of messages is that you're an unhealthily sexist egotist. And that's just the bare minimum description!   Interesting - I was wondering if there have been any role reversal CreepyPMs, I guess this is close enough! Certainly answers my question of if there are any women who do similar things as we see here.   Apologies on behalf of the self-important prick- we're not all like that, and I'm sure you're lovely when engaged in conversation instead of ordered around and verbally assaulted.   Is speed an attractive quality when a woman wishes to watch a guy cumming? I doubt it.  Amazing some of the things these people try!   Personally like the comment box's suggestion "Write them a lovely message..." It's almost like it knows and has its own idiot-related sarcasm!   Don't feel bad- no matter the problems he's had, it's not okay to one-eighty with those kind of shitty accusations, even more so when you've not spoken for ages.   I seriously cannot compute how anyone can entertain imagining that this is a) okay, b) even appropriate or c) would interest anyone...   Was this just out of the blue, no prior contact either way?      By preparing I mean both for the course and the application process!      Thanks for this; answered everything I wanted clearly and concisely. Heading out now to try and source a decent boar bristle brush, and some oil.  Much appreciated.   A bit late to the suggestions table, but hate. If there's a reason she dislikes the mixed-bred races that fuels her passion, even if she's not a great rhetoric, a mob can easily form behind someone who is zealous enough in a singular belief. See most religions, even if your movement is more political, a lot of political and religious groups mirror each other without realising (or admitting) it.   Hey guys, I'm 25 and only just started to grow my beard and moustache out for the first time (properly).  The longest I've had it is a months growth, today sees it reach two months. My girlfriend trims it every two weeks for me, snipping the straggly hairs and split ends to keep it even, so I'm covered there, and I condition it every time I shower (5/6 times a week).  First question; I've read about JoJoba, Argan and Almond oils- do these have to be specifically labelled as for beard use, or can you buy some "normal" almond oil (for example, say from the cooking oils or health foods sections) and apply a few drops of that?  Second question- what type of brush would be a good substitute for the high-end brushes I've read about? We're backpacking so money's quite tight.  We live in Australia at the moment, for shop references we have Target, Woolworths, IGA and Big W in our town.  Will try and update/edit this soon with a picture, maybe even a before/after double. Thanks in advance for any advice and help!   I like the insecure rogue/thief/assassin- he/she's really doubtful of themselves, unsure of their place in the city/country/world, and absolutely certain there are people out there better than them.  They put on the "best ever ego" march to cover this up.  The humanity is what gets me, or at least emotion.   I find Pinterest SUCH an awesome help for pretty much everything. Combine fantasy with creature, race, myth, monster, anything you like really, and you'll get great results.  My own loves?  - Condors (also giant birds but a different species) - Manticores - Chimera (I love the variability of this one; pick your animals to mix together!)   I also like to think more of on the ground/underground, as a LOT of people give flying to the biggest bad-monster/creature.   Okay, so I've begun to finally get on top of my aches and pains. Thanks for the advice previously all who gave it.  Now, you've worked all week, getting dirty, achey and tired- what's your best remedy for recharging and resetting your body for another working week in your day/days off? What combination of food/meals/activities/rest cycles/doing nothing helps you come back into the next new week kicking?   Thanks for all the replies:  I worked in a warehouse lifting weights of up to 25KG for 8 hours 5/6 days every week for two and a half years, so I'm not unused physical labour.  I shower as soon as I get home, and socks and boxers are always clean on, as are my tops. My nails are always trimmed (I'm anal about them), but the dirt seems to get to a place my nail scrubber doesn't reach.  I will try and get my hands on some foot powder and coconut oil, and a ball or roller if I can find one. Thanks for the encouragement, where given- I'm determined to keep on keeping on!   Okay so I've been working on an Avocado farm for three weeks now. I shower daily after work and shower/condition my beard and hair as well.  My fingernails stay dirty, the skin around them is cracked, peeling, dead and dying, my fingers feel stiff and swollen (even though they're not), my joints ache and crack with most normal movements (knees and back/neck mainly), and the skin on the soles of my feet/toes is three times as worse as my fingers.  Does anyone have any hints/tips to help keep these areas healthy/in good condition during this period of rough working? I'm planning on staying at this farm for the full six months (I'm in Oz on a working holiday visa), so want to be able to keep working!  P.s. I need my hands glove-free for the work I do, so unfortunately that won't help (also, the initial skin death/peeling around my fingers started when I used gloves for weeding for a week).  Any help would be greatly appreciated.      Things I like;  The Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini Shadows of the Apt by Adrian Tchaikovsky Lincoln Ryhme Series by Jeffery Deaver Game of Thrones Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks Harry Potter ALL by Robin Hobb   So mainly Sci-fi and Fantasy, but I do read general fiction and crime too.   Thanks, good to know!   The horses are ones he's just stolen - he's setting them off down the road as a diversion, so I they won't be trained for it. Similarly I don't think he'd have the time (or the know-how) to set up a mechanical system for it. Thanks though!   Substitute the carrot for whatever piece of food you want; does it work? Would a horse or horses keep walking forward to try and gain the food continually?  I'm writing a story (set before modern technology), so wondered if this method would work to keep a horse/horses with cart moving forwards continuously for a long time?   Hmmm, does the carrot-on-a-stick type thing actually work IRL?   Like would there be a way to keep a whip cracking at them or something? My characters need to set the horses and cart to go on along the road without them in, and ideally the horses need to keep going for as long as possible. Is there a non-modern mechanism that would do this?   Like would there be a way to keep a whip cracking at them or something? My characters need to set the horses and cart to go on along the road without them in, and ideally the horses need to keep going for as long as possible.      Personally don't want to smell another person's pee, and definitely don't want to risk splashing myself with it after it's sat there for who knows how long.      Still, it's impressive :)  	42
 Make me 3..   I think that may be the car from the TV show called Fast N Loud..  There is a matching motorbike as well   Who?! Who doesn't want to wear the rrribon!   "I made dinner for you just the way you like it.. Perfect"   Makes me rage so much!   That's more of a bonus rather than a side-effect   To add a little more onto this, it  helps trigger us off at the same time (well for me anyways)   Timeless song.   Could be worse.. Could've been Sandstorm.   What's 25i?   This made me laugh way more than I should've. Well played, son.   Get a dog that will grow up to be short and fat, call him FDR    Keep in mind that the cold weather does have some bonuses, in Sydney we need to drive for hours to see any snow, and for the same price it would cost you to fly to Thailand, get 1 week accomodation and all food paid for, you get 3 days at the snow for that same price. Not including lift passes, food, equipment.    It's the middle of winter and it was a cool 19 degrees C today..    I don't know what you call it in the US, but that would have nothing but 'boot rattle!'    Which team was which?   She kept on saying "uhuh hunny" a lot..   Well said, even made me feel better than I did 5 mins ago.    Does the grate remove?   You're going to need to get into the piping and clear what's blocking it.  Their should be another drain in the middle of your bathroom floor, is the water overflowing from there? If not, its the pipe from your tub to that drain.  If the water won't drain from the tub, its too late to pop in a pipe cleaner liquid like Drano, you'll need to clear the blockage.   You may need to get yourself a snake (whatever you guys call it in the US) and break down the blockage.   When people breath through their nose and it makes that fucking whistling noise.   Not a quote but a scene..    Dale: 10:15 hank picks up Hal (into tape recorder)  Bill: What?

Slow shipping is what sucks    Thanks mate   Awesome clip.. Thanks for making it!  What are you using to cut the clips?   Ooohhhhhhh, now I get it.....   It is when you're using eftpos   Me too   Growing up in a European family, that smack is the first thing I would've copped after my parents checked I was OK.  Not sure why you're being downvoted.   The update wasn't worth the factory reset.. Kinda wished they at least gave us a new watch-face to chose from.  The Wifi bit is cool though.   The factory reset worked for me. I got the update straight after it.     No worries, thanks mate.  I'll wait patiently, it will drop sooner or later   Does your phone need to be on Wifi, or can it just be on 4G/LTE to pull the update?   That's a point to MS from your point of view, still doesn't change GNows ranking    Its like an episode of Seinfeld now, the one where George wants to use his comeback.   Still better than having nothing at all!   Yup, Verizon is Telstra.   Thanks mate. Was that your work?   Why? I don't need it to.   Verizon sounds like the Telstra of Australia.  I only buy Nexus devices because of the update schedule, except for the blip when Google released that heap of shit called 'Galaxy Nexus'.  Having carriers control the majority of the updates was a STUPID idea.   If pictures could make noise.. "WHOOOP WHOOOOP!"   Why didn't I know about this reply 30 years ago !   Yup.. My social media extends to Reddit. The end.  The new generation are getting dumber and more pretentious with social media backing them, to top it off, they are socially awkward as fuck.   Nope, can confirm first hand that Google Now is the champ.   Cortana is ok, but Google Now is vastly more polished.   With Android M, I'm hoping that Google Now can do more and more    haha, well then, it was directed to me, I just didn't understand how beams covered in wood got me a response about Diabetes and Obesity   That boy ain't right    ahuh, cool..   Make sure you put a nice stain on it, will look good when all done   err.. I think this reply was meant for someone else.   But thanks anyways, good to know!   What's up with that random timber box around your ceiling beam?   PS3??!!    The difference between a Mech and a Box mod..   I miss my Mech, but love the battery life of my regulated box mods.   I believe you buddy.   But, if you're lying, I'll hunt you down with my pitchfork.  So, explain to me what is different with the watch now? (Your credibility hangs on this)   It begins..   Next is a bunch of S-sheep lining up and camping for the next Phone.        Fair call, well, wish you the best with everything.   What about permanently tattooing them on?   Nah, that bar was put there to hide how fugly the AU falcon was   I answered the 3 questions honestly and it recommended the Nexus 6..   I have the Nexus 6.  I guess that's somewhat of a win.   It looks good though.. That's the only real reason I want it.. It would be rooted within minutes and would run some stock version of lollipop :)   The N6 is my pride and joy.. I have one, I was more talking about getting one as my work phone (paid for by work).. Might look at something else instead though! Thanks for the comment / review    I'm thinking I'll apply for the S6 edge for me.. I like what they've done.  I answer approx 30-40 calls a day averaging 5-10 mins a call, receive approx 50+ emails a day, watch YouTube whilst taking a dump (15 mins), receive / send ~ 200 sms.   (IT manager / on-call) the Nexus 6 wouldn't come close to what the dreaded iPhone offers for me.   If you can, try and hold them and see how you feel about them.  I have the Nexus 6, I love it, but I would never rely on it for heavy business use.  The G4 has been receiving awesome wraps lately.  The only downside is that you won't have pure stock Android with the other phones.   As much as everyone will argue it, the N6 is a gigantic phone with 'OK' battery life.  Be prepared for it, one handed use is a No, full day of battery won't happen.  I have a work phone as well as my personal, I can choose any phone I want, I HATE iOS, but for my work phone I use an iPhone 6.  I'm on the phone all day, including push emails, and the iPhone will die at 9pm from a 7am disconnect of charger.  The Nexus 6 at the same use would be dead at 3pm.  Get the Galaxy S6 edge and install the google launcher. I would've done the same but the S6 didn't exist at the time.   Props to you for having an actual credible reason to an incredible scenario.  I accidentally rubbed 100mg un flavoured Nic straight into my eye, you'll be fine.    Winrar.... Best free trial ever.   Yep, HTC have been a little cunty lately, especially when giving honest feedback on their products.  I use my Nexus 6 turbo charger on the 9 and it works fine.   Mine does this at 15%    I didn't think magpies had a nice bone in their evil swooping bodies   Steam E-Cigs in Mascot.. They're a good bunch   Technically anyone of any age can buy a mod online.  The B M's I visit, refuse to sell to minors.   Un-installed.  Thanks to other comments in here, I now have Opengur instead, a LOT better.   Not in Australia they didn't. They never do.    Cunts.   Directory assistance too   Awesome, thanks mate    Are most of them sideloadable APK's or do you need to flash the package from recovery?   Use nicvape for flavourless Nic.. Never let me down   I have the 12 edition since launch, its a little slow these days, but never bricked or skipped a beat.   Have replied to you via PM buddy. Pencil me in, give me a time and place and I'll meet you there.   Yeah me too.. I'm in. Happy to raise some awareness of vaping.  And no, I'm not a hipster that 'chucks clouds', I vape cause I hated smoking.    Looks great and all, but I'll suffer with this gigantic Nexus 6, until I see some front facing speakers on the new N5 or whatever other phone they release.   Huh?   The Simpsons.  It was one of those shows that I grew up with and can still quote line after line.  Ever since season 13ish onwards, it's been getting worse and worse.   The Lemo is a great tank, value for money, she's a great unit.  My B M I visit, use the lemo as the test tanks for all the units   Dripping isn't all its cracked up to be for me, you take away all the convenience of vaping.   You need to carry a bottle of juice with you and keep on priming the coils.  Flavour and clouds are good, but not good enough for me to drip full-time.  I have the subtank mini as well, and the flavour and clouds are brilliant, even better than the Kayfun I use. The only reason I prefer the Kayfun is because its tiny in size as I have the Bell-Cap on it   Me too.. I'm now at 14 months of vaping   He looks like that Canadian astronaut   Yup, I've been through the ranks where you kick off with an evod, then you get your regulated Vamo, then you chase power and clouds which gets you on RBA's / RDA's and a mech mod, I'm now at the final stage of settling with an istick and a cloupor.. That's it for me.  I don't need or want a 5909w unit to fire a stupid quad coil, Jean zipper, rip tripper build.  Kayfun, single coil micro, .8 ohm on a regulated LITTLE unit is all I need.   If you have bought organic cotton specifically for vaping, don't bother.  If you have cotton from a chemist etc, I boiled mine.   Some say flavor is better and others say it's to get rid of the treatment chemicals etc, I boiled a handful of cotton, strained all the pieces like a big ball in my hand them spread them out to dry in the sun.   That handful will last you forever as you only need a fraction of a cotton ball when wicking.  As for coiling over a screw? No good.. How will you slide the coil of if it's stick between the threads?  The aim of the game is to have it tightly wound with all the coils in a perfect row together. When you fire the unit, the coil should glow from the middle then out to the edges perfectly.   Kanthal is ready to rock straight off the roll, you'll fire it a couple times when you first build it, that will burn anything on there, straight off.   Get yourself a subtank mini from Kangertech.. It has coils that are pre-made, and gives you the option to build. This tank goes toe to toe with my Kayfun   Exactly the same here..    I've watched people burnt alive on liveleak, and it's this clip that had me cringing the most   I use 28g coil, 7 wraps over a 2mm drill bit gets me approx .8-9 ohms.   It's technically 'sub ohm' but not really. Flavor and vapor is perfect for me at 18w.  Depends what you're using to fire the tank, you won't need an ohm reader.   I have gone through all the units including multiple mech mods, now I'm sticking with an istick 30w and a cloupor mini as my all day drivers, both have an ohm meter built in.  Pm me or reply here and I'll try answer any fiddly questions for you from my own experience.  As much as the internet bashes Rip Trippers, his tutorial on basic coil building is all you will need.   If you quoted that all off the top of your head, you are the KOTH winner.  The "when shame eats too much stupidity" line, was my ultimate favourite in that rant.   Torrent.   Watch all the KOTH you want, without Ads or headaches.     The best part of this episode is when Hank allows Dale to let loose on Bill, but still makes sure that it's all above belt-ish.   Bill, have you been working out?   Hey, thanks Bro-bot.   uhh hmmmm.   What part of this is cringe?  The guy tried and got shot down.   These days no one knows how to talk face to face anymore    So surprised to see that 'religion' wasn't the highest voted comment..   A little while ago yes, but now a lot of planes offer WiFi, and their inflight entertainment also connects via WiFi so you can use your own device.  I flew Virgin Arline's not long ago and it felt so weird not hearing the "turn off all electrical devices"   Did you get up her shirt?   Huntsman.. Those things are ok..   Larry's humour is still great, but you're right, it's very dry and at times a bit risqu.. Where Jerry's humour starts to trend towards slap-stick (well sort-of).  Both brought a lot to the show in their own way, but Kramer developed into an even better character once Jerry took control.   Fucking redback spun a web around the handle of my bin. Wheeling the fucker out last night all I could think of was where the cunt was hiding!   The Merv Griffin show was one of my favorite episodes. It's like Kramer's character found an extra gear when Jerry took over  	102
 Good for you! :-)   Uh, maybe you should see things from her perspective bro   stop looking into things so much. I got the impression you just want to control the relationship, not fix it..   Ahaha that was perfect   Important dates to Remember:  First black president's date of inauguration: uhh... Gay rights: June 26th 2015 Says a lot about this country   Mm..

The six letter F-word.       Singing, dancing, and yes, acting out, the opening scene in Kingdom Hearts 1.    Start researching the place you're going, what you will want to do there, and always keep in mind what season you will be traveling in. At first do a lot of general research and then do the nitty gritty: how are you going to get to point A to B, B to C, etc.? Food expenses? If you choose to travel with a tour group, hotel costs and meals may be included. Try looking up various routes to your destination via different airports in your area. Sometimes, this can save you a lot of money. Borrow luggage from someone to also save money... And lastly, consider a companion   a great camera.   	11
 Thanks. This game is so huge, though, that I wouldn't even know how to level through cata and mop. Are there certain areas to go to? Does cata and mop leveling just blend with the rest of the game?   Yeah, sorry about the broad question. Having not played in so long, I couldn't think of any questions that were more specific. But, thanks for the reply.  	2
 You cleary are uneducated on this subject. How can you stand against something you dont understand. What do you think AA is?   Mine too, great list   True but your point has been made, why linger. I dont think rounders is perfect but its a great vastly underrated movie imo   Great list, love to see the love for Reservoir dogs   Great list. First TWBB ive seen, that one is like a 5b for me   I hear ya, anyone with Almost Famous that high has to pluck a 6 string. It was my favorite movie for years   I can buy that   Great list 1st time ive seen jaws   Still pretty crazy though. Id always assume we saw the whole moon, but when i found out about the Dark side of the moon i was floored   Yea seems Aliens is prefered, im with you though i like the 1st one better. I just thought Aliens was like a bust or w/e i didnt know it was so well liked   Fair enough   I really like this list   Yea im surprised. No hate going on either, yet. Your list sucks, how can you like this movie etc. Pleasantly surprised   Yea, bad attempt at humor. Still havent seen but ive heard great things   Whats the deal with aliens, is the sequel that much better or is it a typo?   Mullholland Dr #1??   I will give this movie a shot in the near future   I could see that   Im surprised Goodfellas just mentioned. Like your list we have similar tatse   To add to this take Deep breaths, people who get nervous tend to breath fast they dont get enough oxygen and it throws them off   Hes got different tatse than you so what....Fuck Off   You gotta play guitar, right?   Just out of curiosity, 2nd time ive seen Aliens, is the sequel that much better, i honestly cant remember it   I love Pans Labyrinth and its gotta be top 25 for me easily.   Im down with that, maybe a lil fresh green onion too      If you want to be super cheap just a lil siracha does wonders   Love your tatse. Ive seen Se7en about 30 times   Well i didnt get a chance to see Avatar on the big screen, ill never forgive myself. So watch it before 2 comes out so you can watch it on the big screen. I got a feeling its gonna be an epic cant miss movie event   If you add to Ramen noodles they are the bomb. I add a lil teriyaki sauce and Siracha, Off the chain   Groovy list i have to say   This is 2nd time ive seen Clue, is it really that good?   Still havent seen Close Encounters, ill have to check it out   Damn Big Fish, i havent seen or thought about that movie in years. That is a great movie, i will have to rewatch soon   From what i understand his finger tore loose from his body due to his ring. It was a serious surgery that is relatively in its early stages. It was more of a precaution, the measures after the sugery. From what i understand anyway   Let me know your favorite top 5, in order. Im not worried about most awards highest grossing(if you are in to that and base your rankings off that, thats cool too) but your favorite films. I will offer mine feel free to comment.      1.Goodfellas     2.Apacolypse Now     3.Reservoir Dogs      4The departed      5.Avatar       EDIT. Thanks for all the responses ive enjoyed looking though them, keep em coming. It looks like PULP FICTION is the most mentioned!!!   Wow, i found the one person who likes this movie more than me. I love this movie, not in my top 5 but top 25. Its rewatch ability has to be top 5 for me though. I cant tell you how many times ive watched it. Worm is one of my fav characters ever.    We only see half of the moon ever   Pay it Forward. I thought the concept was very thought provoking and for sure could be a way to make a difference   Also has to do with fire and sterile water cooked meals etc.      Plus birth comes into play. Our own race almost died out due to the rapidly growing human head and its effect on the birth canal   Ive had women ask for this during, its for sure a turn on for some   Yea it should be amazing. I missed Avatar on the big screen and i havent seen a single 3D movie, im holding out for Avatar 2.      Im thinking the next one is going to be a civil war between the Omaticaya with the return of the sky people at the end   It has more to do with than just race, educate yourself on what you critize   Read the books their great   /r/iaddnothingtothetopic and /r/iknownothing are great for you, youll fit right in   It involves gender as well   Lol. Yep my mistake, still want to see TGWTDT finished though   Have you read Pet semetary yet?   What about this didnt you get from watching the movie?   Avatar is far into production, suppose to be 3-4 with a release every x mas starting next year till their done.     I would like the girl with the dragon tattoo to be finished   Jfk   Semi Pro. Hilarious but awful   Yea thats true, i did watch 2 last....   This is true though   Goodfellas   Ill take 2 everytime   But if you have seen the movie why do you care about a trailer?   Why though?   Who cares about a trailer?   AA is not only about race   You are retarded, you understand that the FBI wasnt involved right away as you suggest? Nor does that mean the FBI falsified anything in this case? Your article pertains to less than 100 cases, are you saying the FBI only dealt with 329 cases of DNA since forensics came around overturning less than 100? Furthermore your article mentions nothing about SHOES, its alot easier to identify a shoe print to a specific shoe than hair or bite marks to a specific person. Even your childish mind can see that difference. To claim a shoe print is the same catergory as hair or bite marks shows your ignorance. One can look at the PIC today and run a simple test to prove what kind of shoe it is.       Your only evidence is a pin LOL, compared to the evidence against OJ, you really are an idiot, what about the witnesses, unexpained cuts on his hand, his bronco gone from the premise at the time of the murder, you are aware OJ has an alibi shortly before and after the murders but not during while a limo driver was beating down his door so he wasnt at home, the BRONCO chase scene and suicide note, unexplained cuts on his hand and his confession in book form, this is without mentioning DNA or motive???? you holding onto a pin LOL     I know this case much better than you. There is much more proof than a shoe print, including a ton of it not dealing with forensics but again their not RODGERs size as you conveinantly havent addressed. Plus you just make shit up like OJ not owning a pair of the shoes, knowledge doesnt come from making shit up and bad info from a bias documentary lol.    Freedom Anthony Hamilton     "Im looking for Freedom. Freedom!!!! To find it will cost me everything i have."   Smokin cigs   There is neither happiness nor misery in this world, just the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief will best be able to experience surpreme happiness.   No. Its been around in one form another ever since we evolved from apes. There are ways to box it but never rid of it completely   Lebron   The Matrix   ?? Thats how i spelled it      Any input on the scene??   A)Of course there is proof. He admits this in the civil case      B)Your one article presented does not say shoe prints. Ir we assume thats what it meant, you are ignoring the rareity and condition of the shoe print     C)You do realize there is more evidence than DNA and prints      D)Why would he lie, obvious. Publicity, money, fame, boredom, insane.     E)The FBi may have introduced evidence in court its the Lapd who collected it. Specifically the gloves and blood samples. It was the LAPD who drew OJs blood days after the murder.     F)No i am testing the range of your conspiracy. But you have to see a connection here.      G)this is true policd have framed before. The evidence is so vast in this case that there was justification in stopping the investigation       First, cmon with those childish comments "if you knew anything bout the case". No need for that, also you were wrong in that statement. We are having a decent debate but no room for that.     Also can you address the FBI admitting to falsing facts or some proof.   Who is dead??!!!! lol   Eastern promises. If you can get past the nudity, a knife fight between trained killers, no solid footing, no clear path to fight in, naked and blurred vision. Intense to say the least      Django Unchained. The scene where Calvin Candy finds out what their after at the dinner table, Wildly intense   A)have you seen the pic of the shoe print? Furthermore they identified it as a bruno magla shoe before they knew OJ even owned a pair!!!     B)if rogers didnt need money why he is comiiting a double murder? If he is a successful criminal why would he wear rare shoes to a murder scene? You still havent adressed it wasnt his shoe size     C)no im not FBI but the evidence as well as the whole trial is documented so.....     D)OJ lied at a voluntery questioning before he was a suspect, plus why lie about Your Own Shoe collection if you hired someone else to do it? And rodgers is incapable of lying right     E)So you think its more crediable a mass conspiracy between the LAPD and the FBI was commited to frame OJ? You do realize the amount of different departments and people that dont intermingle would have to work together on this right     F)did the FBI fake the many incidents of OJs physical abuse against Nicole? And the infamous 911 call?     G)so OJ was clever enough to hide any connection to Rodgers but not clever enough to have an alibi? Lol   Also if Rogers did it, how did the cops get Ojs blood?   Yea 99.9% of those cases didnt involve an extremely expensive shoe where there were only 500 pairs or less at the time. Even less when you consider the size. Furthermore OJ lied about owning a pair, not only does his lying have a significant impact but why would a poor desperate for money Rogers be wearing those shoes? Its not his size either from what i understand.     Also very rarely is the print found in such prestine condition, so your rebuttal very well said does not hold alot of weight considering     EDIT on top of that there is much more evidence if it was just the shoe print i understand some what where you are coming from but there is so much more   Again your an idiot as no one has given reason to why the hate on the jury. Why the quotes i havent said that at all oh yea because you are an idiot and but hurt i called you out on your BS about this case you know nothing about.   How so? The shoe print found at the crime scene was from an extremely rare shoe, even rarer when you consider the size, that was not rogers size but OJs. He denied owning the shoe at all, later aftert he criminal case a pic surfaced confirming he owned and wore these shoes. How again is it more plausible?   You are an idiot. Most people do blame the jury, its been documented. The jury doesnt always make the right decision nor should it be respected at every out come, 2nd im asking why the jury is seen as being wrong, widely considered btw.     No one has been clear on the hate towards the jury, i understand the jury made a decision. Why that answers the question, it doesnt, why do you think i need to hear that, i dont.     I have no interest in you as its clear you are ignorant to the case at hand   That story is simply retarded. Dont you think if you hired someone to kill your ex wife you would be sure to have an alibi??      You dont sound aggresive but ignorant to the case the prosecution presented   Im not saying those with certain history should be punished nor did i say it was a justification for AA. Again your conclusions are not drawn well from the statements made.     How do you see AA as punishment??     Again i was only remarking on your idiotic statement.    Yes i agree, people are reaping the benefits now that have no true idea why, and are privelged by it. Is it doing more harm than good now a days, i could agree with that. I hope to see this removed or changed in the future to include those in the majority that are hindered in other ways other than color. I do feels it adds to the lingering feeling of most blacks that most whites are racist, hence why there is AA, some would say.      But it has helped in positively effecting change imo. It was a positive thing upon its being implemented. I believe it had a direct effect on the culture change since that of the 60s. I also feel blacks are still the minority as far as population and see AA as a way to level the job searching playing field.      I have the biggest issue with job programs for inmates. Those who can leave jail to work in the real world. It hinders the average "free" citizens job opportunities by a decent amount. Since most inmates are black its a privelege rarely touched on, and a spit in the face of equal opportunity imo.   Thats just laughable. Would lebron be competetive yes, dominate no.   No, i dont know how you drew that conclusion. Your statement that every white has no connection to slavery is ludricous.     I support AA as it is a way to level the playing field. Equal rights is an issue that has been solved just recently, and that mind set is still prevalant. So in order to change the culture and mindset this is reasonable imo   Its not though. I have no better idea than when i started why people blame the jurors not the prosecution.   To be fair AA goes beyond slavery, and has to do with equal rights that were fairly recently made into a level playing field.     I understand where you are coming from though. I simply support AA because its an attempt to level the mind set caused by this very long history of unfairness to blacks. Is it in turn unfair to whites? Yes. Anyone who says it isnt is wrong. Is it nessacary to implement changes in cultures and mind sets? This is debateable but imo yes it is.     You make great points on other immigrants discriminated on. Take the irish for another case. But most of these immigrants had equal rights not offered to the blacks. Thats the difference.   Not only that but not every white southerner supported or participated in slavery and not every white northerner opposed it. Its a fine line to state every white in America doesnt have links and a fine line to state every white does.   Fair enough, i agree.      But i will  add the shoes to me proves he almost certaintly did it.     Im well aware of the case my friend. Im looking for your view point      If you want to get into police framing, explain the shoes?? Evidence not presented at the criminal case   Freedom, django unchained   Some whites history and inheritance are linked to slavery even today, plus some still support the idea. So no not every white but the vast majority are not connected   Well its not hard to win a case the prosecution hands you. Doesnt answer to your view points though   The fact that the post lumps "white people" together is bias in itself. It also lumps wealth and race together, quite unfair.      I support AA but in some ways it punishes certain white people who had nothing to with slavery and are not racist   Bill russel?   Micheal Jordan. 6 finals 6 rings 6 mvp.

No small talk   Jobs is dead   Bernie madoff, no doubt.   I dont have a problem but im looking for personal opinion on OJ, im well aware of the verdict. And yes its simple fact that in the criminal case all the evidence was not presented.     Also to clarify i think the verdict was the right one based on the cases presented but i also think he is guilty.   Are you aware of the book he wrote?   Right, cause the jury never gets it wrong   Yes ive seen this a damn shame. There was also another witness that placed OJ by the dumpsters of the airport, night of the murders. Digging or hiding something in them, never presented. Plus the shoes the most damning evidence of all   I understand the difference well but my point is there is room for opinion. To disagree with a verdict is common place and this case especially has merit for such a discussion  	105
 For all bacon-lovers out there, this could be the answer to our love for bacon and concern about getting the perfect bod for summer. http://www.livescience.com/51588-bacon-flavored-seaweed-dulse.html  It would just feel weird eating something-green-that-tastes-like-bacon.    With that amount, giving away the interest he earns for the benefit of the poor would alleviate world hunger because about $30 billion per year is what is needed to end world hunger. More will still remain in his bank account.    This could have been more meaningful if they put below the year when the suit was used. It's like you just looked at it and then ask 'What now?'    That's some great work in there. I'm sure all Mario fans are green with envy with that carefully detailed kart. I for one want to give it a go.    Where was I all these time? What have I been doing? Haven't seen all those movies mentioned.    It's been a while since I saw it last, but I wasn't able to see it with this spectacular sunrise. Hoping to go back again soon. (That is if work permits)       She sure attracted a swarm of men out there. It was 1944, so is it safe to guess that they were not used to seeing women with too much skin showing? I'm giving a benefit of the doubt here lol!      I am not so sure if I would be happy with this news. Yes, they can live longer now, but on the other hand, they still have that disease that is slowly weakening their system. I do hope that they can find a cure to finally eliminate this disease.          You've come a long way, man! I'm sure you'll do best in becoming a father because you've gone through a lot. Congratulations in surviving the worst.         	15
 I think everybody does. Personally I can't say I'm that dedicated. However I truly believe that very few women deserve this kind of man.   I mean you need to bring something to the table so that this man considers you worth this effort. That is something many women don't get. They think they deserve this treatment because they are a woman.       Phew!    Haven't looked at it yet. Is the finger being cut off with it?    ?   I never heard anybody complain about people saying: I really really like Japanese people. But as soon as somebody says they dislike Japanese people you get called a racists.   Obviously every race (or more specifically, every culture) has certain characteristics. It should be find to dislike these characteristics the same way it is OK to like them.  Edit: I'm not a racists though ;)      Guys, reboot.   And yes, I can see that for 4 pieces, the price is decreasing again.          Doesn't work. I read somewhere that when you flash the lollipop rom, you lose your custom recovery. not sure where I read that though.   If you power on with vol up pressed, it just restarts.   Never said it was. It is very pretty but boring as fuck.    I have the dual recovery installed. And I also flashed the first lollipop rom when it came out.   Now I would like to flash the 5.02 ([this](http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/d5803-lollipop-5-02-odexed-pre-rooted-2-t3090505) one) but can't manage to get into the custom recovery.   I read that I shall turn it on and wait for the green light to flash, but there is no green light.   I feel stupid, but for the life of me, I don't know how to do it.    What an asshole. She will NEVER forgive him.    Would like to know that too. Can't get to the first saves on my porn account    I meant no offense, that is correct.    I'm starting today!    To be honest, I was not sure it qualifies.   On the other hand it is never clear that what I wrote is even considered in the series. Like somebody else wrote. The series considers Skaara to be his son replacement. However I personally believe this is a good explanation of why the behave towards each other like they do.    Fair enough, but when she crawls to the windows as if she was raped, why does she think that is on tape but not when she put wine on her shirt?  Fair enough the movie is about the fact that people are overlooking things because they are biased. However, surely somebody would have looked at the video tapes.   It makes no sense that she was able to manipulate the recordings.    Well, still strange that it is several days after the disappearance.    What's the problem with putting a sign up: This is free food. We are convinced it's good, but we can't guarantee. Your call.    Well, if I look at it from their perspective, all I see is:  Somebody gave you something so you won't starve, for free, and you fucked them up the ass. and you also fucked all the other people up the ass, who will no longer get free food.   I would never do that.   Jack never got over the death of his son. Partly because he feels responsible for it but partly because he would like to be a dad. He is the perfect role model. He is aware of it because that is who he wants to be.  Daniel lost his parents when he was young and never got to learn from of look up to a male role model. He is a bit of a girl and he is also clumsy.   When Jack meets Daniel, he sees a child - a kind but naive person. But he likes him  Daniel sees a military leader who does not care about morals or "the right thing to do". He does not understand Jack, just like a child does not understand grown ups.   Over time they grow fond of each other and without ever realising it Jack becomes a father figure to Daniel and Daniel becomes a replacement for Jack's dead son. Daniel inspires Jack and turns him from being the cold soldier that he was into the best human being ever.   Daniel on the other side only lives up to his full potential because of Jack. Daniel never realises that Jack always agrees with his morals. Jack often seems to be against Daniel's ideas. The reason is that Jack is able to see if something is a lost cause and instead of demoralising Daniel he takes the blame for not doing the morally right thing so that Daniel can stay who he is, just like a good father would.   Jack protects Daniel like his own son. He wants him to grow, learn and eventually grow stronger and wiser than Jack himself. He is proud of Daniel and only like this is he able to sometimes forget that his actual son is dead. He gets to be a dad.   Daniel, until very late, does not realise what an influence Jack has on him. He does not understand his motives and does not see that without Jack, he would have never been able to achieve what he achieved. He is always stubborn towards Jack because, just like a father, Jack is always in charge. However in the end you can feel Daniel's appreciation for Jack.

I have a 128GB SSD that is now in my laptop, but I will scrap the laptop.      **What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**  I will mostly be using it for Lightroom and internet surfing.    **If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**  I will be playing Diablo 3 and some older games. I am considering to buy a new shooter though. Is that going to be possible? 1080 is fine for me.  **What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**  I want to see if I can get this done with less than 300 quid. It is more of a project. I don't actually need a new PC. My laptop can just about handle Diablo 3. But I would really like to build my first own PC.   **In what country are you purchasing your parts?**  UK  **Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**  All I know is it will be with the Intel Xeon X5650 because I got that from a guy who got it from work. I already bought it with the intention of building a PC.   **Provide any additional details you wish below.**  The most important thing is that it will last me a few years.   Many thanks in advance.     Thanks.    I don't know. I feel like you will be doing stuff you did not want to do all the time.   what exactly did you do?   You know what the most frustrating thing is? People will rea this post, agree and nothing will change. But I like that you took the time to post it because I might be wrong and you might have changed some people.   Never give up   Every time I want cash I get my onscreen balance.      I never buy bottled water or anything in plastic bottles for that matter. Too much rubbish.             It's strange. I would describe myself as two faced (or multi faced if you want). I behave very differently around different people. I still express the same opinions and beliefs and I am not a shy guy with my mum and a womaniser around my friends. But my language changes, how comfortable I am and how much I open up (other things too). I know everybody does this to a certain extent but I feel I do it more than others. I actually don't think there is anything wrong with that.   My star sign is Gemini and I believe that is part of why I am how I am.    You dislike comments on reddit I take it?

Best pic I have seen here in a while and there are a lot of awesome shots.   I am sure BW is best for this. But do you have a colour picture?      Can I ask what the difference is for using greenify and powernap if you don't have xposed?    Fair enough. Thanks   OK.    I did miss most of what you wrote. I got that ultra was sincere about saving humanity. This is why I was wondering about Fury's statement. How would he K ow all of what you have written above.   But honestly, this all goes way over my head. I had a lot of trouble following the movie. I am not a huge fan and I find that the way things are connected is so complicated by now.   Anyway, thanks for sharing.    And also, I hated the movie. I left before it was over.   When he appears on the farm he starts lecturing the Avengers about what Ultron's plans are.   How would he know? The Avengers are the only ones who talked to Ultron, and I am pretty sure Fury can't just search the net for Ultron's plans.   Also, I am not entirely sure but at that point I find it still 100% believable that Ultron only wants to eliminate the Avengers to protect earth. So why does Fury say he wants to kill everybody?   I think I'll try this   I think I'll try this   I think I'll try this.    Thank you. I think I'll go with a single cable    I'm in the UK but thanks    Hey, I bought this cable  http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EI41K26/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8 qid=1432638653 sr=1 keywords=surface+hdmi  but the picture I got was really bad (I think the cable was just faulty (about 30% of pixels looked weird)  Which cable do you recommend to connect my surface to a monitor?   Same here.       No, same thing.    The PC does not actually work currently and I am trying to find a way to install Windows 7. However even if I manage to do that the machine might just be too old.   I was wondering if there is any point using some of the parts and rebuilding a new PC based on them.     After installing windows 7 it boots up to the point where you see the wallpaper and then nothing. My friendsaid its a driver issue. He said I should install windows with drivers already intergated. However I do not have that recovery CD anymore   It came with Windows XP Media Centre Edition 2005. When I got it nothing worked. I do not have a recovery CD. I have tried several times to install windows XP and Windows 7 but it always fails to boot afterwards.   If possible at all, I would love to run Windows 7 on it and just use it for the living room. I only need to HDMI to work.   Any help would be much appreciated.   Is there any chance I could sell this somewhere?   What can I actually do to be informed or influence this?    I should always think first    I understand you guys. Just because someone creates and opportunity he should not have his bike stolen. Agreed. I am 100% on your side. I would love a world where I can just leave my bike on the street k owing nobody will touch it. It would be brilliant.   But that is not the world we live in. That is a shame but it's the truth and this guy knows it. Otherwise he would not have bought two locks.   It is a fact though that he did not get the most out of the locks he had and that is all I am saying. I am not blaming him for having his bike stolen. But if he would have been a little smarter he would only be missing one wheel.    Yeah, you're right. It is, but I want to believe that he is taking the piss because I would find that funny.    Exactly    Fuck me? Fuck you! When did I say he deserves it. If he is in an area where he is worried his wheels might get stolen and he is not smart enough to lock the frame as well, then it's his fault.    He wanted to protect his wheels and protect his wheels he did.      I feel like some of the things I find on here, I find very reasonable actually. His English is not great but I really think this is quite funny.    Not if you write dates in a way that makes sense.   M/D/Y is just stupid.    I never had to work this hard for anything.   So he is actually especially stupid for trying to bury with water?   Music is awesome.    Don't want to lose root.   Sorry I should have said   Why does this start a debate?

Working out was the best decision of my life.    They might have. I would point that out though. His target audience should know the difference.    I really don't want to get it wrong but what matters is not how many calories they eat in each study but whether or not they understand that every person has a different TDEE and that 2000 kcal (or however many) for some people will mean weight loss and for some weight gain.   Now that would still be OK if the same group would do both trials but the people in the group probably  vary too.       No, they should have worked out the actual energy consumption of each individual in the group and then have them consume for example x - 500kcal per day each. For one group in 2 meals and for one group in 7 meals. Then you get a result.    I haven't finished reading but it starts out with one group eats 2000 kcal in 2 meals and one in 7 meals. So what?! If it's not the same person what does that even tell me? What do I know about the energy consumption of each of the people in the group?   Edit: just read a bit more. Even though I do not have in depth knowledge on the subject I can tell that this article is worthless. The research he is talking about is not referenced, he misinterprets and does not know the basics.   Edit 2: oops, he does reference. Soz   Really boring. How's the protagonist?

Thank you   I really need to see it go back down. Fuck this gif.    But that makes no sense. It is not moving from location to location (I think we can all agree on that) but it's is moving through time really quickly. So my my point of view, the faster the machine goes, the slower the time traveller should appear. But it should still be visible.    I like this idea. Makes sense to me    Fair point.

I count at least 20 people. Let's see:  If half of them want it warm, thats 30 seconds just for that plus let's say another 30 seconds for being served = 10 minutes  Let's say the other 10 people get served and pay cash in the time the other 10 get their sandwich heated up = +0 minutes.  I am sure at least 5 of them will have a coffee as well. I am sure this adds at least 5 minutes.   I'll say it takes at least 15 minutes.   Edit: Ok, just saw that you wrote it looks like MORE than a 5 min queue. I that you said looks more like a 5 min queue. Forget it.   Does anybody have experience with the myprotein ready meals? Is the quality acceptable? Does it taste OK?    Oh, did not get that.    It is true what you say. Child molestation is never funny. But why do you think that he thinks it is funny? He's telling a story about how the 70s were different and how even child molesters were kind of accepted back then. And he makes a joke about that to point out how outrageous that actually is.   Then he point out how absolutely insane these people are by stating that their desire for "a young boy" is stronger than their desire for freedom and general acceptance in society. He tells us that they are sick but he does it with jokes.   I see nothing wrong with this.   Edit: I didn't get that op was being sarcastic. Sorry...

I know how you feel, I just got my first paycheck from my first job. The lack of ambition I have had for a couple years is finally gone and I can do things. Life is looking up for us both!!  	3
 If the art schools were better, the generalization wouldn't be present.   What if there was an MMO where there were only one of a few very powerful things and whoever controlled them could do amazing things. Can you imagine the stories? If I was that company, I would create a position for people to just follow the objects an make sure nobody collects more than one.  What if the MMO started with only a few people, in a real room. Then they chose from the objects by way of riddles which belied their power. The rest of the objects then get scattered about the world... into rivers, caves, temples, and to the tops of mountains and the guts of beasts.   http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr733.html  The New York Federal Reserve just released a report which explores how federal tuition aid increased tuition rates.

I have a coconut allergy and get a rash that looks like the keto rash if I ingest coconut protein. I think people who go keto are trying new protein sources and experience allergic reactions to some. Some people get over the allergy, because oral ingestion will sometimes do that, and not have the problem again.  Since there is no scientific studies yet, we don't know. Both make sense to me because adipose tissue stores a lot more than fat and releasing it fast can't be easy.   Can't float in water :(   They've got their hand in everything.

Hijacking top comment to let y'all know Morales gave the Pope the cross and necklace as propaganda to reinforce his socialist government. This picture of a smiling pope is what his people will see, they will never hear that the Pope then said "That isn't right" and refused the gifts. This polite smile didn't last long. The Pope couldn't fucking even, either.  I usually wouldn't hijack, but, you know... state propaganda.   By charity and opportunity. In the evolving market, new players will always come to the front if they have the means to. Accidents, family tragedies, and malinvestments happen which can unseat even the most leading businesses and organizations.  Being fair is one thing, but being personally generous is what would make an economy fall into the definition of distributist. The effort to make life easy for your neighbor - to follow the golden rule.   Slavery was a little different to the immediate people he was addressing. It was more like voluntary slavery, which you can find Ancaps defending and theorizing from time to time. I bet there are threads if you search.  True, not every slave was in that position as debt but as war-prize or outright slave. I think the regional Jewish state restricted that practice, however. Rome definitely had thousands of galley-slaves.   yah, and he gave it back as well.   He said "That's not right" when he saw the cross. He then refused it and checked the necklace - which he also gave back.   And to fix it we need to... disregard the law...  hmmm   I guess I'm trying to get away from "whose fault is it?"  People experience incentivized and naturally attractive options; also disincentivized and naturally poor options. I think we are in a situation where different forces have disincentivized the general population from both simply choosing to eat healthier and doing the research to find out what they think might be very healthy eating.  The government may be some of those forces (and the federal overreach enables that), but there are cascading forces off of that - and even more important - there are forces which influenced government in the first place.  Government is a tool for lobbyists. I blame capture on narcisistic scientists and irresponsible corporations. Like take a look at the McGovern report. The government got behind fringe ideas even though strong opposition was there from the scientific community. There is nothing more dangerous than a narcisistic scientist with an idea that a major industry can use to control mass populations.   Not if the cocktail is awesome.   Haven't played AoE3 (yet...) so I'll keep an eye out.   The way to get a karma rain on reddit?  Admit a mistake.   Those rims are looking a little bright...   Other luminaries include Allan Savory and Mark Shepard. I've seen that Bill Mollison understood most of what these men practice now and Geoff Lawton helps spread news about and teach people.  We can feed the world, but it will mean making farms more labor-intensive. That isn't a bad thing, because done correctly it is healthy and fulfilling work, but people are used to seeing robotic harvesters raoming across the plains scooping up grains. Raising a head of cattle will take much less land and water and almost only the land the herd grazes on will be included in the process. No more taking into consideration the roads between the grains in Iowa and the industrial ranches in Colorado or the water rights in Nevada for the farm in California. With more people on the land those dying midwest towns will liven up, increasing opportunity and prosperity. The deserts of the Southwest can be restored through management by slowing down the water that currently flash-floods away.  How much more valuable would the land we currently till for corn be if it didn't take so many material inputs? How much more affordable would meat and whole food be if it was produced by many more people rather than a few strings of corporate farms?   Yet at each level of education and attention being paid, there is misinformation and confusion.  There are competing consensuses right now. Fighting dietary guidlines, fad diets, and "fad diets" that have stuck around and become "alternative diets." Unless each person individually sits down and reads a sizeable amount of literature there has to be some bridge of trust - the field of which looks like chutes and ladders right now.    the incentives are so huge they have altered our systems of food service and commercial environments.  It didn't take that long for people to leave fats behind. If the governmental support for trash foods gets decimated society will change again.   Subsidies have to be eliminated and industrial meat production should be eliminated in exchange for increased mob grazing on managed, restored, grassland.  There is a large incentive to eat tons of carbs which outweighs the health concerns many times because the incentives are so huge they have altered out systems of food service and commercial environments. Racks of chips and soft drinks are EVERYWHERE and that is both part of the culture problem and a result of the corruption problem.   News is reporting he took the necklace off, as well.   News is coming out he rejected the gift and similar necklace.   It isn't a cigarette. Do you alrady smoke cigars and inhale or are you asking why people don't?   Mob grazing and plains restoration will save us all. These agri-corps can't run from the science forever.

But, seriously, a better translation says money is the root of all kinds of evil, in the sense it is the root of many but not all.   The game or the store?   Progressive government programs are generally an attempt at equal outcomes. Of course, how can a government manage an economy down to the individual? It cannot; so some idiot thought it would be just fine to try and make people equal by dividing them by demographics. Gender, age, wealth, ethnicity. To do so is institutionalizing discrimination and directly impinges free opportunity.  "But!" They will say, "The ---- people have more of these jobs than the ---- people. That isn't fair!"  Why are they acting like those people are different? To get votes from one or the other. Or out of an incorrect sense of justice which relies on discriminating against successful people by seeing their succsess as dependent on institutionalized force... but then why use more institutionalized force instead of just removing what those people were supposedly using? It is like gaining the One Ring and thinking you can control it, when it will really just enslave you.  (which is apparently along the lines of what JRR Tolkein was writing about. Anarchy and Christianity.)   Hey! I remember when it was called "Cranberry Mall" and had a Babbage's. There have been a few gamer-oriented stores in the past few years. I got a link to [Save Point's](http://savepointmd.com/) website off the directory.  Didn't see any of the other stores there, they probably closed up.  Edit: If OP contacts the staff, they'll probably have a lead on a machine even if they don't have it in.   Those were technological advancements and feats of organization - arguably the biggest advance reinstroduced to the area - not simply services.    you'll quickly see that your feeble attempts to expropriate his struggle for your own selfish ends is disingenuous at best  [Boy](http://img.pandawhale.com/40627-boy-that-escalated-quickly-pxYE.gif)   Equal opportunity vs equal outcomes.   That only works if we also recognize other things that are holding society back, like not caring about the big picture. Most votes are acquired through marketing, not personal research by voters.   So you would eliminate the green space, recreational facilities, and a major collector road?  Bad plan.   So then the question is - how fast will Latinos google his name?   Huck and Santorum aren't even more conservative in financial matters, only religious ones. Frankly the base is a little split on that.

Ushered me directly into the arms of permaculture.   You are either trolling or do not understand how fast and loose the English language is.   Despite the fact your comment will soon be deleted I still feel the need to mention that ironpunk definitely refers to the [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age) in this context.   Then I am glad you found out. Good luck.   Being from Senegal *in particular* does not mean anything to his argument. The fact that health inspectors were unaware of why the code was the way it was and maybe that it should be changed was important. They also, like everyone else, did not understand or care how hard it was to do business and what businesses contributed to the community. Both because they were not part of the community and because they were not culturally assimilated. The majority of these immigrants will one day look back and think they might have been too hard on many places they went to.  The other people had a different problem. Straight anti-business attitudes are from stupidity and misplaced elitism. These jerks are masters of the social bubble and will clip their incoming information so that they stay willfully ignorant of the problems they are causing unless an event pops the bubble... and then its even money between them coming around to more conservative attitudes or going full commie.   Great WWII movie, by the way.   Western European culture has historically toed this line in many ways which evolved into crossing the line. Once people were tempted to defeat the spirit of chastity in each practice it eventually became the norm and progressed from there, again.  Germanic cultures have used a board placed between two young adults sleeping in the same bed to test for marital compatibility. Sometimes there was even a chaperone involved, sitting there in the bedroom.  Allowing young people to sleep together eventually became turning a blind eye to young men "coming through the window" (literally scaling the house and sleeping overnight in the young lady's bedroom) on their own daughters. I've heard it said that coming through the window was a practice which came from times when couples were betrothed but financially or politically unable to marry.  Chaperoning seems to be the most stable resolution to ameliorating temptation when dating. Never leave yourself alone with someone if there is a chance you could get really physical. That will only leave you wanting more. Been there.   ######[](#dropcap)  You know they are already winning when the Lipizzaner Stallions ride by.

[ I've got to be ready to synthesize a few flagella and get to spinnin'](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9d/06/8b/9d068b2e3eb9226f34c2eeecaa9e9906.jpg)   Yes you did and I hope once you finish you sketch out what you're thinking this things looks like because I like it!   Sinarnu yelled at his ox-drivers around the heavy cart. "You sacks of vinegar!" Throwing his unencumbered hand in the air, he proceeded to point towards the correct dock. "My ships are at berth on the northern wharf! You waste my time and I'll make sure your masters flog you bloody!"  Standing to the side as the cart was more swiftly guided in the correct direction, Sinarnu hefted the box of metal under his arm. It was the most important piece and he didn't trust swine of men with it. It was a shame he had to endure these Bedu slaves - with their lowly foremen not much better. Taking a pace behind his most precious cargo, he tried to remember his own place as a well-connected merchant. He paid no mind to his personal slaves and entourage, which wafted the air near him with slightly scented palms and carried his necessary documents, impressed in kiln-dried clay.  As the cart wiled it's way through the dusty but cobbled streets to the edge of the wharfs, he spied Zannan coming down a sidestreet. A worthy merchant, he was no doubt coming to see what Sinarnu was taking to sea. The boy, Idadda, was also coming. He was coming to the age of twelve and six, fully grown and already accomplished. Their entourage and slaves combined were greater than his own, so Sinarnu pretended not to notice them approaching and hurried past the groaning, burlap covered cart to his waiting fleet. The cobble ended and slaves hurried even past the rushing merchant to identify mud and guide him around it.  The fishermen's fleet of the Aynen Row bordered Sinarnu's fleet and his slaves also took the duty of mustering a path through the men and women carrying baskets dripping brine and refuse on the dirt which sloped into the harbor of Ugarit. One woman, a transplanted Minoan who was customarily bare-breasted dropped her basket behind Sinarnu as he passed - causing his scribes and attendents to prance about, avoiding the catch sliding underfoot. Sinarnu noted the impression that might appear to Zannan, that hoity Hittite. He thought of a dismissive comment - just in case.  With his entourage picking themselves up behind the master - who looked very displeased - Captain Burnu tugged his oiled and curled goatee for luck and decided against smiling as the master came to the decking of the wharves. "We'll load the cargo immidiately."  Sinarnu stepped up, level with his dutiful employee, and sternly looked at him in a class-bridging evocation of contempt for his situation. "No, you'll have to wait until I entertain some friends..." Burnu looked to see Zannan and his son round the corner of another street and turn to walk up to them. There were a few minutes and he could see the oxen making good time through the moderate crowd and spilled fish (the Minoan woman still scrambling to gather the remaining, untrampled, fish). "We might be able to - " A wave of Sinarnu's free hand brought closure. "I have said." The key piece was handed over to Burnu, and Sinarnu confided: "Stow this now and act as if you have nothing to hide."  Burnu grabbed the metal and took it in stride. The master has his obligations, it would seem.  Sinarnu turned toward his approaching cart and kept the corner of his eye on the Hittite merchant. He also looked at the sky, seeing it was clear and blue with a weak and low sun for the late month. Comfortable and bright. The perfect atmosphere for gloating.  The behemoth load stopped at the deck's end, and Sinarnu clapped his hands for the foremen to take orders. Six swarthy Ugarits ambled off the cart and from the mass of livestock and resting slaves. "We are to beach the craft and lift the device by passing poles. Dispatch the beasts and assemble for the task!"  Now Zannan was upon the scene. Sinarnu was now among his strong and tanned sailors, who did odd jobs at the foot of the decking and carried things past - to and from the four ships. The Hittite was now evenly matched, at least in appearence of power. The best power - power over men.  "So you have a cargo, friend Sinarnu!" Zannan said in his brutal northern accent.  "I have a great cargo, friend Zannan. Welcome friend Idadda. You appear strong and fine. See my ships and men."  "Thank you friend Sinarnu, you do me honor. I have seen your ships and men and the wares you attempt to carry. We are all truly blessed in prosperity."  "The west does not see prosperity, though." Sinarnu added.  This puzzled the two Hittites slightly. Zannan asked, "How far west?"  "The blight was not yet upon Crete ere I last did hear."  Idadda replied "We are glad to know. The north is bitter but for the love of the Nile." Zannan nodded in agreement.  Frowning his own agreement to that statement, Sinarnu then smiled and raised a hand in a gesture of changing from news and pleasantries to the matters at hand. The air was open for Zannan to fill it.  "Please, I desire greatly to see what you have. I will give you a pair of tin ox-hides to know it."  Sinarnu chuckled, his tidy clothes concealing a jiggling belly. "Do so and I will show you. You will pay more to be told more."  "Done!" Zannan's eyes betrayed his sense of the importance he placed on new and dashing things. From knots and jointings to dances and spices - he was known for being a glut of information. The desire served him well in practical matters, but fed his soul even more. A scribe of his dashed across to organize the transaction.  A clap from the master and the eavesdropping foremen cut tethers on one side of the burlap cover, slaves pulling it to the ground. A shining contraption stood five feet tall off the bed of the cart. It was framed plainly but full of lines, plates, and spurs.  Zannan stood transfixed, a hand toussling his oiled locks. "You have a maze."  Idadda started to walk around the behemoth of oiled bronze and rubbed wood. "But not for amusement!" he politely called back to his father.  "A man of Babylon's great work." Sinarnu showed his open palm to Zannan. "Will you know what it works?"  "Yes, yes!" Called Idadda, clearly as enticed as his father. He was poking his nose up to the plates and sliding catches of the large machine, respectfully not touching but trying to absorb the complexity.  Zannan furrowed his brow with the upcoming wager for haggling information's price. Staring hard at the sea merchant above him on the decking, he shouted: "Two more tin ox-hides!"  "Done!" Sinarnu called out. Another scribe dashed about to manage the transfer. Sinarnu descended graciously, smiling at his needy competitor. Inside, he was armor-clad in knowing the knowledge would be of little use for the Hittite. Such a man simply did not have the conections, yet, to manage such an event. Strolling together, they circled the cart as the slaves and foremen stood back. "You see this outside of plates and beams, it carries the toothed plates inside. It makes sure the axles - like on wagons - do not move. This is a very special construction unlike we have seen before. I tell you the creator is a magician for what he makes metals do."  Idadda waited for them at the rear of the cart, having calmed down. "Father, there is a trough here for something."  Sinarnu waved a hand in an offer to have Zannan look closer. The Hittite ascended the cart wheel and looked deep into the... machine. "Tell me what goes in here, friend."  "The creature of purple dye." Zannan's eyes grew larger than his son's had. "And out comes the dye."  "I am afraid I have underpaid you... for this information." Zannan tried his most carefully to say as he eased himself to the ground. The dye of royals was immensely treasured. He did not want to be in debt to anyone - even an honorable Ugarit such as Sinarnu. "Please, let me - "  "You are in no need, friend." Sinarnu pretended to look ashamed in politeness. "I have concealed important information about the machine. It is not for sale but I can repeat that the man who built this is a magician." Sinarnu ushered his merchant colleagues away from the polished monstrosity. "Everything I have said is true and all you have seen is true. It is from the east and it is going to the west. It takes in the shellfish and dispenses the dye." He turned and pointed to the batch of his entourage responsible for refreshments and they readied a modestly transportable collection of foods and drinks.  Zannan watched the slaves cover the device back up in preparation for a sea voyage. "I hope to see one in motion."  Sinarnu thought of the metal box he had carried for miles from the trade roads outside Ugarit in confidence. He had opened it in the security of his own home - in the cellar. His cousin who made the journey said it was not magic but skill though some would not differentiate. The bronze spring inside was easily recognizeable as a work of immense value. Sinarnu did not know how it made the machine work. He knew more force was needed for operation, but it was still very alive in his hands as he regarded the power such a thing was capable of.      I really enjoy comparing the pair of buildings St. Chapel on the Isle of Paris and Thorncrown chapel. Thorncrown is designed by E. Fay Jones, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. I've never visited either.  Of places I have been? Boston Public Library, original section,  McKim, Mead, and White.    ^ ^^ ^^ ^  **Ol!**   These people are screwed *today* and they can't stop themselves.   The credits have been put under new direction at the last minute and at very great expense.   Just grab a wet washcloth and wipe her down. You can get the nooks, crannies, and boogers later.   You got some purdy, expensive-looking lettering on the front of that there device.  But seriously, do you have any tips for covering that up permanently or temporarily?   It is a very brief article which focuses on historical life, not martial action.   I can't follow that up. Too damn glorious. Well done.   Or at least not cancel your ticket. But also, if you got to know pilots, stewards, or other frequent fliers I can imagine they'd invite you to their home field for dinner or a bed. And you could even save up enough for a vacation home in one or more far-flung continents.   There is a growing movement away from modern housing. The air-tight house is a failure. Costly, over-mechanized, and prone to maintenance. I grew up in a 200 year old stone house in Maryland and appreciated being able to open each window for a "chimney" effect where the air would come in the basement and get sucked up through the house by the air above it getting warmer - and then out through the attic. I am furious sometimes when I see what developers are building.   Probably because the areas are food-sufficient enough for resistance to not have been reliant on central government sponsorship. It is more in the culture than in the politics, possibly. I am wondering, not speaking from experience.   Note that you will need the hair on top of your head to be longer than it is now.   I still remember watching the Beijing Olympics on TV and seeing a little snippet where they showed Phelps chilling between events playing Age of Mythology on a laptop.  "Oh, hey, I do that."   You're going to compare yourself to a man that raped his way into the bloodstreams of the world?

If you weren't trying to add some kind of argument to this particular conversation where the difference between consenting abortions and accidental abortions is being debated, it might have been better to put that as a top-level comment. In this context you appear to be making a statement along the lines of "abortions happen so easily, why can't we just use the pill?"  Which explains my scoffing response. Anywhere else and I'd be like: oh, yeah I knew that. cool fact, bro.   Oh, say does that chemical burn blister like a mother...

I'm a libertarian, too.  Let me rephrase that first sentence to be more legible: Am I forcing my morals, or, are we both simply voicing opinions?  Nothing I have said *makes* people do anything, but it does let them know I disapprove. That isn't violence and it isn't force.   Am I forcing my morals or voicing my opinion just like you?  There is a comment box here, so I'm using it.  Forcing morals is serious stuff and I won't have any of it in government or in personal physical persecution, but social pressure is present in the form of voiced opinions and I feel responsible to let y'all know how I feel about this. You don't have to like it.   I don't know about you, but most people with crushing stress don't get it willingly, drinking too much can lead to unwanted pregnancy in many cases, and I've never heard of someone choosing to work out too hard in order to end a pregnancy... least not a man.  I define it as something done willingly, not as something which happens to end a pregnancy through ignorance of the possible consequences.   Oh, then if that's all. Sorry to butt in on your abortifacient parade. Guess I'll just take my morals somewhere else.   I don't find irresponsible intercourse a manly thing to be doing.   the articles are every bit as good as the design.   If you read the article, sounds more like the advocacy groups got co-opted and wrecked.   "Its beautiful..."   Haven't had my hair stand on end that much for a while.

It is asking less of people to run a business well in cooperation with others than to ask a government not to get in the way. The incentives are different and only beneficial to the private individual when he is in full control.    "McClellan is to me one of the mysteries of the war."   - U. S. Grant   Don't know quite what to say, but I read your post.  My perspective is that people have used the force inherent in government to mistreat and cause malinvestment. Finding out where the malinvestment is and working towards living outside it might be a good way to go... but which way is up?   Technically, Kramer was gulping so he could puff at the same time. His goals were a little different.   Ah, but I would wait around the seond level of the Phantom Menace computer game to listen to the march in [The Invasion of Naboo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0p2OrIojxA).    peoples taxes (majority anyways) are paid through their employer.   Exemptions can be requested... it would probably be rescinded after the first offense. That is why it would have to be coordinated. The government is made to act like it owns our money and lets us keep some. Overloading the system to the point where it will only operate if terribly simplified might be an avenue to correction.  The government is staffed by people and tied together by perception. One perception that keeps it aflaot is the perception that enforcers are doing the right thing (this is important within the ranks of enforcers and in the general citizenry, of course). Since this is usually incorrect at some level, administrators have two options to keep the perception alive. They can either walk back the control or lash out and justify actions later.  With the ranch, the government had made a mistake *somewhere,* so they had to stop the hardball. If I remember correctly, it was with not enforcing the arrangement more formally and immediately. Maybe it flew under the radar for a while before someone noticed - I don't recall. Nobody thinks FBI and LMB agents dieing over scrubland will solve anything.   Don't know, yet, but the most successful movements have been organized and although the theory of technique and process may have been public, the practical application was done in confidence.  I think people may stop paying taxes, or pay a flat amount voluntarily while ignoring government code. I think small and medium businesses may band together to ignore regulations and licenses set up by corporations to subdue them. I think property owners will start prohibiting federal authorities from accessing their property.   Indeed.  Time for civil disobedience.     is SMARTER regulation, not over broad legislation based on emotional reactions to crisis' that the politicians created  ...and that isn't going to happen at the national level ...and I'm not sure how much good it will do at the state level.   It is interesting to note that at this abstract level neither theory precludes the industrial revolution from occurring without European colonization. simply later, more slowly, and/or somewhere else being in the forefront.

I bet it is like this for all consumer electronics. I am dead tired of getting screwed by strangers online and on the road.  What brick and mortar chain stores carry dashcams?  Where do you buy from online for top-quality customer service?  What models should I stay away from and which brands should be more reliable?  Do you have a checklist for checking a dashcam when you get it?  Do models that cost more tend to be fakes/duds/lemons less often?   No, I've got that as well. It is a fluffy bit of chub that sits there and mocks you in the mirror.

I wonder if there is an argument that each marriage acrries the full weight of catechism and would be permanent - as in no divorces. A Catholic marriage is only sacrement and living with someone for the rest of your life when the state is there taking up the legal ends.  The legal reasons for having a record of marriage is to protect each spouse and any children without any taxes to be accounted for. Churches have long provided this service, which these days provides a great deal of geneological assistance.   anyway, as a Catholic I recognize that the family structure is communal and yet it exists inside the wider structure of capitolism. Have any thoughts on that?   So you are opposed to the revolution, or just participating in rolling heads?   You are, however, comparing the supposedly inevitable revolution to the American civil war. Do you think violence is unavoidable, or natural and cyclic?   The thing is, how are you going to prove it works to convince people?  You cannot expect stable, reasonable, people to trust a system will be better without proof of the final result.

Maybe a region or a medium sized country? (This is in the context of the reddit post, where there would hypothetically be no armed opposition, nor ideological opposition) Can you concieve of there being a placenta-like interface at the theoretical place where the two meet? Inside the geographical area, socialism with no property rights. Outside, anarchy with other socialist groups.  I think I know what you should say, though I'll tell you if you reply so I don't spoil it.  It sounds like you saying socialism has no way to protect from anti-social elements, or are you conceding that socialism is not good enough to prove itself in the face of no opposition.  	139
 The easiest way for me to do it would be to make everything a picture, even the dotted lines for people to write on. That way you can copy and paste, and if you make the text wrapping "In front of text" then you can place them where ever you want and not have to worry about formatting.   It should be under the repair tools.   Ok, what I did was just adjusted the latitude of the lines using tab, then right clicked the picturetext wrappingin front of text. This allows you to place the picture where ever. Just format your paper how it would look without pictures, then add pictures using the above instructions. Hope this helps.   Somthing like [this?] (http://i.imgur.com/Ic1eMGD.png)   What exactly are you trying to do with the pictures? Screenshot would help.  	5
 Magic is mainly psychological priming. If allow guilt and regret into it you'll essentially lose that focus. Source: I'm a Reverend in the Church of Satan.   Satanism is a functionally atheist, carnal religion. We do not believe in any deities or conscious/communicable external forces. Our entire religion is based on the idea that this our one and only existence and that we are own gods in our subjective lives. We recognize the human need for ritual, symbolism, and metaphor so we choose to use the symbol of Satan to represent our life philosophy. Along with this symbol of Satan we also reject all spiritual moral systems that deny earthly vitality in exchange for spiritual enlightenment or transcendence.       1. Got into Satanism when I was a young teenager after reading the works of Anton LaVey. I spent a lot of time at an independent bookstore in the NYC East Village and read through just about everything they had on religions, the supernatural, the occult, etc. I recognized many of my own thoughts and conclusions about the world in LaVey's work.  2. In some ways, yes. But Christianity, like other diseases, has evolved and contaminated other bodies of philosophy and thought. Christianity without Christ or supernaturalism is still our enemy. Satanism is not just opposed to Jesus or Christianity, but the ideas put forth by all White Light Religions. From his biography: "Satanism is not just an atheistic stance but a anti-theistic stance. We prefer destruction of mystically-oriented religions through active opposition rather than simple non-participation."  3. In everything. From the way I dress, how I speak to business partners, to the films I watch.   4. No. Those that do know either respect me enough to accept it or reach out to me for advice.   The "dark force" is really a collective metaphor for all the forces of nature that keep things in balance. It's the carnal drive necessary for procreation, the instinct to exact vengeance when wronged, curiosity that inspires innovation and skepticism, that pit in your stomach when you're saddened or hurt. We call them "dark" because throughout human religious history all these instincts were sinful or carnal (as a pejorative) and lead to temptation.   We "manifest" these forces through actions, art, or just living life to the fullest.   Funny enough, LaVey didn't outright support abortion. He actually made an argument against abortion from a Satanic perspective. But it wasn't about the rights of women, he was concerned about overpopulation. So he advocated birth control, sterilization and eugenics.   "For example, the science of eugenics provides solutions for the issue of abortion. Satanically speaking, I am against abortion. Yet I do consider a problem of overpopulation. Therefore, I advocate compulsory birth control. Unborn babies did not ask to be conceived. Once conceived, they should have loving, responsible parents, even if adoptive. A stupid, irresponsible woman should not have the right to "decide" what she does with her own body when in all other things, her mind is being controlled by impersonal vested interests. An unborn child's father should influence the outcome of a pregnancy if it can be determined that he is more responsible than the mother. If he is stupid, insensitive and irresponsible, he should be sterilized. Irresponsible parents, male or female, should simply be kept from conceiving children."   TST was not created by Doug Mesner aka Lucien Greaves, he's their current media representative. The TST was created by several film producers as a mockumentary, like of like The Yes Men. Mesner joined after a couple of their stunts used hired actors, they needed an "authentic" Satanist to represent them. Mesner was associated with the Church of Satan via his partnership with Shane Bugbee, who was a member of the CoS. Mesner co-hosted the show Three Ring Radio with Bugbee on the Church of Satan's Radio Free Satan network and was the illustrator of Bugbee's reprint of Might is Right. He parted ways with Satanism completely after Bugbee sold off Radio Free Satan. Whether or not Mesner was officially a member of the organization is unclear, since we do not have records of him being a member under the name Lucien Greaves or Doug Mesner.   Was brought here via a mention. I'm an ordained Reverend (fancy way of saying official representative) in the Church of Satan. I've been a member since 2005 and worked closely with a large number of Satanists, both within our organization and outside of it. I was part of the team that developed the Church of Satan website, one of the owners of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/), and have been featured on television, radio, and print as a spokesman for the Satanic religion and philosophy.   Satanism as defined by Anton LaVey is based on functional atheism. We do not acknowledge external conscious deities and live our lives as such. That said we do recognize a dark force in nature that we call Satan, upon which we apply a system of symbols, metaphors, and rituals that stimulate and enrich us.    So no, it's not "just atheism". We have dogma, ritual, ceremony, tenants, and metaphysics.   Yes. LaVey and the Church of Satan do recognize magic as something that exists outside of current scientific understanding. We do not yet know exactly how it works, and we do not require our members to practice it or even believe in it, but we do support those who do.   That said, our system of magic is completely secular. We do not believe it has anything to do with spirits, deities, or external supernatural forces.

You can also verify this in Mesner's interview in Vice and the Village Voice's investigation into the origins of TST.   1. Unmerciful destruction can be anything from public embarrassment, legal action, humiliation, and in some cases physical violence if necessary.   2. Women in the Church of Satan play a huge role, and not just as naked altars.

Satanic Magic is based on carnal, materialistic applied Jungian psychology, aesthetics, geometry, hypnosis, mnemonics, and a bit of the unknown. At its most basic level it's psychotherapy. At more advanced levels it can be something more, but still carnal and within the realm of flesh, muscle, and electricity. None of this requires God, gods, demons, spirits, etc. But the terms are useful for stimulation and creating ritual Total Environments.   "Satanism, realizing the current needs of man, fills the large grey void between religion and psychiatry. The Satanic philosophy combines the fundamentals of psychology and good, honest emotionalizing, or dogma. It provides man with his much needed fantasy."    Right there as a foreword to the Book of Belial:   "What good is a study of falsehoods, unless everyone believes in falsehoods? Many, of course, DO believe in falsehoods, but still ACT according to natural law. It is upon this premise that Satanic magic is based."    "The definition of magic, as used in this book, is: "The change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable." This admittedly leaves a large area for personal interpretation. It will be said, by some, that these instructions and procedures are nothing more than applied psychology, or scientific fact, called by "magical" terminology - until they arrive at a passage in the text that is "based on no known scientific finding". It is for this reason that no attempt has been made to limit the explanations set forth to a set nomenclature. Magic is never totally scientifically explainable, but science has always been, at one time or another, considered magic."   Looks to be a rip from The Church of Satan Interview Archive DVD from Purging Talon...   It's not a reproduction per se, it's actually a special print by the original publisher, Harper Collins, made available via Rabid Crow.   Oh I'm sure there's something to that. But what I'm referring to are people who pour over these modern spooky grimoires written by people who couldn't pass Into to Latin. They'll talk about achieving sinister enlightenment and communion with higher powers but don't have anything to show for it. That's the rub and what LaVey hated about people who obsessed with the occult.   Christopher Lee wasn't a random actor, he was an obvious aesthetic and cinematic influence on many Satanists who grew up watching his films. Gilmore explains it pretty well in the actual article.       As for agnosticism, the Satanic position would be "god might exist, but who cares?"    The Church of Satan is a "functionally" atheist organization. I say functionally because we do not disregard the idea of god altogether but we operate as if there were no governing supernatural deities. We do reject the idea of gods existing as conscious independent supernatural entities, but we do accept ourselves as gods of our own subjective universe. This isn't a small thing, it is the basis of the entire Satanic philosophy. It's what ties LaVey's philosophy to the Left Hand Path tradition, the idea of self-deification, but instead of occultnik spiritual mumbo jumbo, we fulfill this through mastery of carnal existence.    You might be interested in this http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-afro-caribbean-traditions.php   Some of our most active members of the Church of Satan are not white. We don't go around flying their colors though, and neither do (or should) they.    Satanism is an individualistic philosophy, so general racism is inherently un-Satanic. That said, Satanism does recognize scientifically proven genetic variations between races, and accepts that reach individual should exploit and mitigate any aspects of their own makeup to the best of their ability. This does not mean that one should feel superior to another purely based on the color of their skin.     The Church of Satan is an international organization and we have contacts in all the major continents (can't speak for Antarctica). It's obvious that we in Western nations have certain freedoms others don't, where we may fear social or career conflicts with our religion, Satanists in other nations may face certain death or imprisonment.     One of the major works in recent years has been getting more and more material by LaVey and Peter Gilmore translated into different languages, including a Spanish translation of the Satanic Scriptures to satisfy our growing membership in Latin America.    I don't think it's controversial to say that SDJ had a passing interest in Satanism. He was good friends with Aquino and LaVey, and kept in touch with Diane. His PR people have gone out of their way to distance him from those days, and Sammy played along, as he should.   He was obviously into the carnal aspects of Satanism, and I would consider him a defacto Satanist (a person, whether or not they self-identify, who's life and work is Satanic).   The Church of Satan represents and advances the philosophies and metaphysics of Anton LaVey, as described in The Satanic Bible and his other works. This includes his ideas on magic, human nature, stratification, and applied science   technology.    A common misconception seems to be that TST is somehow a variation of LaVey's philosophy. They aren't, even though some of there early members were involved with the CoS in direct   indirect ways. But a close examination would show that their principles and tenants are very much *not* from LaVey, but are sourced from various Secular Humanist material. I've noticed that in recent interviews and press releases that TST has started to distance itself from LaVey altogether. People say that because TST is an atheist organization that they share that "atheist" platform with LaVey and the Church of Satan. That isn't accurate. We *do* believe in a force of nature that we symbolically refer to as Satan. We do not believe it's anthropomorphic or that it can (or care to) communicate with humans, it just is. Does gravity listen to the prayers of the passengers of a plane about to crash? We also do not believe a continued existence in an afterlife, but we are open to certain things that can be considered supernatural. I like to say we are "functionally" atheist and healthy skeptics. TST does not condone any belief in the supernatural at all.   If you have any other questions feel free to PM me.   Different people have their reasons. Some want to tap into a network of like-minded individuals for their mutual benefit (as /u/johnnywatts states), others just want throw in their support for an organization that upholds the philosophy they believe in. We have many members who join just to say "thanks for being around" and never reach out again. We have members who never tell another person of their affiliation, and we're contacted after they've passed and a family member finds their membership card in a safe.     When I first joined the Church of Satan it was mostly to acknowledge the body of work that their membership has produced and the suppport that their members had given me. I was a concert promoter and I noticed that just about every other show I helped put on had a COS member involved, or that there were many COS members in attendence. I had long considered myself a Satanist and supportive of the organization and its representatives, so I thought it was time I paid the Devil his due.     Keep in mind, joining the COS doesn't make one a better or more authentic Satanist. It doesn't even make one a Satanist at all. It's about what *you* put into it, or don't. Like I explained elsewhere, the $200 is mostly a real, physical barrier to entry. We only want people who thought it through and really wanted to join. The amount is both high enough to warrant a second thought and low enough to be reasonable for a person with sufficient means.    You pursue the implementation of Satanism by being the best you can be in the areas of your own influence. Be it your career, art, or personal achievements amongst your peers. Set out to be a shining example of what the Satanic philosophy can accomplish when met with skill and force of will. Communicate your goals and your accomplishments with the organization and you may be pointed towards others who share your goals and interests. We have members who are writers who work with publishers, musicians who go on tour together, web designer who collaborate with developers, professors who tap the shoulders of academics and the insight of brilliant minds, entrepreneurs learning from one another. I personally recently hooked up a producer of a show who needed a musician to come up with a soundtrack.   We're realists and understand that the internet is the most productive and wide reaching way for our international base to coordinate with one another. Like I said, individual members are free to gather and get to know each other in person. We will hold some official gathering in the future, but we will decide how much to reveal to the public or even our general membership. Realize that we're not omniscient. People can apply to our organization, join, and be active but still be unstable or have some ax to grind without us knowing. For example, if we were holding a celebration for a high profile member, we'd probably want to make this an invite only event with members who've shown us to be trustworthy and interested. So if you join, keep us informed and we'll keep you in the loop.   Yes, that could point towards a political leaning for a Satanist, and for many it is. I don't think every Satanist needs to agree with that word-for-word, and a case could be made that they could support a small social net in order to keep a Hobbesian all-against-all at bay.   "This is harsh, but that is the way of the world. We embrace reality and do not try to transform it into some utopia that is contrary to the very fabric of existence."    That's ultimately the key. Whatever social welfare we support it's not to dream for some utopian society where the needs of the herd are met. It's done so we can maximize our own personal interests. To borrow a term from physics, I believe such social programs to be a weak force, they work well in small groups, break when made large. But this is a whole other discussion.   I don't see the dissonance, what Gilmore wrote is descriptive, it would be the natural outcome of certain social and environmental situations.   My comment was not aimed at anyone who is content with their life, regardless of their monetary success. If that struck a nerve with you, that was not my intent. What I was aiming at are those who keep harping that our membership fee is some kind of greedy con (any MBA can tell you we do not have a profitable model) and that their public forum with thousands of free members somehow makes them relevant in some way. Which leads to OP's issue. And what LaVey was talking about was in regards to people trying to impress him with all their occult mumbo jumbo and how they were some great Anti-Cosmic grand wizards but couldn't pay the rent, so brother spare a dime?  I know this makes some people uncomfortable, but money is a useful metric for success. It is perfect? No. But it works well enough to filter out the flood of garbage our kind of aesthetic attracts.    Your life story is not unusual for a Satanist, shit happens, you suck it up and handle your business. I'd be more proud of myself if I were you. Hell, if I'm ever in DC I wouldn't mind getting a drink and talking video games.    As for evidence of successful members, I believe /u/Witch_Zaftig covered that well enough. We're not in the business of making martyrs or attracting people who need validation from others. We want individuals who are willing to stand on their own accomplishments.   He was involved in setting things into motion and working with Greenwald. Also featured in the film.    Our stance in regards to other organizations (most of which are little more than small circles of friends) comes not from a vacuum but from decades of experience. Every "Satanic" organization we've ever even considered affiliating with has embarrassed or misrepresented LaVey's philosophy in significant ways. Most of the time these people just want their own little fiefdoms to declare themselves Grand Master Flash over. This is why the grotto system was disbanded. Too many people joining the CoS only so they can dress up and fill a social void without contributing anything to the implementation of Satanism in the real world. All this leads to the very issue in your post, the image of a bunch of losers being representatives of the Satanic religion. Consider it a form of quality control. If that makes us look mean or arrogant in the "occult community", so be it, that ceased to be where we draw our most productive members a long time ago. We'll have no part of that rush to the bottom, even if it costs us potential numbers.   We do encourage individual members to get together at events or functions if they share goals and interests. I've been to and heard of such gatherings in Southern California, Salt Lake City, NYC, Vermont, Florida, Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, and others.    Aquino's drama was almost 40 years ago. He held his position because he was beneficial to the organization and LaVey considered him a friend. When he left he took a lot of kooky baggage with him and that was for the best. Since then we've both moved on, the TOS no longer considers themselves a Satanic organization in any way. As for Rex Church, even he admitted in his open letter of resignation that he hid his Theistic beliefs from the COS, knowing full well that they contradict our philosophy. We went our separate paths and both are better off. He's free to pursue his activities without the need to hide anything, and we remain consistent with our philosophy. Don't see the big deal.  Here's LaVey on the failure of the Grotto system and why we don't pursue organized recurring social functions. People seem to think that this was something new with Gilmore, but it's not, it's been operating procedure for decades.    I realized many people were joining our ranks simply because it was a guarantee of friends, or because they wanted glory of passing tests to earn degrees, much like the lodge hall Grand Poobahs who take off their robes and vestments and become the local plumber again outside their lodge. They were getting more spook-appeal out of being members of the Church of Satan than we were getting esteem from having them among our membership. As an organization grows, group activities only cause contention, drain vital energy that could be better applied elsewhere and eventually become counterproductive. Teaching people that theyre all right and society is all wrong, that the only ones who really understand them and that they can relate to are within the group, is damaging in the long run. It only reinforces their own inability to deal with the larger world.   Thats one reason why I dissolved the Grotto system. I wanted to create of forum, a loosely-structured cabal for the productive aliens, not misfits who need to depend on a group. After the re-organization, I was free to be more selective. I would much rather attract and lend support to those individuals who use their alienation  just as most leaders are usually different or distinctive in some way. Groups encourage dependence on beliefs and delusions to reinforce their omnipotence rather than applying magic on an individual basis, as The Satanic Bible outlines. Instead of fostering self-sufficiency and honest skepticism, I saw my group lapsing into blind belief and unhealthy anthropomorphism. Thats not what I intended and I had to make moves to get the Church of Satan back on track.   a. Yes, one of the key people behind the film is a member of the Church of Satan. You can dig around and find out without much effort. He doesn't hide it nor does he openly talk about it, like many of our successful members.  b. I suppose that depends on what you disagree with and if they're actual point of conflict. I've found that some people have misconceptions about the organization, or feel that because one member says or does one thing they're not comfortable with it must apply to whole entity. That's not always the case.   Also keep in mind that not everything someone does must be directly tied to Satanism. Satanism isn't the end result, it is a tool to be used.   Hah, he's gotten better responses since then. He's certainly more Left leaning than other Satanists, but I can see the Satanic angle to that statement. Go experience this one life.   First of all, judging Satanism by the people in online forums is probably not the best course of action. While many Satanists are on social networks, not all are, and the most successful of them either aren't or aren't open about their Satanism online.    Second of all, SIN consists of the bottom of the barrel "Satanists". They're founded by a reject who could barely hold a job and lives with his mother at age 40. And what you observed is what happens when you have no barrier to entry, you attract anyone and everyone who thinks being a Satanist is cool and spooky without any sense of quality control.    People complain about the membership fee for the Church of Satan and yet this is exactly why it's there. It's a real, material barrier to entry. If $200 is a struggle for you, then may you should reconsider joining an organization that supports a power and elitism philosophy. That's less than I spend on a decent night out with my wife or ammunition at the range with friends. Anton LaVey was all about results. He didn't care if you memorized his texts or practiced every ritual, he cared that you actually made a difference in the real world. And not just to talk about it, but show it by gathering wealth, power, and influence.    At the recent Year 50 Conclave we had several successful Satanists demonstrate their achievements, including lawyers, entrepreneurs, corporate executives, computer security researchers, environmental scientists, musicians, engineers, and university professors. And those are only the ones that are open and chose to present themselves. You won't find our Reverends holding "gatherings" at the parking lot of a metal show, you'll find them doing [TED talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYFmJ9y6svg), producing [critically acclaimed documentaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenfour), lecturing [at universities](http://cimminneeholt.com/) [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8UPNFcnYIM) [events](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL47BE9BBAA6FD9C9F).  As LaVey said, water seeks its own level.      Not sure if you're joking or...    FYI, I 100% agree with Adam and Erin's statements on the emotionally disabled student who's trying to sue because she couldn't take an exam. Trigger warning: life is hard. Deal with it. Contrary to egalitarian belief not everyone can be anything they want to be.       [Best ouija board.](http://pbfcomics.com/220/)   I approve of everything in this photo, especially the 12 year scotch.   She isn't even nude though...    If you want Satanic nudity you might as well go to an actual Satanic porn star like [Ophelia Rain](https://www.twitter.com/OpheliaRainXXX)   Atheism is a building block in Satanism, but not the end-result. Atheists say there are no gods, and that's that. Satanism says, sure, objectively there are no conscious gods (LaVey and Gilmore both put forth the idea that Satan can be seen as a force of nature, unconscious, and uninterested in human affairs), but we still have a social and psychological need for religion and deification. So we self-deify by acknowledging that man creates gods, so who better than ourselves.    I would also say that the common ground with Humanism and Satanism is small, especially when we talk about institutional Secular Humanism. Secular humanism has a strong emphasis on altruistic morality and distributive justice, which Satanism completely rejects. Humanism also holds "human" life above all else and sees it as objectively valuable, where Satanism sees human life as cheap and only as valuable as the individual living it sees it. In many cases human life is seen as worth less than animal life.    Yes, rituals are an important part of Satanism.   Half of the people who complain about Magus Gilmore say he's too much like LaVey, the other half complains that he's too different from LaVey. Gilmore is not LaVey, he's his own person with his own focus and approach to Satanism and how it applies to today's current affairs.     In my opinion, Magus Gilmore pays less attention to (but does not disregard) ritual Greater Magic and the supernatural elements of Satanism. That said he does dedicate a chapter to the practice in [the Satanic Scriptures](http://underworldamusements.bigcartel.com/product/the-satanic-scriptures).     It's important to understand the context of the times as well. When LaVey started the Church of Satan he needed to be his own publicist. He needed to be a showman and shock people to let the world know that Satanists are real and have an organized religion of their own. This tapered off into the 80's, where LaVey himself said that phase was over, and the new phase was to start implementing Satanic ideals in the real world. So Magus Gilmore is a continuation of that. He's a lot less interested in attracting rock stars and celebrities who tend to burn out quickly and ditch Satanism in favor of the next trendy thing, and spends more time talking to successful entrepreneurs and established academics. Gilmore is also focusing on growing the Church of Satan as an international organization.    You can hear Reverend Campbell ask Gilmore himself what he sees as the differences between himself and Doctor LaVey in his Year 50 interview on 9sense, [fast forwarded here](https://youtu.be/6b5m2R6TPso?t=30m57s).   99.9% of the questions posted here, including yours, can be answered by reading the FAQ. For more details read the accompanying material.  [Church of Satan FAQ](http://www.churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php  )  [Satanism: Theory   Practice](http://www.churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php)  [Church of Satan Interviews](http://www.churchofsatan.com/theory-interviews.php)   If people are scared of Satanism because they think some devil is going to appear in a cloud of smoke and kill them then fine, go away. We don't want you. That's the point. We don't want everyone. If the word "Satan" is enough to scare them from actually reading and doing your own research, then they should go cuddle up with someone else.    Because individualism, humanism, etc. are not religions. Satanism is a religion. We do believe in something we call Satan, but it's not the devil in horns that lives in this place called Hell. We believe Satan is the natural instincts in humans that has always been repressed by White Light religions throughout history. It's the force of nature that keeps things in balance. It has no thoughts, no emotions, and doesn't care what people think or do. It just is. Like the force of gravity. We call that Satan. Satanism is not humanism and there's a lot in our philosophy that is anti-humanism. Individualism is part of our philosophy, but we do not believe all people are individuals (most people are herd animals).     Satanism is a combination, expansion, and reinvention of many different philosophies and ideologies, when taken in sum stands on its own.         If you're ugly, use that to your advantage. Become a terror to those that would belittle you and a source of awe and inspiration for others.   You must be referring to the Ninth Satanic Sin: Lack of Aesthetics. LaVey states that the Satanist should have an understanding of what's visually stimulating and use it to their advantage. This does not always mean "beautiful". He gives the example of using a sinister or frightening aesthetic for certain situations, or if you're a older man, maybe the look of a wise old sage. The idea is that you should recognize that visual signals are an important part of Lesser Magic and a Satanist would be a fool to think it doesn't matter how they look.   What made Zeena go Buddhist? I have no idea and I really don't care. It's clear that she left the Temple of Set for exactly the same reason she left the Church of Satan, she wanted more power and she was denied. I think Buddhism gave her an audience that was open to manipulation and victimhood, so she can be seen as a spiritual leader, like she always wanted.   One of the core fundamental concepts in Buddhism is la, or ethical conduct, and it is completely based on abstinence (abstain from killing, abstain from taking what is not given, abstain from sensual misconduct, abstain from liquors, wines, etc.) This is completely against the Satanic principle of indulgence. Also consider the Noble Eightfold Path strives to eradicate hate   greed, where Satanism says hate and greed are productive natural instincts that should be exercised. I would say Buddhism is fundamentally incompatible with Satanism.   LaVey warned against giving people credit just based on who their parents are, and that includes his own children. Zeena left the Church of Satan in 1990 and renounced Satanism. Any statements made after that time do not reflect Satanism at all.   Errr... No. Thats ridiculous. The Church of Satan does not endorse racism. People should be judged on their own individual merits. We do acknowledge scientifically provable human biodiversity and believe it to be a field that should be fully explored without fear or taboo.    The only time I've been asked about the Sigil of Baphomet in public was once in Disneyland. I was wearing a CoS polo shirt and a cast member asked "What does that symbol mean? I see people wearing that here often". I said it's the symbol for Satanism and the Church of Satan. Many of our members have a fondness for Disney's work and consider Disneyland to be a special place.    But that's a stranger, and you're asking about someone familiar with you. Depends, but at that point you're probably best of at least explaining it on simple terms. It's the symbol that represents your philosophy, based on individualism, rationalism, and an appreciation for life and all its wonders. Obviously this is a glowing angle on our religion, they can figure out the rest on their own if they want.   [What?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/what1.gif)   I think it'd be a far stretch to consider TST on the Left Hand Path. The idea of the Left Hand Path is the use of black magic to achieve self-deification and fulfillment of the will. TST completely rejects the idea of ritual magic, in any form. I would posit that they also reject the idea of self-deification, as that implies stratification, which contradicts their egalitarian position.        http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-on_sentence   All of his official books mentioned in this thread are required reading if you want to get a strong understanding of his philosophy. But I would suggest you read [Letters from the Devil](http://underworldamusements.bigcartel.com/product/letters-from-the-devil) right after your next selection. LFTD is a collection of questions and responses from LaVey's time as a magazine columnist from the late 60's and early 70's. You'll notice that he's answering questions back then that many people are asking today, even on this sub. Many of my responses on basic questions (why "Satan", our stance on crime and drugs, politics, Satanism vs. Humanism) are sourced from this collection, based on things LaVey said himself on those topics. The book also contains much of LaVey's sense of humor.    Sigh. Don't worry, I've seen the nipples. Do you really want to be [this guy](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/024/183/500pxShopped.jpg) or do you have some kind of complex?   On Satanism and Objectivism: http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php       I actually enjoyed this article, believe it or not! Some of the first people who advocated for cryptocurrency were Satanists, including a CoS Priest who analyzed the security of Bitcoin in its early years.   Not sure if you've been to our website recently but we do [accept donations](http://churchofsatan.com/support-the-organization.php), though we do not advertise it normally. We have accepted personal Bitcoin transactions in the past but not for membership, and probably not for a while for various reasons as this was something we have considered. Maybe for donations.    You're right though, we aren't a charity. We're not altruists, we believe time and resources should be compensated.    They're something called abductor muscles, commonly referred to as "abs". Highly recommended.    Would share the uncensored image but... nah. Here is a link to the model.   https://www.facebook.com/carlottachampagnefans   Good one! I'm not the designer, but I can pass the suggestion on to Ashley Palmer of ASP Apparel and Kevin Slaughter of Underworld Amusements for consideration.     I also prefer knives for personal concealed protection, never leave home without one.   I do consider myself a realist in certain definitions, I believe there's an objective reality out there, and science is the best tool we have for understanding it. It doesn't mean I discard everything else, or ignore instances of pessimistic induction (what was once scientifically true is now false, and vice versa). I keep an open mind, but I don't let my brain fall out.    No, not a "theist" at all. I don't believe any of this requires any belief in external intervening gods, spirits, or demons. It's all flesh, mind, and electricity.    Read the online material and figure it out. If you have more questions read the The Satanic Bible. It's fairly short and an entertaining read.     http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php  http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php  [The Satanic Bible](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380015390/churchofsatan)       In my experience I've observed the very real effects of aesthetics, architecture, and audio stimuli as they are applied in a ritual setting. At a basic level participants are affected and can change the world according to the goals of the working. That's why the most effective rituals are those with large audiences (performances, etc)  But that's not the end of it. I understand that OP and you are asking about influence at a distance. I believe there to be so many variables at play that it will be a very long time before there can be any substantial scientific claims on this phenomenon. I believe most projected influence to be minimal, limited by what LaVey termed the Balance Factor (realistic expectations).     LaVey addressed the skepticism of magic by noting that nothing but extreme, highly repeatable physical manipulation will only begin to convince the hardcore skeptic. He proposed that the amount of psychic energy to accomplish this could be used to gather an army across the world (proposed, not saying this can be done), so why would this person bother with that exercise if he wouldn't be believed anyway?     Personally I see magic as a subtle art that can tip things in your favor. Workings are like a combination lock, requiring various pieces to fall into place, some in your control, some not. I've had more than a few lucky coincidences in my life not to dismiss the Seventh Rule.   Here are some basic premises: all religions and gods are created by man. There is no such thing as divine intervention or transcendence. So we created our own religion, gave it the name and symbols that best suit our needs. If that doesn't satisfy you, well, have a listen to the world's smallest violin.     It's the 50th year and we've just got started. So far, so good.    We do believe in something we call Satan, but it's not the anthropomorphic Christian deity. Satan is the balancing force in nature, and we build on that with a system of symbols and metaphors that represent the Hebrew idea of the Adversary.         Yes.   Interestingly enough one of the latest political arenas we've seen LaVey's teachings applied has been the Neoreactionary/Dark Enlightenment movement. I've spoken to several writers from that camp who've named LaVey and several other Satanists as influences. But anyway... this dance has gone on for 50 years. The Left wrings its hands about our support for eugenics, Social Darwinism, and Lex Talonis. And the Far Right tend to have such a terrible sense of humor. Oh yeah, then there's that whole Jew thing. "Confound and confuse til the stars be numbered."   I suggest you get familiar with the idea of pragmatism. It'll serve you well when you're out in the real world. And yes, I get what you were implying with that "black nail polish" comment. Learn a little about confirmation bias before you make such lazy generalizations. Ultimately we don't care much about the people initially attracted to Satanism and what baggage they bring. We're interested in the few people who actually understand it, apply it and gain power in the real world.   Hah! Good catch. Fixed.   It's nice having your own schedule and [business class Wi-Fi](http://i.imgur.com/665ePhK.jpg).      What do you make of it? You exercise it. If you drop the Social Darwinism you no longer have Satanism. Period.    Have you even met any Church of Satan members? I don't remember any of them wearing black nail polish, unless they were females. The last few that I've talked with include a political lobbyist, a CNN correspondent, a member of WikiLeaks, a nuclear scientist, a Navy Seal, lawyers and business executives, standup comics, and university professors.     Sorry, but being 21 and living on a college campus doesn't qualify you in any significant way. Satan is real, but not as some ineffectual occult bullshit, but in the energy and force behind the people actually causing change in the real world.    LaVey's philosophy is needed now more than ever. If you think his message is strictly anti-Judeo-Christian (learn to spell it if you're going to address it), then you need to work on your reading comprehension (if you read any of his material at all).    OP's list is his own subjective application of Satanism. I don't agree with it, and I think many other Satanists won't either. I could easily come up with a list that's directly the opposite of these points that are more closely aligned with LaVey's philosophy. But that shouldn't matter, it's up to each person to decide how they want to integrate Satanism in their lives.     We believe in some things that could be considered "supernatural", though we don't think them to be spiritual in nature. We also do accept magic beyond psychodrama, though we do not require blind-belief in this.    Don't be a dummy, what in the world makes you think High Priest Gilmore posts on Facebook? Because we have an official page? You do realize that other people can maintain and post to a Facebook page, and many large organizations have a staff that handles things things, right? I would know because I'm part of that staff that posts and moderates it. Sorry to burst your bubble but Peter Gilmore is not on social media.     The person trying hardest to be "edgy" in this sub recently is you, so don't try that.    If by evil you mean cheap. Last hardcover limited press book I bought cost $80. Half of this book, in used hardcover, usually goes for $700-$900 (check the screenshots on the page). Think this could have easily sold for $150 all day.   That can be your personal synthesis of Satanism and Liberal Humanism, but wouldn't say much of that has to do with Satanism specifically. Either way, if that works for you that's great.   Yes, it's a special pressing through Harper Collins that's part of our Year 50 series of announcements and events.   Always good to have an extra one for marking up, dog eared, and with references, and another one for special occasions.       Thank you for the conversation, had a great time!   How old are you?   As the director of RFS I'm making it a goal to step up the production quality of our shows in the coming year. Hell, I need to get back on a regular schedule with my own show. Have you heard Terror Transmission? That's one of the best produced podcasts out there, in my opinion. http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/terrortransmission/   Remember the sin of self-deceit. The Satanist knows her strengths and weaknesses, and knows when to seek the advice or assistance of others. Being an individual doesn't mean you're an isolationist. Even wolves have their packs, choose yours wisely.   While there is some common ground between Secular Humanism and Satanism, there exists some core differences. Like you say, the sacrifice of the individual for the good of humanity is ultimately conflicting with Satanism. Keep in mind that Satanism is not a normalized philosophy. We do not believe that everyone is or can be a Satanist, so he or she many see it to their best interest to advocate Secular Humanist policies without subjecting themselves those principles.    Listen to High Priest Gilmore on Point of Inquiry for more on Satanism vs. Secular Humanism http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/   Stay Strange does regular outsider/DIY music events throughout the city. Not seeing anything currently booked in your time frame but follow them online and see if something comes up.     Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stay-Strange/343201505692906?pnref=lhc    Website: http://staystrange.com/upcoming-stay-strange-shows/   Did you even read the comment I made? What's morbid about supporting technology that may help you eliminate disorders or cancers? A number of well established organizations support such research such as International Association for the, Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics, Galton Institute, Human Betterment Foundation, Planned Parenthood, Mensa, and others.   Yes, eugenics is an inherently Satanic concept. Yes, the Church of Satan supports eugenics research and implementation. And yes, Peter H. Gilmore did write about and support eugenics. But if you read the article it states that there are normally two forms of eugenics, negative and positive. Negative eugenics is the restriction of genes through sterilization and birth control. Positive eugenics increases fit genes through the promotion of procreation (financial incentives, etc.). Peter H. Gilmore advocated a Satanic Third Side (which genetic scientists have called "New Eugenics"), which is the advancement of genetic engineering and embryo profiling. He also did not advocate a compulsory system.    Satanism says "responsibility to the responsible". If you choose to have children, do so rationally and be ready to tackle the challenges you may face.    It's not the only entry http://lccn.loc.gov/2001005141      That's something for the individual Satanist to decide. As someone who grew up in ghetto neighborhoods I have little to no sympathy for the "less fortunate". That said I could see a Satanic angle in keeping a minimal welfare system with strong drug and timeline restrictions. The question is "who benefits?" The individual Satanist may benefit if it means a safer neighborhood, and his own ego would will get the satisfaction of helping others.    The thing is that the Five Point Plan is general and broad by design. It's part of that balance of the Church of Satan being a loose individualist organization. We provide some guidelines but we ultimately do not take official positions as that would misrepresent many of our members who wish to apply our philosophy in different ways, or who may not be interested in those topics at all.     Our public representatives mention the Five Point Plan frequently, I know I have and I hear it mentioned on 9sense regularly. I believe Rev Campbell even dedicates segments of his show to the points. The balance here to is not proselytize but to give material to those who are interested. That said, I do not see another revision any time soon. Blanche Barton wrote her revisited article in 2013 in the Cloven Hoof, in which she covered each point with current perspective. Members are free to address other issues not in the plan at their will, or ignore the plan altogether. Maybe in the future we may look into expanding. I could see the environmentalism being a possible addition.    That would make sense, yes.    First of all, the Church of Satan never had a public political agenda, so to say it moved away from that is inaccurate. The Five Point Program has always been a general guideline for individuals to pursue and use as a barometer to determine if they wish align themselves with the organization. We do not want to make headlines as the Church of Satan. We have many members who are out there pushing those Five Points in their lives but we do not require, or even desire, them to attach our name to their projects. We believe a Satanic revolution will happen and is happening without people realizing it. I can expand on some ways out members are active in each area.  1.  Blanche Barton gave a few examples of how this can be achieved in her revisited article. There are Satanists working closely with political organizations whose purpose is to cut government spending, cut social welfare programs, and  restriction government intervention. This includes about both local and national politics and a number of well funded think tanks. Very rarely do these individuals mention their Satanism by name, but their actions speak volumes. Focus has increased, and will be a talking point in the upcoming elections.   2. Not a focal point at the moment. Social norms have yet to accept the taxation of religious institutions. But HBO's recent Going Clear documentary on Scientology planted a seed on the absurdity of religious tax laws, so we hope that will bear fruit in the future.    3. The current Church-State debate is an obvious focal point. We have many members directly supporting and functioning in organizations like the Center of Inquiry, American Atheists, JREF, and others. We've had guests on skeptical and atheist podcast, radio shows (I just did one for a Miami based group), conferences, and more, nearly all on the common ground in the fight to keep our secular government. But some other points of interest would be the legalization of marijuana and right to die with dignity (both often fought by religious right).     4. We have some very public members working on such things as Real Dolls, demonic baby dolls, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. Much of this ties with the last point.     5. This one is fought both in the virtual and carnal worlds. On the former we have members pursuing virtual environments and AI. As for the latter, we have several public Satanists showing off their beautiful (or terrifying) homes and others manufacturing the products and materials necessary to give it that Satanic touch. But with that comes the need for privacy. With increased government surveillance and data collection comes the real threat of Thought Crime and a crackdown on outsider interests. Part of the goal of Total Environments and Artificial Human Companions is to have safe place to exorcize taboo interests without fear of hurting others or bringing unwanted attention.  This has been a hard fought issue for some very well known Satanists, including one Reverend who was featured in an Academy Award winning documentary on the issue.    So my point is, we are out there, making our moves as best we see fit. The Church of Satan exists to reach out to others who may share our goals and applications, not as a political party. We're interested in people who are out there right now applying these points in the real world, not those who are waiting on us to give them meaning. More often than not, realistically, flying a Sigil of Baphomet does your movement more harm than good. So don't do it, and don't come crying to us if you do and it backfires. Ideally this wouldn't be an issue, but we're not there yet. But we're not far off either.   I spoke to Magistra Barton about this article and the work that needs to be done refers to the advances by those individuals who wish to achieves these goals, not the goals themselves. We feel no need to update or adjust our program, only to switch focus from time to time.   True. Something to keep in mind.   If there only was an online encyclopedia that would immediately answer such a question...   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night    As the article indicates, it is the most important holiday in the Satanic calendar after one's individual birthdays. [Here's last year's announcement by Magus Gilmore from the Church of Satan](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/84341936702/wicked-walpurgisnacht), and [here's one from 2012 that seems popular](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/22121381050/wicked-walpurgisnacht-to-true-satanists-the).   It's my wedding anniversary so I'll have plans for my wife and I. We'll be going to Disneyland and meeting some Satanic friends for drinks at Club 33 and private dinner at Blue Bayou. Some of my associates have some grand plans this year on the East Coast.    Taking the word of slanderers and plagiarists, is also not considered reliable in academic research.  Err.. Sloane himself wrote about his affiliation with LaVey and his time with the Church of Satan. What I'm talking about is corroborating evidence to anything Sloane claims prior to 1968. There's none.   The whole "Horned God" story came out in an 1972 interview. At a glance through my notes and copy of "The God of Witches" it seems that at no point is the term "Sathanas" ever used. There is a recollected story of a witch who referred to a familiar as "Sathan". And that's it. Funny enough, "The God of Witches" was reprinted in 1970. Convenient timing.    So yes, no theological significance. There is no historical anthropological or theological connection to the term "Sathanas". The only printed material that the term appears in is a [story in a 1946 issue of Amazing Stories](http://imgur.com/nQqtSIx) (Shaver made up the word, his character was based on Ming the Merciless, ruler of the planet Satana. Odin is also in there, looking like Santa) and a whole bunch of illiterate black metal albums.    The only evidence of Sloane's group predating anyone is Sloane's own words decades later. There is no other confirmation of this. In academic research this not considered reliable and could only be referenced as a supposed post facto claim. By any serious measure Sloane became a Satanist in 1968. At its peak his group had maybe a dozen members, but mostly just a handful of locals.     And Aquino is not an Atheist... he's the founder of the most established Theistic Left Hand Path organization...   The only record of the Ophite Cultus Sathanas (the last word having no theological or metaphysical meaning, it was borrowed from an Amazing Stories novella) being founded in 1948 was a 1973 interview, and vaguely in some letters in 1968 in which he praises LaVey. There's no record of Sloane being anything other than a Mystic or Spiritualist (popular at the time) until 1968. At this time he is confirmed to have been affiliated with LaVey and the Church of Satan via the Grotto system. Official records are mixed, Aquino claims to not have heard of him as an important member during his time in the CoS, and also verifies he was not relevant to Satanism or considered himself a Satanist until after LaVey gained publicity in the late Sixties. The little media attention Sloane did get in the 70's compared him as a dumbed down awkward version of LaVey.   Individualism for the Satanist. I would argue that does not need to apply for the masses, because the masses need conformity. So I could see a Satanist being in favor of a Fascist society that he himself (the individual) places himself outside of or in power.    LaVey loudly rejected the invitation to the event (it wasn't a rally, only a couple dozen people attended, mostly people who had nothing to do with it and wanted to check it out l). He did not authorize it as a Church of Satan event, but his daughter and her husband Schreck got some of their friends (many were not Satanists or anything) to attend.   I'm very familiar with the 8/8/88 performance and the interview Rice conducted. I know people who were there and they've shared their experiences with me. First of all, while commenting on Hitler Boyd said very clearly "this is not Church of Satan doctrine" and does not represent Satanism. That aside, he was talking about the power of Nazi imagery and its occult significance, and an atavistic return to natural instincts, some of which is captured in National Socialist ideas, but not entirely.    Secondly, LaVey often wrote about the connection between Fascism and Satanism and noted that the relationship is largely aesthetic and an appreciation for Law   Order. Magus Peter Gilmore expands on this in The Satanic Scriptures, in which he said that generally a fascistic society would not be desirable for the Satanist, but he painted a scenario in which the Satanist can maneuver himself into a position of power and exert his will accordingly. Keep in mind, Satanism is not for the masses. There could be another scenario, where the Satanist is part of a small, familiar clan or tribe, and such a fascistic system would benefit him. It's all about positioning yourself and working within the system.   Nothing. There is no Satan, Hell, Heaven, etc. For more info: http://www.churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php   You realize most of the early seminal Neofolk albums were heavily influenced by Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen? Cohen being called out specifically by Douglas P. as a major influence and one of DIJ's first shows was opening for Nick Cave. Also most of the early neofolk scene was drenched in humor, irony, and experimental production. Considering those things, I would say King Dude is a return to the roots of Apocalyptic Folk.   Essentially, yes. I also find it amusing that people think having a sense of humor or irony is a neofolk sin. The whole "folk" aspect of "neofolk", which came from the term Apocalyptic Folk, was meant as an ironic, tongue-in-cheek joke. Think of albums like Looney Runes, etc.    Actually there are plenty of subs with strict rules that auto delete generic posts that ignore sidebar info.   It was good to see you there! I think we know each other, short but pleasant talk at the bar.   Great show, it was great to hear Rome   Worm Ouroboros over Complex's amazing sound system.   The funny thing is that TJ doesn't consider himself neofolk really, it just seemed to catch on with the neofolk scene through his associations.

       We had done some things. We went to some movies and spent a day at the beach together with her friends. We cuddled a few times, and kissed a few times. In the span of about a month and a half. I wanted to do more with her, to really become something more than friends, but I was so afraid to do anything that the relationship faded. She told me that she didn't think I was ready for a serious relationship. Honestly, I feel like I am, but my damned SAD is stopped me from doing as much as I wanted to do with her. I feel like this really could have been a great thing if it wasn't for my anxiety. It really sucks.    r/thalassophobia   	4

Do they decide what the rover should explore next or do they browse Facebook and dank memes?   AND they don't use timewarp, which is quite impressive, really.   Because it was such a big claim, I (who, I admit, usually don't read papers, yes I know, I should probably start) read [this paper](http://www.esciencecentral.org/journals/rosetta-studies-of-comet-pchuryumovgerasimenko-prospects-for-establishing-cometary-biology-2332-2519.1000126.pdf) of his yesterday but still remained unconvinced.   Could you give him at least due credit for his theory of stellar nucleosynthesis?   I am not sure it would cause mass panic. Sure, it would cause a massive amount of stir, but why panic? Some religious groups would go out of their way to deny that, conspiracy theorists would have group orgasm, plethora dank memes would be spawned, but nothing that would affect everyday life in any way.  I just don't see that much happening.         Fucking casuals.   Have you read the conversation below? I don't think they were joking.    Friggin modders.

I am a brony, and I know people who have their rooms full of merchandise (i don't), but that doesn't mean they're creepy (most of them are kind, friendly people, who just enjoy it). If they ever do some doll photo op like this, they do it in jest.  That said, there are people who are actually mentally unwell and delusional about their waifus (the word is also mostly used ironically) - I recall one who was **really** possesive about one of the characters and had all sorts of fantasies about their mutual love and was jealous of others liking her, really argumentative about it; was allegedly also physically violent toward his classmates -, but that is more of an exception.   I doubt they actually think like that, it's just like a stuffed animal and you pretend to make food for it for Fb, but of course it's understood that you make food for yourself.   That doll was supposed to be cute, but from this angle looks like an old woman.

No. Would she use the word "fat" for describing this girl? :P   I agree. And there are two more reasons I stopped playing.   1. I am a chicken, so I played on Peaceful. But on Peaceful you can't craft many items because there are no materials that only come from monsters. (it was more than a year since I last seriously played MC, so correct me if I am wrong)  2. There are so many craftable items, but there is no ingame documentation. I get that it is meant to be discovered by the player, but I think there should be ingame wiki for those that want it. The need to have MC wiki open in the browser ruins immersion.   Well, yeah, I guess. Maybe she wanted to show off the booty her uncle is getting...?   I don't think people here would mind that if she wasn't fat.   What if you're jumping to conclusions?   Thanks, I like nice art.   Ask the guy.   What if it's not her biological uncle?   Yea, I think so. (though there are people who can draw photorealistic sceneries)   I am pleased that this is a thing.

If they don't know the criteria by which to judge if something is true, or if admitting they are wrong would contradict their deeply held beliefs, people will happily believe bullshit. Consider people who believe even the most credulous things (New Age woo etc...) without equally strong evidence.  People also do some pretty dumb stuff. Even if 50 % of the stories on the subreddits like /r/FloridaMan , /r/NewsOfTheStupid , or /r/offbeat were fake and the other 50 % true there would still be quite a few some pretty dumb stuff people do.  Have you read /u/MyLifeSuxNow's story about his bitch wife? Afaik in the end settled Reddit found out that it is made up when people were pointing inconsistencies in it. And yet, it wasn't a very credulous story, I could totally see that happen. I thought it plausible, so I believed it until other people called BS. No big deal, it was just a funny story anyway.  And it is by no means the only example of me being fooled by a story and it most probably won't be the last.

I think most people would also be civil in such a situation.   It's not just about "going outside", that is all I meant to say with my comment.   Can you actually offer some reasonable argument or are you gonna keep using that stupid stereotype?   wat :D   have you heard about balaka and anti-balaka in africa? religious clashes in india? extreme buddhism?

 No.  There isn't. It is not ionizing radiation.  It has no more chance of giving you cancer than the heat from a stove will give you cancer.  But with RF radiation, theres already evidence that its an extremely unlikely carcinogen. For one thing, theres no plausible mechanism by which cell phones or Wi-Fi devices could cause cancer, said Leonard Finegold, a physics professor at Drexel University.  Its not just that we dont know exactly how RF waves would cause cancer. Its that theres no plausible way for it to happen without rewriting the laws of physics and biology. Its by the same reasoning that most scientists dismiss homeopathic medicine  at least the genuine kind thats so dilute theres nothing in it.

Just happens that the power is so low the effect is negligible and unnoticeable.  FCC regulations limit the maximum output of a consumer WiFi router to 1 watt (1000 mw).  That is not a lot of power.  Even small microwave ovens will be 700 watts so 700 times more powerful when it comes to heating things up versus your WiFi (and many microwave ovens go well over 1000 watts).

Psychological pricing (also price ending, charm pricing) is a pricing/marketing strategy based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. Retail prices are often expressed as "odd prices": a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or 2.98. Consumers tend to perceive odd prices as being significantly lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that lower pricing such as this institutes greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of price points.

Remember though that HSBC laundered at least $881 million in Mexican drug cartel money and $660 million in prohibited transactions from Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Libya and Burma.  No one is guessing at this.  They admitted it.  The banks' laundering transactions were so brazen that the NSA probably could have spotted them from space.

Others have already noted it is not a disorder because it does not harm the person or other people.    As far as having no "obviously valuable reason" there is some evidence to suggest (and note we are talking from an evolutionary standpoint and why being homosexual was not selected against) a gay person in the family increased the survival likelihood of the family.  This is often referred to as the [Gay Uncle theory.](http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html)  Also, there is some evidence that [the gene that makes men gay makes women in their family more fecund](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/13/highereducation.research) (fertile...they have more kids).

The members of FIFA are getting quite wealthy off it.   In the United States, the term "treaty" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty#United_States_law)  So, basically, a treaty is whatever the president wants to call it.  If it is inconvenient to get it passed as a treaty then no problem...call it something else and *poof*...problem solved.   Just playing Devil's Advocate here.  I am not a fan of AT T.  The First Amendment only protects you from the *government* restricting your right to free speech.  AT T is under no obligation from the First Amendment to let you use their service to say whatever you want.  Kinda like I have free speech but not in your front yard.  In your front yard you are free to tell me to shut-up and leave and no amount of my claiming you are restricting my right to free speech will help me.  So too with AT T.  It is their property so it is their terms that prevail.    Grey Stallion  Not great but I can live with it.  FTR I do not have an XBox...just used my GOG account for it.    [P47 is best as a hit-and-run "energy fighter".](https://youtu.be/Lu5vX86TdIU?t=629) Which is to say get altitude on your enemy, dive on them then use the energy from the dive to escape and climb back to altitude.  Rinse and repeat.  It actually wasn't a bad all around plane at all and could out-turn a BF-109 or FW-190 even at low altitude (BF-109 was definitely an energy fighter and getting into a turn match with other planes was usually death for it but they were lethal in hit-and-run fights).    You can if you do it the old fashioned way of holding the floor and talking forever.  60+ votes stops the procedural filibuster.  Also realize that fast track authority makes it against the rules to filibuster once the treaty comes up for a vote so it was now or never for them to filibuster.    [Angry Joe got one of those for his new battlestation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNN9RTChRiw)  His has GTX980's in SLI.  He says he got a deal on it for some promotional consideration but I have no idea how much.   How is it that for six years the republicans could filibuster with no more effort than raising an eyebrow?  And assuming there was some legislative routine that stopped the silent filibuster where were Warren and Sanders (and I assume they could find a few others) in this?  They should have done it the old fashioned way.  Surely they could get a few others on their side and done tag-team, stand on the floor and read the D.C. phonebook till they killed this.  I keep seeing Sanders offering up populist proposals but I have yet to see him throw down when it counts.  Going to fundraisers is a lot more fun than standing on the senate floor pulling a days long filibuster.    They find somewhere to perch and ride it out.  If the rain persists long enough (e.g. days) they can run a risk of starvation.  And it is not like one drip grounds them.

Get a stable OC of 4.5Ghz and max temps of around 55^o C while doing a stress test (I have seen a given core spike to just above 60^o C but only for a moment and it is back to about 55).

Nothing in the question, or in your answers, supposes acceleration at all.  The OP wrote:  will humans ever be able to reach them?  All answers were considering that question.  How do you propose humans move at light speed without acceleration?  Now consider the Twin Paradox and acceleration breaking symmetry and you see why things with mass cannot go the speed of light.   Further, the ONLY things that need no acceleration are massless particles.  Anything with mass *must* be accelerated to light speed (or arbitrarily close) because, in fact, things with mass can't go light speed (which is to say they come into existence slower and can only be accelerated around).    No.  Acceleration breaks the symmetry.  [See the "Twin Paradox".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox)   You are wrong.  You are right that you can get arbitrarily close to the speed of light which means your clock will run ever slower.  However, it is absolutely true that if you ACHIEVE light speed (impossible) and do not merely get ever closer your clock stops.  It is definitional in relativity.    I understand it just fine.  If we assume a magic rocket that can push you to the speed of light (impossible) time will stop for the people on the ship.    That said it is impossible for something with mass to got the speed of light so you can get arbitrarily close to it but never reach it.    To those looking at you they will see your clocks moving slower.  To you your clocks will be running at a normal speed.  If you actually achieved light speed your clock stops.  Indeed physics call allow for things that go faster than light speed (e.g. tachyons) or slower (NOTE: we have never observed things that go faster than "c" but they can fit within current physical models).  But light speed itself is a barrier.  Things that go faster can never go slower and vice versa.     "c" is the speed of light in a vacuum.  It is measured as 299,792,458 m/s in *all* reference frames (meaning no matter where you are or what you are doing you will measure the speed of light in a vacuum as that speed).  It is a universal speed limit so no...no human can ever reach it.    Nothing with mass can reach that speed.    There are a variety of reasons such as time slowing down the closer you get to "c".  When you hit "c" time would stop for you (e.g. if you pushed the button on your magic space ship drive that moved you at "c" you could never, ever, in the history of the whole universe, push the button again to turn it off because time will have stopped for you...the universe will literally cease to exist before you can push the button again to stop your ship).  There are other issues too but that is a show stopper all by itself.    ["Naked short selling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling) is selling shares you do not own.  It has a dubious legal status.  It can be done but is dodgy.  Most times short selling is done by borrowing from someone who owns the security.  For example, let's say you own 100 pebbles.  I think pebbles will go down in value.  So I borrow some pebbles from you with a promise to give them back to you a week later.  You agree and charge me some fee for the trouble.  I borrow 10 of your 100 pebbles and immediately sell them on the market.  Let's say for $10 each ($100 total).  I HAVE to give you 10 pebbles back at the end of the week...no matter what!  So, if the pebble lose value I can re-buy the pebbles on the open market for less than I sold them.  Pretend at the end of the week I can buy those pebbles back for $9.00/each.  I can re-buy the 10 pebbles $90.   I now give you your 10 pebbles back.  They cost me $90 but when I borrowed from you a week earlier I sold them for $100 so I pocket $10 (actually a bit less due to fees and a charge to "borrow" the security).  If the pebbles rise in value I'm screwed.  I still have to buy back 10 shares to return to you but now I buy them at a loss.    Let's say you think Widget Corp. stock will go down in price.  1)  Borrow the stock from someone who owns stock in "Widget Corp." (naked short selling is selling the stock without owning it which is usually a crime).  2) When you borrow the stock you promise to repay the person the stock you borrowed (not in cash as if you bought it but return the stock) and often some cash for the service.    3)  When the stock goes down you sell it.  Say you borrowed it when it was $100.  You then sell it at $100.  A short time later, if you guessed right, the stock is worth, say, $90.  You re-buy the shares you borrowed for $90/share and return them to the person you borrowed from.  4)  You pocket the difference between the borrowed price and the re-purchase price minus some fees.  If the price goes up you *still* have to give the stock back which means you buy at a loss and lose money on the transaction.  You can also use Options to give you an "option" to buy or sell stock at a set price.  This can be used to bet either way on a stock market move.  However, it is safer because you have the "option" and not an obligation to sell the stock.  You pay a premium very much akin to an insurance premium for this right.  In this way you can spend a little to cover you from a big move.   LSD and marijuana are not physically addictive.  I doubt he smoked enough hashish to be an issue.     Hot dogs don't need to have 10lbs of condiments to be delicious.   Just do not ask for ketchup there.  I know a lot of people get bent out of shape because they want their food their way but a few Chicago hot dog joints are unrepentant about refusing to put ketchup on hot dogs.  Personally I support them in refusing to put ketchup on hot dogs.  If you like your hot dogs that way vote with your feet and go elsewhere.    That *looks* kinda gross.     Alien: Isolation was recently revealed to have sold 2 million copies, which has to be disappointing for a big name franchise like that launching on 5 platforms.  Yup although really 2+ million sold is not bad at all by most measures.  Sega has revealed its full-year software units sales, and some of its releases have fallen short of sales expectations. Most noticeably is the critical hit Alien: Isolation, which has solid 2.1 million copies to date, but failed to meet Sega expectations.

Steel becomes molten at about 1500c but becomes fairly malleable at about 500c  As can be seen at any blacksmith's forge as they hammer out hot steel into whatever it is they are making.

AMD has been AWOL with competitive video card releases for awhile now.  [Nvidia has had four releases with no answer from AMD](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2015/03/17/with-titan-x-nvidia-has-introduced-4-unanswered-gpus/) and the [r9 280x was pretty much a re-branded 7970.](https://youtu.be/xoH3ly5gkoI?t=507)  People can fanboy all they want about which cards are better but at the end of the day we are all served well when there is real competition between them.  Without it we get crap like this from Nvidia.  Let's hope the upcoming card from AMD is a performance winner and a good value.  As consumers we will all win if it is.    They just never made a constitutional framework that could eliminate them.  They practically guaranteed it.  Perhaps they did not realize it but a First Past the Post voting system such as we have in the US basically guarantees a two-party system.   There are other reasons for the Electoral College.  If the president is elected by direct vote (e.g. just a straight-up 50%+1 vote of the whole voting populace) then the president can ignore wide swaths of the country.  The population is centered in cities so the "fly over" states can largely be ignored.  Or...pander to an ethnic majority or religious majority.  With the electoral college the candidates need to win a lot of smaller races to win.  They cannot ignore minority interests as easily.  We are used to such contests and have no problem with them as a way to do things:  The same logic that governs our electoral system, he saw, also applies to many sports--which Americans do, intuitively, understand. In baseballs World Series, for example, the team that scores the most runs overall is like a candidate who gets the most votes. But to become champion, that team must win the most games. In 1960, during a World Series as nail-bitingly close as that years presidential battle between Kennedy and Nixon, the New York Yankees, with the awesome slugging combination of Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Bill "Moose" Skowron, scored more than twice as many total runs as the Pittsburgh Pirates, 55 to 27. Yet the Yankees lost the series, four games to three. Even Natapoff, who grew up in the shadow of Yankee Stadium, conceded that Pittsburgh deserved to win. "Nobody walked away saying it was unfair," he says.

It is worth getting one.   Why does CDPR not seem to get the FOV issue?  Once again their game has a far too narrow a FOV for comfort.  I cannot believe they are unaware of it and only do it to hit some FPS mark.    Yes, that is why it is so yummy!   No one has ever claimed it was healthy. ;)    Foolproof, 1 minute hollandaise sauce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOWzVV_XrcM hd=1  Best cooking "trick" I've come across.  EDIT:  Changed link to original poster and not someone stealing their video.  Same video though.   How many people were protesting?  The article does not say.  A handful of cranks can be expected for any topic.  If there were several hundred then that is something else.    FWIW driving killed it for me and I own barley any driving games (i.e. I am not a snobbish about perfection in driving).  There was just something wonky about the controls in Watch Dogs that always made itself felt.  Like something soft and spongy...I dunno how to describe it.  It just SUCKED is all (sorry caps but yeah...it sucked).  Also...mouse movement in menus was just...bizarre and annoying (and I have mouse acceleration disabled on my PC).  tl;dr  Controls are seriously wonky.   Imagine we use pebbles as currency.  I want to buy a widget from you and it costs me ten pebbles.  I dig into my pocket and hand you ten pebbles and you give me the widget.  Electronic transfers are doing basically the same thing.  Taking stuff out of your pocket and giving it to someone else.  Obviously if we used pebbles for money transacting things like buying a house would be difficult.  We'd need trucks to carry the money around.  What is much more efficient is to just move the money around on a ledger.  So, you have all your pebbles at a bank.  So do a lot of other people.  You do not have a private vault with only your pebbles in it.  The bank keeps them all in a big pile and keeps a ledger that records who has what.  When an electronic transfer order comes in the bank records the transaction on their ledger which says you now have less money and the merchant has more money.  Yet not one pebble in the bank vault was moved.  It was all done on paper.  Even if it is different banks they have some money moving one way and some moving the other way.  At the end of the day they settle up and find most of it cancels out (e.g. my bank has to give your bank $5 but then someone else did business the other way and your bank owes my bank $5...at the end of the day they square their ledgers and no money physically moves).  You still need the pebbles in the vault though.  If you just think you can magic up some money without the assets to back it up (i.e. pebbles in this case) then bad things happen.  Ask Zimbabwe who tried it and ended up printing $100 trillion bills (yes, trillion with a "t").  [You can buy them for about US$40](http://banknoteworld.com/shop/Zimbabwe-100-Trillion-Dollars-2008-P-91-Uncirculated-1-Piece.html) but they are worthless as a currency.  Just a novelty item now.     The issue is that consoles are harming the PC gaming market.  Developers, very reasonably and understandably, develop to the lowest common denominator.  It is very expensive to make different versions for different systems.    I am on the fence with this one.  On the one hand CDPR seemed to go above and beyond to make what looks to be a high water mark in open world CRPG.  Doing that took a lot of time, people and money to produce.  To make a profit and stay in business they need to widen the audience and pull in consoles too.  Unfortunately this means graphics get left behind.  On the flip side it fucking sucks that the graphics on this highly anticipated game has been kneecapped.  We all know it could have been fucking awesome.  Stellar even.  Truly a triumph and an unparalleled high water mark.  Instead we get insipid graphics (honestly I am wondering if Witcher 2 actually has better graphics...I intend to check).  Personally I think if they had delivered a PC-only tour de force they'd have had people ditching their consoles and upgrading their PCs.  They should have had Intel and Nvidia subsidize them to give people a reason to buy new hardware.  tl;dr Consoles are killing PC gaming because they make the whole industry cater to the lowest performing setup.     You cannot send money you do not have because an electronic transfer is a deduction from one account and a deposit at another account.  So, you swipe your credit card at a store and the store's computer contacts your credit card provider and asks it if there is enough money in the account to cover the purchase.  If yes the sale continues and the amount is deducted from your account and added to the merchant's account.  If there is no money to be had the transaction is canceled.  So too with countries.  If Greece says, "Here is 500 billion," the bank receiving the money needs to find the account where that money is stored and deduct it.  If it is not there then it does not happen.     I like mine too.  My girlfriend likes it as well.    She has a great series of videos.  Anyone interested in this cuisine (which is very tasty) should watch her videos.     It may help a tiny bit when it comes to stuff like showers. But to a toilet, or if you're filling a pot with water to cook, it'll just take longer to fill. And in a shower situation, it may take you a little longer to rinse your hair, for example.  It helps more than that because people often let their taps run while doing things like brushing their teeth or washing dishes.  As a result there is a lot of water wasted.  Flow restrictors will minimize that waste.   There is not enough information in the OP to really tell why they might be getting headaches.  One possibility is you get [motion sickness playing video games](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/19/video-games-makes-me-sick).  It is fairly common and can present itself as a headache and/or nausea.    To combat this many PC games have a field of view (FOV) setting that you can adjust which may alleviate the problem.  For console players they are (generally) further from the TV while playing so do not suffer from this as much.  If it is happening while playing a console game try sitting further away from the TV.  Unfortunately some developers do not put a FOV control in their game for various reasons.  For me, if there is no FOV control I will not buy the game because playing makes me physically ill.   It's more than just cost.  AMD cards are competitive but Nvidia is winning the marketing war.  You can see many in this thread who just *know* that Nvidia = faster (even though it is not really true or only just barely true and hardly worth nothing the difference).  While that is in error some things push that perception.  One of which is what I posted above.  Eight months with no answer to your competitor makes it seem you are a has-been in the tech industry.   Further, AMD's substantially higher power requirements (and attendant higher heat generation) is a drawback and again makes them seem less efficient and thus old tech.  As I said I have used AMD cards for the last 7 or so years.  I am not an Nvidia fanboy.  But I was in the zone for a new card and AMD had nothing I wanted anymore.  That's just me though.  To be clear I really, really hope AMD succeeds with this new card.  Strong competition is good for us.  Unfortunately, and I have no idea why, AMD has lost a few steps on their competitors (Intel and Nvidia).  There was once a day when they had those guys running scared.  Now AMD is perceived as the bargain bin level of computing.  They really need to up their game.  Not easy, their competition is doing their level best to bury them and are close to succeeding.  They'll be willing to lose money in the short term if it means they can end the competition.  EDIT:  As an aside their "points program" where you earn points to get discounts on AMD stuff is pathetic.  It actually helped drive me away from AMD because it was so much bullshit.  You had to play a gazillion hours of different games to earn enough points to do much and the discounts were unbelievably pathetic for all that.     Why did AMD think they could get away with a single fan on the reference design?   [Nvidia's reference design is a single fan.](http://www.overclockers.co.uk/pimg/GX-255-EA_97524_350.jpg)  I have two 980s with the single fan reference design and while the card gets a bit toasty it is well within operating parameters and very quiet.  The advantage to these reference designs is they exhaust the hot air outside the case.  Most other cooling designs blow the hot air all around the inside of the case.  This diminishes cooling effectiveness since the fans are warming the air they use to cool the card.  If you have good case fans pushing all that out fine but more fans also equals more noise.     I just don't understand why people are talking about AMD's GPUs like they need some miracle to be competitive again.  It is linked in the article:  With todays more official reveal of the Titan X and its massive 12GB framebuffer, Nvidia has now introduced four unanswered graphics cards into the market since AMDs Radeon 285 in August 2014, and these GPUs have targeted a broad consumer demographic, ranging from the $200 GTX 960 all the way up to the $999 Titan X.  Thats 8 months without a new desktop GPU product from AMD, nearly an eternity in the tech world. Thats 8 months Nvidia has had to continue eroding AMDs market share. 8 months to steal away new fans, from the mainstream PC gamer all the way up to the ultra-enthusiast.

AMD had me.  AMD lost me and won't get me back for at least three years when I next consider an upgrade.    Outstanding.

I cannot think of another online video content provider I hate using more than Hulu.    We'll have to wait and see I guess.    I've been using Steam for eight years or so and I have only contacted support a few times (maybe three times).  EVERY time they were of no help whatsoever and left me out in the cold.  It did not matter that I am a very good and long time customer.  It did not matter that I rarely contact them (so not bugging them for every little thing).  EVERY TIME they were slow to respond and utterly unsympathetic.  They had my money, I could go fuck myself.  Why?  Because fuck you, that's why.  They know there was nothing I could do about it.  They had me over a barrel and were more than content to leave me there.  GOG will not out compete Steam today or tomorrow but in a few years who knows?  Steam when it started kinda sucked and look where it is today.  I sincerely hope GOG makes a good go of this and Steam finds its lack of consumer support is its Achilles' Heel.     You can try to contact the store you bought it from about it.  I got my new 980 from Newegg just before the new promotion started and they were super cool about it.  Sent me the code.  Note there is no guarantee they will give you the code.  They may tell you to go pound sand but it is always worth a try.  (As it happens I am about to upgrade my whole PC anyway and they just guaranteed themselves all my purchases...awesome customer service is all too rare these days.)     If they have even the merest hint of actual, responsive customer service they will win over Steam.   This.  Make it so whoever it is you want to get revenge on is massively jealous of your success and awesomeness.  Bonus:  Totally legal and your life is rocking!   George Lazenby.  Probably the worst Bond and in only one film ([On Her Majesty's Secret Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_%28film%29)).  In the film something bad happens to him (avoiding spoilers).  This could easily be used as a reason for him breaking bad.  I think he'd actually have been an ok bad guy.      There are a number of theories but perhaps the most prevalent one is the ["gay uncle" theory](http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html).  In short, gay uncles provide a net benefit to the survival of the extended family (since they do not have kids of their own they expend energy and aid in the survival of the extended family).   There is also a [theory that female relatives of gay men are more fecund](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2158795/Gay-gene-survives-generations-female-relatives-homosexual-men-babies.html) (have more babies).    As it happens the population does not need many males.  It needs females so some men "dropping out" of the gene pool is not a bad natural selection thing if his sisters are better able to make babies.

In general self-policing organizations such as the Bar Association or American Medical Association are not eager to punish their own members.

Akin to the police not really policing their own members (e.g. a cop generally will not ticket another cop).    You are pretty much correct.  The salt left behind needs to be disposed of.

Physics teaches us that gravitation and acceleration are indistinguishable from each other without an external frame of reference.  Yup.  For the record it is called [The Equivalence Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) and was put forward by Einstein in the Theory of General Relativity.    From my point of view, it largely seems to stem from the fact he is hiding behind the first amendment to promote fringe or even quack medical and health products.  Well, while it is true he invoked his free speech rights under the First Amendment as his excuse to continue saying what he is saying it should be noted that his rights under the First Amendment were never in peril.  The First Amendment only protects you from the government silencing you.  It is entirely within the rights of Columbia University to revoke his status there and for other people to point out he is a snake oil salesman.  Dr. Oz can continue to stand in his front yard saying anything he likes but the University he works for is not required to grant him a stage or their imprimatur.  More broadly speaking to the OP the outrage towards Dr. Oz is not new at all.  There has long been anger and outrage at his peddling "magic pills".  It is only lately that the community of doctors is turning against him.  Generally they are loathe to go after one of their own (because someday they may be the one people go after and they do not want that).  But Dr. Oz has been so consistently bad for so long they could no longer remain silent and have called for his ouster from Columbia.  In some ways it is too bad this is happening.  By all accounts he is a personable guy and an exceptional heart surgeon.  It is his peddling snake oil cures that has people angry *particularly* because he is a doctor and definitely knows better.  *Primum non nocere* is a Latin phrase that means "first, do no harm" and is is one of the principal precepts of bioethics.  He is violating that.      We've been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards...  Taking 75% of the money off the back of the mod maker's work is not sharing in the profits.  It is bilking them.  If your and Bethesda's real concern was for the mod maker you'd find a way to allow people to donate money to them legally and above board then take maybe 10-15% for your processing fees.    I have issue with it.  Not because I do not think mod makers should necessarily work for free but considering the number of mods I like to use and try and change over time the mods can very, very quickly outstrip the cost of the game itself.  I had 30 mods on Skyrim and tried many more over the years.  Smacks of microtransaction hell.  Frankly there did not seem to be a problem with mods as they were.  There was no hue and cry for mod makers to get paid.  Why this should change except to line the pockets of devs and Valve even more is beyond me.  If they REALLY wanted mods makers to be able to make money they could setup a donation system and clear and legal roadblocks for the mod makers to collect.   All I can do is vote with my wallet.  I just bought Witcher 3 elsewhere because of this.  I will continue to find alternate venues to buy my games.  I may not always be able to and then I will buy from Steam but I can guarantee Steam will lose more from the games I won't buy from them than the mods I will buy from them.  FWIW I have been a customer of Steam for a long time and barring one or two cases (unless it was an exclusive tied to something like Origin) bought all my games through them.  I am not their #1 customer or probably even their #10,000 customer but I have spent a considerable sum with them over the years.  I will make it a point to try and spend my money elsewhere.  Amazon, GOG, Green Man Gaming are vendors that leap to mind and, much as I hate to say it, I might have to look to Origin.  If Origin/EA has a clue they'd do well to take advantage of it.  Origin already has a better return policy.  Combine that with Steam's utter lack of customer support and its new mod policy and competitors might have an opening.    One can only hope.    While I think the whole idea of paid mods is in error clearly the 75% take is obnoxious.  45% *might* be ok and Valve takes its 30% cut out of that 45%.  Just an idea, I have no idea of the *right* numbers since I think mods should not be paid for (people should be allowed to donate).  But if they MUST be paid for the 75% take from Valve/Bethesda is truly obscene.   In many cases you can buy the game elsewhere and still use it with Steam.  I'd suggest exploring every other possible avenue to buy a game before buying it off Steam.  GOG, Green Man Gaming and Amazon leap to mind.  If it is something you want and just have to buy through Steam for some reason then fine.  But even so if you buy most games elsewhere they'll feel the pinch and lose more than they make on Mod sales.    "If you're going through hell, keep going." ~Winston Churchill    There are many reasons why a mod maker may not return to fix a mod (some good and some not so good).  One thing is certain though...they already have your money.   The problem is not buying mods does not hurt Valve in any way whatsoever.  Prior to this they made no money on mods.  They then added a bit of code to their billing system and now they can.  If you do not buy any mods they are no worse off than they were before.  It does not hurt them in the slightest.  I completely get your anger and I share it.  I just do not think Valve gives a fuck and this is the first time I have seen them turn to purely anti-consumer, money grubbing tactics ala the EA model.  If the goal is to reward mod designers the mod designers can setup a Patreon account or a dozen other means to ask the community for support.  I do not see how them getting a mere 25% will be better for them than random donations.  If Valve wants to make more money they should get Half-Life 3 out.  Pretty sure that would net them a few $$$.    Mother Nature wants us to perpetuate the species.  Evolution has seen to it that we enjoy having sex to further that goal.   But a train ride from NYC to Chicago is just a waste of time.  Would it?  The distance is 790 miles.    A plane will make the trip in 2 hours and 10 minutes (130 minutes).  On paper the train (if we assume 300 MPH average) would take 2.6 hours (let's go with three hours for a round number).  So, the high speed train would take 50 minutes longer.   BUT:  - The train goes from city center to city center.  No need for commute.  I live in Chicago and can tell you the Chicago end will be 30-45 minutes from airport to city center.  Add on how long it takes to get to LaGuardia, JFK or Newark in New York).   - You need to get to the airport particularly early to clear security.  Add on anywhere from 5-30 minutes for that (you never know...sometimes fast, sometimes slow but you have to allow for slow).  - The train is more comfortable.  Bigger seats.  No air pressure differentials.  Concession cars/bar cars.  I'd think Chicago to New York would be competitive.  At a guess I think any trip under 1000 miles might be well worth considering a train for instead of a plane (all things considered).    Well, yes and no.  Certainly jet planes fly faster.  But not by as much as you might think.  Average jetliner cruise speeds are around 550 MPH.  200 MPH faster than the train is a lot but then the plane spends a good deal of time slower at takeoff and especially landing.  I am not sure what the average speed is for a whole flight (terminal to terminal) but I bet it is a lot less than 550 MPH.  The train would be too since it would not maintain 366 MPH the whole way but willing to bet it is less of a decrease than the plane.  Add in the time you need to dork around in an airport (getting there 90 minutes before your flight to clear security and what not) and you can start to see there is a sizeable window where high speed trains would make sense and be competitively fast getting from Point-A to Point-B.  Even better trains can go from city center to city center.  Quite unlike the commute to the periphery of a city to get to an airport.  Cross country in the US (NY - LA) would be too slow but lots of shorter jaunts would make sense and further than you might think.  Also consider that trains are almost always more comfortable.  Bigger seats, bar cars, cell phone service, easier to walk around  and so on make them a LOT more attractive than the cattle car airline seating and amenities.  TL;DR:  Bottom line when you consider ALL travel time associated with using a plane or train (commute to the airport/station, time to check in, etc.) it is easy to see how high speed trains could be quite competitive with a plane in terms of time.  Add in comfort and the train really pulls ahead in all but very long travel distances.    Clinton will embrace the TPP and it will be perhaps the clearest indication of her too cozy relationship with Wall Street.  She will navigate this easily enough by not actually being a part of it.  She is currently out of the government so she will wring her hands and say there is nothing she can do.  She may well mouth some platitudes for the liberal base but she will not do a thing to oppose it.  Nothing short of her saying explicitly and clearly that she will do her level best, if she becomes president, to see the US not be a party to the TPP or leave it if we already are will amount to anything.  Don't hold your breath.    Is there some reason someone can't write a plugin that fudges this information?  I mean, one computer is asking another for certain information.  Surely this can be prevented or altered before sending that data.  Is the data somehow necessary to be able to browse?    They look "guilty" because you are looking at them like they ought to be guilty. Even though you may claim to not be trying to do so.   I am guessing you have never had a dog.  I have and there have been numerous times where I came home with zero clue anything was wrong.  Instead of my dog greeting me as usual she'd be reluctant and frankly looking guilty as hell.  There was no prompt from me that would scare her into submission.  I was walking in the door as normal.  It was then I knew to go looking for the trouble she caused.  Dogs are intelligent creatures.  They share the same emotions we do.  Even if you have never had a dog you can instantly recognize their emotional state be it happy or scared or angry or whatever.  Why?  Because we have those emotions in common.  There is no reason to think guilt over having done something bad is on the list.  Dogs have long memories and they can discern when they have done something "bad".  Like a little kid they fret over it.         Strictly speaking, dogs are rarely associated with being able to tell right from wrong, and what is correct and what is not. To them, mauling another animal may just be something that is natural and all part of the chain of life.  Dogs absolutely do have a sense of right and wrong.  There are [countless examples you can see on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guilty+dog) of dogs looking guilty.  They look guilty because they know they broke the rules.  One reason dogs work so well as pets for humans is dogs are innately social animals.  Even in the wild there are dos and don'ts among the pack that are enforced by the social structure.  Dogs are not a walking, furry machine of random.  They abide by and adhere to a set of rules just as humans do.       I was going to say he just lost my vote but to be fair I wouldn't have voted for him anyway.     When you call Comcast and the automated voice says "This call may be recorded for customer service purposes", that also gives you consent to record the call.  It is not clear at all that this is the case.  OK, so I passively agreed to being recorded by staying on the line after being informed that the call may be recorded. The representative agrees to be recorded as per their job with the call center they work with. Then what is the problem? Theyre recording so I can record.  Youre going to hate me on this but no, you can not. These are two separate instances of the same thing.   Thing 1 (T1): The location you are calling has consent from you and the person you are talking with to record the call.   Thing 2 (T2): Recording a call between you and an entity that you agreed to record your call  but did not agree to you recording them.  These are two different things. The center had consent to record from both parties. Ryan did not have that consent nor, in the recordings placed online, did he specifically ask or tell the representative he was recording.

Considering the center has moved pretty far right over the last decade she is hardly what most liberals would consider a liberal.  Further, it is believed she is a big friend of Wall Street and in the pocket of the bankers.  Finally I think there is a general sense of the presidency bouncing between two families.

Using that PPP rate for hypothetical currency conversions, a given amount of one currency thus has the same purchasing power whether used directly to purchase a market basket of goods or used to convert at the PPP rate to the other currency and then purchase the market basket using that currency. Observed deviations of the exchange rate from purchasing power parity are measured by deviations of the real exchange rate from its PPP value of 1. PPP exchange rates help to minimize misleading international comparisons that can arise with the use of market exchange rates.   For example, suppose that two countries produce the same physical amounts of goods as each other in each of two different years. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, when the GDP of one country measured in its own currency is converted to the other country's currency using market exchange rates, one country might be inferred to have higher real GDP than the other country in one year but lower in the other; both of these inferences would fail to reflect the reality of their relative levels of production. But if one country's GDP is converted into the other country's currency using PPP exchange rates instead of observed market exchange rates, the false inference will not occur.

So 2p is 14:00.  5p is 17:00.  5a is 5:00.  Basically, subtract 12 from any number over 12 to get the time for PM.  - UTC time is Coordinated Universal Time which is basically equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) which is a time zone.  All times in the world (via the time zones) are + or - from GMT so sort of making GMT the zero point.  Note that UTC is NOT a time zone (that is the main difference from GMT) and is always read on a 24-hour clock.  So for instance GMT may experience daylight savings adjustment while UTC will not.  - Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970,[1][note 1] not counting leap seconds.[1][2][note 2] It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats.

Installed the game, opened it, and only thing I get is "Dirty Bomb" picture in the right corner. On steam, it says i'm playing the game but I can't find it in the process. I tried turning it ON again but it says that the game is already running?  What the hell is going on?   You have some really good points, but I kinda want my games all on one place, you know? :/    fair enough   I meant on steam, it's only 35% there.   because it's actually good :D   AC Rogue is very tempting, but only 35%.  Why I'm saying only 35% when the game came out few months ago?   Well, game is currently 12.50$ on amazon, but it's uplay drm. ( I know you get uplay drm anyway, but I prefer my games on one place ).  My question is, do you guys think ROGUE will get a deeper discount during summer sale?   edit: link for AC ROGUE: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T6T93ZY/   game would  be untradeable so I'd have to gift it to you. I'll add you and we can work from there.   I can do 4 csgo keys for XCOM EU Complete if you want. They have to be color keys tho ( not base ones )   Yea, I got 50 because of EHOME.

Is it hard to build a PC by yourself? Did you use any tutorials?   8 keys bundle   yea, I heard it's supposed to come out soon, it's probably just me being a huge fan of the game and wants it early. 3 months of waiting is a lot in my opinion :/   really?   tomorrow is July? :)   Your thoughts?   I really really really like this series more than any other Telltale games ( I think GoT is tedious and boring, and I'm a huge fan of show ), but I'm not sure what's the hold up?   March 17th - ep 2 released   31st of  May - still no ep 3?    ?   I'll pass on Witcher and I have Far Cry already :D   what  the fuck   that's what he said ?   yea   here we go again ...

 Hey y'all, not sure if this is the right subreddit. I am looking for a charity/ nonprofit to volunteer with and donate to, but I'm having a helluva time wading through the sheer volume.. I thought maybe y'all could help?   I am an Army vet with combat experience,Does anyone know of a charity that I can volunteer with to teach/promote literacy amongst incarcerated folks? I mean like getting in the prison and teaching writing, poetry, speech, reading classes, or even just leading a book club..    Nice try ISIS   720p   Because I get shot at.    Oh, wait nevermind, that shit is fun.    Because I have to deal with privates.   I pop my dog in a disciplinary way. If he disobeys, gets hardheaded etc I will spank him. Always openhanded, and always on his rear. He is now well trained and I rarely have to discipline him at all.    No, Saul did not have a healthy commitment to God's law, or he would have believed in the messiah. Saul had a self centered and prideful outward appearance of obedience, but an inward rejection of the truth of God's law (namely the deity of Christ and legitimacy of his claims).    You cannot be truly committed to the Law of God without being regenerate.    Whitewash whitewash in my eye  Falling from a birdie in the sky  I'm a soldier so I don't cry  But I'm sure glad that cows can't fly.   Yes, and you have to have actually been in a conflict.         Join man, we need young blood. The VFW is a little more exclusive than the Legion because you have to have a campaign ribbon to join the VFW, but they are both phenomenal organizations.   Wrong use of "capitol". It is spelled "capital" when referring to a city, "capitol" is the brick and mortar building in which the legislature meets.   It always is, just remember people care about you. If you ever need someone to talk to, reach out. I am here if nobody else is.   Love is rooted in obedience. In John 14:15, Christ gives the basic equation. If we love him we will keep his commandments. Love for God is based in a healthy fear of his awesome power, commitment to his Law, and an equal and opposite hatred for the things that violate his law.   You won't always feel the mushy gushy love stuff. Love isn't the twitterpated hearty eyes our culture says it is.    That's all? Does it actually affect air flow?   I am 22, Afghanistan vet, and active VFW member. I love the VFW. They are one of the oldest VSOs around, and do tons for vets. Many young guys have an image of the VFW/Legion as a smoky, shitty bar full of drunk old farts. While some VFWs are like this, blanketing the whole organization as such is totally off base. Let me make some points.   1. Joining a VSO is about what you can give to the organization not what you get out of it. Many vets our age (and millenials in general) act pretty entitled. There has been an influx of new veterans organizations all about giving shit to vets, meanwhile these old vets and old VSOs are operating on a totally different premise. If you aren't looking for free shit or a pat on the back, but are looking to give back and continue your life of service, the VFW is a great place to be. The VFW offers many ways to get involved, showing up en masse to lonely vets funerals who die in nursing homes, getting involved with local organizations like habitat for humanity, getting involved with local politics to fight for vets, scholarship funds for vets kids, and even a home for orphans of war.    2. Many guys discount these old VSOs because of the large number of Korea/Vietnam/old crusty vets. Doing so overlooks a huge resource. These guys have been there, done that, and seen most of the issues we are now facing. They make phenomenal (and willing) mentors. Sometimes the reason VFW bars are full of crusty old vets is because they have nowhere else to go where folks understand them.   3. I have been very enriched by my experience with the VFW. The old guys in my post have given me solid (and sometimes blunt) advice, I have been able to continue civic service by volunteering with habitat for humanity and attending old vets funerals when they have nobody else. If your local post isn't perfect, none of us are so give them a break, join and make a difference.       I first learned about the Oath keepers because many of the porta-johns in Afghanistan have graffiti advertising their organization. On occasion I have seen their name pop up in Libertarian circles (Ron Paul rallys, Libertarian Republican caucus meetings, etc). Upon googling them, I understand their purpose and the gist of who they are, but I am curious if anyone can tell me more specific details. Are they a Libertarian organization? Are they Tea Party conspiros? What exactly do they do?    There are so many charities out there. Which nonprofit is the one closest to your heart, and why should others support it?   1. Scott Walker and Rand are two very different politicians. Walker is a traditional conservative. Paul is a Libertarian-Republican   2. The President does not have a ton of power. Presidents cannot totally change the nation on their own.   3. Paul would likely support marajuanna legalization, same sex marriage, a reduction in US military intervention, abolishment of the NSA spying program, and a reduction of Federal involvement in the markets       Thank you! Looks like a lot of great tips, I will check this out.      Hunting, camping, tinkering, grilling, whiskey and tobacco pipes   No, it does not   Yeah, I also cook in the kitchen. My ham biscuits are A+.    Cool, be yourself. You are entitled to your own opinions. If you want to disrespect folks who are different than you, I can't change you.   [This is likely a wonderful site for green blooded American men](http://www.irishamericannews.com)   Hey y'all, I am looking for new websites to browse. I am an avid reader of the *Art of Manliness* website, and was wondering if y'all knew of any similar sites. If you aren't into the whole traditional masculinity thing that's cool, but it is my lifestyle. Can anyone recommend some web destinations that I might enjoy? Topics I am looking for include; blue collar lifestyle, beer, grilling, tools, military, etc.    Former Marine Corps Commandant James "Mad Dog" Mattis.   Because he is a proven leader with balls, professionalism, and not giving a fuck.   [This cover](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v-x88h7xAv8) of *I Wanna Be A Billionaire* by The Cleverlys, a comedy bluegrass act.    Or if you are looking for serious; [this cover of Seven Nation Army](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K3bEV7SaatQ) by an absolutely adorable foreign girl.   I am leaving for 91A reclassification school in November.   Will I clear my current duty station before AIT or will I come back and clear upon graduation?   Will I get BAH for my current duty station (Drum) or for my AIT (Benning)?   Will I keep my Corporal rank in AIT?    Yeah, I don't know why more military folks don't want them. Portable, cheap, and sustainable   Sustainability  is not a fad, it is a necessity.    Made a bourbon and brown sugar marinated flank steak on the grill, a six pack of Miller High Life, and a full garage of loved ones.   Credit card debt, my TSP, a down payment on a new Toyota, and the rest is sitting in my tinyhome fund.   I have found they are very useful for getting close kills in COD.   Blunt talk;    There is a middle ground. Women do not want a controlling jerk, but they don't want a pushover pussy either. Make decisions. If you are going to take her out somewhere, think ahead and choose something, make a tentative plan. Don't just make decisions to make decisions, but use what you know she likes, and other info to make an informed decision. At the same time, you need to listen to her opinions, take them to heart, and add those to your internal database for future decisions. She does not want to be shut out of the decision making process, she just wants you to take initiative and action.   Show his heart to someone.    I am a tattooed, gun toting, red meat grilling, wrench turning American Veteran. The moments I feel most proud of as a man are the ones in which I opened my heart to another and allowed her to see me for who I am.      No. I'm not a butthurt baby. If stuffed animals help her sleep, awesome. If she got one as a gift from an ex, good, at least he was not totally useless.    No, I do not have a stuffed animal, but I do have a 105 lb bloodhound with flappy lips who sometimes sleeps in the bed, which is just about the same thing.   Volunteer. Get involved with your local habitat for humanity, food pantry, boy scouts or something. The types of people who volunteer have a real sense of community, and generally have other enriching qualities.   I am an active member of my VFW, and I have made so many great connections through volunteer work, it really works.   A pail of oysters, collard greens with a ham neck, cathead biscuits, and a big jug of sweet tea.   Jefferson thought that the American Revolution was a spark that would ignite liberty around the world. He advocated a worldwide awakening to "the spirit of `76". This belief coupled with his natural francophilia explain his ardent (sometimes radical) support for the French Revolution even after it turned chaotic. Other founders were not so enthusiastic. France went a different direction than the US, excluding moderate voices like Lafayette in favor of truly radical revolutionaries.   All in all, I think the colonies proved that liberty could win, and that big empires could be defeated and in so doing acted as a touchstone for the French (who consequently used much of Jefferson's advice in their early Assembly of Notables) but ultimately each event had their own causes and sparking moments.   Buy some cigars, grill some good cuts of red meat, and buy a nice bottle of whiskey. Everything else will fall into place naturally.    I would not take any government welfare under any circumstance. I believe in earning my wages.    My date is November as well, we might be together.   Do you have any clue what AIT will be like as an MOS-T?    How often do Tank maintainers go to the field?    Speaking from an OPC perspective.    We are staunch Calvinists and infant baptizers, we worship according to the Regulative Principle.   The Westminter Shorter Catechism is probably the best TLDR.   Sweet, I am a Cpl. hoping points drop so I can pick up my 5 before I go.   I will not be at Fort Lee, 91A AIT is at Benning.   Lamb. Absolutely delicious      Hey y'all, I just locked away a school seat to reclass to 91A (Abrams maintainer). Can anyone give me more info?? What would AIT be like for a MOS-T? What about garrison and deployment life?   Recording lunar cycles seems to have a long connection to gardening, they are still included in many farmer's almanacs and gardening books.   What effect does the moon/lunar cycles have on gardening?   I have not overwatered, they have been in good sunlight. I thought maybe nitrogen deficiency?    I have  red sail and romaine varieties, all are looking droopy and flat.   The Bhagavad Gita, directed by the prophet Muhammad.   My bachelor party. First we went to a local tobacconist and had superb cigars and scotch. Then we headed to the party location (a cabin my buddy owns on the Gulf Coast) where we grilled Angus burgers and fresh caught crab.   T'was a wild night.   An old man who wears fine  cardigans and smells of pipe tobacco and wood.   Manure, horse or cow manure.    I used a bagged humus/manure fertilizer in conjuction with MiracleGro topsoil on my vegetable garden. The smell is potent/ and my garden is near a high traffic walkway. Will the smell go away? If so, how long?   Blue collar= traditional values, physical dexterity, simple living, kinda rowdy, set in his ways, strong work ethic, bluntness and honesty.   White collar= more progressive, vague skills oftentimes, more selfcentered, higher standard of living with regards to physical things..    I am totally blue collar, and always will be. Veteran, gearhead, beer drinker, and fairly conservative.   What qualities do you associate with blue collar men and white collar men?    Which do you associate with more?   Drink beers, eat chicken and ribs, listen to country music, and hang out with the othr regulars.   Is there anywhere I can find an easy one stop place for truck news, custom trucks, etc?   That is what I fell for. I am trying to reclass into the Combat Engineer field or something in the 13 series   What do you prefer about combat arms  over support?   Where do y'all go to get your NASCAR fix for articles, opinion,  and analysis?   I plan on throwing a couple racks of pork ribs on the grill next week for a get together. I do not know where to start.   I know I want to use a dry rub, because I am not a big fan of sauce. I have a basic weber charcoal grill.   Help me out? Recipes, tips?   Every unit I have been in had fine, positive medics, who visited us when we were knee deep in shit. They rucked with us, convoyed with us,dug fighting positions with us,and talked like us. Many of them also inentionally reached out to soldiers in a positive way.   I always felt most Chaplains were pretty removed from the line..    Maybe I am just drunk.   I would not ever get a piercing because I think they are lame. The circles I run in don't contain men with piercings.   That being said, I don't really give a fuck about what another man does with his body   Inside a clamshell that got hit with a White Phosphorus mortar in Afghanistan.   How were you treated? What did your recieving unit think of you? What was OSUT/AIT like?   What are the pros and cons?   Yes.   Because you should not take drugs from strangers.   You are not skipping specialist. On paper they will likely show that they promoted you to SPC then laterally to Cpl.    You will be treated like a bitch. NCOs won't aaknowledge you as an NCO untl they have a bitch ass detail that requires an NCO. SPC will tell you to fuck off if you try to pull rank on them. Cpl's get all the responsibility, none of the pay, and very little of the authority of a sgt.    Sometimes being a cpl makes your PSG want to send you to the board. More often, they realize they dont need to hurry and send you to the board.   The government stole the moneu from its citizens through threat of coercive force, and then gave it to Tesla.    If I stole 100 dollars from you by threatening to throw you in a cage if you did not give it to me, then took that hundred dollars and loaned it to a poor inventor who later paid it back to me, is it moral?   No way, I am from Baldwin County Alabama, been to Enterprise several times.   Dothan's peanut festival is a lot of fun.   Because of George Washington Carver.   Seriously, the South was saved by the peanut, and it has become a very common part of our culture.    Yeah, same here. Had a briefing from our BC, stupid stuff.   girls; white tank tops and nice fitting jeans...   5 days a week.  Mon; Run between 4 and 6 miles  Tues, Core/muscle failure  Wed - Sprints/31 61's  Thurs- core/muscle failure  Fri- Alternate between another 4-6 mile run and a 6-8 mile ruck march   No, I carried it on deployment. I just had a phenomenal armorer who replaced everything in a timely manner and ensured services were done on time.   I would join whatever resistance movement springs up. I am a combat veteran (so the thought of combat does not scare me silly) with several capable weapons. I come from a small town in Alabama where everyone has loads of weapons and knows how to use them.    Pretty sure my hometown is the last place you wanna attack.   Hmmm, mine have always worked like a charm. Maybe I have just been lucky.   Yeah, I never said there wasn't anything bigger. I love the 240b, but have not had the opportunity to carry ine.   I have heard a lot of different opinions. Personally I love her. She is heavy, but pulls her weight when it counts. Magazine fed just does not do it for me.    Lets hear your SAW stories, tell me about your time with the girl?   Licked a girl's butthole.    Eat a girls ass and she will love you forever.   Hey y'all, I am consodering transitioning into trucking once I get out of the Army. I have my CDL, and 8 years of experience in the Army logistics world. Would that be enough?   What do I need to know? Is trucking profitable these days, can I make a decent living at it? I pretty much have an open map, I can move anywhere.    Any advice?   You would be surprised. They like to attack at meal times.    Get ammo.   Because politicians tell us to. If folks want us home they should elect someone whose foreign policy isn't hawkish.       The worst is the kids wearing hollister jeans ans tony lamas thinking they are country... Don't know the difference between a steer and their own nutsack.   Fake country folks are popping up everywhere... Boots, flannel, big belt buckles. It is starting to be "cool" to be a redneck again..   As an actual trailer trash country boy it annoys the shit outta me. Be who you are and dont try to fit into some scene.   No. We acknowledge out marriage anniversary          Your so called "blood moons" are a totally natural occurrence. [Here is a helpful infographic](http://www.space.com/images/i/000/038/377/i02/lunar-eclipse-tetrad-140408b-02.jpg?1397077348).    There is no apocalypse, religious or otherwise. I am surprised how many so called "apocalypses" I have lived through in my short life (except I am not).   Chill. Politicians are retarded. That has been a constant throughout history. So are blood moons.   Yeah, its pretty bad   Crawfish Etouffee   45 days. I was in the field in the Army.    Because that has worked well in the past? Tyranny does not beget liberty.   Nevermore   Reminding myself nobody owes me shit. The government does not owe me shit, the world does not owe me shit, and nobody else owes me shit. I have to earn it all myself.   Patch on the left is the [US Army North/5th Army patch](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_North). The patch on the right is the patch of the [US Army Ninth Corps](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IX_Corps_%28United_States%29)  The rank is 1st Lieutenant.     I cannot see clearly his branch insignia, is it two crossed cannons? That would be Artillery. Or crossed rifles? That would be infantry.   I cannot see his medals clearly enough to make them out.      General James Mattis  Theodore Roosevelt  Ernest Hemingway  General Hal Moore  Norman Keith Collins (aka Sailor Jerry)   Smallpox shot.   And moonshine/homemade wine where I am from.   I have the same experience! Trailer park block parties are the best!    I am from a trailer park in South Alabama. I love the close knit community of my trailer park. I love how nobody puts on airs, everyone is truly free to be themselves. Attractive folks (trailer park girls are **sexy**) to unattractive folks, everyone gets along just fine. We have mechanics, retirees, a hooker, and a charter fishermen (among other trades). We are diverse ethnically, we listen to different types of music, we have different religions but we all get along. In my trailer park everyone is poor, but not ashamed of our poverty. So we don't make much, we get by through brow sweat and elbow grease.     I think my trailer park is the paradise many folks are looking for, but they are too busy looking down their nose at us to see it.   What aspects of your trailer park do you love/hate? What stereotypes are false about trailer parks? Which are true?   Vets should be respectful and compassionate members of their community, not be the stereotypical hurt feelings, bent out of shape at the smallest provocation alpha male.   There is a big difference between the way older vets went back to their communities, and the way some of our generation's vets do.   I agree with calling them out, so does the article, but we have to call them out in a way that doesn't hinder civilian-veteran relationships. Let the civilians understand *why* this is wrong, don't just get belligerent and profane.   I agree with calling them out, so does the article, but we have to call them out in a way that doesn't hinder civilian-veteran relationships. Let the civilians understand *why* this is wrong, don't just get belligerent and profane.   Looks phenomenal!! I am jealous, currently on a field training exercise eating Army food.   Odd, looks like OP is pretending to be a bot his recent answers are random and bot like, but his early answers and questions are somewhat coherent.    I'll chalk it up as a troll fail.   I think it is totally appropriate to call out posers, watching friends die in the uniform they are disrespecting is a lifechanging experience. The point wasn't that we should not call them out, but that we should do it respectully, taking the high road.      That is a violation of reddiquite. Vote brigading   Yup, from South Alabama.   Reading, hunting, fishing, mudding, bonfires, etc.   No. No business should be forced to provide services to anyone. Each business's product/service belongs to them and is their property, they should be free to exchange their goods/services with anyone they wish, and to refuse to exchange their goods/services with whomever they wish.   It is not that hard. Also I would probably use my handgun.   Please add me   Michelle Rodriguez because she is the sexiest greasemonkey I have ever seen.   *through   Tampon on a female's wedding day while walking down the aisle.   That sounds like just what I am looking for! Tactical advice from basic training washout!  Thanks!   I shave every morning at 430. But as a military man I don't have a choice.   10/10 would respond the same way, except he would be deader than dead.   Can anyone recommend high quality/interesting military podcasts dealing with professional/noncom development, news, or other military topics?   Portal Gun, obviously   Yeah, I have known too many privates end up with a stripper or a hooters girl they have known for three days (no offense towards those fine professions)   I am a soldier. I am regularly away from home for weeks, months, even a year at a time and I cant spend my whole time away thinking about my wife. We love each other, but we also understand that when I am on the job I am on the job.    The first date flutters go away, it gets deeper, more meaningful. The test of deep and true love is the ability to focus on other things, not having to constantly obsess over your SO without losing power.     If your relationship is harming your worklife, it is unhealthy.    Please explain the button at /r/thebutton   Stars and Stripes is reporting the same thing [here](http://www.stripes.com/news/us/army-set-to-ease-tattoo-rules-1.337959). I consider them a little more reliable.    That being said, don't get any tats before you see it in Army doctrine.   Stranger danger; if they give you the gold they want one of your holes.  	135
