          And what caused your head to asplode as a result.                                                That is a legit adjective.                        I can't watch the video atm, but serious question, why is it a fiasco?                                       Hey all - just picked up the first DS after hearing lots of good things. I'm only an hour or so in, but I'm curious to know, when did this game click for you? Combat is slow and sticky at the moment, with frustratingly long character animations. Also, the lack of a proper pause button doesn't seem like something to make the game challenging, just alienating to anyone who has some notions of balancing this game with other activities in their life and home. Thoughts? When did you go "I get dis"?                                                                                                      As in, phones are so large now that that sound small?   instantrimshot.com  Very good, sir. Very good.   Definitely not just you, I've noticed it too, specifically in the last few days.   OP here, I have no idea how this happened either, but I made it to the second page of reddit.com with another post on r/gadgets earlier this week too. It's like the algorithm is heavily weighting posts from this sub-reddit atm, too much so. Which, weird.   Not usually, but it really varies by network. Three do unlimited 4G, and T-Mobile UK meanwhile (a subsidiary of EE) doesn't cap 3G at all. So I'd say this is a bad example, as it is very stingy I agree.   Really? I've always been the opposite. I love Android but much prefer using an iPad in portrait mode, because of 4:3. 16:9 screens are just too wide to be useful (save for video) and basically useless when not in landscape.   Interesting points, I didn't know that about the organisation limits. I think part of me thinks that because eSports teams aren't tied to locations that they need some form of shared history/heritage, something a team name provides. Just my two cents!   A financial necessity? Absolutely.   That being said I do think a lot of personality is lost with these sorts of team names. A sports equivalent: there is a football/soccer team in the UK called Total Network Solutions and it is a laughing stock for it. Branded names have no history, emotion or location to them, and I do think that's a shame, this Worlds matchup being an extreme example.  I'm not sure what the solution is, and there probably doesn't need to be one but I do wonder if it might not be a bit off-putting for newcomers.   Very excited to see how the pitched battles actually pan out. Hopefully they're chaotic!   Hey that does look good! Thanks, will give it a go.   FYI the original source is here http://www.redbull.com/en/games/stories/1331682984950/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-unity-preview-and-interview   I definitely think it was wise to hang tight. I had a 360 to test for a few weeks, and it just wasn't that useful - although I will say the voice recognition was very impressive.   Answering trivia questions people sent in by text message. Saturday afternoons when people just wanted to know the football scores were like money showers for 21 year old me.   Sorry guys! Was not in the story so that was unexpected.   Not me, but someone I know had a rabbit that needed an injection daily. Went away for a few days, and his mother did it in his place, except with a mixture of air and the wrong liquid in the syringe. Rabbit died horribly. :(   The LG G3 has I think been sorely overlooked by the press (but not you guys). The screen will cut you just by looking at it, it's that sharp.   That's a very good point. Makes you realise that it's not just a financial reason for the big OEMs resisting this for so long.   I agree they're not really competing products, but the significance is in HTC possibly accelerating their plans because of it.   Oh really? That's impressive. Thanks!   Yeah, I completely agree. It bugs me when a free to play game takes stuff out unless you pay, rather than adds stuff in. And even then, I'd still prefer just to pay upfront. But so it goes. Games like Monument Valley are the exception and not the rule now.   This guy. Thank you! I am definitely going to do this.   Thank you for these! I think I will definitely follow up on the chocolates.   London - for significant other (woman).   Thanks! I just had some of the popcorn. Cheese and caramel. I don't know what to think anymore!   I'm a bit miffed about this as a current 3DS owner, but also puzzled by this from a business perspective. Why does Nintendo want to quarter or half the large handheld audience it's built up which is its most profitable business right now? Because segmenting the 3DS with a blockbuster title like Xenoblade rather than some rubbish DSiWare would seem to be a good way of doing that.   Does Godwin's Law apply when discussing games featuring Hitler? Do agree though.   Apart from Portal and Portal 2 (since you can't really return to them until you forget how to complete the puzzles), I'd say Ni No Kuni. That game is mesmerisingly beautiful, but damn do you have to grind.   My own personal preference? The Ultra Nintendo Entertainment System. UNES has a good ring to it.   It's 29 that gets me. Such a bizarre bit of trivia, and now that I know about it, such a baffling thing for Nintendo to do.   Good point about how non-devs won't think of games in terms of what doesn't exist already. As a non-dev, I of course didn't think of this!  	104
 That was awesome! I'm really digging this subreddit!    Thanks for the post. I really enjoyed the song. Especially the whole "rain stick" sound in the background. One of those few bands that get to me on the first listen   I'm using reddit on my phone, sitting on my rolling chair. I clicked on the link and it was taking a while to load. I moved the phone closer to my face to see it better and it starts screaming at me! All this images start blaring at me! I pushed away from the image but forgot it was on my phone, which was still in my hand; I couldn't get away T_T I panicked and struggled to press the Home button.  It's been awhile since I've been scared shitless, I praise you for this terrifying find!   Hah hah! That blank stare with that smile gets me everytime!    I took a girl to the shooting range for a first date. It was for Valentines and my date really enjoyed doing something she's never done before. We had time to talk on the way to the shooting range but once there talking is minimal. I think the adrenaline from shooting a gun the first time really helps out during dates in general.    Very nice! I like the expressions on em! You should make more ^_^   Thank you, thank you. Currently using it as my phone wallpaper. Didju make this by any chance??  	7
                                     Just found this gem in the Christian Science Monitor's comments section, attributed to "Dan Henning":  "All the News media BLACKOUT with the Election FRAUD and Voter FRAUD on Dr. Paul is coming back to BITE EM HARD!

Also, check out this Ron Paul-bylined PDF: [Race Terrorism in America](http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/RTA.pdf)         Headline is satire, though probably not by much.      Whatever happened to Ross Perot?      2012: The Year of Linux on the Desktop.      "Eric Dondero, Paul's estranged former volunteer and personal aide, worked for Paul on and off between 1987 and 2004 (back when he was named "Eric Rittberg"), and since the Iraq war has become one of the congressman's most vociferous and notorious critics. By Dondero's account, Paul's inner circle learned between his congressional stints that *"the wilder they got, the more bombastic they got with it, the more the checks came in. You think the newsletters were bad? The fundraising letters were just insane from that period." [italics added.]*  Cato Institute President Ed Crane told reason he recalls a conversation from some time in the late 1980s in which Paul claimed that his best source of congressional campaign donations was the mailing list for The Spotlight, the conspiracy-mongering, anti-Semitic tabloid run by the Holocaust denier Willis Carto until it folded in 2001."  http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter            Mrs. Paul's.   Who paid the police overtime? Which public works guys cut down the trees? Who paid for the garbage trucks to crush and cart away tents, food, bicycles, and books to a public landfill?

Im on the side of sick and tired of paying for it.  Paul's popularity has risen since 2008 largely because of the Tea Party. He doesn't lead in polling in any state, but he is routinely in the top three in states like Iowa and New Hampshire.*  Discuss.   Just curious.      May you find peace and rest.   Americans for Prosperity, Walker's Wisconsin, etc.  Anyone monitoring the latest?         [700 water main breaks in Houston  a day](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44160515/ns/weather/#.Tkrn2GbfGdY)         1968: George Wallace and the "American Independent" party.  1980: Ronald Reagan convinces lower-middle class Americans that they will become millionaires if only they approve massive tax cuts for multimillionaires. The multimillionaires become billionaires; everyone else: the impoverished, the lower-middle class, and the middle class are forced to eat dirt, but persist in their belief Reagan is a American saint.   1992: Ross Perot, to be followed by his "U-nited We Stand, America" party.  1994: Newt Gingrich and the "Republican Revolution."  1998: Newt Gingrich and the Clinton Impeachment. While he presided over the impeachment trial of Clinton for getting blown by a young staffer, Gingrich was himself getting blown by a young staffers (while he was on his second wife. That young staffer's name? Callista; she is now his third wife, and evidently quite fond of shopping at Tiffany's.)  2000: Ralph Nader decides that if Ross Perot could pull 20% of the vote in 1992 and 14% in 1996 despite being a complete whackjob, *surely* he could pull 5% in every state. Nader aligns himself with the "Green Party" in hopes of winning Federal matching funds. He was very much mistaken. He doesn't break 1% in *any* state, but he takes 91,000 votes in Florida; this is enough to throw Florida to George W. Bush.  2001-2009: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. If you don't remember the hell they unleashed, go look it up.  2008: Sarah Palin.  2010: The "spontaneous, up-from-the-grassroots" Tea Party movement. Realizing that Ross Perot won the rageful, spiteful votes of a certain segment of the American population, a motley crew of Republican political advisors, Libertarian brothers (and multibillionaires from birth,) join forces with a right-wing media billionaire to re-run the Ross Perot campaign, minus Ross Perot.   2011: The "TeaPublicans" determine that they will "save America" by steering our ship of state directly off a cliff into a vast canyon. No sane American of any political stripe    We, as Americans, realize that our National Parks belong to all of us.  The same applies to the resources under our land and under our waters.  Why, then, do we lease out our lands and water to private, for-profit corporations who then extract America's natural resources, process them, and sell the products to right back to us, the ones that owned it in the first place? Every penny they've ever generated in profit comes from the resources they've extracted  Maybe it's time we spoke up for America and Americans, rather than worshipping at the altar of the Corporatists. They take our resources for *fractions* of pennies on the dollar, and sell it back to us at a truly astonishing markup.  It's one of the greatest scams ever, and it's gone on for nearly 125 years now. We give away *trillions* to them for next to nothing. If you want to get mad about something, get mad about this. Yet, there are those among us who would blame schoolteachers for our economic plight.  We don't owe any allegiance, nor profit, nor to these private, for-profit  interests. We pledge allegiance to the United States of America, not Exxon/Mobil, nor Shell, nor BP, nor Chevron, nor ARCO. Defend these private interests if you must, but don't delude yourselves that they can, have, or will *ever* show any allegiance to us in return for what we have so foolishly given away for so long.  Perhaps we should pledge our allegiance to ourselves, and our nation.      Followed a Rachel Maddow link to Palin's Facebook page.This was the most recent comment ("about an hour ago"):  [*name redacted out of a sense of shame for hapless Facebook poster*] "why do we have to suffer because of the debt why can't we cut the aid to other countries in half? that would save us enough money to pay off the debt and would not have to interfere with medicare, medicad nor with our social security, i'm just saying who is none of the people we vote for to protect us can't see this. i am just an american of every day person and I CAN SEE THIS but no we have to suffer cause our congressmen can't do this for the american people"  ...    . . . Richard Mellon Scaife (another multibillionaire by inheritance) who in the 1990s funded the Arkansas Project designed to destroy President Clinton?            Will they go after the 12 members of the Casey Anthony jury, too?      A nation eager for freedom and liberty awaits your response.      Punishing them makes us no wealthier.  We chronically undervalue our own financial worth anyway, and it doesn't look as if any of us will be getting a life-changing raise soon.  The solution isn't to tighten the thumbscrews on Congress; the solution is to value ourselves, and the work that each of us do for ourselves and  the nation.  One Congressman's salary sounds about equivalent to what it takes to provide a good, solid foundation, provide a reasonable existence, and a path to a comfortable retirement for a family of four. Let's use that as baseline, inclusive of health care benefits and vacation time.  Why? Because we're Americans, and we not only owe it to ourselves, we have quite literally *earned* it.   America, you've earned a reasonable existence, solid health care, a few weeks of vacation each year with the kids, and stable golden years. The question is, are we American enough to accept what we've already earned for ourselves?  Value your own worth, and that of all of your American neighbors. My life as an American is a bit worse today, because somewhere within our borders today, one of my fellow Americans died from cancer that would have been caught years ago, had it been diagnosed. One of my fellow Americans ended his life today because he can't find work and would rather die than ask for help.  We've earned it. Are we American enough to accept for ourselves and each of our fellow Americans that which we have already earned?  Let's make this Fourth of July one to remember.  If every American resolves to honor each and every one of his fellow Americans *as* an American, there is no peak we cannot surmount. It's all that's united us and saved us before, and no one's changed the prescription.  We WILL get through this, if we honor one another, and treat ourselves and one another as we ourselves would like to be treated. Our grandparents and great-grandparents proved our resilience, and we could do far worse than follow the example of those we rightfully call "the Greatest Generation."      They defrost and dump hundreds of embryos daily. Some go straight down the sink; others find their way into Biohazard bags to be burned.  Why all the fuss over Women's Health Clinics? Why hassle women trying to get pap smears? Why murder their doctors? Why not march with obnoxious signs on the in-vitro labs, where far more fetuses are obliterated daily?  An informational query.      Drug kingpins.  Think of it! Never a tax, never a regulation, never some meddlesome bureaucrat poking through your books, or hassling you over quality control. And forget about pesky firearms laws -- not only can you buy arms/weapons in any quantity you like, but you can raise a private army to use them for you against those you decree must die.   In the realm of *truly* free markets, drug lords are king. Who are we to penalize their success? They earned it.   B-I-N-G-O!   I mean, their devotion is admirable. It's like my own private C-SPAN!  I will admit, though, that a moment or two to myself would be nice once in a while. Perfect example: after a meet-and-greet with the Jaycees this morning, I was followed into the Denny's restroom by a group of men in T-shirts, stained jeans, and mounds and mounds of facial hair. They kept talking about how Linus (the blanket kid from Peanuts?) could help us line up an account with the FedEx, something something involving gold, something about Fiats also (crappy Italan cars?) They were nice enough, maybe a little awkward socially, but seemed to be decent young fellows and dedicated to the cause of liberty. I finally sent them on their way by autographing ten or so toilet seat covers.  Well, back to it. Who knew so many of my fans were proficient in Gregg shorthand?  P.S.: left tip in doubloons.            He's the right-wing billionaire-from-birth who spent tens of millions of dollars in his attempt to destroy Bill Clinton.  The only right-wing billionaires in the news these days are the multibillionaires Charles and David Koch, who just like Scaife rose to prominence with the money that their daddies left them.  What's Richard Mellon Scaife up to these days? And as long as we're talking about pouty, greedy billionaire-by-inheritance boys, how about Steve Forbes?    Count me among those who say Adobe Flash is "the past." Other, far superior alternatives to Adobe Flash exist.  I've often wondered why those who hate Apple/the Mac/iOS and snidely label Apple's ecosystem a "closed, proprietary system" refuse to evolve and embrace the open standards of HTML 5. Yet, they scream like little children who've had their Popsicles stolen when obsolete Adobe Flash and *its* closed, proprietary system, a fossilized artifact of Web 0.3b, acquired via Adobe's takeover of Macromedia back in the 90s, are ignored in favor of far superior alternatives.  I really don't understand this bizarre fixation on Flash. Continuing to support Flash with all of its well-known and well-documented instabilities and security risks makes about as much sense as demanding that all programs in 2011 be written in Basic.  Seriously, *what's with this Flash fixation?*  Is it some sort of offshoot of Stockholm Syndrome? Do people believe that when Flash dies, their free internet porn will go away? [It won't.] If they even remember RealMedia/RealPlayer, did today's Adobe Flash sycophants feel the same way when Real's third-rate shit software and delivery capabilities [*Buffering . . . . . . Buffering . . . . . .* ] died from both obsolescence and user frustration at Real's utter ineptitude? Will anyone besides basement-dwellers who make drag-and-drop porn banner ads with Flash actually miss it?  Can anyone explain this? *What's with this irrational love for Flash?* You might as well demand that Apple support Betamax.   This is why they'll never be "pro-life."  They are "pro-birth."  There's a world of difference.   The Republicans can't believe it either, but they're happy to cater to these loons as long as the money keeps rolling in, and their precincts get walked.  This whole thing is irrelevant, as due to the Hyde Amendment *not a penny of Federal money has gone to abortion services in decades.*  In private, when they're being honest, the Republicans have a greater and more snide contempt for anti-abortionists than does any liberal --but because of the political support the Repubs are happy to toss them a bone once in a while. Such is this "Planned Parenthood" red herring.       Why/why not?      Any guesses?   I don't mind paying to help Reddit out; but if they're going to charge for that which is otherwise free, they'd better be able to provide a stable and accessible site.  If they charge and can't deliver, they either need to charge more until they can afford to provide the service, or go all-free.

Do you guys realize that the Republicans/Koch Astroturfers are absolutely laughing their asses off at you behind your backs?  You guys think liberals think you're stupid? The Koch Republicans *know* you're stupid. What kind of fucking idiots (people who actually had their own taxes *cut* by Obama, though they believe the opposite is true) would actually go to their corporate-funded Uncle Sam cosplay rallies and scream about "socialist takeovers" because their multibillionaire masters will have to pay 2 cents more per dollar of income?  You think liberals mock you? Republicans *detest* you. They take great pleasure in grinding your faces into the shit and dirt, then tricking you into blaming the liberals for it.  Remember: the American Right uses you to do all their heavy lifting, which only serves their selfish interests while undermining yours. Do you believe they have any respect for those who would work like dogs against their own best interests?  It's a lot easier to print up ten million plastic American flags in China and pepper the crowd with a few puffy-shirted, tri-corner-hatted, out-of-work-actors shouting out Tea Party slogans mixed with misquoted Founders and "patriotize" you into doing their dirty work.  Remember, every time you see them talking about "taking America back" on TV or at a rally, ***they are all laughing their asses off at you*** the ***instant*** your backs are turned.*   Painful but accurate analogy for you: if your personal liquid assetts are *less* than $10,000,000 and you buy into the "Tea Party" narrative, you're no different or less foolish than a black American marching in support of the KKK.      If you thought the Republican Congress under George W. Bush was bad, wait until you see what these guys are brewing up.

The impression i've had is that iPhone/iPad software was the same OS, now iOS4, which is itself a subset of Mac OS X.  In fact, I remember earlier versions of the iPhone OS reported as being a lean but full Mac OS X install.  Does anyone know? And if it is the same OS, why couldn't we run iOS4 on iPads today?

Put a $10,000 fineper illegal, per dayon everyone who HIRES an illegal.  Whoops! Bet that won't go over too well with the Republicans who race-bait you with this issue, would it? Their buddies in agribusiness wouldn't be too happy about it, for one.   SOPick your own fucking vegetables, build your own fucking house, mow your own fucking lawn, make your own fucking food, bus your own fucking tables, wash your own fucking dishes, wash and iron your own fucking clothes, make up your own fucking motel rooms, and [scariest of all, I know,] WATCH YOUR OWN FUCKING CHILDREN.   My $10,000 per illegal, per day fine on *EMPLOYERS* ends illegal immigration TOMORROW, Republicans.   Bet your Party's big-ticket donations would dry up *very* quickly, eh? And you'd lose your favorite "DEY TURK YER JERBS!" argument.  Here in America we have a saying: Money talks, and bullshit walks. So, Republicans, are you going to go after the *real* reason illegal immigrants come here? They come because they're PAID to by your major donors, who must have their cheap labor.      For decades, conservatives have preached the benefits of personal responsibility and explained human success or failure via a theory of Social Darwinism. By this logic, the good and noble of society rise and prosper; those left behind in society have only themselves and their lack of dedication and virtue to blame.  Conservatives have long been very free with their criticisms of others; they'll sneer at the destitute or unemployed and say, "[Ross Perot/Ronald Reagan/Chuck Norris] made it in life; that shows it's possible.  Why can't you, *loser?!* HAHAHA!"  Obama's election means only to them that they have to eat their own words.  If a black guy from a very modest background can become President, it only underscores that they themselves *aren't* President, or anything even approaching the same level of importance or prestige.  Worse still, it proves to them they don't even possess the skills or abilities to achieve such heights. It shows them they were outdone by a better educated, more diligent, more dedicated guya better educated, more diligent, more dedicated *black* guy.   Since they are happy neither with themselves nor their station in life, Obama's achievements just serve to underscore their own personal failures. Subconsciously they apply their Social Darwinist thinking to Obama, then look at themselves; they *really* don't like the result of that matchup.  As President, Obama is on TV and in the news daily; they can't escape news, images, and discussions of him. Every one of Obama's successes only serves to underscore their own failures.  This is why they have to constantly tear him down.  It's their means of mental self-preservation.  Thus, they don't just hate Obama because he's black; they hate him because he's black and is "better'n [me.]"   Does anyone have any recommendations for a Bluetooth headset, or units to avoid?

 I hardly doubt Romanians or Bulgarians were holding off working in the UK cause of these restrictions. I believe those who wanted to leave did that already. British tabloids played a dirty role in making a fuss out of nothing.   Enlighten us brother.   The Guardian has a different take on the report than the BBC http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/05/eastern-european-migrants-report "Romanian and Bulgarian migrants 'unlikely to head for UK'  report"   I work for an IT infrastructure company.  Fortunately, I am not. It's a horrible thing that such a beautiful word is used by such a horrible tabloid. Someone should sue.   I love it all. The people, the language and the country. From The Netherlands. I live around 6 months a year down here. The rest is spent between Holland and the U.S.   Thanks for the clarification!

It's utterly ridiculous that in order to compete in the world of technology you have to be working with an army of lawyers.   Nope, but I do speak Romanian and have been living here for a while.  It's very unfortunate that such a terrible newspaper has such a name.   Oh absolutely, Islam forbids that. As far as I know, al-Qaeda is the only terror organization that does that. They learned it from the Tamil Tigers, that women suicide bombers are much less suspected of.   Terrorist have actually used this tactic before (and still do) http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/afghanistan/2011-06-28-Afghanistan-captured-leader-al-qaida_n.htm  There have been many suicide attacks in Iraq with foreign terrorist dressed as veiled women.   Some ultra conservatives don't think much of elections, unless of course they win.   A standard practice for desperate oppressive regimes.   This happens in many parts of the world.

It's amazing how news organizations can so easily parrot a fake story.   Damn sad story. A series of tragically bad decisions.    As if there needed to be another strong reason to quit.   Unfortunately, it was a decision based purely on reputation. It was a clear foul.   This might help answer that question: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/astrophysics/what-curiosity-will-and-wont-teach-us-about-martian-life  Over the years, planetary scientists have had to significantly revise their expectations for what they might find. In 1976, when the first successful Mars landersViking 1 and Viking 2reached the planets surface, many had high hopes that the spacecrafts instruments would be able to settle whether lifeeven simple microbial lifeexisted on the Red Planet. Each of the Viking landers carried a suite of instruments, including a combination gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer that was designed to detect organic compounds liberated from heated samples. But none of the Viking instruments found convincing evidence for the existence of life, or even its most basic ingredients.  About 30 years later, NASAs Phoenix Mars Lander made a discovery that may explain why the Viking spacecraft came up dry. In 2008, Phoenix found abundant amounts of the potent oxidizing agent perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate can destroy organic compounds released during sample heating, and it may also be able to destroy organic material in the upper layers of Martian soil, well before it is scooped into a spacecraft sample chamber. The surmise is that, if organic compounds exist on Mars, perchlorate may have prevented them from being picked up by Vikings instruments.  Curiosity could finally settle that question. The rovers Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument includes a mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph, just as the Viking spacecraft did. But each of these instruments now boasts much better capabilities. Working in concert, they will be able to detect trace amountsat the level of a few parts per billionof organic compounds released from the stepwise heating of samples retrieved from surface soils and cores of rocks. Although this level of sensitivity isnt too different from Vikings, Curiosity will be able to heat the samples up to greater than 1000 C, twice the peak temperature of the Viking instrument set. That will help liberate materials that might otherwise stay trapped and inert in a sample. Whats more, SAMs analysis protocol calls for adding substances that can reduce the temperatures at which organic compounds are released from samples. Perchlorate salts are thought to be released only at higher temperatures, and with this procedure, samples will be heated to only 350 C, which should reduce their tendency to decompose.    Present-day Republicans dont want to hear challenges to their preconceptions, and dont want anyone else to hear either. And if they do, well, it must be suppressed one way or the other.   "The real art is not in buying the Legos but in knowing how to put them together."  Exactly!   Many patents currently disputed were never even created by the parties involved to begin with.

People who seek out music illegally are exposed to a lot of music. They're also pretty obviously into music. They have enough passion for it that they go out and spend time seeking out new music.   Sony seems to live in this fantasy world where they think their products are better than the competition and that their brand name commands some premium over the rest of the market - which was the case years ago but not anymore. This is why companies like Samsung have pulled the rug out from under these guys in a market they used to dominate in the past (TVs, cameras etc.)   Religious lunatics/fanatics are mostly sad horrible creatures.

No one is better prepared to be President of the USA (and the world) than the Secretary of State. Would be a great POTUS.   I really doubt this and I hope its not true.

 The Runaways?      New X-Men, Astonishing X-Men and Ultimate X-Men are all great, self-contained stories that are easy to jump into. Ultimate X-Men isn't canon though.   So, the same thing they did with Cars 2 and Monsters University - didn't want to risk a new property, so they've reskinned it to fit an old one.   For example, I think Doctor Strangelove would be very interesting if remade in a post-9/11, Iraq War USA.   I hope he is carried over to the 616.   Pretentious is the wrong word. It's more like they have a set of prejudices. Proof: in their list of greatest films, number one was Borat and number four was Team America.    "Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of The Brady Bunch before offing their victim."   JRJR has a style, some people like it, some don't. I personally don't, but because itms so stylised, I don't think it's bad, just not my cup of tea. Like cubism or sculpting.   As a comic fan, it upsets me they must fall to the clich of fighting the first time they meet. Batman and Superman have one of the sweetest relationships in comics and I'd hate to see that bastardised so we can see Batman kick ass (again). I don't think I've ever read a fight where Supes wins.   Cage to Detroit, uh? Any paticular reason for that?   Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. I think it's just because I had a crush on the character since I was a kid and seeing he in live-action just did it for me.                                 Captain Marvel sure kicks ass, huh?                     ... But I say it was more of a 50:50 split.  * Stane was great - more-so as Stane than Iron Monger - even if he lacked proper motivation. Bridges makes him. 1/1 * Ross and Abomination weren't great. They both acted incredibly irrationally. 1/2 * Whiplash was underdeveloped, but Hammer was genuinely entertaining. 1.5/3 * Loki was a deep villain and as close to a Shakespearean character you're going to get in the MCU. 2.5/4 * Red Skull was pretty awesome, but I can't think of any defining character traits sans "is Nazi." 3/5 * Loki redux. 4/6 * I love Iron Man Three, but I still don't really understand what Killian wanted or why. 4/7 * Malekith was never expanded upon (which is a shame as I felt there was some good stuff there. 4/8 * Pierce, The Winter Soldier, Crossbones and Batroc were all used brilliantly and kept in line with the tone of the movie. Of course the villain was Hydra, rather than a single character, but that made the move stronger. 5/9 * Ronan was underdeveloped and - like Ecclestone as Malekith or Rourke as Whiplash - was a waste of a fine actor. 5/10  5/10 = 1/2 - I say it is 50:50  So there you have my highly subjective opinions on the villains in the Marvel movies. Of course y'all disagree, but I think this is highly representative of the common opinions this sub. I personally don't think any of these villains reach the level of the Joker or Doc Ock, but half of them have been fairly decent.  One thing I've noticed is, the problem has become so much worse with Phase 2.  So, thoughts?      Like when a character is transplanted into another genre - like the Hulk in Planet Hulk (Science-Fantasy/Swords-and-Sandals), Nova in Annihilation (Science-Fiction), Daredevil in The Man Without Fear (Crime). Would Fraction's Hawkeye or Azzarello's Wonder Woman count as examples?  Edit: Please list the character and genre you think it fits in.            Hypothetical: The big publishers have come together to discuss the state of the industry. They've decided they want comics to be more mainstream and more people to read them. They've hired you to do it. How do you?         I haven't read X-Factor or New Mutants yet and was planning to read them at another point in time, must I read those tie-ins for the whole story?            No more than ten members for each team.         I think it'd be interesting to see what the users of Reddit rate as their favourite films. Everybody could pick ten films and then we poll the results together and put them into an infographic. We could ask people to write a little bit about each film (must be optional) and use quotes from Reddit users to describe the film on the infographic. Would anyone think this is a good idea?   I want to read it, but I am unsure. I wasn't really a fan of his Ultimate Fantastic Four stuff.            I've been reading through Modern X-books starting with Grant Morrison's New X-Men and I'm unsure which Decimation tie-ins are worth reading. Anybody know?  [Apparently this is all of them.](http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/guide-part-5-decimation/)    I've been reading through Modern X-books starting with Grant Morrison's New X-Men and I'm unsure which Decimation tie-ins are worth reading. Anybody know?  [Apparently this is all of them.](http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/guide-part-5-decimation/)             I've read most of his work, but I'd like something similar to Daredevil and Wolverine written by someone else (ideally with equal art abilities). Something ninja-like.   ... Who would you like to be on the team? Who would you cast? Who would you like to write and direct? Which storylines would you want them to draw from?  Personally, I'd love Joss Whedon to write/direct it, but I think I'd think I'd prefer a serious movie written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Not sure how well Fincher could do action, but he could certainly create a great tone that stays true to the core themes of the X-Men, whilst putting his own dark spin on it. I think that Mark Millar's Ultimate X-Men run would be perfect. Tonally, it could easily mesh with Sorkin's dark and edgy writing style.  Alternatively, a visual director like Sam Mendes could really do spectacular things with the mutant powers and - unlike Fincher - we know he can direct action well.  My team would probably be Angel, Beast, Colossus, Cyclops, Dazzler, Iceman, Marvel Girl, Morph, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Rogue, Shadowcat, Storm, Thunderbird and Wolverine. Morph and Thunderbird only exist to be killed off quickly. No idea who I would cast as them.   Thor? Angela? The Winter Soldier? Superior Iron Man? All-New Captian America? Deathlok? Ant-Man? How are these and any others that I missed put on?   I'm thinking about rewatching Avatar again, but I've seen it a couple times already and I was wondering if there was another - prefably shorter way to watch it? Does someone either have an alternative watch list or like a list of about 30 episodes I must see trimming out some filler?      ... is that we're getting a Jessica Jones series. I'm currently reading Bendis' Daredevil (which everyone should read as it's one of the best things I've ever read) and it's clear the biggest street level heroes at Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Daredevil and Spidey.  www.imgur.com/NQaVCfih.jpg  If Marvel had the rights I'm certain Peter would have taken Jessica's place in the Defenders and she would've just been a side character. Now our beloved Jessica Jones is getting all of the attention she deserves. Moon Knight on the other hand...  www.imgur.com/k5WQDxs.jpg   I'm surprised when I hear that a book like The Walking Dead sells 70000 copies, but then the show can get about 17 million viewers. Why don't comics ever reach numbers in the millions? Especially with the success of the films, why are comics still considered a "nerdy" hobby rather than just another medium like a book or a film? Will a comic ever sell as many copies as X-Men #1 again? Why not? Do Warner Brothers and Disney need to make an advertising push for comics or is it not worth them bothering? Why are comics being used to advertise films rather than the other way around?   I just had a couple comic book questions that I felt like I needed to be answered. And I wondered if anyone else had any other questions that we could get answers for.  My first question is the title. My second is does anyone still write comics using the "Marvel method"?   They don't have to be traditional members of the league.  Mine would be:  * Nightwing * Shazam * Martian Manhunter * Green Lantern * Green Arrow * Animal Man * Swamp Thing            I was watching some of the DC animated movies and I was thinking, lots of people would love to see adaptions of their favourite arcs in the MCU, but it's unlikely. I thought a cool alternative would be to have canon straight-to-DVD or TV animated films that adapt arcs into that continuity.  If this happened, what arcs would people like?               Is he a serious hypocrite or is this just an oversize by the writers.   In the past two years Robin died, Nightwing faked his death and went undercover, Batgirl lost faith in Batman and moved away, Catwoman became mobster and Batman Incorporated was dissolved.  I guess this truly is the death if the family.               As she's a mutant does this mean Fox own the rights? Does that mean we'll never have a decent Squirrel Girl movie? Why wouldn't they through her into Infinity War? I'm sure she'd be very helpful up against Thanos.      And why?   I haven't played Minecraft since early August. The last big thing that happened was TE4 being released. What's new since then? Any notable new mods updates or packs? Any modders "quit"? RedPower 3 released? What has gone on?      Maybe it's a tad early to be predicting who's going to star in the Phase 4 movies, but who would you like to see starring in one of those upcoming movies?  I'd really like to see:  * Kamala Khan as Ms Marvel * The Runaways  Also are there any sequels or spin-offs people are disappointed weren't announced? I know many people were expecting another Hulk movie, but I really would've preferred a Hawkguy movie. Fraction and Aja's run has been so delightful that a film version would just be the icing on the cake.  As for TV series I'd love to see Punisher, Moon Knight and Ghost Rider.   Does Marvel Unlimited contain anything from the MAX and Icon imprints? I can't seem to find anything.   Now that it seems awfully likely that Sandman is getting a movie, who else from Vertigo would we like to see?  I'm expecting the typical, Hellblazer, Swamp-Thing and Zatanna lot, but who else? How would these movies be connected also? Would their be a shared universe for them or would they stand alone? Would we expect a Justice League Dark movie?  I know he's not a Vertigo character, but Jonah Hex sort-of matches the tone. I also feel he's due a decent movie.   L'Etranger, Your Eternal Reward and The Dead Ringer. You're welcome.      I've just finished reading it as someone recommended it as an introduction to the franchise, I have to say I really enjoyed it, but I can't imagine how it could fit in with what Stan Lee wrote. Could someone explain it to me?  Also, Uncanny X-Men: First Class - when should I read it? Where does it fit into Claremont's run?   I've just finished reading it as someone recommended it as an introduction to the franchise, I have to say I really enjoyed it, but I can't imagine how it could fit in with what Stan Lee wrote. Could someone explain it to me?  Also, Uncanny X-Men: First Class - when should I read it? Where does it fit into Claremont's run?   Are there any books that go well with Morrison's run? I was thinking Stephanie Brown's Batgirl series, Batman and Robin (volume 2) and Snyder's Detective Comics would compliment Morrison's run well. Is there anything else that I should read additionally?    Obviously the Arkham Franchise isn't canon in the comic continuity (pre/post-Nu52), but the games share a lot of similarities with B:TAS (especially the voice actors). Is there any truth in this?   I've never played Project M, but I'm curious, what are the differences that make Project M better than Brawl? I've kind of lived under the assumption that it makes the game more about technical skill making it less accessible for casual players, but much more competitive. Would this be about right?   Well, I haven't thought this out to much, but I'd love to hear what people think. Idea contributions are very much welcome.  Here we go:  - Based off either Attack/Defend or Control Points   - The twist is you can only play as a Spy  - The only items you have equipped are the L'Etranger, the Dead Ringer and Your Eternal Reward.  - Madness ensues.         Where in volume form is it all collected? The one on Amazon misses out the last four issues in Justice League and I'm not sure where they're printed. Are they in the Justice League volumes or what?         What would /r/ERB think of Spartacus vs Kunta Kinta?   I've been wanting to get into Marvel Comics for a while now and I hear Marvel has an online subscription service for comics.  I have two questions. Is it worthwhile? And is it available in the UK?   We've already had two Spider-Man origin movies. My fear would be that people wouldn't want to sit through another spider bite movie.  My proposal would be to skip a year into Peter's career as Spidey and have him already established as a hero. He could recall what happened to Uncle Ben and the bite briefly and then move staight into the web-slinging action.  Of course this is an idea if Disney had the rights. Thoughts?      I just finished reading Batman: Earth One. I thought it was a very enjoyable read, but I'll admit it had one very fatal flaw. It doesn't feel like a stand-alone novel. I feel it would have worked so much better as a long running series. Does anyone else share my views?   [Tis good.](/spoiler)   Is it plausible that Marvel Studios will make an original movie for a change? They seem to have been following pre-sold franchises (some that honestly don't fit into the rest of the MCU very well). Is there any chance that they could make a new movie about an original character?  Edit: What I'm really asking is, if they made one, could it possible be good?      Is anybody here capable of and willing to help me with MineTweaker? I wanted to create my own modpack and I collected permissions for all of the mods, but I realised that there was nothing that set this group of apart from a big, bloated pack like Monster. What I decided to do is use Minetweaker to edit the recipes of certain items to unify them (like Mekanism machines use TE Machine Frames).  Is anybody willing to help me with this?   When I load up, Minecraft with MineTweaker none of my additional recipes have changed. Does anyone know why this is?  MineTweaker files: http://pastebin.com/X62AsmBV http://pastebin.com/kVLNtBef  Modlist: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPqtKVHWiQEvW3DJKon2c3kFjybmiRSPZr7EZBXWhQY/edit?usp=sharing         I'd like to but a request through to take them to court. They broke the one rule. Drew tricked me into going into Yokay's base and using Yokay's MFFS to take my items. They gave it back afterwards and insisted they were joking, but Drew has a reputation so I find it difficult to accept that. Also they didn't apologize. Then they accused me of not being able to have fun. In what way could that be fun for me? Explain that?  Drew and I have had back and forth bickering for a while and we've both agreed we're feed up of it, so on multiple occasions we've agreed to make peace. Since then, Drew has slayed me with a sword, taunted me with false gifts and done this. I'm fed up with this. I admit I may have kept up the rally before, but never doing anything directly harmful. I have links to the only bad thing I've done to him in the past week.  http://gyazo.com/6915b9540d0ec31e2a27f9b772ecad1b http://gyazo.com/25b0f5b72a4885887b57a22a442e48c3  As you can see in that last picture Drew said some offensive things that greatly displeased me as a homosexual. It's already difficult being gay without having to put up with bullies like him.  If anybody wants to hear Drew's motives for breaking the one rule here they are: On his first day he came to mine and Syrenn's base. Does he not know not to come into the ginger bread house? We killed him and ate his flesh (Sai only was involved in the eating of flesh part). I personally think it's fair enough for him to get mad, but he repeatedly takes it too far. However after this he comes back at our request, we give him all of his stuff back, but then he stole a sword (a precious iron sword called Jeremy Irons). This angered us so we told him to get out and never come back, calling ourselves even as that blade had sentimental value. Then Drew continues with the teasing and the odd homophobic remark; which he could probably get away with if he was 11.  Please can we ensure neither of us conflict again. I'm fed up of constant conflict.  Edit: Recently Drew said this: http://gyazo.com/9924b77f0f2c02cda8b82a8a849e8ee7  Edit 2: Also take not I deleted some Mystcraft stuff of his.  Edit 3: I'm no longer mad at Drew for his homophobic remarks. Maybe I was being oversensitive and also Drew apologised. He insists he's not actually homophobic and I'm inclined to believe him.  Edit 4: I sarcastically said this, don't let Drew use this against me: http://gyazo.com/e3f450b2ab5708d5250e598b8382eafc  Edit 5: I redact all bad things I said about Yokay, he's cool.  Edit 6: Look at what Drew put at spawn: http://gyazo.com/db97115890e481d4635d75e6033d55d9   Is it possible to change this line in the Logistics Pipes configs to true?   # Enable Support for TE conduits to allow them to connect LP pipes.  # This feature MODIFIES TE.

 Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's kinda the fucking point.   Wait, why? Because other people are writing the material, or because no roast material will ever come close to what Kat had for Flava Flav?   Exactly what I thought. Running up to the big guy like "He's scared! He can't fuck with you, dude!" Probably going to be yammering away next to him for the rest of the day, pointing out other skinny kids: "You could take him, Mike! Is it cool that I call you Mike?"   Ugh. I mean, I get as much of a kick out of the fat acceptance movement as the next guy, but I sure as shit don't hate people for it. It's just flat out hilarious. "Look at me, I'm beautiful!" Ok sweetheart. Keep telling yourself that.    I had no idea we didn't like her. Quick, someone tell me why I should hate her too!   Rolling Stone doesn't shy away from stories easily. I'm very curious to know why they didn't publish this   Your definition of "high quality journalism" is a little different to mine   I literally have AIDS now. Fuck this sub   When did the Marine Corps get involved?   Whaaat? I thought this was fucking fantastic!   EVERY GODDAMN TIME.  "Honey. Honey. Go gown on me."  "Have you showered?"  "Yeah of course."  *sniffs*  "Nope."  Damn you, ball sweat.   Yeah. That's why I consider it a very poorly executed good idea.   It depends on what kind of writing you want to do, but for most creative stuff you'd want to **start simple**.   I started with American lit, Kerouac, Thompson, Twain etc. Their stories are accessible, entertaining, and well written. Diving straight into the REALLY good stuff, especially writers like Vonnegut, tends to discourage beginner writers because they are such masters of their craft they make it appear dead easy. So easy you think there's no way you could ever fucking come close it what they do. It's not easy. And if they had felt that way, they wouldn't be the writers they became. Writing is fucking masochistic when you get down to the nitty gritty, and the best writing will convey the exact opposite. I can't tell you the amount of times I've put down a book after reading a sentence and thought: "Well fuckit. Guess I'll be a teacher now."  After that, I'd say stick with writers that are generally praised for good writing. For masterclasses in novel writing, my top recommendations are Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, Lolita/Pnin/Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, anything Dahl (seriously), Hero of a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell, Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut, and probably many more that I can't remember right now.  OH.  And A Farewell To Arms. Hemmingway. I have a first edition and it's far and away my favourite book.   This is great advice. Also, never ask a writer to edit. I was constantly asked to help with people's papers in college. The guys never took my suggestions seriously because it assaulted their pride, the girls just fucking cried.    In novel writing this would apply. Depends on whether you want to go down in history or make a buck. As a reporter, you're doing it for the history. You are providing your society with a fair and accurate account of events (ideally). You have no place in deciding what the people want. I've published a few big stories in my time and they've resulted in fundamental, tangible change for the better. But you can bet your ass I was dragged through the coals for it.    Definitely. I was a hockey goalie for a season. Lots of contact. LOTS of hate. Few things as satisfying as a sneaky slash to the back of a guy's calf as he's screening you.   I've found that this ESPECIALLY applies to writing on a deadline. In fact, writing on a deadline is where I learned this the most. "Don't be afraid to write a shitty lede." Chances are if you're writing on a deadline that requires such precision, you're already a good writer. So "shit" is relative. If I have to have 1800 words in quick, I disregard all thoughts of structure or my lede, parcel the story out, then arrange it in an informative and, hopefully, captivating structure. Then go through and tweak each paragraph so it has a smooth, logical flow.    That never worked for me. Personally I prefer to write sober, edit stoned.   Yes x1000000. He puts it way better than I do. I wrote a screenplay called "101 Banditos" in my teens. I shudder thinking about it. It was.... I can't. It was bad. Really bad. BUT. It was about a former slave turned bounty hunter in the wild west... Now I look at it as one of the best ideas I've ever had, just a very poorly executed one.   Hire an editor or bed a comp lit major.   Ehhhhh. I dunno. There's A LOT of shit out there you could do with avoiding. My mother comes to mind.   Me: "Mom, have you read 50 Shades of Grey?"  Mom: "I don't have enough time to read crap, let alone 50 shades of it."    I always loved it when a team had a good striker that I knew I had to be on point for. I suppose being made to score good goals is just as challenging and rewarding as being made to make good saves.   Me too......... How bout them Yankees?   I outline HEAVILY to avoid exactly this. I also smoke. And outlining and smoking go well together.   Nabokov's wife fished Lolita out of the trash. [I always defer to Ira when I hear this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY)    You'd have to be a fucking moron to send something that reads like it's been written by one. The point is that you go back and make it better, ace.   Precisely! When I was in advertising, my boss wouldn't allow us to present an ad unless we had literally sketched out a thousand ads before it. He'd plop a fresh stack of printer paper in front of you and tell you to have drawn an ad on every sheet by lunchtime. The point isn't to sit around and think carefully about each ad. You scribble an idea as quick as possible and move on. Once you're finished, sift through the paper, pick out the best, repeat.   You're right. I wish that wasn't the case though. I had to read a lot of academic literature as a newspaper reporter and quickly realised I had no objective way of judging what I was reading. It was just too bogged down in a jargon I was totally unfamiliar with, and I didn't have the time to become familiarised. I think that's the problem with science and media right now. Neither industry makes much of an effort to communicate with each other in a way everyone will understand. The stuff that IS well communicated is usually the stuff scientists complain about getting stupid amounts of coverage.    Fun fact. My friend banged him in Vegas.    Pretty soon, you and your audience will like what you've written, as long as you have good taste.  FTFY  Pro writing tip #2: Read good shit.   I mean dont be afraid to write poorly. Don't worry about spelling mistakes (god knows F Scott Fitzgerald didn't. His editor was a goddamn saint for transcribing his scribble into books), finnicky grammar, poor sentence structure, insufficient conveyance of an idea. If it's slowing your progress, don't worry about it and move on. The most important aspect of writing is writing. Anything that stops that pursuit should be scythed off like a wart.   I've written professionally in television, newspapers, magazines, PR, and advertising for more than a decade. My number one piece of advice to writers (and this applies to all forms of writing, whether it's a cover letter on your CV, a college essay, or a novel) is don't be afraid to write like shit.   Worrying over whether it's "good" or not is an exercise you save until you're done. Write an awful sentence. Shit, write an awful chapter. Mark it. Go back and change it later.   This has served me better than any other writing tip I've ever come across.  EDIT: Do not write drunk and edit sober. Hemingway didn't do that, and besides, he's fucking Hemingway.  EDIT 2: Do what you want. I'm not sure I like the front page. Tis a silly place.   EDIT 3: I'd love to respond to all the messages for advice and feed my ego, but the sausages popping in the kitchen are more appealing right now. Everyone asking for tips on how to get into writing, there's a reason that word is a gerund. Writing is something you do. Do it. If you don't know what to write, read. Simples. Stay gold, ponyboy.    All your mothers were seriously lax on manners. I'd get crucified for not greeting people properly.   Ah, so very true, but those were the greatest compliments! I'd get a half chub if a striker refused to shake my hand after the match.   As in players give keepers respect for good saves more than you might think.   Was a keeper through college. Nothing beats the satisfaction of this. Happened more than you'd expect.   I seem to remember hearing or reading somewhere that he had a writer for these kinds of speeches. Can any confirm or deny that?   That's exactly how the best interviewers do it. See: Robert Durst.    The all boy's middle school I went to would suggest otherwise. Nobody is stopping you and your buddies from gathering peacefully.    And now single! Hiyoooooooooo   Holy shit. Kenny vs Spenny.... now those are two names I've not heard in a long, long time.   Someone rang?   I had a one night stand the other night and once the willy came out the girl gives me this disappointed look and says: "I was told it was bigger."   Long story short, there's a rumour going around that I have a large penis. I don't. Really not sure how to feel about it.    Well shit, that's a lot better than I usually get. Once was told I'm like an autistic Brad Pitt...   On YouTube, if anyone find my news presenting skills funny enough. I'm going to be a news anchor! Look out, Robin Scherbatsky!   wow. you DO realize that hasn;t been taken away. like. at all. right?   This is one dedicated novelty account. Have all the upvotes.   [This.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jib)   I have to get it cut in a few month for my new job (I'm gonna be on the tv!) Really, really not looking forward to it :(   It is fabulous, at times. Other times it's fabulously annoying. Dont get me started about driving with the windows down.   I will be the bouffant whore Reddit craves. Not because I want to. Because I have to.   Of course. But again, meet anybody involved in feminism beyond online flame wars and they'll agree men need better treatment in family court. I'd refer to RBG again on this issue.  ...gender discrimination is bad for everyone. It also ends the stereotype of women as givers of child care and men as solely breadwinners. [We need to] tear down those barriers so a woman or a man could pursue whatever path in life they had the G-d given talent to pursue.  Also, it's "per se" not "say"   Also, a little teapot. Not that short. Kinda stout.    Fahd had just died and Abdullah was the regent.   I like the cut of your jib   Yissssssssssss. Fuck yeah TAL.   Seriously. Can we get a source on that?   Big props to the pastor.   I mean this in the kindest way possible, but please, try and reserve your opinions for when they are informed. I'm not from the US either, but I went to school there. One of my best friends is as gung-ho feminist as they come. She's a clinic defender, someone abortion clinics hire to help when people protest. What you see on the Internet is NOT feminists. They are people who talk about feminism. There's a big difference. Every gender studies, women studies major I've met has a firm understanding of the challenges men face and agree with me on all the standard MRA points. First wave feminism most certainly did not fix the outmoded gender stereotypes men face, just as it didn't do that for female gender stereotypes. I'd really encourage you to speak to real women who are actually on the ground doing feminist work rather than sitting on Tumblr complaining about cis male privilege.    Outmoded gender stereotypes? Have you ever met an actual feminist outside of Tumblr? RBG has done more for men in America than any other person.   My asshole dad refused to go to the doctor about his heart pains and died at 41 of a heart attack. Asshole.   What "right" has been taken away from you because of women? I'm genuinely curious. They are men's issues. They deserve to be discussed, absolutely, but the idea that women are leading the charge against us is retarded.   My boss would have thrown a book at me. Or whatever hard object is in his immediate vicinity.    Ugh. I wish I had an asshole dad. Well, any dad would be nice.   Only when my mother is pissing me off, for some reason. Usually though I just take it out on some fish or lobster.   It's really discouraging to see so many male-oriented subs go the way of women bashing. Even Men's Rights. I subbed because I thought we were going to discuss issues that effect men. Nope. It's a giant bitch fest about the women they all can't get. Even RP had an initial edginess to it, like you're approaching life as a predator. Nope. Bitch fest.  Can there be a sub for guys who like talking about guy things and have no problem with the women in their lives? Because right now I really don't think that exists.   I mean, that's pretty much how I react to stubbing my pinky toe. So I think mildly perturbed does it justice.   Hey. Let's not go allocating blame here. I think everyone is sorry, right? Right?    Anger and hatred? I'm mildly perturbed. That's all.   I... I'm sorry. I got a little heated. You said some things. I said some things. Let's put it behind us.   Your personal experience does not equal prejudice or racism. Prejudice is literally a preconceived notion based on ignorance.    EDIT: I have anger management issues.   What? C'mon now this is nonsense. I like the spirit of this sub. This is more RP crap.    Yep. Got detention as a kid for using it in that context. Didn't know it had an alternate meaning, so naturally the teacher wasn't too please I called him queer.   There's something oddly... non sexual about your pose. I have the most confused non boner. Awesome either way. 10/10.   Shut up, Scott.   I respectfully disagree.   Ah. So, like DBZ GT?   Yes, yes it is. Well done. And this is all from his wife, who has relayed it back to her uncle (my step dad)   Oh... Well I feel dumb. I thought the Star Wars stories went on, and these are just putting them into film form.   If I got the chance. They were supposed to come stay with us a few times now, but each time they cancelled because of filming etc.  From what I've heard, Adam starts out good, then turns bad, then becomes a Sith (I love Star Wars, just not that informed about it). Is that Kylo Ren's character arch?     Just sharing what I heard. It's the talk of the whole company, obviously.   :(   I'm very curious to know how OP here has a pristine single page with an internet warning from the 90's...   I'm not saying a lower rate is a magic wand. I'd imagine you could marry a number of policies with it to incentivise companies into coming back to America, though. It's a pretty big subject for us in Bermuda, being a tax haven, and everyone's asshole gets a bit tighter around election time and we wonder what it would take for us to no longer be an attractive jurisdiction. And frankly, I don't think it would take much. Companies are far from peachy here. The IB environment has only just gotten friendly again after the ousting of the Progressive Labour Party in 2012, so we're seeing an uptick in new company registrations, but honestly myself and others really don't think it would take a whole lot to sink our economy and start floating yours. Take that as you will, I suppose.   There's nothing illegal about re-domiciling. That's why it's called a loophole.    Just the opinion of a guy living in the country where all your businesses domicile to avoid taxes, but I happen to think lowering the corporate tax rate would be the best way to start reeling in that lost tax revenue. They talk about closing the tax loopholes every election cycle and never do. Seems to me a good way to keep American companies paying taxes in America is to give them less reasons to domicile overseas.   Colby 2012   Fucking prick.   Yes, well, coming from an island that is 21 square miles long and in the middle of the ocean, I was unaware of such things.   I prefer my women to be conscious when I disappoint them, thankyouverymuch   It was Halloween at Western University in London, Ontario, and my friends and I were hitting up an amazing burger join just outside of the bar we'd been drinking at.   I go for a piss after ordering my food and find an apparently very drunk girl lying on the bathroom floor. I sit her up and try to get her talking, but all she keeps saying is "I hardly had anything to drink." She's pretty much incapacitated.  So I help her to her feet and get her out of the bathroom and sit her down at a table, then return to my friends and ask them what I should do. The logical choice was to help her into a cab, so I helped her back up again, walked to the street corner with her, and flagged down a cab.  Cab comes, but the girl is too far gone to even remotely remember where she lives and the cabbie refuses to take her. She manages to communicate to me that her house is on the road we're standing on and that she can point it out, but the cab driver still refuses to take her alone.   A bit pissed, I get in the cab with her. She starts slurring about how she barely drank anything again, and then starts trying to kiss me, at which point it clicks that she's probably been drugged. I push her off me and she tells the cab driver to stop and that her house is right here. Cab pulls over, I go to pay him, and she bolts from the door and begins running down the sidewalk. "Ok awesome," I think. "I did my best." Nope. She stumbles and face-plants right into the concrete.  So I pick her ass up again, pretty frustrated with the whole situation at this point. She's bleeding from her forehead and yammering incoherently, but says her house is "right there." We get to the door and there's a party still going on inside. Her housemate answers the door, I tell him I "found her like this" and she fucking belts: "HE ROOFIED ME." Housemate clocks me in the nose before I can respond, sending me down the flight of stairs leading up to the door. Bang my head on the concrete. Housemate kicks me in the stomach, lays on a few more punches, and leaves me there.  Now drunk, concussed and bleeding from my nose, I make my way back to my res, find my resident advisor and go to the hospital.  I've never hated a slutty nurse so much in my goddamn life.  EDIT: Shout out to Western. You may remember me as the guy who ran around Saugeen with a boner, or that guy who unwittingly punched the stripper at the Beef Baron. Go Stangs.  EDIT 2: Ya'll motherfuckers need Jesus. Where I'm from, we help people in need of help. Yes it was dumb to get in the cab. GEE, THANKS. I know I fucked up. That's why you're reading this, turdblossom.   EDIT 3. Dear god... If you're a personal injury lawyer, I don't care. Go chase an ambulance.   Was the effect of 'yellow journalism' such that it truly convinced a nation -- that valued freedom above all else -- that they were justified in taking freedom away from others?         Court reporter here. Was speaking with a lawyer and he was telling me about the time he had to represent someone accused of having sex with a horse. "Did anyone ask why THAT horse, instead of any of the others?" I asked.  "Actually yes," replied the lawyer. "He wanted a stable relationship."            Had an argument with my boss one morning. Was working in broadcast journalism and had set up a series of interviews with politicians to respond to a major story that broke over night. Except that those interviews I set up were being handed to someone else and instead she told me I had to go and talk to orphans and ask them how the economy was effecting them. I laughed, and said "No, Gary can do the orphan story, I'll do MY story, thankyouverymuch." At which point she launched into a tirade, belittling me and basically speaking to me like she was my mother. This has happened a bunch of times. I hung up and texted her. "Please don't speak to me like that again or I will have to quit." I got an immediate response: "Your fired." I was gutted. But as I looked at my phone again, a wry smile creeped across my face and my thumbs went into action....  *you'RE  We haven't spoken since.  **EDIT:** I suppose I should add that I was at my wick's end (EDIT EDIT: FINE. "WITS' END" YOU GLORIOUS PEDANTS) with the company and her as my editor. She was extremely unprofessional. What made this argument special was that she constantly told me I was not delivering enough stories of my own, that she was setting up too many interview for me. Naturally once I start doing this, she hands the best interviews of the day, set up by yours truly, to the chief reporter-- who has stopped talking to me after she handed one of HIS interviews to ME-- and sends me to do some filler about the economy. She was eventually fired and I have since been offered my job back. Twice.               Frankly I think us men should no longer hide our erections in public. For too long now our erections have been oppressed by belt buckles and between our thighs, hurriedly tucked away lest anyone sees. Man will not truly be free until he can be proud of his erection, not ashamed and embarrassed! We get them all the time, for many reasons besides arousal. If a 'liberated' woman can walk around with hard nipples reading 50 Shades of Shit, why can't I walk around with a hard penis? I envision a new era, where penises are not judged by size or breadth or stamina, but valued as utilitarian assets-- a world where, when I get a boner on the train, I can stand with my erection proudly as a free man...  	105
 There are people without homes, meals, health care, clean water. I'm all for helping animals, too, but the resources and expense of giving a fish a fake eye? Lord.    He could be a good veep choice. I just can't see Bush, Romney, and Christie all running, though. Maybe two, but not three. Bush is going to suck the fundraising away from those other two. And this may keep others, like Scott Walker, out of it, though they could bootstrap for awhile.    The Bush-style country club Republican has been on the run these past few years. By the looks of the people Jeb is hiring, he'd bring them back. Whatever innovative mindset he's claimed on education, immigration, etc., the Karl Rove sect is firmly in control of this campaign.    If there were ever an athlete who should keep quiet and let his actions speak for him, CS is the one. Instead, he makes things worse whenever he opens his mouth.    Because s/he's a Dodger fan. Why would he want SF to win another? :)   BitUSD and the other BitShares assets combine crypto with market-pegged stability. NuBots is another one worth considering.    Bytemaster's blog on this should be required reading. Very informative.    You know, he could be a good pickup for the Giants. A little more insurance for that starting rotation. Can Bills play LF?   Terrific. All college could be free with some strings attached. I look forward to seeing the proposal.    Wow! Gorgeous image.    These lists are tough, since we all have our own opinions and few of us every had a chance to watch the historical greats from different eras, such as Babe Ruth. Those are all HOF-caliber players, for sure, and it's a solid list. Interesting that they only chose 23 pitchers (that's my rough count)--far more position players. Rickey Henderson would make my Top 10. Best player I ever saw.    He must be a certified Nejcbeard. Hopefully, they get things worked out.    Good for them. This may create a mess initially, but it is in everyone's long term best interest for create a more decentralized grid.    Just ask Stephen Drew.    I read the article. Her actual promise was to dismantle it 'from the inside out'. I thought the title was a little inaccurate, but only indirectly so.    The Economist gets it. That's a good news source. Too bad they have a paywall. If we find the full article, let's post it here.    These look great. They need to go back to brown. So many teams gave up on their traditional colors and went with some version of blue in previous years.    As I understand BitShares, it is more practical than conceptual.    Fair point. The swing states were harder to predict.   I just thought it was a good place to drop that metaphor, whether you interpret it literally or sarcastically. :)    Bugs are meat. But I'd rather eat beans!   I'm open to this, but also consider use of resources: making the pots, bringing in water, soil or medium, fertilizer, and light. It has to be efficient.    If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.   That's interesting and I like it. But in tracking only one election (if I understand correctly), that vastly discounts the fact that one of the candidates could have been a better public speaker, more charismatic, or with speeches written to hit certain popular lines. And meanwhile, the opposing candidate might be better at raising money and running TV ads, so could in the end be just as competitive. With only one campaign, there was a 50% chance of this outcome, which makes for a questionable correlation.    I think there's a subset of white Democrats in Appalachia and the south who might be attracted to a guy like this. But yes, if they're less tolerant of those elements in the first place, then they're probably not Democrats anymore.  What I don't quite get is that Webb didn't want to stay in the Senate, he didn't want to be governor, and he withdrew himself from veep consideration. But he wants to be president?     I really like the fact that Warren is proactive with these things, whether or not one always agrees with her.    I have a lot of respect for what Roger Ver did, based on his principles. But crying about not being able to get back in? If I were the U.S. government, why exactly would I give a crud? You basically said you didn't need the U.S., and now suddenly you do?   Does not inspire confidence in centralized exchanges. "Ground up" will take time. By then, the market will have moved on.    Cool. With a name like Cliff Mass, I'd say your expert was destined for a career in earth sciences.    This is a very thoughtful and well-researched piece.       They said it would have more value if broken up.    Sorry for your loss and hope you get it back. We definitely need to start thinking of technologies that bypass these online exchanges.    It's happened to all of us. "Your mess of crackers" -- "Your meth and crack whores"... See how bad it can be!       Nice job; it's not always easy with the clouds. I love the colors of those waters with the glacial moraine. Beautiful image.   I'll play!      Definitely destined for the AL if they can move him.       I think the Giants are taking a year off. Most likely to come out of the blue with last-minute money to sign a big (and probably over-priced) free agent:  Yankees, Angels, Tigers...any others? I might add White Sox and Dodgers, but both of them may be done for now and/or pretending to take a more budget-minded approach.    Should there be a period of time after which non-use invalidates the patent?  	42
 I think it is a hacked article.   This sounds like hacked article. Somebody went on the Reuters website and planted a hacked article.   I wonder if people are going to gold on the cheap.   Try Target, Walmart, your local Supermarket, Taco Bell, and those places.  Also this could be a resource http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/ret/ http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/fbh/   temecula might be a good idea.  You got the wine country as well plus there is gambling and shows at Pechanga.   average for a guy.   This guy goes on and on.  The diatribe becomes too repetitive and bore at times.  He lost my interest after about one minute.   What evidence does he have?  I doubt that he has any evidence.  The reality is that the money is coming from Saudi Arabia or Egypt.   What a sick prick!   good shit.   We do not need another cigarette taxes.  Cigarettes are taxed too high and people should have the legal right to smoke.   That sounds like invasion of privacy.   That is going too far.  I mean gun control should be on the table, but banning games is a violation of free speech.   The only problem with that theory is that the wealthy are not receiving additional benefits for money paid into the system.  Unlike the income taxes which were designed to be a progressive system, the social security tax is designed to be social insurance program which is based on how much a person's contributes to the program over a period of time and the benefit is proportional to the tax receipts that paid into the system.   Once the tax has no ceiling on income, it ceases to be a social insurance tax, but rather a form of restricted income tax on the wealthy disguised as a social insurance tax where the tax receipts are creates an encumbrance (restriction) on expenditures to be used to shore up security instead of being appropriated for use in the government general fund.   In conclusion, raising the ceiling is a form of restricted income tax on the wealthy and is not designed to social insurance for their income.      Obama has a "fear" of not looking being bi-partisan and just being bold liberal who fights for liberal causes.  He wants to be seen as  "post-partisan" and is afraid of being tagged as a liberal in his legacy.  Instead, he should embrace the liberal agenda and be like President Johnson who liberal agenda defines him to this day. While Johnson always have the Vietnam War that will tarnish his agenda, Obama should have realized that liberalism will have defined his legacy, and not trying to be post-partisan with this group of Republicans.   Administrators did not put enough effort into forecasting the effects of a bubble economy on the city finances.  If the city had made a proper forecast of the housing bubble, perhaps, the effects of the housing recession would not be in effect.   There should be a focus in the state legislature to force the communities colleges to identify and eliminate inefficient use of overhead and G A expenses.    Impressive Rack.   Makes me think twice about drinking and driving.   Why cannot we do this nation-wide?  They do this in many European countries.  How about granting a week off for all workers?   What a bunch of loons! Do they ever get it?   While Hugo Chavez criticisms of US imperial power and help towards the poor was considered to be hallmarks of his legacy, he also leaves behind a a cult of personality that is akin to Mao, Stalin, or Castro.  While Chavez was a far less brutal ruler than Mao or Stalin, he still used a  lot of the same tactics to stamp out the opposition.   This is the problem when you keep an artificial ceiling on interest rates for an extended period of time instead of letting the interest rates float.   That is a good idea for a single-payer system. Instead of Obama Care, we could have single-payer catastrophic health-care system and have private supplumental surance for the rest of the expenses.   You never hear about that idea from the left, but it might be the idea that hits the spot.    What is the point of the article?  It means that there is massive inequality in the nation and that people are forced to go on food stamps because there is not enough high-paying jobs.   If there was enough high-paying jobs, the need for food stamps would decrease significantly  The reality is that we need to increase wages to get people off entitlement programs and not cut entitlement programs just because people cannot afford food stamps because the jobs that are around are considered to be crap jobs out there.     It just goes to show how people will go to any lengths to have the bible justify their position, even though the bible has no prohibitions against interracial marriage (especially in the New Testament which has no prohibitions against interracial marriage)   I guess there will be massive exodus of people out of Phoenix one of these days, but I doubt we will see until maybe 2040.   Why is is this even a link?   Too bad. I was actually looking forward to Ashley Judd running.   An interesting idea, but I do think it would work.   The thing that I did not get is that Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee voted against it.  I think it shows that Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul wanted something more extreme thing that what Paul Ryan proposed.   Is anybody suprised here?  He is a neo-conservative that is sheep in clothings.  He is a just another neo-con DINO out there and we are glad to get rid of him.   That is a such petty law.  Good job by the Judge.     And you got to remember, the House of Representatives is supposed to be the people's house and that is not in the hands of the Dems.  In reality, the people's house belong to the Republican party, like or not and that is based on population.     Wow! Lack of bullets? Maybe cutting a few F-35 fighters from the marine's budgets should give them enough money.   The F-35 is nothing, but a giant fiasco (http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/14206240-the-f35-fighter-jet-program-a-world-class-fiasco)    Yet, an another Republican  know-nothing.   That is way too much money.   Thanks   Why does all of our politicans have to pander for AIPAC? It seems that nobody has courage to stand up to them and state that their policies contribute towards creating a hostile environment in the Middle East, and actually hinder the peace process and worsen the security environment for Isreal.   Isreal should gets it the across-board cut just like everybody else does.    Finally, some transparency on this issue, but it does not shed light on the operational procedures for drone killings.  Such operational procedures should be discussed in a secret briefing to Congress (for national security purposes), but our lawmakers should know the operational procedures for how a  targeting drone stike is conducted.     Thinking that voting is somehow a entitlement is an purely indirect method of hiding one's own view of racial superiority. It suggets that one has an inferior view of poor and uneducated black people having the right to vote.  Do we give white and poor voters and deny them the right to vote? The answer is no.    The South has infamous documented history of making voting access difficult to racial minorities and other lower-class people.  Therefore, letting the South monitior its own election is liking letting Wall Street police itself.  We know that self-regulation in the end does not exist in places where the environment itself encourages noncomplaince with federal constitutional law.  Therefore, we need to keep the voting protection acts as long as possible.    It is time that people learned to step up for themselves and say no to austerity economics.  Once the cuts get bad off, it is time to say "no" to austerity economics.   I think the main problem is that he used doomsday language to get the Republicans to sway to vote on more tax increases.  That is not simply possible.  You are going to have to elect more dems because you have to tell and demonstrate the these cuts are actually bad for the economy and you need more revenue to do it.  We actually need to experience a few months of the sequester to really to determine whether it is really harmful for the country.  If it is, than the Republicans lose the political battle and Obama will be proven right.  If not, the GOP will have some talking points for the 2014 campaign.   I think his poll numbers are dropping because people are beginning to see that the effects of the sequester will not be as bad as first reported.  People will see that the Republicans are right on spending cuts that the effects of the sequester are overstated (even I though I favor less spending cuts and higher taxes).  Remember, that 50% of the cuts are coming from defense which is something that we need to cut anyways and the GOP (except for some like Rand and Ron Paul) would refuse to cut it prior to the sequester   The house is pathetic piece of government. It does not know to how lead the government   Nice rack.   I would  recommend attending some Al-Anon meetings. They would provide some support and advice for you. Al-Anon is designed for people that have relationships with people in addiction    that was motherfucking funny   Well, I guess there are some horny 40 years old out there.   Time to for Sheriff Joe to resign.   So hot!   How cute!   I guess Germany is not going to have to be a tightwad.   They will get the gallows for that   Just shows how much Christans ignore their own scriptures when it comes to love and tolerance.   They know how to groove.   adorable!   That is an act of bravery.    What a moron.   Keep to a three to four a day.  Just do not drink a six pack and end up an alcoholic.   All I get is spam with this link.   So cute!   Should be posted under World News   There is no evidence that proves or disproves God existences.  Therefore, it is completly rational to believe in a god.  For example, the complete order and harmony of this universe points towards a creator of infinite intelligence.  However, we do not know its ways or neither we can comprehend it.  There are infinite amount of stars and possibliy a large amount of intelligent life out there that we cannot detect.  We do not know how God has dealt with them.  We are just finite beings with finite capacity to understand the infinite.   I belief strongly in Darwinan evolution, but I also believe that it is strongly possible for it to be power greater than ourselves to exist   I do not like it.   They know how to fight.   Hope you get clean and you get the help that you need to change your life.   3 years probabtion and 90 days in the county jail.   No, they are not responisble for the  person death.  The person is neligent for believing the claims of the faith healer and is responsible for their health.   Nice ass!   That is why UPS is far better than USPS.  The only good about the mail is that cheaper than UPS or FedEx.   Super PACS.  They do not help build movement conservatism or neither to help elect liberals to office.  They are poison to both parties and so should be banned.   Never heard of that before.  If it does exist, it is very obscure passage because I have never heard it any Christian or atheist circles.   Yeah! It was failed policy     I should have checked it.   Please do not post it.  I consider that to be an offensive remark and I am agnostic.  I have a lot of people that are Christians that have significantly helped me with my life and recovery.  Putting people down's faith is just no no to me because their faith in God has helped my life to be better.   Go put Rick Perry go without health insurance for 30 days and then let him to tell you how it much sucked not having insurance.  Seriously, you make blanket statements like that means that you have take action and do what is right.    With who? Nobody can run elections in politics until money is removed from politics which is replaced by a surtax on the income tax that specifies that .01-.05% of all taxable income be taxed to fund the Presidential and Congressional elections.  It is not a popular idea but it would generate the amount of revenues required to fund all Presidential and Congressional elections without resorting to big money campaign donations.   Pepper spray for nonviolent protestors?  I thought that was only reserved for prisoners in the supermax facility who would be a real threat to guards.  Pepper sprays work goods in prison because it prevents super-max guards for using brutal force, but on a person from Occupy is going too far and should be considered a criminal action and result in a trip to the county jail for the police officers who pepper sprayed the protesters.   Orange County Burners.  We are at http://groups.yahoo.com/ocburners.  It is an older group, but we are friendly to everybody.   Sorry Fox News  you are bunch of liars. (http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/04/07/4126070-context-lies-and-videotapes-the-real-acorn-story)    They should be monitoring pederasses, thieves, drug dealers who sell hard drugs, and robbers and not wasting taxpayer's resource on the Occupy movements.   That is the problem about putting links on the mobile phone sometimes.   It is NFSW by accident   They are supposed to run a public transportation system and not into become a fascist organization.  Unfortunely, I believe the culture at BART is systemic and this is why Oscar Grant is in a box because BART has not taken dramatic step to rid itself of this culture.  Until BART realizes it is primary purpose is public transit and not law enforcement, you will not see any change in the culture.   Maybe that reddit belongs to the cult of I-Phones.   The only that I have gone with using the internet in the last few years when I have been at vacation at Burning Man.  My life is so connected to Facebook, Yahoo Groups, and Meetup that I would have a hard time finding and connecting with people.  In addition, I use the internet to attend AA meetings online.   There is nothing  that you can do about her alcoholism.  She has to become honest and admit to herself that she is powerless over alcohol.  She has admit that her life is unmanagable and that she needs serious help like an inpatient rehab that deal especially dual diganosis cases. Or she can go to 90 AA meetings in 90 days and get a sponsor.   I wish that I could do that, but it made my life unmanageable and therefore, I have to a meeting a day for a long time.   I wish that I could use the OC bus system to save on my commute.  I would use if it took 90 minutes to get from Huntington Beach to Mission Viejo,  Sadly, it takes two and half-hours and that shows the sorry state that public transit is on the OC   I would personally just left the dope alone. I support Cannabis legalization even though I do not smoke and I am in recovery for alcohol abuse.   What a fiasco! I cannot believe Obama has sunk to this point!   I would use it to buy some hiking clothes, a backpack for backpacking,  I would also buy some topo maps for places for hike.   That is last area that we need to cut.  We need every dollar to spend on climate change and not cut the environmental bills   There are some services like garbage that should be outsourced like trash and IT support.  Private contractors do better at some things than public sector does.   And this is coimg from a progressive.   Now! That is a bachleor pad that I wanted to go into   Why is Obama on this issue?  He should be like Theodore Roosevelt and makes this merger DOA.  Nothing  All Obama has to state that he opposes the merger and that he instruct the FTC to block the merger.  The corporations will then back down and not merge.  Of course, Obama captiluates on everything and therefore, does not have capablity to stop large corporations because he fears them too much.   Than perhaps Ron Paul is right and we should eliminate the Fed.   Yeah, getting out of drug and alcohol addiction takes hell of lot of effort and humility.  I know! I have to recovery my addiction to alcohol and it takes a lot of effort and time.  A lot of time that could have gone into hobbies and watching TV shows on weekday nights are taken away.   Yet, it is doable.  I have got sober three times and it is struggle, but is is possible.   This  make me sick to my stomach      Just what I need!  Congress cannot make a payment on  the debt ceiling and I do not get paid my vacation pay while I was in rehab.   Do you live in the OC?   If weed does not make your life unmanageable and you are not addict, try to set your weed smoking to a set amount of times a day.  A good advice is to take a toke every five hours on the dot.  It would mean that you smoke three blunts a day and get about 15-17 hours of work done and the weed will help you relax better.   yeah she is hot!   put it in the gay section or on your local Craigslist MFW casual sex website if you are not gay.   What about the problem of teenage unemployment?   They are crazy.   Sounds like this guy is not rapist, but an alcoholic who needs serious help and needs to admit and accept that he cannot recover alcohol unless he admits total powerless over and that it makes him life unmanageable and he works a program.  As an alternative, he needs to learn to motivate him to abstain and deal with the underlying problems that cause his drugs.  There is multiple paths to soberity, but it depends on how much that he wants it and you do not need an expense rehab to solve it.   Trying to pay for it will not help.  You should seriously consider about seeing a dating coach instead of paying money for a hooker.  Or try to see threapist that is skilled in teaching relationship skills.  If you got the money to afford hookers, you got the money to afford professional help that help you to develop social and relationship skills that you lack.   Drinking alone was one of most loneliest and depressing things that I did.  I did it for two years and it did not solve my problems.  Maybe it works for you though.   Because people are too lazy to change their old, bad habits.   It is all about control and fear.       Me too   Meetup is good way to make friends.  If you are into Burning Man, there is a OC Burner group here locally that gets together. http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/ocburners   What happened to shareholders keeping the corporations accountable for operational performance?  Clearly, an incident like this should result in no bonus for failure to achieve concrete operational goals.      Even as a US liberal, the government should not the business of making vodka.  Vodka is a private good and therefore, the private sector should have control over the Vodka market.   She is a such a douchbag!   Nope   I do not create an identity on Facebook! It is real me!  I tell people on Facebook that I am recovered alcoholic, agnostic, progressive, Burner, autistic, political junkie, and Chargers Fan.    I do not pretend to be somebody that I am not. These people are lying to themselves because they live in fear of being themselves.   Great! A week of work and I get a claim of week of unemployment! Woo hoo!   Well, if they want to make peace with the stubborn Isrealis, than Hamas has to go.    Are they ever going to give up fighting the people of Gaza? Has enough blood been shed there.   The lesson is that you have to get that perfect buzz to make the best music.   Probably good old Southern Baptist   If you want to get rid of birthright citizenship, than the GOP also need includes a clause that include langauge that get rids of corporations as people.  Than you got your deal.   Your are glad that you never have to inside the Maricopa County Jail.   Just enjoy a quiet beer to yourself or you intend to get drunk?   I would lose in that game. I have zero hand-eye coordination and so that prevents me from getting addicted to video games.   Nope, there is the Log Cabin Republicans which are gay conservatives. Most of them favor free-market capitalism over the regulation of capital markets that Dems favor.   The Republicans better be careful because this stratergy could really backfire.    Obama will veto it.   What an arrogant SOB!    I still read old media, but I use my computer or phone to read it.    California cannot have a budget deficit and therefore, California is experiencing massive spending cuts. The federal government does not and therefore, not need to. Theortic ally,  it can run a deficit into eternity as long it pays the debt service cost.    Just use Google Docs and use the spreadsheet function  It has portable operability because it is web-based and you do not have to Microsoft Office license to operate it.   There is always Afghanistan.  It is supposed to have tons of lithium.   There is called one problem that we have in the United States that prevent us from doing that: a massive budget deficit.   Your are normal toker!  People that smoke a ton of bowls every day are addicts just like alcoholics.  Unless your smoke a ton of bowls every day, continue to smoke!  The people that smokes a ton of bowls every day need to quit because their are addicts and need to abstain from use of weed.   I am the same way.  I like being alone for extended times, but I like going to large-scale parties.  I find it easier to mingle with people at large parties than spend significant time with somebody with one on one.  That is odd for somebody who have high-functioning autism, but that is what my social skills training good for.   You have no friends?  I recommend go to Meetup.com and look for a Meetup that is centered around your interests.  OC has tons of meetups.     You might want to examine whether it was the result of your own making.   You might want to look into the flaws that causes the break-up of the relations.  If your self-examination discloses no findings or flaws, that she just had flaws that she needed to work and it was too difficult, given her flaws, to maintain a serious relationship with the member of the opposite sex.  You can only keep your side of street honest.  You cannot change people or control their actions.  Being rigiorously honest with oneself is the key thing to ensure honest relations with the other sex.   I got OCD and autism and I already addicted to Reddit.  The other webstie that I spend way too much on Google News.   35   My only criticism of the video is that they did not have some smoking hot babe as the police officer.  Than she spank you and call you a bad boy.   LOL   Yep, having a car is important.  More important is the ability to have a relationship and have excellent social skills.   What is the threat? Iran?   Now that is nation full of morons.   Join a credit union.  My credit union never charges me when I have enough funds.   I would rather have Bloomberg as President over any of the nitwit Republican any day of the week.  He might favor the plutocrats, but he does know have to govern and has good leadership skills.   No, that it is impossiblity.   The real lesson is how teach to people to have long-term soberity and quality soberity.  We do not want have the bad type of soberity like George Bush does.   Not all TV is bad.  There is the Science Channel, The History Channel, and other stuff.  Of course, Stewart and Cobert as well.    She needs a giant hug and be told that her is okay.  Living self-pity is solution that leads to addiction.  Learn gratitude!  The key to this problem is self-acceptance.  She needs to accept for the person that she is and that by working on herself, she can work on her character flaws.  She needs to learn that perfectionism is not the goal.  It is progress in our self-development and not perfection.     That was funny   This is an cause and the effect error.  Your reasoning suggests that people will do daring acts because the government will pick up the tab for the health care.  The reality is that this is a coincidence.  A lot of people do dangerous acts in the United States and take the risk even though they do not health insurance.   Yuck! That is gross   Yeah, I work for the man.  The military-industrial complex itself.   Most Americans will never watch it.   The reality is that most people are paying federal income taxes through payroll withholds on their payroll checks.  In most cases, there is was more money withheld on the payroll check than the actual tax liability.  This result is in a refund check and therefore, it appears that the person had paid no federal income tax, but in reality it is just a check for the excessive withholds on the payroll check.   Rush has not done a through 4th step in years.  Needs to write down that list of those people who he resents and the reasons for resenting those people.   This is all about net neturality issue.   On Healthcare = The Government is not going far enough on that issue.  There should be a robust public option competing aganist private insurance companies On Education =  Repeal No Child Left Behind and let local school boards control the curriculum   Glen Beck will like George Soros being gone.  Of course, Beck is using Soros as a scapegoat because he does not want really debate policy issues.   It is lack of people knowing the proper media resources. Most people are low-information voters and do not about the rich treasure trove of progressive media out there.  I consider myself to be a high-information voter and therefore, I know all of the major conservative and progressive blogs.   I do not think so.   I voted for it, even though it should have been part of a massive prison reform and controlled substance reform act.   Go to Google News and type site:ft.com and Gideon.  That is how you get access to the article   That was good video   That is funny   Hmmm.  You could a mobilizer site like Baresite to get around the filter.     It sounds like a good show.   I am at home watching the rally, but I have to clean out my car and take it to the car wash.   This is fucking sweet   I do not why the mass populace is voting for the Republican party.  I think that these people place too much reliance on talk radio, Drudge Report, and Fox News.  In my neck of the woods, I have Pacifica, KPCC,  and KTLK 1150 AM. I also read the OC Register which climate change denier paper, but my news analysis comes from Thom Hartmann and Pacifica and therefore, I will not vote for Republicans based on the information that was dissesmated.  People that listen to conservative get half-truths most of the time.  At times, Beck and his ilk are partially right, but they distort the rest of the story which creates a half-truth.  Our voters rely on half-truth equate it with truth and therefore, will vote Republicans because of their inablity to listen to diverse news sources.   I would rather go to war and they would put me all day on working on intelligence gathering via computers.  Prison? Forget it? The gangs would rape me.   and they have no clue about that there are serving the corporations.   And the tea baggers are being taken advantage of.   Me too. I am Reddit when I should be learning dance steps.   It does not go far enough. Vote No on Prop 19.  Wait until 2014 for the California Prison Reform   Control Substance Act    Your are sick fucker.   Out of my friends that are Christians, they actually read it and know it quite well..  But my friends are exceptions to the rule.   And most of the people who watch it are bunch of dumbasses.  Go on Topix and you find a bunch of people who agree with Fix News.  I listen to Pacifica and MSNBC for the commentary on the news and I rely on Google News for getting the headlines.   I think you submitted the wrong link   I am going to vote no.  Why? I have better solution to Prop 19 and my problem solves the California Prison Crisies.   He should have the golden light and quit.  Heroin is serious drug that should not be messed with.  My friends use drugs, but they stay away from heroin, crack, and meth.  Most of them are not addicts and use drugs safely.  Those drugs can kill and rob lives.     Who cares about what Bill O thinks?  He wants the US return back to the 1950s again.  Which was a more prosperous time in this country, but a time where intolerance and social conservatism were far more widespread than today.  And, yes being an atheist was far more frowned on than it is today.   How was the trip?   I do not get that   Maybe they are actually showing Christian forgiveness which is the message of the gospel .   A lot of pastors in the church would agree with you on that subject.   This is the problem that the church is trying to tackle  (http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en ie=UTF-8 q=biblical+illiteracy spell=1 oi=spell sa=X)    Yeah! You need the program my friend.

 Tub girl... Or just r/spacedicks   Beer Slip N' Slides?    Great question. A wallet with $500 hidden that well makes me think they were pot seeds from some righteous plant. I was more concerned with my sisters friends coming over  which is why I was hiding in the closet to being with... Nine-year-old me had some game.    'Draw' numbers one through ten represented by dots in a pattern and some simple math from there. Then breakfast burritos.    I found a wallet with $500 and a small envelope of seeds tucked in the frame of the inside of a closet (where the moulding would be). I was pretty young and showed my mom... real slick. The thought of how many WarHeads and candy cigars that could have bought kills me.    [reference]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZbxTt0d4pI    Eh, kind of. I dropped out of college after my first year because my band got picked up by an independent label. Long story short, after some cool shows and a lot of fun, I ended up working nightshift in a factory. Went back to school and now work in a research lab, live with my SO, and come home to her and my dog each day. Not quite the rockstar life I thought I'd live, but honestly, I like this one better.    Yes, this is very common. It may be with a different professor eg. Anatomy and Physiology on Monday, wednesday and Friday at 9am with Dr. Green, 11 am with Dr Brown; OR on Tuesday and Thursday with Dr Yellow   Grossology - Got me into science as a kid. I do science for a living :-)   If it's an SO - Men, sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door.  If it's just a friend or roommate - You should probably sleep in your own bed. It might get weird.   Stacy gives Wayne a severed head; Wayne gets very upset.   Walked into the house after a particularly long day at work to fresh baked Guinness stout chocolate cake (Yes, cake made with beer), Metallica slamming out of the stereo, an Allagash White, and a backrub. This same woman snuck my (deceased) grandfathers watch out of our room and had it repaired as a surprise this past Christmas.    You know, if you stab a man in the dead of winter, steam will rise up from the wounds. Indians believed it was his soul escaping from his body.   Its like people only do things because they can get paid. And that's just sad.      If you want fiction, George Orwell's 1984 is exactly what you described. If you're looking for more non fiction check out A Peoples History of the United States.   Another interesting read would be the Republic of Plato which spends a lot of time on society and justice.   Think of the brain in terms of musicians. Each region of the brain has a set of different tasks that it performs and one that it is typically known to be 'responsible' for. In this sense the frontal cortex (The outer part of your brain just behind your forehead) controls your higher-thinking processes but is 'known' to be, generally, responsible for your personallity. The cerebellum, the little baseball-looking lobe at the lower backof your brain controls things like muscle memory and muscle tone, but is generally taught to be 'responsible' for fine motor coordination.   Now, just like a lot of artists who have many songs (in the case of the brain - functions) the brain regions might have "one-hit-wonders" which are the functions that people usually remember. Name one song, without google, that MC Hammer did that was not 'Can't Touch This'. Most of us cant. That's how we end up saying that the occipital lobe (Back outer part of your brain behind that pointy part in the back of your skull) because known as the visual center. As with every one-hit-wonder some artist will write a cover song! There are many parts of the brain that are responsible for many tasks and there is a lot of overlap between them (There are 45 centers in the brain that play a role in vision) and can even 'rescue' the functions is others become damaged.   The parts I mentioned above are more responsible for less vital functions. That is to say that if they became damaged you most likely would still survive but could become deaf, blind, develop cognitive defects, etc. You mentioned blood pumping and breathing. Well those are controled by the inner part of your brain, what's in the center and at the top of the spinal cord. Those parts control vital senses that are absolutely necessary for you to live. damaging that part usually results in death.   Now the awesome and amazing part is that all of these things are happening all at once. If we're thinking about parts of brains as musicians who are playing their whole discography and their well known hits and some are covering songs written by others then we can think of the brain as SXSW. This orchestra of musicians all playing at once and working together is what allows us to run (Primary motor cortex, at the top of your head and cerabellum among others) and to read (occipital lobe, and frontal lobe among others).  Hope that helps!   The Limulus immune system is pretty simple. It's composed of the amebocyte, plasma, and a few proteins. To be honest, my largest body of knowledge is into their nervous system (primarily molecular and electrophysiological). But [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873049/) abstract gives a decent overview. They're a pretty amazing creature. If nothing else, they pre-date dinosaurs and yet we can go to the beach and see them each spring/summer.   It stands that we (the royal we/academic community) dont know as much as we need to. Unfortunately there are not any real regulations against harvesting and bleeding crabs. Hopefully more new [research](http://www.biolbull.org/content/225/3/137.abstract) will bring this more to the public eye. Sadly, once the crabs are released back to the wild after they are bled, it is not unheard of for a crab to be re-collected by mistake and bled a second time, thus killing the crab. [Here](http://limulus.mx/lo-que-late-dentro-de-una-sangre-azul/?lang=en) is pretty cool article about how their blood 'works'.

You're seeing light from stars as they were thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years ago. Many of them may not even exist any more and yet we see them as they were.

 When I'm playing and I level up, I always click the little box to upgrade a skill. However, I was watching a video today and it didn't look like the guy playing clicked on the box to level his skill up. Is there a keyboard shortcut for this? Thanks (:   Exact same thing happened to me, i sent a ticket in, but they take forever to answer so i don't know what they'll do   I completely agree. The Capital Wasteland was amazing and just filled with a good looking and somewhat unique environment. New Vegas was kinda bland with that. It was basically miles upon miles of nothingness with a few towns and caves scattered. Nothing like Fallout 3. I think there were more locations in DC alone that the entire Mojave desert   Yeah, that's definitely what I'm going to go for now. I didn't even think of all of that, plus with my friends being able to play ranked they'd probably ask me to play too and screw my elo up early on   Thanks, I'm definitely glad I asked here first (:    Well I generally only play a game every day or two so I figured getting one based on days would be a waste. But thanks (:    Well I just got some RP for the new TF skin, and I have enough left over for either a 10 win XP boost or the 4 win IP boost. I'm only level 19 since I don't play too much, so the xp is pretty useful. Anybody wanna help me out here? Because I really don't know what to get.   Definitely the most useful thing out there so far. Thanks (:   That just sounds amazing actually   I hope so    Wasteland 2? Never heard of that one. How is it?   I seriously hope they give us something   Damn, this is going to be a bitch of a wait   Has there been any information released about the next Fallout game?

 There's also a nice set of photos and an interview with the author [here](http://www.theworld.org/2011/11/ants-art-of-war/).   If I had to guess, I'd say it ushered in the militarization of the United States.   "Maps of Time: an Introduction to Big History" by David Christian is a wonderful book that doesn't focus on any one region and spans from the big bang to 2002. Big History is interested in the history of the world as a whole and Christian points out some surprising trends.   For a lie to be believed it must be very big and repeatedly told.   The Standard Oil octopus has always been my favorite.   Name calling is the last bastion of someone who can't hold up their end of the argument. As for pretending I know what's going on in relation to American history, I fooled two universities into giving me degrees that say just that. Let's see how much you know about this period. I'll ask a simple question that any of my students can answer: What do historians call the period that stretches from 1890-1920s? Extra points if you can name two activists during this time.   "Your use of a 1904 poster shows the problem with your analysis. Social darwinism, by definition, requires that there be competition on equal grounds amongst people. In 1904, after slavery had been abolished, there was competition."  Darwinism does require competition, however it's not on equal grounds. White slave owners considered their slaves as inferior, and no better than animals. I'm also not going to argue this point any further in that you don't understand your own nation's history. As for Ron Paul, I could care less about the man or his politics. He is a libertarian, a group that was popular during the early 1900s, and its influence paved the way for the later economic melt down that began in the 1920s, leading to the Great Depression. Libertarians are simply political Luddites.   The article's author states each myth and then proceeds to explain why they're true. It makes no sense to me why the author calls them myths. 1. Hoover was gay. Author - Whatever he did behind closed doors are his business. 2. Not a coward - didn't join in WWI because of family responsibilities. ETC.   He may or may not be a social darwinist in re race. I honestly don't know and certainly don't know what you think social darwinism has to do with slavery.  Social Darwinism played a huge part in slavery, and continued to be used as an excuse by American politicians in both the north and the south to enforce Jim Crow laws and the "separate-but-equal-philosophy." For example, [here](http://i.imgur.com/38K02.jpg) is a poster from the 1904 St. Louis Expo that lists the Races of Man according to the Social Darwin scale. Many historians argue that the U.S. Government's [reason](http://i.imgur.com/2PPyj.jpg) for occupying the Philippines and Cuba was to protect its backward citizens from cruel Spain.    I attended San Diego State University for graduate school, but looked into attending a Cal school (UCSD) and it was far too expensive. Maybe it's because I'm just not as wealthy as I should be at my age.   No sensationalism here. I'm just asking whether you believe that the same contemporary Republican leadership that has purposely hobbled the economy in order to to win back the White House, would risk their political careers to free the slaves?   This event just might be the tipping point that leads the FBI to investigate California's police state. You see, those kids go to Berkeley, and their parents have money. Do you think some Berkeley students' parents are now very upset?   Discovery channel did a good show on whether racist symbols are hidden within the sculpture and surrounding tunnels.   Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity.   Honey, the last thing I want to do is hurt you. But it's still on the list.   Today is the anniversary of my father's death. I want to die peacefully in my sleep, as he did, not screaming in terror like the passengers in his car.   When I think of socially cashing-in Facebook whoring immediately jumps to mind. The people in these photos have actually gotten off the couch and are practicing real democracy. Not to sound too harsh.   To really take back our democracy we must place term limits on representatives from both houses. Politicians and diapers, they should both be changed regularly and for the same reasons.   My dad grew up during the 40's in the mountains of Asheville. Judging from the little he tells me about his childhood, the area is remote, religious, and hostile to outsiders.   Banksy? Is that you?   Readers of Cracked, or perhaps on crack.   My personal favorite is Old Boy.   There is a single page option on the landing page. I'm not too keen on posting content that requires multiple clicks because I understand the Reddit hive-mind doesn't like them.  Edit: It's labeled "view all."   From the survey - "Do you think the views of people involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement generally reflect the views of most Americans?" Yes - 46%   The idea of Germany going to war sends shivers up my back. I want to say it's a country with a penchant for war, but then I look at the US and realize we're no better.   On the flip side, OWS has a 46% approval rating.   I see the move as a positive; it will give the students a familiarity with the kinds of jobs they'll be assuming after leaving college. Now that's really getting a college education.   Wow...there might be some substance to this idea. Does Goldman Sachs stand to make a boat-load of money?   My sentiments exactly - tell a lie long enough and loud enough and it will eventually be believed. I wonder if Sun Power will come out swinging in response to the negative Fox campaign.   Not for younger readers in deed. I'm still scarred by Dr. Seuss's book "Horton Hears a Who, and He Better Not Be a Fucking Snitch".   The mere idea that if a person needs public assistant they must be on drugs is deeply offensive. The wealthy are in a far greater position to indulge in a chemical holiday.   So your okay with the idea of drug testing someone before they can receive a pittance from the government; you must have been inconsolable when the government gave away 750 billion without asking for one single drug test. I'd say they're both forms of government assistance, but one form is actually reaching the people it can help.   It is the truth in those words that gives it humor. I heard a comedian once say that all humor was rooted in truth.   Hmmm...just waiting for an alum to comment that the address is actually a form of class warfare.   South Park - it's a shitty wall (city wall) made by the chinese character who owns a shitty wok (city wok restaurant).

If you do drop acid, may I suggest the lobby of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas as the location. Just trying to walk across the hotel lobby's carpet while tripping is an adventure in itself.   It also breaks the third wall by acknowledging the day-to-day Hollywood routine in the final scenes of the movie.   "Get your dirty-dick-beaters off of me!!"   I've seen the General quoted in other books, which stressed his stance on foreign involvement by U.S. forces.   Readability is a good one for firefox.  But, really, this is the thought that went through my head as I read the post.  "Hello sir/ma'am. I can tell from your post that you're a busy person, and the effort to push a button can seem daunting at times. Could I, perhaps, interest you in a subscription to Readers Digest?"  "Blah, blah, blah, insert lame excuse here."  "I know, I know, even that seems like too much trouble. Might I suggest that you tune into Fox or MSNBC News, there you won't be required to read, or even to think. They'll tell you just what to be angry about and how angry you should be."   If I want to make them laugh - "Blazing Saddles".  For the more serious side - "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly".   This storm system is HUGE!!!   So RobotRollCall is incorrect? The way I understand light's property in relation to the universe: Looking at a star is like looking into the past; the light from the star that I'm seeing on Earth happened 150 years earlier - or 150 light years away. So if we see IK Pegasi B's super nova today, it actually took place 150 years earlier. Is this right?   I'm researching anomalies for a fiction book. I like my writing to be as accurate as possible.    I wasn't sure if time and the speed of light could be different measurements. This means that if a GRB event occurred, civilization would have a hundred fifty years to prepare?   I think O'Reilly thought he booked a couple of "yes" men and they didn't play along. I don't like Stein but he did hold O'Reilly's view in check.   I'm SO DISAPPOINTED that I didn't make the list. Yet.   That would make a great Saturday Night Live skit. You should email the idea to the show.   or perhaps to shape the conversation. But then again, aren't we all?   No class warfare here. I just looked at your overview and it's a relatively new account with a minimum of submitted links. For an experienced redditor, an account such as yours screams right-wing troll.   After looking through your Reddit overview I'm going to take your opinions with a grain of salt. I also believe your user name is associated with the patrician side of the U.S. political/economic system.   This cartoon is a snapshot of the political process. I think therefore I don't think.   Ooooohhhh...that almost sounds like a challenge. I'm with you on the couch-politician moniker. I believe sharing ideas on reddit has some value.   I'm considering taking a bullhorn to some of the political rallies and yelling "doublethink" when the pol starts slinging the bullshit.   You're going to have to elaborate on your point because at present it sounds like you're passing the buck. Who ultimately has the responsibility for generating "doublethink"?   I thought this would be about Arrested Development.   Okay...I watched this film and it's a very simplistic explanation for a very complicated system. It doesn't take into account political, social, or economic climate. If you live in a zoo this video might mean something.   Thank you, the link is very helpful.   Ender does learn a combat art but the author doesn't say how. He even laments not learning advanced combat arts before his fight in the shower. The military base is a very large population within a captured former bugger tunnel complex. There were at least eight previous commander trainees who washed out before Ender completed the final test. The commander who teaches Ender admits this during his instruction.   A good article that deserves a deeper contemplation.   "This is about exposing the corrupt power relationship between Wall Street and the government. Corporations have way too much influence, and this occupation is about fighting against it, taking a stand on principle, and exposing corruption."  I believe most Americans recognize the relationship between Wall Street and government. What I also believe is that this protest will warn both parties that Americans are now angry enough about the BS to nonviolently protest.   I just posted this to see if it would get downvoted. I'm pleased to see that Palin is losing her popularity, even as a divisive figure.   I'm at a loss for words at how desperate poor people can be. Guess the other country that has a high portion of the young unemployed. With the new social media devices available to the masses, flash mobs may become the norm for the dispossessed and powerless. Where are the young peoples' parents? Working two jobs so that they can exist day-to-day. If the poor cannot reach the wealthy (gates, dogs, fences) then they'll vent their rage on the more accessible middle class. I'm not advocating for violence or looting, but I do understand the underlying anger that's driving these actions.   I'm more interested in Bain Capital's [lobbying](http://buchaada.imgur.com/bain_capital#l5RQI) with another lobbying group [Public Strategies Washington](http://buchaada.imgur.com/bain_capital#wWam2)and [who](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=F07 year=2011) it's associated with in the lobbying process.   Fox doesn't report on the news, it just gives commentary. Delicious, divisive, skewed, and spun, it delivers opinions that are no good for anyone.   From all that I've seen the corporate-political hegemony isn't really keeping things bearable for the middle class.   Just as Americans are [losing faith in their own government](http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/08/05/what-happens-when-citizens-lose-faith-in-government/) corporations move on to its next victims.   But what if that lightning is the product of two leprechauns playing hide the sausage?   I'm going to suggest one book for you, but it is a very long book. "Maps of Time: an introduction to big history" by David Christian is a book that documents the history of earth from its inception to the 2000s. I recommend this book because it discusses patterns and cycles that are hidden unless the individual views the big picture. It is a peer-reviewed book by a noted and well-respected historian that places mankind in context to the planet. We humans seem to believe that manipulating our environment comes with no consequences. Much like Carl Sagan described the Earth in relation to the cosmos, Christian performs the same service for our planet and species. As any planetary scientist could tell you, we are a small speck on an inconsequential planet that sits on a back-water portion of a spiral in the Milky Way. We are nothing in cosmic terms and if humans were to disappear do you believe the cosmos would notice?    I'm no Luddite and love technology as much as the next person, however, I'm also a realist. In geological terms, Homo sapiens have only spent an eye blink on this planet. During this short period we are responsible for an extinction level event that is on par with the loss of the dinosaurs. You won't have to decide on who lives/dies during the great die off, nature will do that. I hear people say, "We must save the planet, we're killing it." This planet will be just fine; it will bounce back and continue to spin. It's the people that really have to worry.    For the working poor the sky is falling. I can only hope you're not the sort of person who looks up at the sky with an open mouth; unless, of course, you're one of the wealthy, in which case I kind of hope you drown.   Your post is basically saying, "Fight the man, but be sure to look like him." Part of this protest is rooted in a social realm and asking for anyone to curtail his/her own individuality is a direct assault on diversity.   Because you need evidence of the government's involvement in creating and punishing race related crimes, I'm giving a nice list of books to help you along. If you're still confused about government or corporate responsibility in creating a police state dependent on racial profiling after reading this list, then there really isn't much hope that you'll ever understand the problem.

That is the problem with the U.S.; too many people are willing to lay down and let shit happen to them. We are in the middle of a culture war with the nation's wealthy who base their opinions on appearance. The right car, college, diction, and associations all play into this paradigm. The reason no one is getting hired today is because there are no jobs. The wealthy have gutted the labor unions leaving very few institutions powerful enough to represent the poor. The latest budget fight is a glaring example of the lengths politicians are willing to go to protect the wealthy. Instead of stopping, you should be getting angry.   Meanwhile, over on [digg](http://socialhype.com/offbeat/10-of-the-funniest-barack-obama-pictures-ever-3/).   I'm with you on this one Patrick; I'd love to know what kind of vehicle those being attacked were driving. Imagine these kids living in poverty but having to watch people have fun at a fair the AA can't afford to attend. The AA's decide to protest and look for victims driving late model BMWs, Mercedes, SUVs, Audis, or Lincolns. This is only the start of the violence; if an individual appears to have wealth they become a target.   Let me just be clear here, no one should be allowed to steal a family driveway critically needed to transport a disabled child.   I'm betting that the drop continues. In fact, I hope the drop continues. Why? Because I'm poor, underemployed ($6000 ytd), and miserable. I could say misery enjoys company but that's not why I want the stocks to drop. In my opinion, the political and economic system in the U.S. needs fixing and the only way that will happen is if enough middle-class people REALLY feel the financial pain a large proportion of Americans already experience. I welcome these numbers because they're another step in that direction.   Ahhh, but can you bend over at the waist and still spell RUN. This is supposed to be impossible; try it with a friend.  Edit: I should also warn that this is incredibly difficult for females to accomplish.   upvoted for wit, then.   Can you clarify your point for me? I'm confused with whether I should be righteously pissed or admiring your tongue-in-cheek wit.   Many times the original submission has been submitted to an inappropriate subreddit. Since you subsist on submission karma, you should substitute the original submission, and subject it to the correct subreddit. I understand you feel subjugated by a subordinate redditor, but I hope my sublime advice will launch your reddit karma into the suborbital karmasphere.   [Reddit](http://www.alternet.org/story/151850/8_reasons_young_americans_dont_fight_back_how_the_us_crushed_youth_resistance?page=entire) is [teeming](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/09/20/903538/-Huge-voter-suppression-plot-exposed-in-Wisconsin) with posts on the efforts to sway the U.S. political system. As a young man, I didn't care about politics. It took a graduate degree in American history to wake me up to the reality of a professional-run political system with a revolving door leading straight to the open arms of big business.   I'm with socks on his critique of your comment. It is an ad hominem argument likely to draw upvotes from like-minded individuals. It adds nothing to the argument and inspires a knee-jerk response. Now, were you to produce a response such as that of SpeedSteamBoat, posted below, and include your critical comments, I would find that much more productive. Instead, your comment is on the same level as the original poster's lede, thus mirroring an action that you supposedly despise.   Edison was the king of stealing other's ideas and making them his own. He was the modern-day equivalent of Dane Cook or Carlos Mensia. By the way, do a search of "fake mexican comedian" on Google and check out the number one spot.   Point 3 is especially important because it explains children's initial introduction to authority. Michel Foucault spoke about the close association between prisons and the school system in his book ["Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish) He argued that children are taught from a very young age to line up, sit, answer bells, and be watched over by an authority figure. I believe this is the very first step in teaching our population to submit.   How is that any different from the U.S. Tea Party's objective?   We have a political system in the U.S. that's deeply wedded to the nations corporate moneyed elite. Until we find a way to divorce the two systems out nation will continue to decline. [Joshua Holland](http://www.alternet.org/economy/151705/why_the_wealthiest_americans_are_the_real_%27job-killers%27) discusses the myth between wealth and job creation, and he found no correlation.   How have I not heard of this man? Thoreau would be proud. DeChristopher is just the first actor in what will soon be a flood of civil disobedience.   "And after 150 years of making other people rich, West Virginia is almost dead last among the states in per capita income, education rates and life expectancy.  And its not an anomaly.  The areas with the richest fossil fuel resources, whether coal in West Virginia and Kentucky, or oil in Louisiana and Mississippi, are the areas with the lowest standards of living.  In part, this is a necessity of the industry.  The only way to convince someone to blow up their backyard or poison their water is to make sure they are so desperate that they have no other option."  This statement is dead on, but the poor are close to their tipping point. When that point comes, no amount of government protection will stand in the way of civil disobedience.   I think he was confusing [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s51unxcyMVQ feature=player_detailpage) event with a Hitler Youth Rally.   IMHOP, the writer had a specific character in mind during the process; they would probably have the best opinion on the actor/actress who should play the part.   This opinion seems to be the consensus.   Apparently movie subredditors don't have a sense of humor (downvotes). It came out of nowhere. This, sir/ma'am, is funny.   The killer should be forced to read the victim's bios and look at their pictures. Religion and nationalism, two sides of the same coin.   Okay, that's just funny.   Juan Williams never mentioned Reddit by name. He could be talking about Delicious, Popurls, or Digg for all you know. Stop jumping to conclusions.   That is a matter of opinion. Words only have power if you give it to them. I myself prefer the term ["SuperPatriot"](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Parenti/Superpatriotism.html) because it describes the tea party's ideology much better.   "In the west, having kids isn't something you can just do without a thought. You need to pay for their education, and child labor laws and the like mean that kids are a money pit for the first 20 years of their lives."  You should probably qualify this statement by saying "in the west today." In the undeveloped western world, having a large number of babies was the norm. With a plethora of resources, many of the children survived but child mortality remained a big problem. Famine in Africa is not new.

Just a quick update for this thread and [vindication](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTzMqm2TwgE) for my argument. Oh, and there's also [this](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/07/23/997923/-Short-and-Succinct-on-MY-Social-Security?via=siderec).   Fred Astaire called this dance performance the greatest he'd ever seen.   I wouldn't say Reddit is pro-democrat because its users are a population that spans the globe. I would characterize the average Redditor as against any forms of unfairness. As the [Stiglitz](http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105?printable=true) post states, most politicians are part of the 1%, so democrat or republican, their political affiliation just doesn't seem to matter.   I miss San Diego and Comicon soooooo much.   Would the percentage values remain the same? I guestimated a 30% downvote margin.   "As we gaze out at the popular fervor in the streets, one question to ask ourselves is this: When will it come to America?" "The top 1 percent rarely serve in the militarythe reality is that the all-volunteer army does not pay enough to attract their sons and daughters, and patriotism goes only so far."  When the violence comes, and it is coming, whose side do you think the military will be on? I don't condone violence, however, it may be the only way to make the 1% listen.  Even more disturbing, as I look at the story's trending numbers, 32% of Redditors downvoted this posting. WTF, Stiglitz offered a concise, well thought out, and intelligent argument and yet 336 redditors disagreed (1/3).   [This](http://files.g4tv.com/ImageDb3/269365_S/stool-sample.jpg) is the best way I know to take a stool sample.   I hope your wife buys the lube because lotion can be a massive irritant that I rely on as a last resort.   I'm proud to say that I'm already Murdoch free.   I'm down with that.   So you're saying she received a fair trial but she's still a "scumbag?"   I'm currently reading "Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex" by William Hartung, and he argues that the military is part of the problem. There is such competition among the different branches that they will continue to support a defense contractor's project even if it's a failure and a waste of taxpayer money. Hartung also credits Lockheed with developing the political strategy of "too big to fail." When congress threatened to pull MIC funding during the 70s because of the C-5A scandal, Lockheed said it would fail without a Bailout. The company claimed that financial failure and job losses within the aircraft production industry could cause a financial meltdown.   Like that little play on the word? I've developed this opinion after listening to Michael Parenti's talk on "the Superpatriot."   Upvote for superior word play.   The sad reality is that most Americans rely on Marxist terminology when discussing societal classes. The markers utilized to define class are malleable and subject to change as societies progress.   Working class: average male (adding a family [wife,2kids] places an even greater strain) 1. Lives paycheck-to-paycheck. 2. Cannot afford to put money in savings on a monthly basis. 3. One car still being paid on. 4. Rents house, apartment, trailer, condo (sometimes). 5. Can only occasionally go out to eat. 6. Heavily reliant on credit cards to get through the average month. 7. Employment is limited to low/moderate pay (30-40k).   I avoided Facebook because I like my privacy.   Not yet.   I don't think Americans think along class lines; Race is more the American cup of tea.   You need re-familiarize yourself with that linked piece. I'll give you a little help here: DoD tracks "representativeness" - as Gilroy calls it - very closely. And representativeness can take a whole host of forms - race, education, social status, income, region and so on. "When you look at all of those, you find that the force is really quite representative of the country," he said in a recent interview. "It mirrors the country in many of these. And where it doesn't mirror America, it exceeds America."  It mirrors the country, which is majority working class. The article alludes to education but that has no relation to class.   Now that your inhibitions are down, do you have any racy picks to share with your fellow redditors?  Edit: I'm such a pussy. Let me try that again. Show us your tits.   Did you get a picture. Without proof it's hearsay.   Really? Do you thinks all those upper-class/middle-class families are going to let their babies go to war. No, it's the working-class, only-way-I-can-afford-college families that watch their children go to war.    Of course, this got voted down immediately.   It's a show about tweekers. DO NOT KEEP TWEEKERS WAITING!!!   I'm with you on this one. I've said for years that the Legislative branch should only be allowed two terms, which is the same limit for the president. We now have congress people whose only goals are reelection, making money, and stepping into the revolving door of private industry. Remove the monetary incentive from the legislative process and the U.S. just might discover new leaders who want to improve their country instead of raping it.  Edit: [Here](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20075586-503544.html) is a little something to chew on.   Thank you for offering the community a very nice example of "keeping your outrage to comment sections" and demonstrating a sweeping generalization regarding "hard line hate mongering liberals."   Blue Beard - "The Great Depression was going on, so that the station and the streets teemed with homeless people, just as they do today. The newspapers were full of stories of worker layoffs and farm foreclosures and bank failures, just as they are today. All that has changed, in my opinion, is that, thanks to television, we can hide a Great Depression. We may even be hiding a Third World War." (p. 71-72)  "He suggested that we build a Money Hall of Fame out there, with busts of the arbitrageurs and hostile-takeover specialists and venture capitalists and investment bankers and golden handshakers and platinum parachutists in niches, with their statistics cut into stone -- how many millions they had stolen legally in how short a time." (p. 90)   Welcome to the reality of 90% of American workers.   Depends on your fantasy.  edit: Coincidently, I've been informed by friends that Depends is also the flavor of old lady p*****.   I'll miss this [guy](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm589597184/nm0000469) more.   Wait...what's this 'we' shit? I didn't vote for Bush the first time around, and I certainly didn't vote twice for that sad, sad piece-of-crap.   I reject your reality and substitute my own.   I'd rather have the ability to fully understand their conversation.   Yes, we all know how hard insurance companies have it these days. Instead of hugs, why not just deny a few claims? Your son needs a bone marrow transplant? Denied - gotta save the money to protect a wealthy person's porsche from flooding. Cancer treatment? Have you seen this porsche that's threatened by a flood? Stop whining about needing cancer treatments?    It's nice to see my wealthy friends being taken care of by the lower castes. This story warms my heart. If only the porsche in new orleans had been saved. Oh wait, its owner was not white.   For just a moment there I was confused with your [logic!](http://www.pbs.org/peoplelikeus/resources/stats.html), and then I checked out your past comments and decided not to waste my time. If you're comfortable with working-class wages remaining stagnant since 1972, while professional politicians vote themselves regular pay raises, then why ask you to pull your head out of A HOLE?   Shopped...so obvious.   Does anyone know why Web of Trust (WOT) has such a low ranking for this blog?   Can you imagine how they'd market to women?

Now, stop whining and find me some content that's worth upvoting. Chop chop.   I "StumbledUpon" this article, found it interesting, and posted it to Reddit for like-minded individuals to enjoy. I wasn't aware the original poster was Vanity Fair.  I apologize and in the future will be more conscious of the content's origin.

Thanks for the heads-up on the firefox addon; I'm always looking for new ways to improve my reading experience, however, this addon didn't work for the Atlantic article.

Thanks for the tip; it was my first ever attempt at posting a screenshot on reddit.   SNL must read reddit.   Let's hope it doesn't end like [this.](http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/works-for-hulk.html)   I'm not on the streets. I live in a vet shelter.   I always believed that my experience and education would shield me from becoming unemployed and homeless. I also believed that federal and state assistance was in place to help if I needed it. I was wrong on both accounts. I'm sharing my experience so that others may learn from it.   I don't have a disability, and though it's been offered, I won't game the system.   Federal employment (hell, almost all employment) and security clearances are hampered by a negative credit background. If you're already living paycheck-to-paycheck and then experience seven months of unemployment without benefits it doesn't take long to achieve a negative credit rating. I also encourage you to demand any member of the intelligence community to explain in detail the particulars of their job. After you're finished meeting with Homeland Security drop me a line.   I'll respect your opinion.   Women are natural targets for prostitution, especially if they have some form of addiction. Their children become pawns for the pimp to keep their mothers working. Some women are so deeply possessed by their addictions that they only peripherally care for the children and they will often leave the children with "friends" while they party.   My portion of the GI Bill was 20,100 and it only paid for my first 4 semesters.   Amen, that.   On person's POS is another's nonconformist.   I truly respect, and to the extent that someone can love the intangible, I love the reddit community. Just being a member means you bring something to the table. It's up to you to decide the quality of that something you contribute.   Thank you for your kind words.   After reading your last three replies, I'll just say that we have a couple of guys here that are bipolar. That sounds mean, but it was the first impression that popped into my head.   Again, let me reply with all the patience and kindness that I can muster - I understand your inability to believe a story like mine. It doesn't fit into the narrative that governs your life. But my reality is that I will go to sleep tonight in my small room, and to the room on my right is an alcoholic, and to my left is a heroin addict, both fighting their own inner demons. I'm sure if someone sat down to talk with them that their lives would appear unbelievable as well. As for myself, I'm not some mysterious soldier; anyone possessing a TS/SCI clearance and signed that little paper given at the beginning and end of any debriefing can attest to the fact that there are mandatory monetary and penal consequences for anyone who reveals state secrets. I also didn't say there are no friends or family I can rely on; I did say that most of them are walking that thin line that I've fallen below. This is my current reality and I will recover from it, but the barriers in my path are very real whether or not they fit into your narrative.   Thank you.   Not that I'm aware of, but I do wish people could understand that race is a social construct. It's like discriminating between people by saying they have big bones in a world that prefers small bones.   Okay, but I don't care.   I'm on both and have reached the second level of employment for consideration as a historian. I believe both education and experience are equally important; those that can find a balance between the two are the most successful, imo. If I had to do it all over again, I would still have attempted the masters. Knowledge is a resource that, once earned, can't be taken away. As for advice: 1. try to stay close to home or family 2. find a way to maintain a means of communication 3. don't believe the state or federal social system will be there for you, it won't. the social systems that will help help you are most often found at the community level. 4. don't become too personally attached to anything of value; recognize its future value as a means to make it another day. 5. don't be afraid to ask for help; swallow your pride because there are people who take real pleasure in helping others.   No, the shelter doesn't provide these items. My situation is different from the other clients here in that I'm not alcohol or drug addicted, or have a service connected disability. I do suffer from PTSD, but once an individual's labeled with a mental disability, it sticks. Federal and state social agencies provide some source of income for these individuals, from which the shelter expects the clients to buy their own hygiene products.   That's the problem, people don't have an understanding. I have blanketed all the job sources you've mentioned. I start my search very early in the morning, for example, looking at the listings of new opportunities, and when I apply for the job there's a info graphic on the job boards stating 250-300 other people also applied for it. With transportation being cost prohibitive, only those jobs within walking distance are realistically in reach. Imagine spending the entire day walking from place to place and being rejected at every turn. There are no jobs to be had. I'm not limiting myself to just Washington, I'm putting in for any job anywhere. This is the longest I've ever been unemployed. And please don't think I'm throwing a pity-party here; this is the reality of today's job market. The kids leaving college in May will have an even more difficult time.   I'm a grown man who can take care of himself in most cases. But, I shudder to think about women with children placed in my situation. The threat of human predation is very real, and from what I've seen of the streets, there are entire industries that specialize in taking advantage of the disadvantaged. The poor have the smallest voice in our society, and only the most sensational instances of injustice receive any attention. If there is any chance you may become homeless plan ahead and protect your children.   The items most needed by the homeless are for hygiene and a means to utilize public transportation. This is the United States, and as I've repeatedly told my family, I'll never starve. Assistance with food is readily available, but hygiene products are not covered by government assistance. Shampoo, razors, soap, deodorant, and clothing are in high demand, but often unattainable. Transportation is another big issue for the homeless. Often, the means to reach a job interview aren't available because they don't have the money for public transportation. I considered myself lucky to have my car, however, I went for a job interview in downtown Seattle. I parked on the street and used what little change I had to pay the meter. Unaware that the street became a through-way for buses after a certain time, my car was ticketed, towed, and impounded. Those individuals living in Seattle will agree that the signs posted in these areas don't clearly warn the uniformed about these parking traps. When I parked, it was with a long line of cars and I paid the fare. I returned to discover my car was gone and thought it'd been stolen. After asking a student, she was unsurprised to tell me it was probably towed. With great sadness, I sold one of my two laptops to get my car back. Without the money for gas, I'm now reliant on the Seattle public transportation system, and the kindness of this shelter which has provided me with a ORCA card. It has fifty dollars on it to be used on public transportation, of which Seattle's is very good.   There was no offer of compensation, and litigation is reserved for those with deeper pockets than I have.   I'm not a religious person, so the holidays are not that important. I do volunteer work, so that's how I'm spending the holidays. Yesterday I did an event for the animal shelter by photographing people with their pets at a PetSmart. My family does know about my situation, but we come from the working class and they're all just barely making it. There are many individuals in my situation, and the numbers will continue to grow. If you saw the photos from my flikr page, there was an entire line of cars filled with people in my situation. That was only one side of the parking lot; there was another entire section filled with people living out of their cars. I studied as an historian, and understand the problems of homelessness. In fact, understanding the system that placed me in this situation makes it that much more frustrating. After moving into this shelter, I was asked by the director to represent the clients in an interview with the E network. I had mixed feelings about this, because I was a college instructor for a short period, and the thought of my students seeing how far I'd fallen was shameful. However, the benefit of helping not only other veterans, but the homeless as well, overrode my prideful side. My situation is what it is, but it doesn't define who I am, and it has humbled me.   I give up on this line of questioning. You win.   I'm desperate for any job which is why I've taken education and experience off my resume. There aren't any jobs out there. I'm on every job board I'm aware of, but there are many, many individuals out of work and looking for employment. I apply in person, however, being forty-five-years-old places me in an under/unemployable age bracket. If I could find a job washing dishes, I would do it.   A large part of my day was spent trying to find food, a place to shower, and avoiding the police. Authorities seem to have a second sense when it comes to homeless people, who they consider a bad image for the city. Libraries are a great resource, but many of them have rules in place to discourage use by the homeless. I'm someone who is attentive to hygiene, so having to go days without bathing absolutely annoyed me. To save money on razors, I grew a beard, which I keep neatly trimmed. Maintaining clean clothing is another big challenge. Laundromats are expensive and there aren't many resources for the homeless in this area. I want to share a photo of my shelter, but for the privacy of other residents, I'm simply not allowed.   You can AMA but expect me to get angry if I'm called a liar.   Every day the financial hole gets deeper. I've just found a part-time job teaching, but it doesn't begin until late January. I've removed the education portion and any dates from my resume, and started receiving more replies. My daily goal is to apply for 5 jobs per day. I've been passed on to the second round of the interview process with the federal government for a historians position. This is a first in a vast number of attempts. My fear is that the financial portion of the background check will preclude me from consideration. After securing a steady paycheck, the next six months will be spent trying to dig my way out of this financial morass.   I don't mind giving particulars about my homeless situation, but don't ask me what I did in the military.   I was a 98j10 mos. Look it up and then KMA.   I felt my education and work background insulated me from ever becoming homeless. I was wrong. As a member of the working class in the U.S., my drop into the truly indigent was short and painful. I didn't mean the description to sound creepy, but if a redditor is in the working class, my situation can serve as an abject example.   Please see my posted reply to redfoxrun.   I am a 45-year-old male who found himself homeless because of the current financial downturn. In 2006 I completed two bachelors, one in journalism, the other in history. Over the next four years I worked toward a masters in history. With the economy worsening, I realized the opportunity to finish my masters was limited. No one in my family has gone beyond a bachelors so my efforts were considered a matter of pride for my dad. In order to pass the summer exams, I quit my job to study. I paid for school and living expenses using a small retirement 401K and a savings account of about $2000. I believed that earning a masters would provide more job opportunities, so the gamble was worth it, imo. As I studied over the summer, I flooded the job market with resumes. After taking and passing my exams on August 21, I received a job offer in public relations from a large company in Seattle. I jumped at the opportunity, and having exhausted all my financial resources, sold all my household goods on craigslist. After arriving in Seattle, I received an email from the HR head of this large firm stating the PR position was an entry level job and I was over qualified for it. He went on to state that someone with my education background and work experience was unlikely to remain with their corporation at the entry level position. The offer was rescinded and I found myself without a job, home, or funds outside of Tacoma, Washington. I'd held back a few items to sell if I reached a desperate state, such as needing gas or food. The first item to go was my favorite dress watch, pawned for food and gas money. My vacuum cleaner went next, and then several wall clocks. These were all small items that fit in the trunk of my car. I had two laptops, but didn't want to part with either because I consider them indispensable for finding work. I attempted to enter a homeless shelter in Tacoma, but after two failed robberies by individuals trying to break into my car, I decided to find a rest stop to park and live. [This](http://www.flickr.com/photos/55230349@N04/) is where I lived for the next two months. As the days grew colder, I turned to Veterans Affairs for help. First, I went to the VA hospital in American Lake just south of Tacoma. Because I didn't suffer from an alcohol or drug addiction, my options were limited. I continued searching for jobs, but because I'd never been homeless or lived on food stamps, I didn't know where or how to apply for these services. Because I'd quit my job, unemployment benefits were not available. When asked by Washington State officials if I was unable to work because of a disability, I had to answer in the negative. This meant I wasn't eligible for monetary assistance but I was given food stamps. I continually contacted the VA social worker at American Lake to ask for help, but there just wasn't much assistance for someone in my position. I was eventually referred to a VA social worker in Seattle, and within days he placed me in the veterans shelter where I'm now living. I'm still angry and confused about a system that I've paid into for my entire adult life only to find it of no use when I needed it the most.   I served from Oct 1983 to Oct 1991; I can't tell you the particulars of my enlistment because it's considered classified and the consequences would mean many, many years in a federal prison. There's also a financial penalty, but it doesn't mean much to someone who has nothing to take. I'll post the circumstances of my situation in a reply to redFoxRun.   It is a nice shelter, but more importantly, it is safe. Most homeless shelters are populated by individuals with drinking or drug abuse problems; individuals in such a shelter are prone to rapid mood changes and they're always on the hunt for the means to carry on their addictions. They make no distinctions between wealthy or poor; if you have anything worth selling, they will attempt to take it. I need to stress, however, that individuals such as these are in the grip of a disease they can control but don't know how. They aren't really bad people. They're simply desperate.  	199
 this night, I think Vincentini actually played poorly   he wasn't really given a chance to right himself. He's been better than folks have given him credit               I don't see what it matters. Seems a topic simply meant to keep old wounds open                              @train_subject1405      A USL team in St. Louis would be welcomed by so many, the city wants a pro team. But I gotta hope for Milwaukee, that's a market to crack                        This thing looks like a Poppler from Futurama                              if the Atlanta Silverbacks brand isn't bought by Blank   a wholly new team is plopped down in the city, then I'll see this as a American soccer failure. we need more teams but we need more teams where there aren't already teams. Anyway. I think buying the brand like the Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps,   Impact all did would be the best route   if your group can't regulate itself then it'll get regulated by the league. every real   vibrant supporter group keeps its own house in order.   I'm so very sick of seeing NFL involved with soccer                                                                  there's a tiny conceptual field called "pataphysics" which is a kind of fake or speculative physics/naturalism. A "metageography" or "patageography" field would be cool            I'd love to see this kind of stuff done with other fantasy worlds--like Robert Jordan's or Terry Brooks'   Carolina are always a team that finds a way to win. Discounting them is a bad idea.   I didn't subscribe   I'm able to click the link to the full article. sorry it's not working for you   Ibarra, Bracalello, Takada   here's hoping you see a win!    I keep trying to get into this show but it's just not sticking   I agree. These look forgettable. The lack of red surprises. I think these kits just ousted Edmonton's for the most bland in the league   * **Title:** Adversaries Together * **Genre:** High Fantasy * **Word Count:** 11,835 * **Feedback:** This is the first fifty or so pages of my first fantasy novel. I'm looking for constructive comments on its tone, world building, and general appeal. * **Link:** http://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/adversaries-together-the-ascendant-realms-book-i/    I'm on the fence about that away kit. But like the home kit, a nice compliment to Feyenoord    got it. I thought as much but just wanted confirmation. thx!   is the rule that one individual owner has to be worth 20mil or one part of the ownership group?   there are couple of quality clubs in the NPSL that could make the jump in the next few years--the Tulsa Athletics among them   Wall flag(s) would be cool. Loon call. Beer/bottle cozy. I'm a sucker for well designed polos. I'd love to be able to buy the some of the training gear I saw last season. I need new pint glasses!   Both of these are jokes, but it's chum given how much these 'rankings' ignore the actual standings   the team's tour in England may not involved big name teams (Derby the exception), but the interactions training-wise and the press attention can only improve the team's rep   quality. I wish more MLS/NASL teams did this sort of thing (in England, Spain, Italy, wherever) in the preseason   this will certainly give Edmonton more edge in attack. FCE will be a much faster team this season   that's a defense of mostly fullbacks. I have concerns about Ft. Lauderdale's defense   well, that's ridiculous. but I'm sure it will be fun   it's an interesting structure. wouldn't it be great if it could be harnessed by actually good writing   this is disappointing news   right? I thought it'd be a comic piece, but no   After Yallop saying that the team is still slightly over the cap, I suspect that Piermayr may not be signed   that Kinney will be let go--but that's pure speculation   Cochrane's a leftback so I would imagine that this pick up puts pressure on Jumper more than Kinney. But it's good to see Yallop getting pieces to be Segares' replacement.   more pro teams in Canada is always a good thing   I feel like this is too narrative--I'd rather see it told descriptively from the first person. Good draft tho   large population and given that Texas is huge   people in general aren't too keen on driving four hours round trip it seems to have just as much a chance as any other potential market   Cardenas sounds like someone who'd compliment Ibarra well. Nimani, Bah,   Jordan sound like perfect fits for NASL   this is a great chance for the Dark Clouds to expand the MNUFC fan base   NPSL season is summer only, set to occur during the collegiate off-season   I have to wonder, if the question was money, why not dump Soumare?   still with the stripes that aren't really hoops but it looks like a training top more than a home kit   Perhaps my feelings will change when I see it on the players. I doubt. This looks like a joke design.   simple, direct, bright without any distractions   I've really enjoyed the Colorado jerseys the last couple of seasons but I'm a sucker for burgundy    Chivas, like its jersey, is forgettable and little changed   clean, bright white is always a winner   looks less like a fun-run prize tshirt than last season's kit. But still rather bland. Still...so much better than Chicago's   that home kit is sweet looking, one that I wouldn't hesitate to just wear out   I think that's a fair assessment. And one the writer of the article makes in an oblique way--Rios just never gelled with Chicago   therefore didn't produce   I like this song   think the chorus could work well   A couple more investors, steady growth,   this team could be in USL or NASL within a season or two   think the consensus with Fire supporters is that Ward is a must-have. Joya   Pineda might have break out seasons this year if they stay healthy   Hope Townsend catches on with another team soon. But he may be a good fit with the NASL or USL, play a season there to show MLS teams that he doesn't just have talent but can produce if played   if that's it, I'm good with it   Stahl has plenty of experience   would be a good signing for San Antonio; Polak could become a very good fullback in NASL (the way Austin Da Luz became a better wide mid); I remember Collins John when he was with Chicago Fire, awful   I wonder about the Rust Belt Cup   team still needs more defensive depth but this is a good pick up   I would contend that Anangono's success will be tied to the strength of his strike partner   the quality of service he gets from the center of the midfield--those aspects could be out of his control   thus lead to some stalling   It'll be bittersweet if Anibaba has a 'breakout' season as suggested as well--I want him to do well but it will be frustrating seeing him excel at a position where Frank I refused to play him   It would have been nice if the Eddies would've played Victoria or even Thunder Bay. The Canadian PDL teams have done well   unfortunate to hear but it's good to know the reasons--improving grounds with the intention of returning, think that's acceptable at the D4 lvl   I hope there's truth to it. it'd be great to see more young   prime aged players being drawn to the league. finally dispel that retirement league stigma   thanks for the info on that   I think it's ridiculous to expect sellout for every game. A 15k avg in a 20k stadium? That's just fine; think we all need to re-adjust our attendance expectations. And yeah, Chicago can definitely handle another team   yeah, wow, kinda feel like something went awry there. hopefully Atlanta got some compensation or perhaps Horth wasn't signed-signed   still wishing for Duval County FC   Looking at the Eastern Conference, it feels like Montreal   Chicago are the weakest teams   this team feels like it's in statis, not worse than last season but not really any better. Hopefully the preseason will suggest some sparks but I doubt. I have a pessimistic view of the upcoming season   maybe grow over time but any colonists born on this imaginary colony would develop from birth differently. If they arrived back on Earth, then would perhaps find themselves stronger   I've been loving your designs, but this one is just awful. I dig the sash in kits but stars are nearly always a fail for me. Still--love what you're doing   thought it was nice to see another outlet giving these teams some coverage   I thought this was an excellent example of what happens when we focus too much on league vs league instead supporting teams. I've always thought it weird that as a supporter I'm expected to be a cheerleader for the leagues where the teams I support play. To my mind, this is the same kind of reasoning I see in MLS homers. I'd rather not see it at all. but I thought sharing it could open up a good conversation that wasn't crazy   I thought this was an excellent example of what happens when we focus too much on league vs league instead supporting teams. I've always thought it weird that as a supporter I'm expected to be a cheerleader for the leagues where the teams I support play. To my mind, this is the same kind of reasoning I see in MLS homers. I'd rather not see it at all. but I thought sharing it could open up a good conversation that wasn't crazy   that's only five defenders for Tampa now. I have concerns about their defense going into the 2014 season   sure thing! just did   I like their signings, giving them some real options to pull the team up the ranks   I feel he needs a partner that's not a target man style kind of striker. Ambersley feels like an opportunity creator for a pocher or solid finisher. He could be an assists machine with the right partner. I don't think he had the right kind of partner in MN with Campos.   also remember, that the stream counts these pass few years fluctuated as people switched to other matches or just tuned out (and maybe came back). This way viewers will have a psychological incentive to stay watching   it could lead to a dedicated means for bars to stream matches   this would be an excellent premise for a slim book   It would seem everything will revolve around quality of stream. Having spent years dealing with pirate links to watch matches that MLS Live blacked out and the teams I like over in Europe, I'll gladly pay $5 to the league for a consistent quality stream. I would like it to be free but I also want the league to nurture a revenue line.   Well, no. I still am enamored with mapmaking and creating cities/nations and landscape. So I'm interested in fantasy that is its own world but that just doesn't have magic    I guess I was thinking of a book that is set in another world but that obeys natural laws like our own. not an alternate history per se   Gulley was dreadful with Atlanta on loan last year. Dreadful. But he's still quite young so I too hope he gets his shit together. I'd love to see Atouba stake his claim for the left winger spot   Franco looks like a good pick but I don't see it as anything more than a lateral move. The team still has red flags at fullback (both sides) and the wings  	137
 I con't belieb dat.   I con't belieb dat.   I think I'm finally going to get around to animating The Victor Podcast.   I'd always known it as fast five, fast and furious six and furious 7.    Another other podcast appearance was an episode of Harmentown he appeared on. Another example of him showing up, being hilarious and just getting on with everybody.    You make a 3D model of the whole set though couldn't you? It would take a lot of work but you could.   Wait so they used the same title sequence for 6 and 7? Why??? I liked the fact each was different.   Haha, oh no. I wonder how I got so many Swedish subscribers in the first place. Now I've lost them all.    [Sorry,] (http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=77421375) it doesn't seem to be available here. I may buy some Swedish food next time I'm in IKEA though and try it in a video.    Two people at most normally.   What? I'm not even going to try understand this.   Thanks! How bad was my speaking at the end?      Thank you. I still haven't listened to all of Hollywood Handbook. I'm still in 2013 on my backlog so I'm only listening to The Reality Show Show from them right now.   What is this reference, I've seen it all over the sub?   Yeah, you can show a naked doodle of a skeleton woman but not a normal woman.   It was the Zooks!   Crack.   Or his own p-cast/podcasting.   I guess PFT just dropped in for a few minutes.    hope?   I normally use this in the summer when people are on but I have two weeks off school now and no one goes on this during the year so I have nowhere to go.   It sounds like that actually... went.. pretty well. Don't question it when things go well.   [Staring into your soul.](http://imgur.com/ZKPUihN)   Congratulations! Do you have a link to the film? I'd love to check it out. I was just in a film festival the other week. It was amazing.   Here, we can always use calculators. Is there certain questions where you have to show you didn't use one?   This is so cool. Not long left to vote too. It was really interesting learning about all of the different stuff. I think I may have voted for too many things to even make a difference!   Thanks I hope so. I have exactly a year today to get my film portfolio for college ready!   I really hate season 3 Abed, he's extremely frustrating. He seems more disconnected from reality than at the start.    I didn't win anything for it so my family seem to assume I'm upset but it was so great to see it in the cinema I don't really care. I just really wanted to share how happy I am with you guys. Have ye accomplished anything that you thought would be a life long goal?  [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7GakCW6MWY)  is the film if any of you are interested in watching by the way. It's not very long or very good but I enjoyed making it a lot. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7GakCW6MWY)   Yeah but that was the last creepy non-human thing he did right?   It seems pretty obvious that Abed has actually changed a lot since the start of the series, something that wasn't that obvious in series 3. Now he smiles and laughs a lot more and seems to have developed a very serious relationship with Annie. With Troy it never felt like he was really friends with him and understood what that meant but now Abed has grown a lot.  I can't wait to see how much he changes in the future season/seasons.    Maybe the movie will be about the group travelling back in time and placing the Greendale flag in a bunch of places.   First time I heard a character in CBB, I had no idea it was character for so long and I was freaked out I hadn't heard of this city if big people. Listening to it now I feel so stupid.   Question. I wear headphones a lot but listen at an extremely low level. Does this make the chances of this happening much lower or is it about the constant noise more than the volume?   Thank you so much!   I've heard mention of a podcast or commentary type thing for the show. I've done some googling but I can't find it. Can anyone explain what it is?   I did the title different for each one so at least one would be right.      In the bar they meet an Americian man. He's pleased to meet them and introduces them to a Spanish man and a German man. There is a Mexician man nearby but he's too nervous to introduce himself.   The six men decide to get a drink from the bartender who is a French man. Once seated together they begin to tell stories of their home countries, explain their cultures and their ways. The German man decided to head into the bathroom because he's quite thirsty. This subject confuses the Irishman, the Englishman and the Scottishman for they have never gone to the bathroom when thirsty before. The Americian man, the Spanish man and the German man laugh for this practise is very common in this bar.  All six head into the bathroom, inside there is an Africian man. The Americian man, the Spanish man and the German man begin to suck the blood out of the Africian man. The Africian man screams. Eventually all of the men join in.   After a few minutes the shy Mexician man wanders in and says "Is there any room for a little Mexician to suck some of this Africian mans blood."  The American man says "Sure what shall we build around this man." And then the English man says "Fencing."   Hasn't it been used way more recently than that? I remember Dan did it like twice in a recent show.   Yes, that's it! His craziness is so much better when he's not all in your face about it.   Chang was so good throughout both episodes. I really liked him during season 5 too right up until near the end. Chang as a villain is so much worse.   Jonathan Banks didn't make it in last year. I think they like to wait a year before putting them in.   As anyone from outside the U.S. gotten one?        	47
                   With a scant six months left until the next Dragon*Con, I have begun working on my costume for this year. My question is this: who else will be cosplaying and what will you be going as? I'm working on a rather convincing Battlestar Galactica uniform, myself. Yes, of course I mean the reimagined series.                           I have no idea about this one, guys. I built a playlist on a USB drive (all files are MP3s and have worked on my 360 before) and when I plugged it in today to play New Vegas without having to deal with Johnny Guitar, the music player refused to recognize any of my music files, giving me this error code. I've tried everything the prompt suggests and I've got nothing. Any advice?            I need to know the best Android phone on AT T in a relatively short amount of time, as I just found out I'm getting a new phone and time is of the essence. Help!                     Just an idea. It seems that all the colleges in Hall County are closed for the snowpocalypse in Hothlanta, and the highways are likely to be too icy for rural /r/Atlanta subscribers to make it to anything that would go on down there. Are there any Gainesville, Oakwood, or Flowery Branch redditors who would like to have a meetup?

However, through it all I had Reddit - a fun site suggested to be by one of my best friends a few months prior. This year would have been a nightmare without the fantastic community and amusing links that this site has to offer.   As we head into 2011, I can only hope that every Redditor has a wonderful year and the best of fortune and health. So thanks again, Reddit. You're the top!  -train_subject1458               There was a video submitted here not too long ago and I seem to have lost it, g-ents.

That's the question folks. If, per chance, you believe homeopathy DOES work, I'd love to hear how.  For disclosure's sake, I do not believe in it.   It was yet another great con, huh? I do hope more redditors find this subreddit and next year we can plan something awesome.      Greetings Reddit. It's story time.   A few months ago, I had a fairly complicated surgery that required an extensive recovery. I persevered, however; by maintaining that I would be able to go to Dragoncon, my absolute most favourite convention ever, and room with a woman whom I absolutely adore and hang out with some great friends. I pinned all of my hopes during recovery on enjoying four days in the heart of Atlanta in a state of constant nerdgasm. This was not to be.  Tonight, at the close of the first day of the convention, I have gotten ill and must return home. I feel absolutely horrible and I needed to vent. Thanks for reading, Reddit. I don't give a shit how you vote, I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with shit like this lately. I know it isn't the biggest thing in the world to lose sleep over, but this is literally the sole thing that kept me even mildy sane over the past few months.            Who's going, what are you going as, and where should the redditors meet? For what it's worth, I'll be the Soviet amputee roaming around the con. Shouldn't be too common a costume. I don't think.  EDIT: Since no one has proposed a Reddit meeting place, may I propose the lobby of the Hyatt Regency on Saturday at some point to be agreed upon?  EDIT 2: As Ketchupgoddess pointed out, "There is already a Reddit/Fark meetup scheduled for the main lobby of the Hilton on Saturday at 1 pm." Be there or else!      As the title says, I enjoy Russian music of the Soviet period. While I do not identify as a Communist, I think their aesthetics and music were impressive and, while shallow and transparent; are certainly more pleasing than the rubbish on the radio these days. Ask me anything!                  I've been having an issue with my WASR 10. I got it yesterday as a get well present from my father, and I have yet to shoot it. It's brand new, sealed in box. My problem is that the military issue double stack magazine it comes with is a tight fit into the receiver.   If it helps, this is a GP, no ban WASR-10, so it's not like I have to use single stack mags or anything. I can tell, based on the 'arrow in triangle' stamp on the receiver, that this rifle is made from former military parts. It also came with the Tapco G2 trigger group installed.  Other than this mag problem (which doesn't completely prevent me from inserting the mag, it just makes it an annoyance) I love the thing and can't wait to get well enough to shoot it.                                    So, I decided to be the pro-gun guy in a thread in the general reddit. This is, of course, a terrible idea, but I felt it was warranted. Now, people are downvoting me without even bothering to engage me in a serious debate about firearms. Could someone comment and at least make it appear as if I'm not some lone gun freak?  [Here is the comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/caste/shooting_spree_in_uk_leaves_12_dead/c0ra6vr)  EDIT: Thanks to everyone who has upvoted, but a serious debate on the effectiveness of British gun laws has yet to arise. The karma was not my issue. My problem with the post lay in the lack of discussion.          Does anyone here know the lyrics to Adrian Rollini's song "Sweet Madness?" It was recorded, I think, some time in the 1920's-1930's and the song is firmly stuck in my head. I know it to be completely distinct from the Ari Koivunen and Joyce Collins songs, if that helps at all.            Age: 20  Sex: Male  Location : Due to ongoing arguments with the alleged "Church" of Scientology, I will go no further than stating Georgia.  Occupation : Student  Hobbies/Interests : Science, science fiction, the Internet, old jazz, literature, anime, firearms, and gaming.  What websites do you find most useful : Well, Reddit of course. I also frequent wikipedia and (until my friends leave it) Facebook.  Favourite music/movies: I'm really into the Ink Spots right now, and my favourite film of all time might be Hitchcock's Notorious. I also enjoy early George Lucas and, more modern, I liked The Invention of Lying.  Nature of your disability: Spina Bifida of the L2 vertibrae. Right leg amputation. Solitary kidney. Fortuitously, I lived far in excess of the doctors' original estimations and didn't have to have any form of potentially brain damaging fluid shunts which are so common with my condition.  Were you born disabled: Yes.  Has disability had an impact on your spiritual life, if you have one: I am an atheist. I don't think it has anything to do with my disability, I just don't find the Judeo-Christian concept of an omnipotent, omniscient *AND* loving god to be at all logical.  Are you easily offended by disability jokes : Offended? Ha! I make them all the time!  How active are you in the disabled community: This is my first real activity in the community.  How do you deal with getting more attention than the rest of your family: I just do. I mean, no one is bothered about it, even when I ask. Either they're great liars or they don't care. If they don't care, why should I?  Do you ever have dreams where you aren't disabled at all: Not really. I think it's because I've always been disabled.  Have you ever damaged someone who was trying to help you: Yes, but I'd rather remain private on that one if suits everyone just fine.  Tell us about the time you most shameless exploited your disability to get something: Every year, I go to dragoncon - a regional sci-fi convention. Now, the able bodied amongst us have to wait for hours on line to get their tickets. Me? I take my friends straight through admissions with my mighty feeb powers!  How do you cope with well-meaning idiots: Grin and bare it. After all, they're trying, aren't they? That's better than apathy or outright hatred.  What is your most-developed talent: My writing. I used to play trumpet, but I've fallen out of practice.  What would you like the people around you to do differently: Nothing, really. I mean, nobody really treats me like I'm disabled, so I don't care. Sure, strangers try to be polite and hold doors for me, but I think it could be much worse.  Best piece of advice you can pass on: Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.  I hope that my filling this out will encourage any lurkers to tell their stories. We, the mods, have set up this questionnaire for the benefit of this subreddit and its users, and we hope that you all enjoy it.   I was born with Spina-Bifida, fairly minor, though I am confined to a chair. I also have severe scoliosis which resulted in one of my kidneys failing to form. Further complications meant that I later lost my leg (not that it was really an issue, as the leg refused to respond to any nerve stimuli) when I was 5.  Anyway, I was quite fortunate in that I didn't have to have a shunt performed and I never required too much care or assistance. I am also fortunate in that I am self sufficient and that having no use in my legs has given me pretty good upper body strength. Anyway, that's the extent of my disability - for all of its pros and cons. Has anyone got anything similar?   Based on an idea in an AMA, I've created a subreddit for disabled redditors to talk about themselves. I call it Oddly Normal, and I hope it serves the community well.  http://www.reddit.com/r/oddlynormal/   Based on an idea in an AMA, I've created a subreddit for disabled redditors to talk about themselves. I call it Oddly Normal, and I hope it serves the community well.   http://www.reddit.com/r/oddlynormal/   Is anyone here good with graphic design? I've got photoshop, but I'm not too good with it.   I need some more things to do in the greatest game ever made. I am also looking for exceptionally high quality addons.                           So, I have the McAfee virus package and I think that it's responsible for my browsers not working. Steam and Skype seem to work just fine, but Chrome and Firefox will only function intermittently. What do I do about this?            Go ahead, ask away!                                             I, for one, would love this feature. A redditor could block users who spam post a lot and could also do away with users whose posts they find bland and uninteresting.    I am 19, live in the Deep South, am a sworn enemy of Scientology and have only one leg... and it doesn't work! I'm generally pretty upbeat about life, am getting my degree and am now here to answer the insatiable curiosity of Reddit.  EDIT: Thanks for all of the questions! I'm really glad I did this.                        I'm at wit's end, reddit. I really like her, I'm not sure, as I've never cared for anyone so deeply, but I think I even love her. She said she wanted someone more serious, willing for marriage and to have a child. I would have done this for her, but alas, I could not keep the relationship. Is there any way to fix this? Or have I lost this forever? I need help, here.   I think a little bit of background may be necessary. In fact, I know it is necessary, as only like one guy on here knows me IRL.   So, I am 19 and due to the positively shite economy, I live with my parents. My parents always get to the mail due to the fact that I am in a wheelchair. Normally, a harmless (if suffocating) arrangement.  Now, the last time my parents found out I had a girlfriend, they were extraordinarily happy. Not the sort of happy that's fun, either. The sort where they throw fits and constantly interrogate you as to the location of the apple of your eye, the object of your desires, she who hung the moon for you. To go through this again, dear Reddit, is an unacceptable proposition.  I had gone to dragoncon with the last girl I dated, and we both decided to keep it professional. We're friends, we decided, nothing more. Soon after, a good friend from high school decided to ask me out. She is extremely pretty and has always been extremely kind to me. I would be most foolish to decline. The issue is, however, her mother is the extremely controlling sort who speaks little English and insists that her daughter not date, so I rarely get to see her.   NOW, the point. For Christmas, she decided to mail me my present. For all I know, it could be something extraordinarily embarrassing that could only be from a girlfriend. If my parents discover this, I would have to have yet another relationship out in the open. It's not like I'm ashamed or anything, all my friends know.   Anyway, I beseech thee, Reddit. What should I do!?  EDIT: I am abundantly aware of my affinity for the comma and my propensity towards run-on sentences. I also have pictures of both of us, should you need them.  ANOTHER EDIT: Wow, you guys are great. I was expecting this to languish for days without any reply. Imagine my surprise to find so much advice so quickly!  STILL ANOTHER EDIT: Pics were requested.  ME: http://imgur.com/gDhBX Sorry, but it's a couple of months old and my most recent. My camera's been a bit shit lately. I'm the one in the pic who isn't Malcolm McDowell.   RESULT: Due to the wise council of my fellow redditors, I have decided to man up and just put it on the table. I shall tell them and get it over with whilst informing them that they have a tendency to be rather annoying in their querying. I thank you all very much for your input.             I mean, really. This is ridiculous. I come to reddit to read about things that matter. Tangible, real things. Not some rich athlete smashing his expensive SUV. That doesn't affect me or the real world. It is not legitimate news. It is a product of our celebrity obsessed culture and a symptom of society's degradation. I expect this to get downvoted. Let it come.  EDIT: Obvious exception to this post. Although, ideally I'd like to not even have to make it.   Can we just cringe at the fact that it was made into a movie, shut up about it, and move on with our lives? Bram Stoker's rolling in his grave as it is, guys. This is simply ludicrous. That is all.   Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/9p8eo/scientology_may_be_opening_in_my_county_how_can_i/  The happy news is that the building permit was denied. Fliers were handed out in my community detailing the crimes of the cult, letters were written to the county council members, and members of the appropriate city councils. I had other (legal) tactics for each step of the construction should it have come to that, but thankfully they were stopped. I and my friends in the area remain vigilant, but for now my county is free of the cult's taint and we can all breathe a little easier around here.   I would like to thank my fellow redditors as well as the whyweprotest and Chanology forums for all of their help. We have won this battle, and the war shall be ours!   This is just a poll I made, nothing more, nothing less. I'm trying to solve the ages old debate...   I just don't get it. Our government has been running out of control for years, regardless of who's in charge. Congress is beholden to the issues of companies, not the needs of the citizenry. No matter which party we have, it gets worse each year.   Meanwhile, our culture is degrading at an alarming rate. Music is nowhere near as classy as it once was, movies are becoming unwatchable by and large, and modern literature is often better used as firewood. No longer are virtues such as loyalty and love extolled by the media, no no. Now It's all about who can fuck more or make more money, and having an intellect makes you almost a target for ridicule. Furthermore, the gullibility of society is increasing, fundamental religions are gaining headway, even cults such as scientology are reporting increased membership.  Tell me, what hope is there for the species? Would I feel so depressed about this if I lived in Europe or something? Help!  Sorry if I rambled, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for your patience, if you made it through this.   The Cult, I have heard, is considering opening a branch near where I live. (I cannot say exactly where, I want to avoid Fair Game after all.) I want a legal way to oppose them. I've considered writing members of the local government and detailing Fair Game, Snow White, Freakout, et al. and this seems to be my only real option.   I've also heard that Scilons shut down personality tests if you flash a Guy Fawkes Mask (USEFUL!) and thankfully, masked protest is legal here. I feel as if I'm up against a corner here. I love my hometown, I don't want it to suffer under Scientology. I need all the help I can get in this matter. I don't care what people believe, but Scientology is, as an organisation, pure unadulterated evil. HELP, REDDIT!   EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your advice. This is all very helpful. Keep it coming, friends! If I am successful in this, I hope to organise. Perhaps I can make a page, telling people how to keep the cult from integrating into their hometowns. It is my hope that eventually, through efforts similar to mine, we can stop the spread of this cult. It's a lofty goal, but hey, it can't hurt to try right? Unless I get SP'd.  EDIT: Co$ was denied a building permit. This is a joyous time!   It's just... the whole site seems to have a rather anti-US military stance. Has anyone ever considered what would happen if we hadn't bailed out the world in WWII? Or if we hadn't collapsed the Soviets? Or if we weren't cleaning up the terrorist filth? It's ugly work, and the methods are somewhat cruel, but the ends justify the means. Always.  As I await the inevitable shitstorm that is to follow my comparatively radical world view, I ask you to consider a world where the Nazis won WWII, where the Soviet Union never collapsed or perhaps a world where Islamic Fascism reigns supreme and everyone is subject to Shari'a law. Imagine a world without the US military and it's means and methods... It's not pleasant. You need us, world. More than you could possibly know.  Thank you for your time.   	153
 Sandra?    If I lost a camera with all my personal pictures on it, I would love for someone to try and return it. I guess you think the OP should just wipe it and keep it?   I don't know...the extra 30 bucks a month I make from it sure comes in handy...;-)    Poor grammar.  Darn skools n-e-ways.    As much as you can under your circumstances. Even a short paragraph is a good start if it's all you have time for. More time? Keep going until you can't.  One of the biggest hurdles in writing is finding the time. (at least for me)   Want to crack a safe? Done  Life of crime? Easy  Save lives? Perfect! Can deflect bullets...more anything. All by thinking.  Choices would be unlimited.    Unlimited telekinesis. Really, not much else after that.   Flying - Make yourself fly.  Need anything, poof you have it.    Google...Pokemon Online Multiplayer.   Receive answer.   Tada!    You...do not have a pre-teen daughter.   I would like this as well. I have a bunch just sitting around...   I would be a person that makes torpedoes out of scorpedoes, and that would be awesome!   Blood...She wanted more.   I can only speak for myself, but I try to keep my descriptions limited. When I read others books and they start to get all flowery with their writing I tend to just skip ahead. I like to form the scene in my own head and I trust my readers to be able to do the same.  Now, that being said, it is ultimately up to you how much description you add. Just be sure to get some good beta readers, and trust them if they say you don't need those four pages describing a chair.   It seems Amazon has finally realized that my collection of short stories have been free everywhere else but on their site, grab it now before they mess up and put it up again for $100 or something crazy like that.  http://www.amazon.com/Collection-Short-Stories-ebook/dp/B007Y2MN48/ref=sr_1_4?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1368757166 sr=1-4 keywords=jamie+heppner   Yet...   Poverty? What's that? (Stuffs his -will write for food- sign behind his back)   I am happy to say, this is completely raw, all writing, no editing. But it was my first sentence, and is subject to change.   Thanks :-)    Okay, first 3 lines...but...  The mirror lay in broken shards randomly strewn across the polished stone floor. This was the end. I had no escape left to me.   It's my current, almost finished, WIP.   It was public, and yep, massively downvoted.    Go ahead, or "go ahead and"  i = I  Doesn't = Don't (This is the correct way to get down votes!)    Ever do any beta reading? Or would you be interested in works in advance of publication for the purpose of honest feedback? I am in need of random strangers that would have no reason to -spare my feelings-.    I was considering opening my laptop and start writing some more, but I only had 45 mins...what do you read (listen to)?   Kids always wake up way before me...no morning time here.   I tell my wife to slow down on the cleaning and enjoy life more...she doesn't listen either.   I personally am enjoying the silence right now...not a single noise I am not making...so nice.      Latest one I am working on is entitled Mirror Thief. The main character can enter and exit the world in side a mirror.   A book cover for one of my works!    One does not simply -drive- into Mordor.    Just came to post the same thing, it's old news, still glad it happened to him, but old news the same.   I don't get a ton of random stranger complements, my wife says women flirt with me often, but I guess I don't see it. However, the few times I can recall a woman telling me they thought I was (something) I can say I was flattered, and I didn't think any more of it. But it doesn't happen often enough to remember more details.   Not to mention a male perspective is too often skewed by inconsistencies.    Perhaps not so much a hit and run as a...shared moment in time.    I can see that, but would you take offense if no-one said anything, ever? I haven't even owned a trench coat in years!  In all fairness, as another commenter said, this works just as well as a woman speaking to a man...Of course, most men would take it completely the wrong way and think a woman is reading to go all the way or something...   Ahhh! But a persons perspective changes everything. I honestly think most models are only mildly attractive if at all, I can see a mother smiling at a child, her hair a mess her clothing tossed and no makeup, yet think she is stunning. Does this make sense?   Yes...the internet can be a terrible medium for an open discussion sometimes. This was just a question I had rolling around in my head today when I saw a beautiful woman, natural beauty, not the purely painted kind. She was married as well, as I had helped her husband earlier...just a thought, no intent.  I also thought that, when did it become wrong to do something like this...were we always so afraid?  Sometimes I think too much.    Whew, but I still don't think I will randomly say it, cept to my wife.   I hope so, but I don't know for sure...didn't add the sarcasm smiley. :-)    How can this give offense? Do you wear makeup? Do you hair? Is it only for yourself...? Serious questions, I am honestly not trying to offend.   So if the person wondered away never to be seen again, this would be even more frightening to you? Or...?   I can understand that completely, that's why I am stressing the random/stranger/one moment aspect of it all.   I can't say I know that glint, but as a man myself it may be hard for me to know if I have it or not...I will ask my wife, she will know :-)    Thank you, I live in a smaller town, if I don't know the person, I probably know someone who does. But the thought has remained, why should it be wrong if it's completely innocent.   Any situation can be turned creepy by the wrong person, it's more the entire random, genuine moment, and finished...   Yes, I could understand the difference, I mean in a complete, random stranger, brush encounter, never to be seen again...   If you don't mind answering? Why? I often see women I think are completely stunning, I have no interest in them in other ways, so I keep my thoughts to myself. But why would it offending, I am generally interested. Also, as a side note, I have a scene like this in one of my writings and wondered at the realism of it, since I don't see people doing it.      You do have to be in the USA though... :-(   Thank you. It's a tough racket to get into.   When the car is not running, I assume you read her other comments, the battery is not being charged. She also stated this wasn't the first time, and she knew it should have been replaced long ago.   If the car had died, while running, than yes...replace the alternator.   Do some reading before you randomly comment like this, it only makes you look like...well, you said it best.    It's *Band* and no...I don't mind them being hidden at all.    I would settle for more book sales, but I will take the cookie for now. ;) Thank you.    Yes, I really do. Getting the wife to help can be problematic though, and I need to keep them away from windows (and the kids). But it does help with a level of realism in sword fighting scenes.    I have a couple of swords in my collections just for this exact purpose.   *This.   For my action scenes it does help to think it through and sometimes get up to mimic the motions. Anything to bring the realism to my readers.    Here is an article to help you understand.   http://m.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/first-google-glass-users-cant-sell-or-even-loan-their-1C9506946  There is still a lot that's hush hush with them.   Google glasses can not be traded or resold. If you do, they can remotely disable them. In theory, this pair can no longer be disabled.   I too have been trapped by the wonderings of....squirrel!   I make sure that if I am in a reading stint I keep my writing to a minimum, and visa versa. I guess you could say, I too, am influenced by what I am reading at the moment.      Now that I can see as a better reason to write here.   If 1.50 won't even buy a coffee to fuel the writing = no point.   But, 1.50 will now feed you for a week...   I think in this instance the old adage -you get what you pay for- does truly apply here. For the most part the people hiring here seem to want things fast and dirty.  Mostly dirty.   I can't stop reading them! It's like watching a train wreck. Paying 1.50 per hour for you to write erotica...must write at least 2 stories a day...I can make more than that just writing my own stories.    TIL: People expect writers to work for nothing.   5000 words a day min for 15 dollars? 25 dollars for a 60k book edit?   Ouch.    He would have gotten away if he just pulled up his pants...   Damn my memory!!!   Damn my memory! Demon's souls! My bad...   Yeah, not the last boss. Not even close.   Please hold for a very important message.   Hit me with a PM and I will email you a PDF tomorrow night. :-)    It actually snows very little up there, mostly just wind blowing it around.   I say... Dead.      Read the comments. There were none made before today. People make pages all the time, I even have a few. It's very simple to change the name.   Obviously. And this post has been made by many others, they have been shown the same thing.   Yes, the page was, it was renamed today. Anyone can do this.   Really? Right off the front page?    Welcome, please feel free to tell your friends as well. More the merrier!   If your check engine light comes on, you should take it to a mechanic. I would leave the pets behind when you do...   They are now free! Feel free to grab them, and let your friends know as well. Thank you.    Once you DL them, they are yours to read. If you should erase them at a later date, you can re-dl them at no charge. Enjoy!      Thank you! I will post it up there instead. I searched for the right place to put this. Guess I didn't search far enough.   Everyone has a gift and it would be a true waste if you were to erase yours. I am happy to have been able to share in the experience of your gift. Keep it up.   I wouldn't mind seeing something like this. I try to add what I can when people ask, but I have to agree that some of the requests are a touch daunting for the time I have available.   This is pretty clinical. You need to drop some details and add some spice. You have to give me (your readers) something to say, hey, I have to grab this story!     You find any, let me know. I make less than you do and my wife and I are sitting here right now trying to find ways to come up with more money. I write books on the side and try to sell them, but I don't even have enough time to push them properly.  It's a no win situation and I wish you the best.   I just went through rotator cuff surgery. Torn tendon.  Doesn't sound as bad as yours does. I was told 6 weeks in a sling, I was out in 4. I was told 6 months before lifting anything, it's been 10 weeks and I am at about %80 strength. Gaining mobility and strength every week. Slow and steady here.  Did it hurt?   Hell yah.  It's better now though...and I don't have any of the pain that I had before. I wouldn't worry about it. If it hurts now, you will deal with it later. The end result is worth it.   I am not a DR, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night, how about you go see a real doctor instead of asking for help online?   You know, like real medical advice?   Time itself.   But they are always making more lego, so...63...64...65...   350 words and 19 of them are wheel or wheelbarrow...I almost thought I knew what you were trying to say here, but then I lost it.   I'm sorry.  If his was meant to be abstract writing, I believe you went a little too far from the edge, and fell off.    First thing I think I can help you with is...  With reddit it, it erases your formatting. The best way to get it back is to do a double carriage return. That will help make this patch more readable. I had the same problema couple days ago.  Second thing of note, the boy was supposed to be scared, but he sure was talkative. As a personality trait, most people when afraid clam up. A better way to make this come alive is to keep your sentences shorter, and more choppy, when he is speaking.  Other than those little things, I like what I see. You do create a not traditional mermaidimage, but it works.   I am a big fan of the -show don't tell- writing style, and your first line starts me on an edge. I can understand the need to tell if you are trying to keep a story as short as possible, but perhaps some more description would spice up the writing.  "The trees surrounded me. Their canopy so thick it was impossible to tell if it was night or day."  Now, that's a simplistic take on what I see, I could be completely wrong if your intent was the opposite.  Just my two bits.   I can try to dredge up some sites. If you do a search on reddit I am fairly confident you will find multiple posts on the subject.  The biggest downside is the time investment, review sights can take months (or longer) to get to your work. Coordinating it all to come together for a big send off is a big commitment.  In case you are wondering, I learned most of this because I made the same mistake on my first releases. Live and learn though.   Reviews can make or break your work. It's best to give out free copies to reviewers and cross your fingers they like it. It's a very hard thing to do, but honest reviews with ups and downs are worth more than gold.   People don't like taking a chance, even at free.  My best month I had almost 5k free downloads on my works, it resulted in 3 reviews, and one of those was 1 star because he didn't get around to reading it.  #bangsheadonwall    I wish you the best, but for the best exposure, you really need to start the promo at least one month in advance. The more time you have to get ready, the better.  You need to have reviews up and ready.  It's best to have as many blogs as possible showing his work and having interviews or at least something up.  On twitter, you should be doing a contest, a giveaway, something to pull in more readers.  On facebook , goodreads, LinkedIn, and as many other sites as you can get, you need to do pre-posts weeks in advance. Try to drag in as much anticipation as you can.  Local book stores, some hate indie's others are quite open to all others, run a giveaway if you can, and if they let you, try to have some posters up to promote your release day.  Sorry, this is off the top of my head, and typed on my tablet, I am sure I missed a thing or two, but good luck regardless!   This is incredible, tell your Grandpa that I applaud him. If he does decide to publish it, make sure he does his research if he chooses indie publishing.    It was my intent to have an overtone of a slowly fading beat, the heart. Perhaps I went a little to strong with it. Thank you.   If you lose your internet, you can't play the game. Even if it is a solo game. Like Sim City was/is.   The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.  Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.  The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.  The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.  Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.  Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.  She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.  Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.  The rain stopped.       Thank you all for the input. My wife interupted me tonight, but I managed to get a minor 500 words down. It's better than nothing, and a start in what I believe is the right direction.                        	110
 This guy is a collector who makes his collection of cars past and present viewable on his personal website. His taste is far different from the Sultan of Brunei, Jay Leno, or Paul Walker, so don't be disappointed if that's what you were expecting. It's an good mix of cars, but his favorites appear to be Cadillacs, Corvettes and Trans Ams with ultra low miles (often under 10,000, occasionally under 1000) A lot of the cars are ones you don't generally expect to see in showroom condition.

I'm thinking that this collection as a whole is probably one you either love or hate.  - http://www.mcsmk8.com/cadillacs/mycads.htm - current cars - http://www.mcsmk8.com/PAST-CARS/MAVICA.HTM - sold cars   Crush the Nissan (ugliest of the three and yes I know none of these vans are built for style), Joyride the Chevy, Daily drive the Ford   - Mercedes-Benz SEC, BMW 8 Series - Hard to believe the design of one is over 30 years old and the other is nearly 25. They both still look up to date. The 8 Series is slightly dated by it's hideaway lights though. Nice that both are hardtops. - Anything currently produced by Mitsubishi (at least the ones sold in the US) already looks and feels like it's 10 years old.    80's Full-size American luxury sedan edition: Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, Lincoln Town Car   Audi RS6/BMW M5/Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG                  Malaise Era cars, built by the American manufacturers between roughly 1973-1983 have long been unloved by most enthusiasts. At this time, 5 mph bumpers and smogged engines with lower HP were enforced by the EPA and NHTSA, leading to the end of the muscle car era. I have been seeing a small, but growing number of them at car shows and televised high end auctions. As younger enthusiasts become able to afford a classic, older cars become more expensive, and the market's tastes change, could these cars soon be taken seriously as collector's items. 20-30 years ago four door sedan and station wagon versions of popular cars built before 1973 were just parts cars to many, but today there is demand for drivable examples of such cars. Even earlier, Detroit cars of the 50's-60's were seen as gaudy, tacky relics, much like the Malaise cars are viewed today, but it took a shorter amount of time for a renewed interest in them to occur. Some of what were the least valuable 10-15 year old US built cars in say, 1977 can currently be purchased for the same price or more then some of the most expensive brand new ones of that year. In addition, a lot this era's Japanese and European cars that were just as unreliable and underpowered when new attract a lot of hype. Today, clean, low mile, unmolested examples of Malaise models can be purchased for dirt cheap compared to their older counterparts and those who don't mind the stigma attached to the era can take advantage of this.   It isn't, but is written by some people. I thought it was one up until I was 10, so if I hadn't finally noticed the red underlining it on MSWord, I might still be one of them. New words are added to the dictionary every year, the English language has changed slightly during the past 100 years, and English is not a well regulated language such as French, so I wouldn't be surprised.   When I say "neither give a damn" I'm imagining the situation probably involving two cars that are POS junkers, perhaps with prior damage to begin with.      Still see a few on the road from time to time in the shitty part of town   I've seen some of such Japanese econoboxes turned into drift cars and tuners. These are usually cheap, simple to work on, plentiful, lightweight, RWD, platforms which are easy to do engine swaps on and easy to find parts for. This is from the 70s but in the vein of what has been done to some 80s imports: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJMAy7Z6zys   That's the point of the question, what cars do the commenters think clash with the idea of a classic car, despite their age.      - Ford Panther Platform - In particular, the Mercury Marauder with its GNX style blacked out trim, and the few Crown Victoria Police Interceptors that haven't been beaten into the ground by then. - Pontiac G8 GXP - The best of the last - Cadillac STS-V, CTS-V, and Escalade - Cadillac got to be cool again. - AMG Benzes - Depreciation is a bitch. A W220 S55 will give you supercar performance on a used minivan budget, so if you are expecting these cars to appreciate in price someday, pick em' up now. - BMW M3, M5, M Coupe - Same as above. The M Coupe was an oddball too. - Mercedes R-Class - This is a wild card. Not that sporty, sexy, or cool in any kind of way, but sold in very small numbers and is destined to be forgotten. Less than 100 AMG models were produced too. Could go down in history as a "Mercedes Edsel" of sorts.         A couple years after it came the 1970 1/2 Falcon, which was essentially a low trim Fairlane.      I understand that she wasn't in her right mind and since this was some time ago and happened when I was still a child, I may remember some details differently than how they actually were. This also didn't happen at the establishment they eventually decided on.      Not as creepy as some of the other encounters here, but freaked me out at the time. When I was 11 or 12 years old, my grandfather began suffering dementia. Because of this, my parents began looking into nursing homes for him. I had to come along and visit each one.  At one of the homes we visited, which was not the one my dad eventually picked, the terrifying experience took place. This particular facility, like most of the others we considered specialized in caring for seniors with mental or physical handicaps such as my grandfather. One of the residents was a hunched over woman in her early 80s at the least with a lazy eye, messy, matted hair, messy clothes, and crooked, rotten, teeth in the worst shade of yellow I had ever seen. Right in front of my parents, she walked towards me out of nowhere and said that I was her son. She proceeded to grab me and try to drag me away, her hold and grip was surprisingly strong. She argued to my mom by saying "he's mine I saw him first!". I didn't know what was going to happen until one of the nurses came by and yelled at her to quit it.  I am still unsettled and reminded of this experience when I see heavily disheveled seniors. When I had to visit the home we picked in the end on weekends, there were a few residents who said strange things to me and I saw lash out, relive past trauma, and break social mores, but none came close to being as threatening, creepy, and gross as the "he's mine I saw him first" lady.   Looks like a gimp mask      I agree with you, I don't understand why the Big Three dropped their old iconic nameplates. Why does Lincoln need to make MKXs instead of Continentals, Cadillac to make XTSs instead of DeVilles, and Buick have to make LaCrosses instead of Electras. These were well recognized cars that developed a reputation and symbolized something.   - Mercedes-Benz W140, W220, W210, W211, pre facelift W212 and SLS AMG - 1998+ Ford Crown Victoria - BMW 8 Series - Most Bentleys - Lexus LS400   The cars live up to their namesake at varying degrees, but the Dodge Monaco was a large, mid-priced full-size car which clearly wasn't made for racing the Circuit De Monaco, and no Pontiac Bonneville is likely to set a land speed record. Chrysler's Newport, New Yorker, and Fifth Avenue, and the Chevrolet Malibu are named after locations in the United States with a connotation for luxury, though New York City was quite run down and crime riddled during much of that nameplate's life.   Thanks for the reminder that I should research what I post beforehand. Assumed it was in Italy because of the Maserati Sebring, which came before the Chrysler.   Why are so many American cars, particularly of the 60's-80's named after cities, towns, or racetracks in Europe where they are likely seldom seem and when few if any European attributes are seen in such cars? Examples include Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Monza, Cadillac Seville, Buick Riviera, Pontiac LeMans, Ford Granada, Lincoln Versallies, Chrysler Cordoba, and Dodge Monaco. The names have a good ring to them, but how many Dodge Monacos have ever been owned by residents of the wealthy principality, and has a single Chevy Monza ever raced on the Italian track bearing it's name? There are few cars where the reverse has been done that I can think of, Ferrari California, Ferrari Daytona, Maserati Sebring, and Yugo Florida.   I have seen many videos on the counterfeit coins from China and Eastern Europe, browsed what is available on alibaba, and found some suspicious coins on eBay. Now that you mentioned it, I also remember going to a dealer where there was a PCGS graded contemporary counterfeit Morgan for sale, plus similar items online occasionally, but my question is more focused on paper money.   A new president      As the title says, it is currently illegal to possess, sell, or distribute counterfeits of US coins or currency which are currently legal tender (Confederate, Colonial, and other obsolete counterfeits can be freely owned). So, if the US dollar ever becomes obsolete in the future, will examples of counterfeit Federal Reserve Notes, United States Notes, and Silver Certificates etc. which had previously been prohibited begin to come out of the woodwork after being "in the shadows" for up to several decades or even well over a century by then and start to show up at Numismatic dealers and on sites like eBay? I thought of this because I once visited a coin dealer which had a rogues gallery of fake silver dollars, gold bars, jewelry, and even a Series 1974 US five dollar bill. That confirmed to me that even if it is officially considered illegal to own such items, there must still be some floating around but away from circulation that the Feds haven't found yet.   There are some cars I see in their customized form more often than stock, and I often wonder about what perecentage of them are modified, and what percentage are still stock or close to stock. Examples include the Ford Model A coupe, 1940 Ford coupe, 1949 Mercury, Nissan Skyline (R32, R33, R34), Mazda Miata, as well as low trim versions of 60s-70s American coupes and convertibles which are often restored (cloned) to the specs and trim of a muscle car.   I hope the price doesn't attract any demo derby racers   - Marilyn Manson - Sex Pistols - GG Allin - Wendy O. Williams - Iggy Pop - Alice Cooper - Anal Cunt - Cannibal Corpse - Motorhead         Love these old box Panthers. Saw a pristine pre facelift LTD Crown Vic in burgundy with a white top today. The 88' facelift was really a styling downgrade.   - Ford Durango - Pontiac Phoenix - Nissan Axxess - Austin America - Subaru Brat   - Dodge St. Regis - Isuzu Axiom - Buick Apollo - Oldsmobile Omega - Mitsubishi Cordia         not many of these survive today and they weren't really popular when new.      1971-76 Big GM Convertibles usually go for under 15k, you can pick up a nice one for 8-10k. [1974 Buick LeSabre] (http://hooniverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1-089.jpg) [1975 Olds Delta 88] (http://www.mcecars.com/images/bank/88%20Convt%20112.JPG)      Mercedes-Benz put velour into their cars too, and many American car designs of that era were loosely Rolls-Royce influenced (Lincolns being an example).   Any car over 20 years old is probably going to be unreliable, unsafe, gas guzzling, and spartanly equipped by modern standards, but do you have sources or experiences which prove that ALL these cars were garbage even when new and should be removed from the history books?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czYUZOlclSo how does garbage make it to 1.3 million miles?   That was a compact   An explanation, perhaps.      Most people seem to think they are ugly or don't look twice at them, but I love the style of these types of cars. They usually look like elegant, cleanly styled designs to my eyes. Many are also tough as nails. Ford LTD Crown Victoria, Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Chevrolet Caprice Classic, Oldsmobile 98, and Buick Regal are some examples.   By 2008, a lot of the ones I saw already had peeling paint.         Not like David Reimer, intersex people, the fafafine, or transsexual kids. What would happen to an otherwise physically normal biological boy who was dressed as, treated as, and made to live as a girl at least up until age 18 and developed puberty as a male? Would other children and adults, as well as the child themselves be able to tell she is a he at an early age, just later on, or not at all, how would the child be affected by it, and has there ever been a case of something like this actually happening? I might also make another post later on asking about vice versa.      I would say the 1996-03 Mitsubishi Galant      Go for a GM B body or Ford Panther   I actually think this Magnum is quite a good looking car for its era. If I had to choose between one of them, a slightly older Dart, and a Plymouth Duster, I would without question choose the Magnum due to rarity and obscurity alone.   Such underrated cars. Not very fast for a "sporty" car but quite stylish.   I really like the second picture. It looks like you are in the Pacific Northwest or Northern California.      Hard to tell the standard Bonnevilles from the Bonneville Broughams, though I will assume the coupe with no sunroof is not a Brougham. I was able to easily identify the trim packages of the Grand Prixs in a previous post.   I actually like most of the RWD land yachts, mid sizers, and personal luxury coupes of this era. Some of my personal favorites include,  - 1973-76 Buick LeSabre - 1977-79 Pontiac Bonneville Brougham - 1978-80 Pontiac Grand Prix - 1979-87 Ford LTD Crown Victoria Coupe - 1977-79 Lincoln Town Coupe   It just usually seems like the automotive enthusiast mainstream gives little attention to anything that came out of Detroit during those years besides the Buick GNX, Fox Body Mustangs, and 2nd gen F-Bodies. When cars of those years besides the three I mentioned show up at car shows I often notice their presence either ignored by most patrons or met with derision by those who choose to speak out loud.         The yellow one is a Sunbird, my mom's first car.   German cars use planned obsolescence. Lease or buy a Mercedes or BMW and your safe as long as the warranty is good, but after that they generally become money pits unless you are willing to let them turn into turds.   Due to the increasing popularity of hybrids, electric cars, and diesels, as well as future CAFE standards, gas prices may actually go down because of decreased demand. But we also don't know what the political situation of the Middle East will be by then.   I would say that a Bonneville Brougham from 79' was a better looking car than that year's Cadillac, and had the most clean, refined look out of all the 77-79 big GMs.   The first row cars are all Grand Prixs, base, SJ, and LJ from up to down. The third row are all Bonnevilles. The two big cars in the fourth row are Catalinas, the smaller ones are LeManses. It kind of bothers me sometimes how people today seem to forget that Pontiac made cars other than Trans Ams in the 70s and 80s.         I think some of these might be interesting to see get stanced, -[1975 Nova](http://images1.americanlisted.com/nlarge/1976_chevrolet_nova_12018911.jpg) - [Eurosport VR] (http://i.wheelsage.org/pictures/chevrolet/celebrity/autowp.ru_chevrolet_celebrity_eurosport_vr_2.jpg) - [Buick LeSabre]  (http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/4/672/1829/39178414001_original.jpg?v=1)   I see a lot of E36 and E46 BMWs driving out of the subsidized housing development a few blocks away from me and around the neighborhoods that surround it. Most are either just plain beat or have been subjected to tasteless modifications like bling rims, fake M badges, and blacked out headlights. The 3s of these generations I see in the more affluent parts of town generally still look pretty close to new.   Interesting, never thought any cop cars came in the 4 door hardtop (pillarless) body style.    I hate seeing people turn these 70s Mopar barges into fantasy cop cars.   When today's cars eventually depreciate, deteriorate, and become beaters, how will they hold up. With their heavy use of plastics, flimsy metal, planned obsolescence, and electronic components I am not sure how economical it will be to keep say, a 2014 car in 2034 chugging along as "economical transportation".   That new GTO is actually a rebadged Holden.               This was GG Allin's first band, which him, his brother, and some friends formed shortly after he graduated high school in 1975.       At a show recently, I saw a young couple appreciating a car I also took a good look at but was not given a much attention by most of the other patrons. It was a pristine 1977 Buick Regal coupe. Also, when we were looking for a parking spot, I overheard a little boy asking his grandpa why the late 80s Honda Accord he drove him there in wasn't in the show.      At shows where the cutoff is 25 years I do see an increasing number of 70's and 80's cars (many of which appear to still be daily driven). I sometimes hear people complain out loud, but it is kind of nice to see this "new generation" of classics gaining recognition, rather than looking at the same ol' muscle cars and hot rods.   I was expecting a "Highlex" to be something like this. http://lexusenthusiast.com/2009/01/27/the-lexamino/      Hassanal Bolikiah, Sultan of Brunei is probably a good example of a car hoarder. He owns up to 5000+ cars, mostly exotics and high end luxury cars, including some concepts and custom built cars. They, in many cases have been neglected due to the number of cars and climate. During the 1990's at least, he was the biggest buyer of Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles. http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/03/the-sultan-of-bruneis-rotting-supercar-collection/   In some parts of the world, it must still be quite common. I've  traveled to the Bahamian island of Exuma, where the most common surnames belong to many, many residents and can be seen everywhere, on storefronts, in the local newspapers, and on the nametags of waiters.      I've seen pictures of that LTD. Head on, it looks more like a Chrysler Cordoba than anything else ever sold in the US, but the grill from that was likely also RR influenced.   I had a matchbox model of the Town Car shown above as a kid and for a long time thought it was a Rolls-Royce. I also had a Hot Wheels Chrysler 300 when I was a few years older which I thought was a Rolls or Bentley until I saw the actual car on the road. The 300 was not as crude of a model as the Lincoln, though. http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081228021146/matchbox/images/4/41/Lincoln_Town_Car_-_B6457cf.jpg   I see a loose Rolls influence in the Buick's roofline and grille, though there may be better examples I could have chosen. The later Silver Spirit and the Cadillac and Lincoln Town Car images I used share more similarities.   These two very different types of cars share similar styling cues. They are all big, boxy, bulky, and generally have four square headlights and a radiator grille. The roofline and grille, as well as other cues of the Silver Shadow (1967-80) appears to have influenced the 1977-90 GM B/C/D bodies and 79-91 Ford Panthers. This I guess was to make the cars more luxurious looking and keep up with the Europeans with little effort, kind of like a reverse of what Mercedes-Benz tried to do by adding fintails to their cars.

Perhaps this was to appeal to the American market and create an elegant yet understated and conservative look. The quad headlights, used mainly on US spec exports add greatly to the resemblance.  Rolls Silver Spirit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Silver_Spirit#mediaviewer/File:1982_Rolls-Royce_Silver_Spirit_front_right.jpg  The 1980+ Cadillac DeVille/Fleetwood, and the 1980-89 Lincoln Town Car which were respectively facelifted and introduced the same year as the Silver Spirit came into production featured a front end strikingly similar, but with less presence than the Rolls. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Cadillac_DeVille#mediaviewer/File:%2783_Cadillac_DeVille_(Auto_classique_VACM_Chambly_%2713).JPG  Town Car: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Town_Car#mediaviewer/File:1st-Lincoln-Town-Car.jpg The edges, roofline, and taillight assembly of the Lincoln are also vaguely Rolls like.  Some of the cars which came 1-10 years before the "box" era of American sedans also had a clear Rolls-Royce influence which was carried over, but not to the same extent yet. Continental Mark III: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Continental_Mark_III#mediaviewer/File:69MarkIIIa.jpg  The resemblance seems to be hiding in plain sight and Silver Spirits have always seemed to me like very ordinary looking cars for what they are. Also, the styling cues are similar but create a very different effect. The Rolls-Royce is unmistakably British, but the Cadillacs, Lincolns, Buicks, and Caprices all have the stance of an American turnpike cruiser. Also, both categories of automobile offer far different interpretations of luxury. The Rolls Royces and Bentleys are hand made, understated, ultra luxury rarities, while the American land yachts are mass produced, and often ostentatious. The materials were also different, a Rolls would often have real wood trim, fine leather, and alloy wheels, while a Lincoln would likely have fake wood, velour, faux wire wheels, and opera windows. So similar yet so different.   I realize our usernames are phonetically the same. I consider "You Hate me and I Hate You" to be one of GG's best, most catchy, and most recognized songs, so this username is the one I chose, not already knowing of yours.         The materials too made a difference, no Rolls, Benz, or BMW featured the kind of obvious fake wood, imitation wire wheels, and velour Detroit seemed to favor at the time.

No Dodge St. Regises   These Novas did have a loosely Euro inspired look      The Japanese do maintain their cars very well      Cadillac ATS, CTS, DTS, Lincoln Town Car, MKZ, Volvo S80 would be more obscure choices. Perhaps also higher mileage, Mercedes E, S class, BMW 5, 7 series, Audi A4, A6.   Late 70s early 80s Dodge Charger, Mirada, or Magnum   Just this year, first year R32 Nissan Skylines began turning 25. This means that they can now be imported to the United States. I was expecting to see a few out at car meets or on the road now that the weather is getting nicer. So far I have seen none. With the desirability and iconic status of the Nissan Skyline, I was expecting them to begin flooding the country, but perhaps most of them are on the west coast (I'm in NY metro).    "Quieter than a Rolls-Royce" was a tagline used in Ford's advertisements for the LTD.   I think that your 81 Newport deserves a better fate than being demo derbied. Only 3622 were produced that year, and less are around now. Hold onto it or fix it up, I'd buy it from you if I could. You may be in possession of a future collectors item.   Exactly what I forget to add when I was posting the cars I found. These are not new cars, they have all seen a lot of travel and will have rust, mechanical maladies, cosmetic issues etc., so be prepared for what can happen.

Four door sedans and some station wagons from the 50s-60s can generally be had for less than the same model in a coupe or convertible. Classic Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Mercurys, AMCs, ad Ramblers are also generally undervalued. Many American cars of the mid 1970's through the 80's also sell for far less than their older counterparts, but aren't seen as classics by all. Some classic Mercedes-Benz, Rolls, and Bentley sedans are also surprisingly cheap. You have a lot of options but it would be good to know what your price range is.   1985-91 GM C, H body cars. These include the Buick LeSabre, Olds 88/98, and Cadillac DeVille.   They both had mental illnesses, or appeared to, sang shocking, gory, or sexual lyrics, had unique on stage behavior, were outsiders in their scenes, and recorded much of their music in poor quality. Besides the traits of their music and performances, they were both individualists, drank heavily, and got in trouble with the law. Hasil and GG also never got the level of recognition they deserved IMO.  Here's an old documentary for those who don't know about him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDyxKLwQ-6I   Clips of GG during his early career are featured in this video. When I first heard this song, it sounded familiar.      For me it's large, boxy late 70s-80s American cars      Big 60s Pontiacs are among my favorites   Happy to see you haven't turned it into a GTO clone.   The music by them which I've heard seemed to be made solely for shock value, and to the point of ridiculousness. Edgy and boring seem like a strange combination.   This band was led by El Duce, who pioneered "rape rock" and were guests on Jerry Springer in the early 90s.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshanna_Lonstein_Gruss He began dating her while she was a 17 year old high school student, he was 38. The age of consent in NY is 17.   This was Joe Strummer's band before The Clash      Put the link up, thought I had cut and pasted it when I originally posted.   By then they are legal in some states, just ask Jerry Seinfeld.   I see 37 year old guys looking at 17 year old girls in that kind of way all the time, but I can tell how this would be a little different.   At 25 years old, a vehicle is eligible for historical license plates in most US states, classic car insurance if it is seldom driven, and may be imported without needing compliance modification if originally intended for an international market.   The paint looks good considering how bad everything else is   looks like a 1967 Chevrolet Impala fastback coupe      Not necessarily classic by most definitions other than age, but those corollas and civics have made it beyond what their lifespan was likely predicted to be. Japanese cars, American full size sedans, Mercedes Benzes, and Volvos do seem to make up the bulk of 25-35 year old cars I still see daily driven or used as beaters.   Looking for numbers, I still see some all the time, but more so when I have traveled to drier climates.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDFeZb2f9wg Extremely different from his later music. This has got to be the least "scumfuc" of any of GG's work.   Were you somewhere in the UAE?   The New Yorker of this generation had some of the most awkward looking rear doors (when opened) to hold it's opera windows. https://www.flickr.com/photos/that_chrysler_guy/7801108996/   The styling and performance seemed respectable for cars of that era and size, but like Dinahmoe said, Chrysler Corporation's financial troubles turned potential buyers off and negatively impacted quality control. The fact that the R platform was developed on a limited budget would explain why only 4 door sedans were available, no coupes or station wagons. Also, unlike the M-bodies which outlived them and became the new flagship sedans, these were true full size cars.   Anything else notable in there?   I have only ever seen one in person, a brown Gran Fury, but I couldn't get an up close look. Only about five have shown up in my searches of eBay, Craigslist and similar sites in the past four years. They seem to now be some of the most forgotten cars to ever come out of Detroit.   These would be the Dodge St. Regis, Plymouth Gran Fury, Chrysler New Yorker, and Chrysler Newport produced between 1979-81.   I love those two green Country Squires      I mean a very similar one to yours or someone who you were waiting for.  	162
 Agreed, they're just being open and honest about their sexism against men. However it does look like they want to make the existing gender justice gap even wider than it is at present.   I'd also love to hear the reply and appreciate you taking the time to challenge this. However, I certainly don't share your optimism about it being fixed.  The Greens started out as a somewhat idealistic but ultimately quite likeable party years ago. However, over the years they've gradually been infiltrated by groups for whom environmental concerns were secondary a best. These groups use the "green" label as a way of hiding or rebranding less palette able agendas such as communism and extremist feminism.  Unpleasant and idiotic feminist ideas are today deeply ingrained in the Green Party and the problem goes right to the top, with Lucas previously making a number of sexist statements and more recently carrying out ridiculous page 3 censorship stunts. I've challenged Lucas on her sexism several times in the past on her website, not only were my comments ignored they were also then censored too.  At the very least I don't see any chance if this policy being sorted out while Lucas remains in charge, though I'd live to be proved wrong.    I see a lot wrong with sentencing men and women differently  Without wanting to defend the Green party's blatant sexism, your sentence describes something that already occurs a lot of the time. Unlike feminist myths such as the "pay gap", the justice gap is a genuine phenomenon, and men receive significantly longer sentences than women for commuting exactly the same crimes. The entire justice system blatantly favours women at every single stage, not just sentencing, but in terms of the likelihood of being charged or even arrested for the crime, with district violence being a particularly notable example of this.  A couple of years back MP Philip Davies gave perhaps his best ever speech in parliament, completely all the myths about the justice system trying women badly and proving that the reality was the complete opposite of what many feminists were claiming. I strongly recommend people view or read his speech.  So, although the green party policy is sexist, disgusting and hateful, it is at least fairly honest, and arguably rather more so that the present situation.   These same feminists who only want to send men to prison usually pretend to favour shared parenting. However, in reality they actually tend to be the ones doing more than anyone else to scupper any attempts at introducing shared parenting legislation or any sorts of equal rights measures for fathers.   I'm not too sure how successful a complaint would be. She's not a BBC employee therefore under their rules she has more lee-way when it comes to saying disgusting things.   Quite surprising to see a show such as these address the issues of male dv victims in a genuine and fairly honest way.  I don't watch daytime tv but, can certainly recall this show as being fairly notorious for its misandry in the past (something that tends to be the case with countless other women' panel showss.  Anyway, the panel looked quite a bit different and somewhat younger than it used to be, so hopefully most of the worst offenders have lost their jobs and therefore the show isn't as much of a stain on tv broadcasting as it used to be.   If feminists think a lack of women in STEM fields cases discrimination with regards to healthcare then how the hell do they explain what's being going on with cancer research, treatment and care for the last 40 years?  Breast cancer has seen mass screening programmes, immense research efforts and patients getting by far the best care of any cancer patients.  Prostate cancer on the other hand has been severely neglected, virtually ignored at times and although things are slowly improving, these issues still persist to some extent even today. Arguments against funding prostate cancer research these days use the fact that the understanding of the disease is someway behind other cancers such as breast cancer. One of the main reasons such understanding is poor is because of the vast neglect seen in past years. Therefore cancer researchers are neglecting prostate cancer patients today, simply because they were also neglected previously!  If money had been spent sensibly and targeted at saving the most lives possible, then some of the billions we've spent on breast cancer would have gone elsewhere and more lives would have been saved.  We're not talking about a trivial points here either. Prostate cancer deaths are set to overtake those from breast cancer in the near future. The numbers involved and the disparities in funding mean we're talking about discrimination against men on an absolutely vast scale.   Someone in Canada made some nice posters a while back in response to these. They switched the genders and sometimes the topics too (such as false allegations). It caused quite a stir in the media.   Note the name at the bottom of these posters.  Vera Baird is a notorious radical feminist politician who was previously the MP in that area. She got kicked out by voters at the last election but she then stood for the role as police and crime commissioner, an election in which hardly anyone voted. She,s heavily involved in various awful feminist organisations and seems to have spent most of her previous legal career representing women who murder their husbands or kids.  J4M B have complained previously about her awful domestic violence posters, and these rape ones aren't half as bad a those as far as I can remember.   Anyway, the point is that there's an extremist feminist in charge of all policing in the region in question, so sexist poster campaigns are an inevitable consequence of this.   This year: Matt O'Connor of Fathers4Justice Tom Martin of Sexism Busters Brother K of Bloodstained men (assaulted once on camera and also falsely arrested at a different incident)  A couple of years back: Daddy Justice assaulted on camera by feminists dv campaigner at dv conference  Historical incidents: Neil Lyndon assautled for writing critique of feminism in the 90s with feminists also openly saying they wanted him shot    I have complained about many issues to the BBC but to no avail.  The complaints process sucks but it is possible to win if you use all available channels. I've had at least 3 successes against the BBC, the latest one was probably the best so far:  https://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/   This is particularly good advice for anyone involved in our movement.  I can think of at least 4 men's human rights activists who have been assaulted, either by feminist or politicians, and three of the incidents occurred this year.  Those without recordings have faced false arrest and charges and even some of those with recordings have later faced arrest (off camera).  If you do one thing today, please fully familiarise yourself with the video function of your phone so you know how to use it instantly and without thinking.   If we're going to complain about men being killed by police then we'd need to pick a far better case than this one.  I'm all for defending even the most awful men when they've been clearly wrong by the police / courts, but there doesn't really seem to be any real injustice in this case whatsoever.  Getting behind shitty people who haven't even been wronged would make us look like idiots and harm our cause. If anything, it's the officer who's been treated harshly, perhaps not by his employers, but certianly by the lying media and much of society.   well they probably don't get all the "positive" discrimination that's found in more prestigious a jobs. So I expect female plumbers have it worse than the far more privileged females elsewhere.   The best record? They certainly have some of the best people when it comes to challenging feminism, but those a somewhat small in number and they do have the likes of May who's almost as stupid as your average Labour feminist and no better when you look at the polices she introduces.  The Conservatives don't even support shared parenting yet, and there's no way they deserve support as a party.  Why not check out the actual Conservative candidate in your area (and those for other parties) and see if they fully support men's human rights or not?   Would be nice if the article gave credit to whoever forced the retraction. Exposing these feminist lies is really important work.   There are also regular protesters there engaging with people in a more serious manner. I think a variety of tactics is a good thing - there's something for everyone.     it didn't seem that people were paying much attention to what they were trying to get across  In another one of the videos a woman describes overhearing a conversation indicating that AAP had warned all those at the convention not to speak to any of the protesters.  It wasn't the nature of the protest that stopped dialogue - that had already been put to a stop regardless what tactics the bloodstained men used.   There's a previous video of a guy arguing with him about the protest. It might be that guy who called the cops?   The foreskin doesn't' usually retract on babies or even young children, forcing it to do so causes significant harm as it is fused to the glans, you have no idea what your'e talking about.  As for FGM, there are multiple types of that, some more harmful than MGM and some significantly less so, but all are clearly 100% wrong. It's abhorrent to cut healthy and important tissue from babies, regardless of their gender, it's their body and should be their choice.   You completely misunderstand the point. The harmful mutilation you describe is completely illegal in most of the world and those carrying it out are subject to vilification and prosecution.  Switch genders, and similar harmful mutilations to males are encouraged, carried out by those supposed to be protecting children, with vast profits being made from this sexual abuse of babies.   Probably slightly unfair to that guy at the end who opposed circumcision, but otherwise seems like a good way to make the medical community think twice about some of the terrible things they're doing to kids.   Here's a video of his release from jail:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqQrONzR-IA  Apparently the charge is now "obstructing government operations" whatever that means.   So you'll do whatever it is that other other people do, regardless of ethics or evidence?  That really sounds like a feminist way of thinking.   The term "men and masculinities" is almost exclusively used by man-hating feminists nowadays, the only thing more obvious would be for them to promise to address "toxic masculinity" (A more subtle/modern way of saying all men are rapists).  They're not being totally blatant about what they stand for, at the very least they're completely clueless or alternatively they know  exactly what they're doing and it is a genuine feminist attack/hijack.  I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you do come across as quite naive in all this. Please be careful if you engage with these people as there a pretty high chance that their aims and agenda are probably the total opposite of yours (and if theirs aren't then it's probably the case for whoever is pulling the strings behind the scenes)   Great idea. You could make it into the ultimate shirt by stating that 10% of the purchase price would be donated to men's human rights organisations.   The best improvement that could be made to this subreddit is for some guidance to be issued for how to submit posts about hateful content.  We shouldn't be giving all our traffic to organisations who make money out of misandrist click bait and instead the content should be archived so we can still read it without giving them traffic or improving their Google rank.  If the content allows comments then that's not so bad as we can at least potentially challenge the misandry, but I see zero value in linking to hate content which has no commenting allowed.   The police haven't taken any action against the perpetrator, though please don't post her info as that's against the rules of this subreddit.    The police were even ignoring the caution while it was still in place. For example, they allowed her to renew her shotgun licence which is pretty much unheard of in the case of someone with a recent domestic violence assault caution.   He has been charged with "criminal damage" for grabbing the sign which the feminist assaulted him with. He's trying to get hold of the CCTV for the area so it shows what actually happened.  Feminists are either spinning it as him being the guilty party, or saying that he deserved it   (Don't think this breaches any of the Twitter rules as I'm sure Tom won't mind this being posted here, he's a public figure, and probably needs some assitence too)   Well that's ok if they also dismiss all Guardian writers in the same way too.   Please don't even make small donations until they at least start to fix things.   She hasn't been charged and her assaults took place back in September so it's not looking as if the police are going to do their job unless people complain.   I meant the majority here don't understand what's wrong with Wikipedia. So many other corrupt organisations have been completely exposed by the men's rights community for their blatant misandry, but no one has ever properly documented the sort of things going on at Wikipedia.  It's very puzzling because people complain about Wikipedia articles more than almost anything else, but they don't look into the Wikipedia foundation itself.   It's a subject that really hasn't had sufficient coverage from our community, so there isn't any article I know of that covers the issue.  Everyone here knows Wikipedia is biased and that it allows and encourages feminist to add their bias/bullshit to articles. We get plenty of people complaining about Wikipedia bias but it's inevitable if they're going to hire the worst man-hating editors as staff. It's not exactly a secret either, it's pretty easy to find out if someone works for Wikipedia, but we all ignore these issues and just keep on complaining about the articles instead of discussing the root causes.     People don't seem to understand just how corrupt Wikipedia really is.  Not only do the the most awful misandrists get admin privileges, many of the most notorious anti-male editors either currently make a living off your donations or have done so at some point on the past. For some reason, Wikipedia really loves to employ sexist feminists.    the concept of this still blows my mind. The fuck is the point?  It's so she actually goes to prison when she next attempts a violent rape and kidnapping (though if she's patient and waits a couple of years before trying again then we'll be right back where we started).   I think it's a great protest seeing as the AAP are in favour of child abuse. I did feel slightly sorry for the guy at the end though who said he hasn't cut a baby and never would.  They need to praise the good guys as well as confronting the bad ones.   It's strange isn't it. When people vehemently opposed to abortion set up fake abortion clinics then there's outrage. However, when those who oppose equality for men and men's human rights  set up fake men's groups, it's absolutely fine.   Whatever your criticisms about this place, it's certainly a hell of a lot friendlier and a thousand times less threatening than Wikipedia, where every single men's rights editor is targeted for abuse almost automatically now.   There are at least 3 hateful feminists who are of have been actually employed by Wikipedia and thus given the money of donors despite their awful and quite blatant sexism against men and male editors. These Wikipedia employees have been known to break some of the most fundamental Wikipedia rules including engaging in sockpuppetry and paid editing yet Wikipedia rules don't apply to them because it is so corrupt and feminist dominated.  Feminists actively stalk men's rights editors all over Wikipedia, often for many years, hounding and goading them trying to get them banned at each and every possible opportunity. This is usually for totally invented reasons or after being goaded by feminists for so long that they finally snap or make a minor error.  I don't suppose you'll be doing much about the above, if you decide to do so, as good a place as any to start is to look in the mirror.   what?   What Google are doing is wrong, but the most outrage should be aimed at taxpayer funded organisations who took part in IWD but afield to do the same for men. Unlike Google, these organisations have a duty to help everyone and to not discriminate.  One case that comes to mind is the BBC, who have a duty to be impartial and always go overboard for IWD but didn't do a single thing or even have a single report on IMD.   It's not my video.   She hasn't faced any action by the police, here's a response video by the perpetrator (watch to the end, that's the worst part): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAddCgWSbTU   Read the video description - she was going to provide written proof of the supposed guidelines she was enforcing, those never arrived. Also notice that she gets somewhat physical which was of concern.  These same protesters face a lot of police harassment and have been falsely arrested multiple times too and repeatedly assaulted by members of the public, see some of the other videos.   She hasn't faced any action by the police, here's a response video by the perpetrator (watch to the end, that's the worst part): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAddCgWSbTU   She hasn't faced any action by the police, here's a response video by the perpetrator (watch to the end, that's the worst part): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAddCgWSbTU   She hasn't faced any action by the police, here's a response video by the perpetrator (watch to the end, that's the worst part): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAddCgWSbTU   Apologies, i didn't spot the date as it was in such small text. However, please keep your comments to the subject of the material in question, rather than commenting on the person submitting the material.  People in the men's human rights movement have a great deal of interest in in a number of medical matters, and their level of knowledge of such subjects if often extremely impressive.   Or attracted more feminist/brainwahed readers than your average Daily Mail article?   The UK has provided some of the most important and groundbreaking groups/individuals in the history of the men's rights movement.  - Fathers4Jusitce forced the current debates on shared parenting and the right for children to see their fathers.  - Justice for Men and Boys, One of the few men's political parties.  - Erin Pizzey, founder of the world first domestic violence shelters, who now condemns the misandry of the very organisations she founded.  - Neil Lyndon, the author of the first modern, egalitarian critiques of feminism.   Please don't like to that awful site. Thanks.   Please don't link to these articles, archive the page instead.   I'm not sure if the posters went up around International Men's Day or not, but there's no doubt that they were an incredible success.  The various incidents with feminists caught vandalising the posters and even denying that men's rights were human rights are now a part of the history of our movement.   Why not put up posters rather than just holding them for a short while?  That has been an extremely successful tactic in the past.   In the UK thousands of girls, usually from care homes, are raped by gangs of roughly this size and the police and politically correct Labour councils turn a blind eye 95% of the time because the perpetrators are Pakistani Muslims (and they even threaten to arrest the fathers of the girls).  Given that Birmingham is run by a Labour council and also has a large Pakistani Muslim population, then there's a 99% that this is exactly  what's going on here.  Really, they should have just any of the men where a conviction was possible, but Birmingham is the worst council in the country when it comes to child protection, and combined with the refusal to prosecute Muslim paedophiles, the refusal to even gather evidence and then the difficulty of getting statements from the victim, then this isn't going to happen.  Although this looks like a men's rights issue not he surface, it really isn't, and is simply about past (and present) failing of ultra politically correct police and local councils who will only arrest sex offenders who are non-Muslim.  **update** article was significantly expanded a few minutes ago, confirming everything I suspected above.  Why the hell am I being downvoted, i just successfully predicted what was going on here?   Something strange is happening with my posts on Reddit, they don't seem to appear in "new" yet this is now on the r/mensrights page so obviously I'm not shaddowbanned.   I see this isn't showing under "new" and has therefore been wrongly censored. please don't do that. Thanks.   Apologies for the indirect link, but i submitted this half and hour ago and it appears to have wrongly been censored. It's quite clearly far more politics related that 40% of what gets posted on here, so deleting this post is clearly totally inappropriate behaviour. Anyway, I'll assume it was a mistake.   Don't really enjoy most Conservative party related sites, but Conservative Women is an exception an has some excellent content.   and up there with the worst misandrists of them all is Lynne Featherstone, a Lib Dem!    Now they promote issues for women and immigrants  Very true, although its worth noting it's particularly middle class women they help. They really don't have time for the small minority of female immigrants who truly do suffer genuine oppression.   Really worth reading this article.  Not only does it expose the misandry of top Labour Party politicians, it also joins the dots to the people in the media giving an outlet for them to promote all their anti-male ideas.   I use Wordpress too (and had a good look at other options before choosing that one).   My advice is not to use Amazon because they insist on selling "Boys are Stupid, throw rocks at them" merchandise.  In the Uk we got most retailers to withdraw these items, but Amazon were one of the few to refuse to do so.   You'll get best value for money donating to a men's domestic violence organisation, almost all of them are massively underfunded and they get typically nothing from the government. The best one I know is the Mankind Initiative (they were behind that viral video of different public reactions to male and female victims). It got 7 million views.   Allow me to apologize for the actions of my gender as a whole!  No, absolutely not, we don't do that sort of thing here. If you still have that mindset then you've probably not quite got rid of all your feminist baggage yet.  Just because idiotic feminist men apologise for the actions of all men and blame them for the world's problems doesn't means women here have to be sexist and demean themselves in the same way. We want to challenge this kind of crap, not imitate it.   Lynne Featherstone is  way up there with the most stupid feminists ever. From Wikipedia:  "In April 2006 one of Featherstone's researchers received a hoax email warning about an apparent date rape drug called Progesterex.[21] Featherstone submitted a question to a government minister inquiring as to "what assessment he has made of the use of progesterex in cases of date rape". Paul Goggins replied in the House of Commons that Progesterex did not exist: "It has been the subject of a hoax e-mail".[22][23] The hoax first originated in 1999.[24] Featherstone criticised the minister's response, stating "they need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out" and that "their cavalier attitude will not do".[25][26] However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in "criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes", stating "trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn't help anybody".[27]"  "In September 2011 Featherstone caused controversy by claiming men make "terrible decisions" when they are in charge. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference Featherstone blamed men for the mess the world was in, and commentators drew parallels with similar comments by one of Featherstone's predecessors, Harriet Harman. Her comments attracted criticism from across the political spectrum and were considered particularly inappropriate given her role as a minister in charge of ending sexism. Conservative MP Priti Patel said: "These comments are really ill-thought out. As equalities minister she has got to be unbiased about the value that both men and women bring to decision-making."[39][40] Elizabeth Day of The Observer newspaper was equally troubled by the remarks, writing "the notion that women are not as aggressive as men, that we would all just sit around a table eating red velvet cupcakes and talking out the world's problems rather than firing off phallic-shaped nuclear weapons is a complete fallacy".[41]"  Finally there's this almost unbelievable quote about Female genital mutilation where she stated:  "if this had been little boys having all or part of their penis cut off the practise wouldnt have lasted four minutes let alone four thousand years!" http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2014/03/fgm.htm  She's absolutely unbelievably stupid and misandrist and thankfully there's an extremely good chance of her losing her seat at the next election.   If the article sucks then don't link to it. Use an archive service instead please. Thanks.   And where are the flashing people in wheelchairs? And children?  Also where's the flashing black light for those of African descent?   You don't seem to understand. It's fine (if rather petty) for them to object, we're in favour of freedom of speech and you could argue the choice of clothing was slightly inappropriate/unprofessional.  Just don't EVER compare this story to the issue of genuinely harmful clothing, **aimed at children**, that explicitly promotes hate and violence against boys and is widely on sale.   They have no known equivalent of the "boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" t-shirt. Were ti to feature females then it would have disappeared almost as soon as it was launched. In fact, even computer generated slogans for products that didn't even physically exist were withdrawn after feminist complaints.   Interesting how the viral video of the guy defending himself on a train from a crazy woman ends up with him in prison for 4 days, yet not the slightest hint of any action here against a genuinely dangerous person.  The victim (Brother K) actually appears in court himself soon after been wrongly arrested at a protest elsewhere.   What the hell are you talking about? If it doesn't advocate violence or even state that females are stupid or inferior then it's not even the slightest bit comparable.   Haven't seen the shirt in detail, but I very much anything on it clearly advocates that females are idiots and should be subject to stoning or other violence because of this "fact".   Strange how there's outrage when these idiots have to pay for damage they've caused during a protest, yet most people were silent when men's groups were threatened with having to pay far roe than this simply to guarantee their own safety from feminists.   This is a premature headline. It seems to be a vote by some sort of set of elite Admins on whether to ban her or not.  Only one has voted so far, with all the rest yet to decide.   First video doesn't show the arrest, that video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1yF4oyo9-U  Apparently someone called the police and falsely claimed the protesters had been indecently exposing themselves.  Interestingly, it seems that the guy wrongly arrested also experienced wrongful arrest at the same location for a protest  back in December 1970 (the first ever anti-circumcision protest in the US)   If it makes you sick so much then **why are you promoting it for them?**  Please use a screenshot or archive service instead.   What does the text say?    Given from the amount of hate I see right here for English teachers it is kind of sad.  The point isn't to condemn all English teachers, most of us are simply discussing the possible correlation between being an English teacher and being a man-hating feminist.  We're not condemning all English teachers, just the minority that hate men. (and that this minority is somewhat larger amongst English teachers than those teaching most other subjects)   True, but why are there not just as many man-haters teaching religious studies or sports?   Record everything, making it clear how uncomfortable the item and her actions make you feel. Also be sure to make a point of how male are a minority group in the education system now, and a disadvantaged minority at that.   Why is it almost always English teachers who are the man-hating feminists?  If you look at the Duke case and the group of 88, Gender studies and African-American studies aside, it was those "teaching" English that were significantly over-represented in that hate group.    Think about how many guys this asshole messed up and brainwashed?  A drop in the ocean compared to what many feminists are doing, and it's not as if his activities are taxpayer funded either, that's when things are a real problem. He should be free to be an idiot and the feminists should be free to protest against him.   I don't really see this as a men's rights issue at all, there's so many other big stories about men's issues around right now so we shouldn't up vote this.  If there are bored feminists out there wanting something to protest against, then its far better they go after this guy instead of using violence and hate speech to try to silence good guys like Warren Farrell.   Well the upper thigh is remarkably close to the circumcision wound and they say the infection may have spread to there.  Either way, when doctors are treating a seriously ill child it's going to be better for them not to have to be dealing with multiple infected parts of the body and completely unnecessary wounds. And it can't be much good for the immune system either to have to fight off infection at multiple sites.  This case is probably like quite a few others in that they can't really tell for sure if it's the circumcision that killed the child or not (though its the reverse to normal in that its usual to cover up the link between the death and the circumcision).   Interestingly, some of these same guys protested in Tallahasse against MGM as early as December 1970, that's the first recorded intactivist protest making them men's rights pioneers.  They were wrongfully arrested at the protest all those years ago too!  Video of the latest arrest is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1yF4oyo9-U   And make sure you have plenty of well written posts about prostate cancer too. Also, next time say you run a men's **human** rights blog. Reminding these groups that men are human too really helps sometimes.   Simple test to see if the organisation is sexist or not. Simply set up a fake feminist blog and make a similar request in a few months.   We usually see positive stories about the Innocence Project here on r/mensrights so this certainly makes a change. It seems that at least some of their staff are more concerned about their ideological opposition to the death penalty than actually helping people.   No, AMR (and even some in the media) find bad people who aren't men's rights activists and then try to pretend otherwise.  If AMR and others were to highlight genuinely poor behaviour of genuine men's rights activists instead of lying 24/7 then that would be fine with me.   She is a feminist, so it at least can be categorised under feminist violence:  http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/dolores-oriordan-you-get-to-the-point-where-you-want-to-die-just-to-get-peace-30221192.html   Might be good for sales/publicity this time around though..    I even have to question his objectivity in his assessment of the reaction to the book  In that article he has actually missed out quite a few incidents such as death threats, an assault, feminist book burnings, anything you can think of really. Wikipedia covers most of them:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Lyndon#Writings_on_feminism  All this "controversy" (feminist hate) meant his couldn't find work and it was even used against him in court to deny him access to his kids!   One other interesting piece of trivia, the "male view" magazine this article is from was one of the first mens' rights publications. It was published by the Mankind organisation, who beame Mankind Initiative, now by far the biggest and most successful domestic violence charity for male victims in the UK and possibly the world.   "Dishonesty is to act without honesty. It is used to describe a lack of probity, cheating, lying or being deliberately deceptive or a lack in integrity"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonesty  There was no integrity in that headline and it was undeniably deceptive. Given the lack of balance in the rest of the article, not to mention the BBC's track record on such issues (such as the example highlighted in HEqual article) then it's not unfair to assume the deception was also deliberate.   It is one sided to call her a "rape **victim**". If she's a victim then it follows that the other party is the perpetrator or the rape. The BBC did indeed switch to a neutral heading which should satisfy any reasonable person.   I've posted it again, explaining that it's on topic and asking them not to delete it.    I've been on Reddit for years and I've never baited anyone, can we actually keep to the topic in question instead of these personal attacks?   It's on topic and a positive story. Surely it's good to see the BBC held to account and for people to actually facilitate change instead of simply complaining about discrimination and media bias?  In some ways it's even a good story for the BBC, because while they obviously made a terrible mistake they did eventually do the right thing in the end.  Anyway it would be interesting to hear people's perspectives and I'm certainly not looking to stir anything up so you presumed incorrectly.   Well, perhaps she was seeking some form of "pay back" by making the allegation in the first place?

This article is about as relevant to this subreddit as it gets. There is no reason to remove it. Thank you.   I posted this article to r/columbia the other day and it has disappeared from there without a trace! I guess some of the admins there are also members of the mob in question.   I posted this article to r/columbia the other day and it has disappeared from there without a trace! I guess some of the admins there are also members of the mob in question.   Why has this disappeared from the r/columbia subreddit?   it's not an imaginary problem and that's not we're presenting ourselves as the solution to either. People should be free to be complete idiots if they want to, we're just aiming to be the exact opposite of them, that's all.   To be fair, they could just make her pay back in full the money she's cost the taxpayer, put her on the sex offenders register and then deport her.  Prison is very expensive, so that would be the most efficient solution.   Might have been fair if she'd paid back the entire costs of the investigation, though I imagine it would have been quite a large bill! In addition to deportation I strongly believe such false accusers should be on a sex offenders register of some sort.  Edit - as pointed out below she did target a specific male. She should be in prison, no doubt about it.   Nice to see the best comments below that article are the highest rated.   It's a fact that there are feminists out there who spend their time trying to control men to such an extent that they campaign for them to sit down when they go to the toilet. They even present "science" to support their claims that it is healthier for the men in question, all of which has been shown to be completely false.  We simply aim to be the opposite of this.   Well I was referring to feminists yes, but not all over them, just the many feminists who oppose the human rights of men. As i said: "our opponents".     Perhaps that occurs a little too often on the site, although at the same time when there's proof of any of the above then surely it's only right to name names? There was absolutely no mention of the Guardian in the first version of the most recent story that was published. It was only later that we discovered that the Guardian appeared to have broken the story, had used the exact same dishonest phrase and therefore the BBC had simply copied it. Only then did we attack the Guardian for what they'd done.  The Guardian is the newspaper of choice at the BBC and they're notorious for having similar views and angles on a story. And we haven't attacked Guardian readers, only Guardian journalists. If anything we're  helping Guardian readers by ensuring they get honest and accurate headlines instead of sexist clickbait nonsense.   Fixed now.   I complained to the BBC and eventually forced them to change the headline. Info here:  http://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/   I complained to the BBC and eventually forced them to change the headline. Info here:  http://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/   http://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/   Anti-male feminism tends to be heavily associated with the left, and there's far more to politics than simple left and right anyway.   not when you consider the content of the article too. For example, where are the comments in favour of actually prosecuting criminal false accusers who ruin so many people's lives. And where are the extensive BBC reports on men who committed suicide after being falsely accuser by serial offenders?   Just been doing some Googling and noticed the Guardian went with the same type of headline. They don't have the same obligation as the BBC to be impartial, but they're still bound by PCC regulations so could be in trouble for it.   True, but unlike our opponents we're not hateful sexists here and we care just as much when feminist-inspired bullshit and hysteria impacts on women too.  On further issue is that the policy would essentially force men (and women) into relationships were it to become widespread. Given the various injustices that marriages causes for men, then this could be linked to men's's rights issues.   it's a good job that there's no such thing as a paedophile gang, or a married paedophile, or a paedophile who has children of their own...   if someone is alleged to have been a victim of a rape then it follows that there also has to be the perpetrator of the rape in question. The BBC is showing extreme bias in labelling someone on trial for false rape accusations as an alleged "rape victim"   Well some of the content like this would traditionally be found on r/unitedkingdom I suppose, but these days anyone who isn't a left-wing Guardian/Mirror reader isn't really welcome there, so I presume people are that and looking for a more neutral Uk subreddit where all views are welcome.   So where's the link to this info then?   in defence of the feminists, the people they're protesting against don't appear to be the most pleasant bunch, though still not worthy of protesting against.  While they do look very stupid and hypocritical, it's not as if they're protesting against ones of the good guys like the blatantly misandrist feminists did in Canada. In that instance they decided someone as respected as Warren Farrell was basically Satan because he was concerned about boys not doing well in school.    his isn't anywhere.  Well her name is everywhere because of her parents coming forward. And yes his name is out there too, though I'm not sure when it was first published.  And if I'm assume she's mentally incapacitated and that no rape took place it doesn't mean I'm assuming she's guilty of perverting the course of justice. Perhaps she was so mentally disturbed that she genuinely and sincerely believed to have been raped when no such thing actually happened.  I think this is the crux of the matter. It seems one one really knows what happened in this case other than perhaps the accused, yet the police seem to be pressured into believing supposed victims and arresting accused rapists regardless of the evidence. Perhaps instead of this tendency to classify everything as either "rape" or occasionally "no crime" there should be quite a few more cases classified as "who the hell knows".   I don't see why you are taking the police's side. Did they even get to see all the evidence gathered for the private prosecution? They supposedly had enough "evidence" to class it as a rape though at the same time they didn't actually have any evidence other than the word of a highly mentally disturbed individual. Seems like very poor conduct on the part of the police to me.  Perhaps if we actually treated innocent people who are merely accused of crimes rather better than all this might not have happened. At the very least we need to see anonymity for the accused.   If a significant amount of time had elapsed then that points to them not having evidence in her favour either. Combined with here obvious mental issues then it's surely wrong for the police to have even classed the case as a genuine rape?  TBH it would be better if the gentleman was able to actually take action against the authorities for what he went through instead of his only recourse being to go after the accuser.   Well the police had no evidence to support a rape prosecution. There does appear to be clear police bias in classing this case as a rape, on top of the lack of evidence there's the clear unreliability of the witness. Perhaps both sides got it badly wrong and maybe if the police had classified it correctly in the first place and treated the man better than he might not had such a need to clear his name?  Furthermore, knowing how incompetent may police forces are, it's pretty common for them to fail to collect or take account of fairly basic evidence. Perhaps there wasn't sufficient evidence of any lies until the accused had paid out a shed load of money and had collected it all himself?   In parts of England customers are increasingly demanding non-Muslim drivers to cut down their chance of rape/assault due to taxi drivers and takeaway workers there raping children on an industrial scale. It's always fine when companies discriminate against male drivers simply based on misandry, but when it's race or religion and based on a very real and specific threat then suddenly all the equality organisations become involved and the media goes crazy.    Yeah, all what, seven?  7 suicides caused by false allegations perhaps    Surely it's the CPS get to decide if there is a case or not? Why assume the police made the right call and that the CPS are in the wrong?   Well at least the headline writers at Sky News can do their jobs properly, perhaps they can give the misandrists at the BBC some lessons?    To sum up, someone with psychosis is less likely to piece together memories in a consistent way therefore putting their testimony at a disadvantage.  True, but your point means they're typically more prone to making false rape allegations too.   I guess the guy who was originally accused of the rape wanted some sort of pay back after her story failed to materialise and hence took her to court.  "pay back" is a bit of a strange way of putting it. If a party has indeed  been subject to a false allegations then surely they just wants justice and to protect future victims from the perpetrator who had caused them so much harm and distress?    Whatever the case, she shouldn't be described as the "victim". It's a huge smear on the person she accused.   Yes she is an "alleged rape victim", but only in her mind and a minority of others, however it's not the BBC's job to promote the agenda of a minority, particularly when its contradicted by most of the facts.  The fact that she was facing trial for false rape accusations points to there being strong evidence to this being the case, yes she's innocent until proven guilty, but that's where "alleged" comes in.  The BBC could easily use neutral terminology in which neither party is described as a victim/perpetrator, but the worst case scenario is to completely turn reality on its head and to so clearly state the accused is the "victim". Doing so in the headline is worse still - anyone just glancing at Reddit/Twitter and not clicking through the story is being severely misled by an organisation with a duty to be impartial and report the facts. The headline breaches countless BBC guidelines, and as for the report itself, where the quotes from someone with the point of view of welcoming prosecutions of false rape accusers and highlighting just how many people get away with such crimes?   Why the hell does the headline describing someone going on trial for false accusations as a "rape victim"?   Correct title is "alleged false rape accuser"   It gets worse, I just decide to search the BBC website for the name of the gentleman in the article above, zero results found!  http://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=Olumide%20Fadayomi  So not only do they lie when a false accuser commits suicide, when the roles are reversed they cover up the story too!    Well shit, this is just unfortunate.  Or perhaps worse than that and it's typical BBC bias?    The title is misleading too  Exactly, made worse by the fact that BBC journalists receive money from the public and in return are supposed to report these matters impartially instead of with such blatant bias. The heading is extremely offensive to victims of false accusations, particularly the alleged victim in this case.  Here's a an even worse case with the roles reversed, a serial false accuers and the victim of the false allegations committing suicide:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1280926/Student-cleared-rape-emerges-second-man-committed-suicide-falsely-accused-woman.html  As expected, not a trace of it to be found anywhere on the BBC website. Their bias is quite incredible.    If the other trial was still ongoing, it's not innacurate  It wasn't ongoing, the only trial where there was sufficient evidence was for making false rape accusations.   Here's my complaint email to the journalist named in the article:   to:  Dominic Casciani dominic.Casciani@bbc.co.uk date:  7 November 2014 16:58 subject:  Ridiculously biased headline in your report on alleged false rape accuser  Dominic,  I'm extremely concerned about the blatant BBC bias in the article about the alleged false rape accuser who committed suicide. The report itself on the matter isn't exactly neutral though at least not terrible, but the headline is just shocking and turns reality on its head and is extremely offensive to victims of false rape accusations. The case is quite clearly not about an "alleged rape victim" and the neutral term that should be used is "alleged false rape accuser".  While it's true that some people alleged that a rape occurred (mainly the accuser herself), the crime she was facing trial for was for making false rape accusations The BBC is obliged to report matters impartially and neutrally, and it's obvious that the key alleged offence here is that of making false rape accusations as that's the only offence for which there's sufficient evidence for a prosecution. As the article itself admits, actual prosecutions are false rape allegation are very rare (though not necessarily false rape accusations themselves of course). The fact that the courts routinely fail to go after false rape accusers thus makes the case against the choice of headline even stronger still. It's also worth nothing that the actual success in gaining a conviction in false rape cases in the few cases that get to court is very high, again suggesting that prosecutors actually rarely go after the wrong person and tend to get these things right in the instances when they actually prosecute perpetrators of such heinous crimes . Furthermore, if the BBC were to stop covering up cases of alleged false accusations by pretending the alleged perpetrator was the victim, then perhaps we'd also see a few more of these false accusers facing justice?  I'm not sure if you're the one responsible for the ridiculously biased and offensive choice of headline but the article does carry your name, and due to the BBC's failure to be transparent and provide any other contact details for the material we at HEqual will have to assume your the one responsible for the content unless we hear otherwise. Therefore please ensure this offensive and dishonest headline is fixed ASAP or forward this information onto whoever is responsible for this blatant breach of BBC policy.  There is one possible alternative solution that could be used instead of changing the headline. If it stays in place, presumably we can also expect to all future BBC headlines concerning actual prosecutions for rape to instead refer to the perpetrators as "alleged victims of false rape allegations". To be honest i don't recommend this second course of action, but the choice is yours.  Regards  John Kimble   **Update - the BBC have finally backed down**, I've blogged about the issue here: http://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/    He was bankrolling his own prosecution, though the state can actually stop him at any stage should they wish to do so. It's actually a very useful tool for cases where the police can't be bothered to get involved or perhaps where they might be better qualified person than the police to make the case. Animal welfare charities routinely use private prosecutions for example.  Also, it's notable that this case changed from a private prosecution to one by the state once the victim made it clear that he was determined to go through and that there was sufficient evidence to potentially secure a conviciton.   Why does the BBC headline use the term "alleged rape victim", surely the neutral term is "alleged false rape accuser" if that's what she was on trial for?   Why does the BBC headline use the term "alleged rape victim", surely the neutral term is "alleged false rape accuser" if that's what she was on trial for?  Are they going to start describing people on trial for rape as "alleged victims of false rape allegations"?   Quite a double standard here. even giving the mother the benefit of the doubt and assuming the allegations are false, then why do the children's names need changing? False allegations by mothers are pretty much an essential part of gaining custody of kids, yet the father gets zero protection in such cases with the false allegations often taken as being true.   Not in the context of a perpetrator being female though. Feminist organisations are only slightly reluctant to report male on male violence, it's female rapists we're not allowed to know about.   The victim of the gang rape was actually male, not female.   We always hear silly sexist arguments saying abortion would be freely available if men got pregnant etc. However, given how immensely skewed the justice system is against men, and how society holds men to account for their actions, just imagine how severe how commonplace prison sentences for the pregnant men would be were they to harm their unborn child.   50/50 doesn't have to be the norm. All the norm should be is that fathers play a meaningful role in their children's lives, and the courts and society accept this. Some fathers will have 50% custody, some 40% some even 60%.  There's no shame or loss of face in a hard working father, who perhaps has unsociable hours, having the kids for slightly less time than the mother, it's not a contest, that's the issue we're trying to get away from. When couples separate they should still work together and do their best for the kids.  There could even be an assumed 50/50 split but with one parent still being on friendly terms and offering to be a babysitter when the other is exceptionally busy (and grandparents/siblings from either side of the family can do the same, regardless of who's "turn" it supposedly is to have custody). It's all about moving away form this childish, combative way of doing things which involves expensive lawyers, and instead moving toward fairness and common sense.    I say that if all the shared parenting forces could muster was $27 grand that speaks volumes.  The "No" campaign raised zero from legitimate sources. Not a cent. $20K from one bar association and $50K from another, none of which is legal.   Some good points there, though you seem to be falling into the trap of assuming we want to force 50-50 parenting onto people.  You talk about "universal 50-50", as if we're feminists wanting for men to have 50% of everything, regardless of merit, desires or consequences ( like how feminist try to force women into politics or force companies to have huge female quotas on their boards)  Some men are perfectly comfortable just being part-time dads who see their kids at the weekend, and if that works for them, the mothers and particularly the kids then great. The men's movement simply wants equal parenting to be a genuine option and the default position in the absence of other evidence.  Kids should simply have the right to see both their parents and neither parent should be able to deny the other a meaningful relationship with their children.   $70,000 isn't bad when you consider the small size of the state. And $26,850 is not at all "similar".  Also if we remove all the immoral/illegal donations from the "No" campaign then their budget would have been zero! Every penny that received came from bar associations!    I doubt the actions of the ACLU and the lawyers had anything to do with this defeat  Well the result was closer last time North Dakota voted on it. It's pretty standard for the side with the most money/resources to at least have an impact on voting.   It can include Roma, but also Irish gypsies. Most slavery cases in the UK to date have involved the later.   we're approaching 100,000 subscribers, that would be one hell of an achievement   Some good info here: http://libertyviral.com/feminists-aclu-divorce-lawyers-opposing-shared-parenting#axzz3IAgVDWBu  more here:  http://townhall.com/columnists/rachelalexander/2014/10/13/opposition-group-turns-to-stealth-and-sexism-to-oppose-shared-parenting-in-north-dakota-n1904235/page/full  If you just do a search of this subreddit for "ACLU" you'll see that it is basically a radical feminist organisation now. Things i found were that it opposes:  * making false rape accusers apologise * shared parenting * due process for college students accused of rape  And it supports:  * spreading pay gap lies * infant male gentital mutilation   The yes vote for shared parenting (measure 6) currently stands at 37.8% with 67% of votes counted, so the bad guys have basically won.  I suppose at least if the actions of the lawyers group is ruled to be illegal as expected then there's has to be a chance of a vote again next time.  Update - now at 38.03% with 70% of votes counted, so 99.9% certain to fail.  Full detail of the proposed measure can be found on the excellent Ballotpedia site:  http://ballotpedia.org/North_Dakota_Parental_Rights_Initiative,_Measure_6_(2014)  news report on the result: http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voters-reject-equal-parenting-rights/article_10491244-64a6-11e4-bb54-3b16c9c9569c.html  Details of the foul play by divorce lawyers and the involvement of the ACLU: http://libertyviral.com/feminists-aclu-divorce-lawyers-opposing-shared-parenting#axzz3IAgVDWBu    This is Norf Dahkoda, where we love to force women to have unwanted children and refuse to let men help raise the children they love.  Actually the shared parenting measure has a lot of support. Simply having it on the ballot and therefore it being a real possibility puts North Dakota well ahead of most other states and countries in the world when it comes to gender equality for parents and children.   and that fathers have finally gained theirs after waiting for so long.    In the strict sense of averages, that wouldn't be true. If 1% of the population "paid for sex" at $200 per encounter, and all people had sexual encounters, paid or unpaid, at the same rate, then the "average man" would pay $2  No, that's the average paid by men. The average man however still isn't paying a penny.    you still have to wonder what other fanatic groups have done the same in their respective areas of interest.  The most obvious other example of this is circumcision-related articles which are blatantly controlled by circumfetishists and in particular by people who associate with these circumfetishists/paedophiles:  http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=Jake_H._Waskett   The "Average man" doesn't pay for sex and therefore the correct answer is zero.   There's not a huge amount of merit to the first link (though I seem to recall reading about "street harassment" at the time and it meets your requirement of featuring a female victim so you should like it). You're way off for the other two though.  We have charities such as the NSPCC basically campaigning against men and fathers, and all sorts of groups and politicians suggesting fathers are a danger to their own children and using fraudulent statements to make the "case" that we shouldn't have shared parenting. Therefore when women murder their own kids it's more than legitimate to post such news, more even more so when they do so using such horrible methods, and more so again when there's possible custody issues on the horizon.  As for the final link, I firmly stand by that too as it shows a child far exceeding the policing abilities of not one but two trained WPCs working together. It therefore makes a hugely compelling case against lowering standards in the police and thus effectively discriminating against the best candidates by failing to recognise and take advantage of their much needed and obvious abilities. Not only is this harmful to such candidates, the weakening of police and fire serves though such policies also puts the general public in danger (and members of the emergency services too). In summary, my concern is not so much with the incompetent police, but with the victims of their policing and with the unemployed/underemployed candidate who should have been employed in their place.   "If you google 'news father BBC'" Yes if you do that I'm sure you're right, not sure what your point is though. I didn't Google anything, i just visited the BBC website and found a story on the main news page.  TBH it's not a particularly well written piece as it doesn't use any scientific terminology to describe what had occurred so it's certainly not one of my best link submissions by any means.  i've already explained my interest in male domestic violence victims and how that stems from the almost total lack of support they receive. therefore we've already established why I don't tend to contribute the type of material you highlight. I've also answered your question about what would happen if the roles were reversed, can you maybe read my answer instead of taking us round in circles?   You've previously implied that my human rights work makes me a potential mass murderer, message received. Any chance you could stop with the abuse and discuss the content instead of the contributor?    Would you have posted this article if the roles had be reversed?  Well if women made up 40% of domestic violence victims of a crime yet were denied assistance front he government/charities soley because of their gender then that would be a complete role reversal and I'm sure I'd post it.  As for your comments on Rotherham you're implying that I wouldn't have posted the story about those 1,400 victims and wouldn't have had the slightest interest if they'd simply been 4 years older whilst all the other facts remained the same. That is total nonsense though you do make an interesting point that it's men and children who tend to be failed by the government time after time rather than adult women.   A while back i did some number crunching for government spend on male victims of domestic violence over the previous decade or so. One finding for was that for every pound spent on male victims in Scotland there was 3,500 spent on female victims.  Not sure why this is being downvoted so here's the actual figures as of 2010:  100 million spent on female victims 28,000 spent on males  That's a 350,000% disparity.   Every post of mine about women? You mean such as the ones about female rape victims being ignored by the media?  I do happen to have a huge amount of concern about male victims of domestic violence given the way they are systematically denied help and support, though as highlighted above I generally have concern for anyone in society deliberately marginalised and denied assistance and justice by the state and by supposed charities.  There's numerous laws in this country that blatantly discriminate against men and I'm yet to find any that do the same to women, so yes men are usually the victims of the legal and justice system, even (or perhaps particularly) when it actually functions as designed.   True, but how many members of these grooming gangs are 16 (or even under 20 for that matter?)    a guy in the year above me at 20 dated a 14 year old for years  There isn't much "dating" going on in the cases with the grooming gangs, how many such cases later ended in the victim and groomer having a long lasting loving relationship and getting married? In fact if he dated a girl who was 14 for years, then she'd be over 16 by the end of it. Grooming gangs typically have no interest in any girl over 15.  The cases were purely about exploitation with the victim drugged or given alcohol, subject to threats and violence and forced into sex with multiple men, often 2,3 or 4 times her own age.   "He said she said" is extremely important usually but almost totally irrelevant here because the victims are all under 16 (and well under 16 a lot of the time). In these child rape cases the only real "she said" defence would be if the victim lied about their age.   In Rotherham the number of abortions resulting from these child rape cases far exceeded the number of convictions. The lack of evidence really isn't a problem a lot of the time, it's just that the police and authorities don't even try to collect it when its staring them in the face. They refused to fund DNA tests, even in cases where victims had insisted one be carried out.    The fact is, many people have legitimate worries that UKIP are a party that advocates, if not downright supports, discriminatory policies  Like allowing thousands of kids be raped and abused because of the race/religion of the perportrator?   Excellent advice, though missing a critical factor - the need to document the abuse. Men do not get believed, so proof will be required.   Prostate cancer funding is finally getting off the ground in the last few years. If you really want to make a different then you need to go for an even more neglected area. Male domestic violence victim is the one area that comes to mind as still being almost completely denied any funding.    its hard to be funny and authoritarian at the same time.  Neither left nor right wing politics have any connection with authoritarianism, so Lee's talking bollocks. The left's strict adherence to political correctness is about the most extreme and authoritarian trend we've seen in politics in recent years. Also, I wouldn't describe the Conservatives (and certainly not Cameron) as a good example of right wing, just part of the Lab/Lib/Con elite. UKIP are more right wing and their support is increasingly working class (particularly the downtrodden who've been failed and abandoned by the likes of Labour).  As for sexism, the real sexists are the BBC who've adopted blatantly sexist quotas instead of employing people based on merit therefore reducing the quality of broadcasts.   Well if a warning was needed then perhaps for once the vid actually was violating the TOS?   Well perhaps if the other videos were reported they be forced to add a warning?   well if it's still on youtube then what's the problem?  Literally hundreds of mens' human rights sits are being defamed and blocked by ISPs yet hardly anyone posts about that here these days. It's great that you feel strongly about censorship but if the video is still up (and has been for a while) then it really looks like a non-issue or at least something somewhat trivial.   Any chance of a mirror of the original please?  Is it this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtVHnZX8E50   Good to see there's such generous people about. I seem to recall that 1,000 funds the fees for fielding an additional candidate at at the election.    Not sure your argument that UKIP are being treated differently holds much water..  Well there's a very obvious successor to Tonge doing the same sort of stuff yet they are always treated as isolated incidents rather than anything to do with the Lib Dems as a whole. If the media must label and smear UKIP as racists who hate immigrants then why don't the Lib Dems get the label of the anti-Semitic party? (especially considering that they largely stood by and kept such people in the part for as long as possible, incident after incident) And getting back to the main point of the discussion, why aren't comedians in particular doing this?   Well to be specific, is was organ harvesting that she was concerned with by Aid workers of all people:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Tonge,_Baroness_Tonge  http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100025868/jenny-tonge-and-organ-harvesting-this-woman-is-scary/  Worth nothing that it wasn't a one off and she had a history of making vile comments, including stating she'd probably become a Palestinian suicide bomber if she lived there.  Note that she still gets a nice taxpayer salary and retains political power via her seat in the Lords. I suppose in fairness to the Lib deems they did withdraw the whip, albeit after about her 10th offence (though I wonder if she still retiains party membership?)   For what? It's all fairly common knowledge (unless your main source of news is the BBC)   That's largely been debunked, every party has its share of nutters at local level, just the media tends to focus on UKIP ones right now.  Labour has links to all sorts of terrorists and has covered up thousands of child rapes all because of their political agenda. The Lib Dems have anti semites who think we need investigation in Jews harvesting body parts in Haiti and other Lib Dems even blow stuff up. The Greens used to have somewhat sane politicians back in the day, but almost all seem completely loopy now (just look at the background of Beatrix Campbell for example).  the only difference i can see is that UKIP butters get exposed by the media and laughed at, whereas Green, Labour, Lib Dem and Tory ones get awards form the queen instead and/or shunted off the the House of Lords.   Exactly. It's not that they don't criticise Labour (albeit less strongly), it's the types of criticism and angle used that shows the true scale of the bias.  Some of the greatest sources of humour in terms of hypocrisy and generally being complete scum and/or totally idiots would be Diane Abbott, Mr and Mrs Harman, Denis MacShane all of Labour not to mention Mike Hancock and Lynne Featherstone of the Lib Dems (and their several anti-semitic politicians). The way the likes of Ed Balls and Angela Eagle constantly get everything wrong is absolute comedy gold, and to be honest a lot of high ranking Labour politicians make the idiot Tories look relatively intelligent.  I don't really watch the BBC much these days, but how many twitter porn gags have they done about the Harmans? Does anyone have a go at racist Diane Abbott other than Andrew Neil?  I recall a feature on the BBC website about various famous people who'd got caught wearing Nazi uniforms and inappropriate attire over the years. The article listed all sort of obscure figures yet failed to mention Ed Balls doing the same thing, and at the time he would have about been the most significant figure in the piece!   Well seeing as they want you to die at least 7 years before your wife, I very much doubt it.   This is getting silly. You stated that Dale Maily was a "the stereotype of the extreme end of the DM readership"  I merely asked where the Guaridan equivalent was, I didn't bring up the  "average Guardian reader" at all, just the extreme SJW feminist ones.   This whole report is a total sham. It's completely dishonest and unbeleivably sexist and has nothing to do with equality at all.  It gives a score in different areas, and generally where there is parity it correctly gives maximum points. However, should women have it far better in any particular area (such as usually occurs in education) then the country still gets maximum points for equality.  So a country with 100% women MPs, no men allowed in school and most of the male population slaughtered by the government will be the most "equal".  Things get more farcical still on the life expectancy measure, whereby you only get maximum "equality" score if women live 7 years longer than men! One of the reason the USA got a low score is because the gender life expectancy gap is "only" 3 years!  The whole thing is total bullshit.        but they have a character who is the stereotype of the extreme end of the DM readership.   That's great, the question is where's the equally insane Guardian SJW feminist equivalent?   I'm not against targeting Israel, it's just insane for hem to be taking sides so blatantly in that conflict, though it's something the BBC does repeatedly.  I acknowledge they do critique Labour, but it's clearly a token effort - i.e. just putting a bunch of subtitles onto one of his speeches. I'd expect such subtitles attacked his personality of something vague rather than the fact that he was part of the treasury when they completely wrecked the UK economy for generations to come and spent every penny we have. I've seen the pilots of this show before the BBC took it on and the bias there was even stronger. It's pretty obvious that those behind it have quite hard left views, and as with the majority of the BBC I'd guess they were either Labour Party members of at least Guardian-subscribing Labour voters.  I'm not against them having opinions, but if such opinions are so strong then it's not suitable to have the television licence funding political propaganda - it's a major breach of the BBC charter. If they want to produce a Guardian style politics comedy show then it needs to find a home on a different channel.   The show is horrifically biased against any institution or political party that's not left wing.  Your typical episode will attack, the Conservatives, then perhaps their coalition partners (but only really for being friends with the Conservatives). they'll then attack UKIP, then the Conservatives again, then the Daily Mail, then a few big businesses and then Israel.  There will be a token gag at the expense of the Labour Party for "balance", though nine times out of ten it will be a half-assed attempt.   The point is that if they're not acknowledging that females are abusive then they're saying men only get abused by other men. It's increasingly common for feminists to acknowledge male victims but to then make it clear it's only homosexual men they're talking about.  	199
 Whenever, already added you    Appreciate!    Would you possibly be able to help me evolve my Seadra?    Cool no hurry. Do you have perchance have Kyorgre?    I can do a tradeback for Diancie    Awesome thanks man! I forgot about the tradeback.. super baked *edit wait that wasn't even you... my bad....    Cool cool, just out of curiosity what is it that the natures do? Sorry I haven't played pokemon since gen 2 prior to this game lol.   I have an Adamant Oshawott but my Fennikin is Naughty, is that alright?    By sheer luck I actually have both of those in the few random extras I have bred!    [trade] I have all starters (all gens) and most of the Hoenn Pokedex. Also need a tradeback for my Seadra. Thanks!   LOL I have similar memories!   Hey sorry I went ark for a bit but if you're still around I could actually use one! Thanks.    Thanks a ton mate! Really helped me out :)    Whenever you're ready    K just give me a bit to hatch it :) Sorry just multi-tasking up the waazoo right now lol    Absolutely that's fine! I'll send over some random level 1's then.    Sure just give me a few to breed an extra    Thanks man! I appreciate it. :)    added you! Don't see you on PSS though.    Awesome thanks mate! What would you like in return?    Thanks! Still after Lunatone, Seviper, Wigglytuff and Lileep. I think most of those are AS exclusive except the Lileep dual type fossil, which I took the opposite of.    Phione takes foreeeever to hatch :P    I can get you Kabuto I'd just have breed one real quick haha sorry! If time is no issue it's not a problem.    For sure! I have an extra Tyrunt on hand, just gotta breed the Phione.    [trade] Alright so I need a bunch of pokemon for my Hoenn pokedex. I'm willing to trade pretty much whatever, I have almost all of the Hoenn pokedex minus this handful. I also have every starter from every generation.  Some other notables up for trade:  Tyrunt Anorith Kabuto Phione  Thanks :)    Shit thanks mate! This was my first time participating in a giveaway and you my friend have made it tops!     Not even the weirdest thing about this picture..   I would be willing to argue that most people here are actually aware that it's a blanket...you're kinda missing the point.   If it were a colour picture I bet it would look normal... just the contrast in black and white photos that makes things look unnatural. That said, this definitely belongs here. Weird photo composition as well, with her way out to the right of the frame facing away...    K then deposited. :)    Okay, about to deposit a level 15 male Slugma. I can't gender lock, but I did level lock. Sorry i'm a noob to gts - do I need to fill in the pokemon wanted section?   aka every pokemon i'm not actively trying to catch.   Badass! The texture makes it seem almost as though it's made of stone. Either way, very good looking Blastoise!    I miss this emulator :( I updated iOS and now it no longer works. My FR team wuz the shit :(   Hmmm I just got all this free stuff from my loving family... I better go complain about it on the internet now.   Good to know man, glad to have you on my list :)    None really come to mind, I'm sure there are lots but I only do a couple at a time, takin' it slowly.    Thanks a lot man! Merry Christmas!    k    sure!    thanks man!    [trade] Yeah so I need a Lotad to help complete my pokedex. Going in systematic order now that i'm done the game. I do have every starter from every generation though if somebody wants one for the trade.    Because sleep is for the weak and I am an internet addict. True story.    Thanks a lot man! Hopefully you'll be around when I finally get my Electrizer and Magmarizer :)    [tradeback] Yeah so I basically just need help evolving these three via trade. If you don't have them already it will be for dex entries or if you do you could just help a fellow trainer out. The Clamperl will be evolving into Gorebyss.    Yooo sorry man I totally replied and then went and did shit thinking you weren't gonna be on! Anyway i'm around now.   Hey man sorry passed out last night, I still need a Chespin though if you're offering. What would you like in return? I have literally every other starter. (except Fennekin, have it but in a different game)    Thanks for the trade man! Now all I have left is Chespin...that one will be tough haha. Not much love for that little guy..   I added you, you still need to add me though so that it's mutual. Just enter in my friend code in the friends app and i'll initiate the trade, it's done through PSS   Kk I still need Oshawott, Got Froakie now    haha sweet :) i don't even know what that is lol. I would have taken literally anything. Thanks for the trade mate!    damn how'd you lose your everstone?    Nice third choice! :) Thanks for the trade mate.    Can do :) have extras of all    Cool sounds good, I literally just got froakie in a wonder trade hahah but yeah np just send over whatever along with the chimchar egg   Yeah man that would be great, and I can trade you all three of those of you want. They're all gonna be level 1 tho haha    [trade] So yeah i'm looking to complete my Hoenn pokedex and I also want to get all the starters eventually so I'm looking for the ones mentioned in the title as well as Chespin and Froakie if anyone has em. Not picky about level or stats or whatever.  Can trade any of the original Gen I or II starters plus Snivvy, Piplup, Tepig and Turtwig.   Thanks. :)    I'm assuming it's done now... didn't get any but helped get a few new dex entries!    Chances are i'll be sleeping by then but i'm not in a rush and if you're going out of your way to offer them free I can just wait until whenever's convenient for both of us. I'll add you tho   Yeah that sounds good, Try me whenever you're on, I'll probably be awake.    for sure!    gotcha. so in 15~min?    Sorry i'm a noob to the Pokemon Reddit community, how do these work?   [trade] So i'm looking for Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander. I have for trade any of the following, bred from an egg level 1: Snivvy Piplup Chikorita Treecko  Also I have an extra ditto.  Thanks!   Ps if you happen to have Totodile or Cyndaquil and want to trade for any of the above, that works too!   	64
 In indian church we MUST clap. And honestly I love that part!   Generally using Head and Shoulder should suffice.  However, if it is severe then you can apply nizoral prescription shampoo that should take away the problem.   Eat insoluble fiber.  FiberOne cereal, an apple, etc.   Fiber will make you feel full longer.   So what career choices did you make as a result of this?  Did your parents past work position offer any gains to you. Maybe getting into a good school or job, etc.   I love them   I think I just learned something here   Use ur floormat and put it under your wheel. This will give it something else to ride on instead of ice.   My suggestions :  1. Buy an egyptian cotton towel 2. Do not put towel in dryer, just hang them. 3. Wash by hand.   Well the reason I ask is because I've given gross, net, and just out of the wallet. This is how I have felt.  ((Gross - net)*10% - Given to various charities of my choosing) + (net *10% to local church) -- Current approach -- Feel somewhat joyful giving this way since I can choose to give to charities I want to give to , but still feel legalistic.  Gross straight to church - Didn't really feel joyful doing this so went with the plan above. Mainly didnt feel joyful because money was going to local church and the money was primarily being stored in the bank. Net Pay - Loved this approach only because I felt how can I give more than I actually bring home. But was told that the proper approach is to give a tithe on gross. And well felt guilty, ya di yada. Wallet - Felt great but always felt like I should given even more than just a couple of bills. Usually I don't carry to much cash.  That said, I think I can give at all levels, and I can surely say that God has blessed me over the years abundantly. 20K+ increase in salary over the last 3 years. So needless to say I am blessed for that. However, I miss the joyful giving that I used to be able to do. And I wanted to test out to see which approach is best. I believe NT approach is by your own will but 10% is def a good standard, and God approved :).  So the reason for my question was mainly to see if people have tested out both theories and to see which one they like/enjoy, which ones they were most blessed with, etc.   And to the fact of legalism, well maybe it is, but following Gods guidelines can ultimately change your heart. I mean heck i never thought I'd be able to give beyond my net, but I can, though maybe a little bitterly. And I'm only bitter because I know most of the money just goes straight to the churches savings account when it should be used to fix / maintain the church and to use it to help the current congregation increase their faith.    Ooh, I'd be curious for someone who teaches EDM music too. Fruity loops specifically.      When did you feel the most joy in giving? During net, gross, etc. Also, why the variation.   How do you tithe? Gross or Net?  Do you use 10% or another percentage?    Is there an app or any kind of utility that removes all non-hdr pics?   Yupp, just used mailstrom for something else and well its pheneomenal!  They can have my money!   I must admit that Mailstrom is pretty awesome at analyzing my email. Though for some odd reason it was unable to delete my emails. Though that maybe due to the fact that I deleted the emails in my system after seeing the analyzed report. I'm going to give it another try on my other email address.   What kind of API do you guys use? Reason I ask is because i was thinking about creating a similar app using MailSystem.Net. But since you guys already have a good software, well there goes my plans.   How would u teach christianity before jesus?  You would probably treated like the false messiahs of that time.   For reefs?   Well, my suggestion would be that if you want to understand your girlfriends religion then your best bet is to learn from her.  Ask her that you want to be part of her spiritual life and for that you want to learn whatever you can from her.  That verse couldnt have been a better choice. Those two commandments of Loving God and Loving one another truly embody the entire rules of Christianity.   However, if you want to understand Christianity better on your own then read the bible. Start from one of the gospels, either Luke or John. The gospel will tell you about Jesus and pretty much what following Christ is all about (Christian = follower of Christ). Then you can go from cover to cover if you wish. But start from the gospel.  And of course, attend her church. The pastors job is to explain whats in the Bible (like that verse) and to take care of the people attending that church.    So when they demolish a building. Do they just throw everything to landfill. Or do they reuse it?    Yupp!  Even though I grew up as a Christian I still manage to have a fall out. A time where i searched to see if I really was a Christian or just raised up that way.  Though I did alot of stupid things during the fall out. I eventually realized that nothing in this world will give me the joy that following Christ does! :)   How does one start a redbox business?  How much does it cost initially?  How much can you make/month?   Why did you stop being Bourne?!   tl;dr Lenovo Yoga 2   wow. kudos to your dad!    I used it to cook my eggs today. They're Pun-omenal   SA would rather spend the time/money on providing aid to people than to aid colleges. Especially considering the cost of colleges these days.  (my personal opinion)   So I used to joyfully give 10% of my net tithe. But over the years I started giving 10% of my gross tithe. But wasn't happy so I gave 10% of my net tithe to my local church and (gross-net) * 10% tithe to charities that I wanted to give to. Giving this way allow me to give both to my local church and charities of my choice. And its a great tax deduction ;). Personally, I would rather just donate the net tithe because I don't see how giving on something you don't have makes sense. Not to mention most of the money I give to my local church goes right to the Bank for future storage rather than to take care of the place.  Though I haven't read Crazy Love maybe you should check that out. I understand you want to be faithful but the New Testament (from what I understand) does not require 10% but requires a cheerful giver (2 Corinthians 9:7) which essentially can mean less than 10% or even more than 10%.    lol   Thanks for using your talents. These are amazing!   "Do not be overcome by evil. But overcome evil with good" Romans 12:21  Was a verse centered on during a youth retreat and has helped me to keep doing good in the face of evil (or just general bad things). I probably need to face this verse again rather than getting lukewarm.   This is why I can't listen to Christian radio. Its the same song and the same artists for years.  KLove is a haven for TobyMac and Chris Tomlin. Not bad artists but every other song shouldn't be from them and it shouldn't be the same song they have been singing for the last few years.    Just wanted to say that this comment has made me re-view of what books I will buy down the road!   Thanks! Signed up for the course!   I'm with you! Stay strong! Seek a counselor. Thats what I'm doing. Preferably a christian counselor.  Also check out the app InstaPrayer if you have access to it.   For most programming jobs you will not need anything more than Algebra 1 or even basic Arithmetic. You will however need to pass at least Calc 1 to get a BS degree in CS.    I graduated few years ago but can't get over the fact that I never fully understood how proofs worked or for that matter any of the material that is taught in the data structures class.  I know major companies desire that their employees understand these concepts but I had a very difficult time understanding the material. We used an outdated textbook that was printed in maybe 1960-1970s and professor used examples of pascal to illustrate the various sorting algorithms.  Anyway, what I'm trying to get to is that is there a modern or maybe a simpler explanation / course / book that can explain all the terminology, concepts, etc. that one should have learned from a regular CS Data Structure course.   Wish I had seen this sooner. Sorry.   Is this worth it? Safe?    Tako in Bensalem, PA. http://philadelphia.menupages.com/restaurants/tako/menu   I have freedompop in Cheltenham, PA area and the service isn't bad. Im using the $10 plan.

    [:(](http://i.imgur.com/tDXwZIY.gif)   I don't think the race is a necessary descriptor here    The stadium looks a lot emptier now...   I'm really digging Croatia's kit   GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL   Here's what happened, and here's a digital recreation. It looks just like what we showed you, see?? Preeeetty nifty.   The country might literally become a failed state   There was homophobia?  Edit: Thanks for the prompt responses, I remember the "boy-lover" quote but I kind of consider that just criticism of pedophilia. It's still completely historically inaccurate for the Spartans to be critical of that, but I wouldn't say it's "homophobic" in itself.  But from what you're all telling me this Miller dude does sound like an asshole, and he probably is a homophobe himself.   There's a jazz subreddit for everything!  /r/jazzhands?

You seem a bit tense   The best way to win in Civ.   Ooh very nice. Thank you.   Is there a line graph for this?   It sounds like something straight out of *Fallout.*   [Why are we changing maps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLqC3FNNOaI)   Do you work there? How were you able to describe this in so much detail?   OH MY GOD.   Jesus. I'm sorry but where did this actually come from? Did somebody originally type this as a serious comment?   Lol somebody isn't STEM hahaha. DAE love getting a job out of college and being better than everyone else?   Most of the time, yes. I actually pay attention to the NYT comments because the readers' picks and NYT picks are often insightful! Idk if other newspapers do that, though. Maybe the WSJ.   Nationalism is an important factor for WWII. Perhaps not *quite* as much in France and GB but nationalism had a huge role in justification and cause for the Nazi party's actions and policies.  It's not the sole cause of either war, but it's an important factor in both.   Upvotes just for saying the name. God I love that movie, it's why I wanted to become a paleontologist.

For a quick, extremely well-written read on war in Europe, I recommend *War In European History* by Michael Howard.  It covers a lot of what you talked about, and more!   POLAN STRONK   I would disagree and say a 7.5   I can always count on /r/science to have one of the top comments be bitching about the article title rather than discussing the article itself.   GO DAWGS   For additional reading I would suggest Horkheimer and Adorno's *Diaclectic of Enlightenment*, for political theorist's explanation for fascism in the context of the Enlightenment, written during the Second World War. You could even just read the first chapter and be a bit more, well, enlightened.   interesting choice of thumbnail...   "Panamanorama"   Or worsen it...worth it...? Tough question.   didn't he just shoot someone the other day? Or was that just a rumor? I just saw a headline somewhere.  	53
 Not to mention, their customer support is unbelievable. I didn't really know about my 944 when I bought it, and I called them to do my timing belt order and their staff picked out everything I need. They're an extremely helpful group.   Yeah I think that's the one exception, but no doubt about it it's a dream machine. I go to bed every night thinking about it wishing that it was mine. The hard lines on it are gorgeous.   Guards red   Who would have thought of such a concept?   You're also forgetting about the drive train, if I recall correctly, the wheels on the sports train were bigger than the factory wheels on the Jag, and the drive train wouldn't be able to handle it, you're essentially up gearing it.   Yeah for sure, I think what they do is tell the builders basically what they want, then they stand around with their hands in their pockets monitoring the progress.    I don't think many people realize that a lot of the things on the show were not actually made by Jeremy, James, and Richard. I mean look at the cheap train travel episode, do you really think that they were all capable of making a car into train? It's not as simple as just throwing 4 metal discs onto a car. But then again, I still like to believe.   Haha I know that pain, I took my family out for a ride in mine for the first time a couple weeks ago, and my dad made my mom sit it the front seat while he laid across the back seats it was pretty funny.   But isn't camber beneficial if you're tracking it? As long as if it's not stupid hellacamber like every 18 year olds wet dream Honda, it should be helpful.    So he sold the MR2 because he couldn't put a two year old in it. Quite frankly I don't see how long the 944 will last then, seeing as it really doesn't have rear seats. But anyways, congratulations on the purchase! Where I'm from its very hard to find a MR2 in great condition.    Oh god yeah they do... I just had my 1994 Cutlass fixed for rotted trailing arm mounts. I bought new trailing arms and undercoated them, I probably should have done it a while ago living in New England.   I'd have a +4 car garage, but have no house. Have the garage be well built, clean, finished, and I would park a Chevy Astro in it with a mattress inside of it and use that as a "house". Of course there would be running water.   Yup, can confirm. I work at an auto body and this happens on almost more than half the cars we get.   Never thought of it that way, that does make a a lot of sense then.   I don't know much about track days, but would this be considered driver fault? Or track fault. It seems to me that maybe the track should cover damages, but I don't know why. Just my 2 cents.   The inertia from its blazing speed will keep it on even if the second one falls off    3 lug wheels are the best    Thank you very much! Now I'll have some new tracks to fool around with tonight.   Links would be very much appreciated.   Thank you so much, Live for Speed never even crossed my mind. I do have the trial version of it, but it definitely looks like I'll be buying the full version now.    Not sure if this gets posted a lot, but I have been looking everywhere for any type of autocross mod for any game. Each time I go to Google all it brings up is rallycross, because as far as I know rallycross is called autocross everywhere but the state's. I do have an autocross track for race 07, and it's okay. I know absolutely nothing about modding and modeling either, so me making a track is absolutely out of the question.   I am not sure if this is allowed on this subreddit, but here it goes. I'm not trying to promote this business in any way, nor am I affiliated with them, but they do have coupons on Simpson helmets if anyone is interested. Most of the helmets are $50 off of original MSRP, except for the carbon fiber helmets which are $100 off of MSRP. http://www.biondoracing.com/   Holy shit, I think I know who you're talking about. Is his nickname by any chance either Doctor Dave, or Doctor Dan? I've been to his garage before and he collects Hursts like hot cakes, and they are all stupid fast.   Kazoo rims go woo woo!   I always thought that the 944 looked kind of meh in pictures, but I actually recently bought one as a track car project; and holy shit. Pop up headlights and 80s box flares? Does it get any better than that?   I live about an hour and a half from Lime Rock, I'm seriously regretting not doing it.   I'd say keep it simple. Start from the ground up with wheel, tires brakes, suspension, etc. You'd be surprised how far that alone would get you. If you feel ambitious, why not do your own paint job. I really don't know what's out there for parts, but then again that's what the internet is for. Lastly, before you do anything I suggest pricing out what you want to do and how far you actually want to go with it. Congratulations on the project, and good luck.   I'm no where near California, but I'll be sure as hell to keep an eye out. Anything to help out a fellow car lover.   I've never done either of them, but I feel like plastidip may actually be more expensive. With a wrap as far as I know you can peel off and put the wrap back on, where as plastidip the conditions have to be just perfect and you have to worry about airborne annoyances.   I've had my fanatec for around a year and a half now, somehow I have had no problems with mine which is extremely strange, except for the fact the alacantra is wearing off and it's kind of ratty looking. I'm running a TH8 with it for a shifter and I would highly recommend it. The feel to it is unbelievable.   I really wish that more sims would have 80s and 90s IMSA cars. I remember reading that someone was going to make a GTO mod for rFactor but it was never actually finished.   OK, thank you very much. They are real Irwin vice grips but I will try again when I get the chance. I really don't want to leave gouge marks but I guess if that's what it comes down to I will.  	32
 We have found our new Michelle Bachmann.   Let's get back in the saddle and pedal forward.     Good for you, /u/elzmuda -- there are always excuses to drink, but if you make the decision first thing in the morning not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, if you doggedly persist in the commitment, then alcohol is not an option.  I like to say that after I decide that I am not going to drink TODAY--alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day.    Lady Lindsey is the last closeted gay male in politics.      Unfortunately, it was a widely-held belief that the alcoholic was immoral--if only he would take "the pledge" or "get religion."  The failure to make the choice not to drink was seen as sin.  It really wasn't until the late 19th century (Rush, Trotter 1760-1832) that a practical "disease model" and treatment emerged (Keely) although it was not widely known or accepted.  The modern recovery  movement begins as a radical reaction to the WCTU and the moral choice models--fully accepting the disease model of alcoholism.  Frankly, the anti-AA ideologues are actually preaching a moral choice model--without the moral-ism.        Many times, these sorts of local heroes become honored judges and courthouses are named after them.               Of course, I've been there in my own special and painful way.  Most of us get where you're coming from and we want to provide support along the way.   Yeah, I remember that neuro-feedback loop when I was drinking.  When I went back to "moderate drinking" after 15 continuous years of sobriety I thought of course that I could sip fine wines.  I'd buy these $100+ bottles of aged port and I'd have the appropriate crystal glasses.  Of course, being an alcoholic, I'd hide all of my apparatus in crawl spaces and wait till everyone else in the house was asleep and pull out my port and sip my wine--inevitable waking up at 5 AM laying on the floor with empty bottles of port that I must have swilled down.  Did I need any more proof of my powerlessness?  And yet, I went on and on for 7 long hellish years.   Fine chocolates.      Like EVERYTIME.   In a discussion sometime last year, I told my pal, /u/offtherocks, about the great 19th Century English novelist Anthony Trollope who in 1858 published [Doctor Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Thorne) which deals with the multiple episodes in the lives of recurring characters in something called the Barchester Chronicles.  If you are at all interested in literature, I can't recommend them highly enough.  In *Doctor Thorne* the title character treats the alcoholism of his friend Sir Roger Scatcherd who eventually dies from the disease.     But be this as it may, be it true or false that Sir Roger was most efficacious when in his cups, there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy, six or seven times every year, without in a great measure injuring, and permanently injuring, the outward man. Whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mindsymposiums indeed they were not; posiums I will call them, if I may be allowed; for in latter life, when he drank heavily, he drank alonehowever little for evil, or however much for good the working of his brain might be affected, his body suffered greatly. It was not that he became feeble or emaciated, old-looking or inactive, that his hand shook, or that his eye was watery; but that in the moments of his intemperance his life was often not worth a day's purchase. The frame which God had given to him was powerful beyond the power of ordinary men; powerful to act in spite of these violent perturbations; powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and headaches and inward sicknesses to which the votaries of Bacchus are ordinarily subject; but this power was not without its limit. If encroached on too far, it would break and fall and come asunder, and then the strong man would at once become a corpse.  p.124  And here, Scatcherd on his death bed describing his fears relating to the effect of the disease upon his heir, Louis:   "With my poor boy; with Louis."   "If he [Louis] will let me, I will [look after him,]" said the doctor.   "And, doctor, when you see a glass at his mouth, dash it down; thrust it down, though you thrust out the teeth with it. When you see that, Thorne, tell him of his fathertell him what his father might have been but for that; tell him how his father died like a beast, because he could not keep himself from drink."   These, reader, were the last words spoken by Sir Roger Scatcherd. As he uttered them he rose up in bed with the same vehemence which he had shown on the former evening. But in the very act of doing so he was again struck by paralysis, and before nine on the following morning all was over.  In the characters and story of Doctor Thorne and Sir Roger Scatcherd I was struck at how sophisticated Trollope's 1858 understanding of the psychology of the alcoholism and the sufferer's powerlessness over the malady.  Also the powerlessness of that caring physician to help his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When I got sober in 2009 after a 7 year relapse, as I saw it, I had the choice of killing myself and avoiding what was certain to be professional disgrace and a criminal prosecution over unfiled and unpaid federal income taxes or get sober and face the music.  In the years of my relapse the income from my professional practice was on a roller coaster.  Some years, I barely made any income and in at least one of those years I made a million dollars.  The unpaid and unfilled taxes were an abyss that I could not figure out how to address despite numerous false starts--of course, not being in recovery I had intentionally walked away from ready and willing help and support.  Finally I was at "fuck it, I'll just sit here and drink."    Ultimately I suffered very serious professional and criminal consequences that included federal prison time. Some of the damages to my reputation and professional status (I lost my license) were permanent, but the criminal consequence has been long in my rear view mirror.    When you own taxes in the US you might find that you owe reasonably $300,000 dollars and then through some black magic the IRS says your $300,000 indebtedness is now $600,000 and then time passes, even with payments and forfeitures, the IRS says you now owe $900,000 which is sort of where I find myself now.  In other words, my sole criminal offense resulting in a short prison sentence has become a life sentence as it relates to intractable debt and IRS collection activities including garnishments and seizures.    When the collections nightmares first got underway the local agent that I dealt with suggested that I file something called an Offer In Compromise (OIC).  An OIC is a whole lot more than calling the IRS up and saying--here's a few thousand send me a release,  In 2012 I undertook the process and I was very close to accomplishing a deal when mysteriously (a common experience when dealing with the IRS) the rug was ripped out from underneath me.   Leaving out lots and lots of the details, I determined to find out why.  I submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and I got my entire IRS file.  As a result I learned that the former criminal investigator in my underlying criminal case supplied misinformation which if I had had an opportunity to address I would have been able to supply documentation refuting allegations he made that disqualified me.    Flash forward, to now, I just completed all the hoops, and I am greelighted to submit a new OIC (now complete) which my accountant believes stands a chance of success based on revised rules adopted by the IRS in 2014.  Also my employer is supplying funds to effect a deal if it can be done.  I write about this to let you know that I too struggle with life on life's terms and I don't drink TODAY no matter how frustrating, confusing, depressing, anxious painful or embarrassing those terms are.  I doggedly persist every day that I am SOBER which means, I still stand a chance.  Five years sober and I am still working on clearing away the wreckage of my past.    tl;dr  CC has bad, bad tax problems; he doesn't drink; he overcomes obstacles; and, he hope that he may finally be able to clear away financial wreckage of the past.  Note: This was painful to write, but I promised to update a comment about my resolution and determination to deal with this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) is a post that I published in several versions.  It's made up of information that helped me stop drinking and get sober + ideas suggested from among others, /u/offtherocks.  My pal, /u/Flow_Morpheous_Flow noticed a typo so with the need to make that slight revision I added a link to the daily check-in, too.    So if you're **new here** I hope you will consider making the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and [the Daily Check-in](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/checkin) part of your Stop Drinking routine.        	191
 Be nice to have another post on how to get a project licence and an institutional licence.      Should say, the post was written by a PhD student from Imperial University London      Many of these animals that PETA picks up don't get to the shelter. Around 1% of the animals are adopted ... most shelters have much better rates than this   They were doing this at the same time as protesting the death of one cat  http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/08/a-lesson-in-hypocrisy-as-peta-cries-foul-over-one-cats-death-while-secretly-killing-hundreds-more/   They were doing this at the same time as protesting the death of a cat  http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/08/a-lesson-in-hypocrisy-as-peta-cries-foul-over-one-cats-death-while-secretly-killing-hundreds-more/   Fair play - how come you don't agree with IVF      good news - the US seems to be folowing the UK in phasing out chimp research      Someone (same person?) did one on vaccines a while back      Absolute gold. I'll get out the bollinger   SR has a couple of goals. Standing up against illegal extremism (which represents only a very tiny minority of the AR movement - but one with a disproportional voice) and standing up against misinformation. The second action IS needed, as there is much distortion of the science.   The slow down in medicine is happening. Only a few airlines will continue to transport primates - used for vital medical research (and only where other animals would not be suitable). This prevents some research going on, and raises the cost of research - reducing the amount of it. Activists broke into Marshall breeding facility and took the animals. Raising the cost of research, reducing it. Activists are protesting the movement of the AZ dogs - if they managed, AZ would simply end up breeding more, and having to put them through the same processes - this does not make "better" research, or "better" animal welfare.  Now, we need to be sure not to underestimate the importance of animal welfare. There are many working towards this. Some push is from the AR movement, some from the animal welfare movements (e.g. RSPCA), most is from the animal welfare officers within the labs. I had the job of looking round a lab the other day, and you should see the pride from the NACWO (Named animal care and welfare officer) of the primate lab discuss all the systems he has in place. The importance of diet, group housing, horizontal bars and viewing platforms in the enclosures, and mostly good training of the animals to reduce their environmental and handling stresses.   Brandon, thank you for your reply.  We are indeed all on the same side in both wishing for further medical advances and wishing for the continued development of alternative methods. The 3Rs, developed by two scientists in the 50s, have been the cornerstone of animal welfare - aiming for the refinement, replacement and reduction of animal research (something we should all agree on). There are some promising technologies in the pipeline that should replace some bits of animal research (lung-on-a-chip is a more recent one), however there is no sign of technologies that can replace all of animal use for medical research, nor is there a sign that new areas won't continue to be developed with a need for animal use.  This link was aimed at informing people on both sides (it was also posted elsewhere) as to how projects are taken from being an idea to a study.  You are right when you say scientifically minded people should go with the best results, and then add a healthy dose of leaning against animal use. However, you cannot get a project approved if there are alternative methods available. In the UK that is checked by the Home Office, in the US it is checked by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.   There is a lot of work in labs aimed at ensuring animal welfare remains high.   Would have thought deep brain stimulation would have said it all: http://pro-test.org.uk/facts.php?lt=aa      It's essentially a trailer for an episode of BBC dispatches. There will be more footage on that.      You don't need to convince me off UKIP - I would never vote for them. Nonetheless, I agree with the workfare program - we have a terrible prison system with ridiculously high reoffending rates - something has to change. Japan probably moves too far away from human rights in its prison system (e.g. no conjugal visits destroys families), but there must be lessons we can learn from them.  Scrapping CPS, human rights etc - that's terrifying and one of the many reasons I would not vote UKIP.   I hasten to add that I am not a fan of UKIP, but I feel what was written above on prisons wasn't telling the whole story   With regards to inmates doing physical work, I don't think they have prison labour for military efforts in mind. I'm not sure whether I agree with it, but Japan has very strict prisons, all inmates must work long days, and more importantly they have very, very low reoffending rates. http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21572257-even-japanese-criminals-are-orderly-and-well-behaved-eastern-porridge   Good point         I confess under normal circumstances I loathe to link to the Mail. It's not high quality science writing, but the article was interesting and reasonably well explained and I've provided the original paper below for people's perusal.   For those who are asking for it - here is the original paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22654062   What the hell?!  1. Lib Dems are not a minority party (smallest of the 3 major parties) 2. The major vote wasn't split between Tories and Labour, Labour got almost no vote 3. If there was a straight run off between Tories and Lib Dems, the Lib Dems would have won it- they have much more support in the area   Good question - I guess the next stage of trials will work that out.   The veterinarian has rehomed the breeding dogs. The rest would not be suitable for rehoming on the decision of the vet.  It would also mean the same beagles would just have to be bred again in the UK - which is against the idea of reduction of animal research.         Would you rather own bank or charing cross branch?               hopefully      Government's still borrow when in surplus if cheap credit is available. Also, money comes at certain points in the year (when taxes are due) so they often borrow at one point in the year and repay later on.   There are two potential risks (I won't say they will or won't happen because economics is unpredictably complex much of the time).  - Firstly, a fast rise in government spending involves the government borrowing from abroad and from markets. Essentially this can absorb all the available cheap credit which really need to go to firms - so firms have little money to invest. This is called "crowding out" of investment.  - Secondly, deficit's must have a credible repayment plan. If you don't then the markets lose  faith and your borrowing rates skyrocket - this results in huge chunks of money going into repayment each year. This is what happened to Greece and Italy last year (and almost France). Compared with the UK, which in its tight-fisted austerity, maintained market trust for repayment, so credit remained cheap. This credibility not only affects governments, but can have a knock on effect to bank and company borrowing.   You should absolutely take account of the authors interest, but unless you can criticise what he says, that's not enough to dismiss it.   The author accepts the findings of the original paper, but suggests that the NYT article overstates what is contained in the sources.   BUAV argue the government promised to reduce animal research - what was meant was within the principle of the 3Rs.  There has been huge increases in expenditure on alternatives - most obviously seen by the fact that money into biomedicine has gone much much faster than the use of animals (thus most money is going into non-animal methods).   Yup!   Also worth noting that arbitrary reduction of animal research across the board (rather than individual experiments) is that it just pushes it overseas      Little bit sweeping. Some vegans (at best - most seem to just prefer to say companion animal and then treat them like a pet).   Anyhow, you're dodging the question. Let me go another way - Do you get rid of a threadworm infection?   It's important not to exagerrate what the original paper actually says (which the NYT headline does) - see a rebuttal here: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/   It's important not to exaggerate what the original paper actually says (which the NYT headline does) - see a rebuttal here: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/   Nature had an article today about the use of GM mice: http://www.nature.com/news/proteins-behind-mad-cow-disease-also-help-brain-to-develop-1.12428   Here is a link to the original NYT article: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/science/testing-of-some-deadly-diseases-on-mice-mislead-report-says.html      You can catch it from your dog - so the hypothetical remains   WHat do you do if you get a tapeworm?    Fortunately cosmetic testing is banned in the UK      Full original paper: http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/55/6/1546.long (sourced in text as well)      Zeus wants him dead - we all saw the thunderbolt   The USDA inspected the facility and found no wrong doing   I never thought that an English breakfast might not translate   That film is 30 years old...      I thought that was people using apple headphones...   I understand that, but sometimes it seems a little "tacked on". The "it's unethical, and even if it was ethical it doesn't work".  However, the scientific arguments against animal research just don't seem to add up - as many of the debunked articles in the link above   Hmmm, seems like the counter to the "33 facts of vivisection" ... still a few more to debunk   Then this discussion should hold no interest for you. Prof. Lovell-Badge's article was meant to dispute those activists who were misusing that statistic for their own argument. You were not.    It's a scary world when activists can hold medicine to ransom.   In Full: bacon, sausages, bakes beans (with mini sausages in), mushrooms, cheese and scrambled eggs      all drugs must be tested on animals - so difficult to find   They use the first argument a lot - the statistic is often quoted as "92%". The latter stat could never be tested, it would be unethical to give a treatment which killed animals to humans.   The UK has had a ban for years, Europe has just fallen suit. Hopefully the US will settle on a set of alternative tests that will satisfy regulators (they are getting there). It does make it difficult to use novel chemicals in new cosmetics, but honestly, we don't need new lipsticks at the cost of animals.   I support animal research for medicine, but I'm all for dumping both cosmetic testing and the LD50 tests (who cares about the dosage that kills 50% of mice - The LD10 would show a dosage that's too high).   no data - it would unethical to move forward a drug shown to be dangerous in animals   read the post - the 9/10 refers to a specific "fact"   To my mind negative rights always entail a duty. My right to life entails a duty not to kill, and so does yours - the result is that neither of us kills one another. When it comes to those who can't think for themselves, such as babies, society deems it right to extend that right as they have the potential to fulfill their duty later on. Similarly, those in a vegatative state have a potential to get better.   An animal will never be able to understand the duties entailed by their rights.   cosmetic testing is banned in the UK - which is a good thing   Of which 17% turn out to be precisely true upon review   The TGN1412 disaster has been the only situation where anyone has even nearly died in Stage I clinical trials that I can name.   dfgb - go and google "Drug Monkey" and "anti-vaccination" and you will have all the science debunking your claims written clearly and scientifically.      Ah, in the situation of rights-duties, the word "duty" has a rather grander meaning than in casual conversations.   A human cannot appeal to its rights when dealing with another animals - the other animal doesn't understand. Rights exist to mediate human-to-human interaction - it is meaningless across species.  Rights are an expansion of the golden rule - if you don't do this to me, I won't do it to you.    It's amazing seeing the improvements in mouse models in the field of neuroscience   Children DO have a right to education, thus the state has a DUTY to provide it.  Responsibility is an alternative to rights. So a painting of the Mona Lisa has, itself, no rights - nonetheless society deems we have responsibility to look after it.      I disagree, it is there to mock this idea that animal research is some terrible cruelty when the reality is that it is tightly regulated and far more humane than anything that goes on in nature.  If it is about how we expect humans to act towards animals then it is a responsibility not a right - rights entail duties which an animal cannot carry out.   Is there a shorthand for saying that? Do I use [OC]? Still new to Reddit      I suppose that's a small advantage to this mass bird-kill      Thanks for the support - it's great to see scientists, veterinarians and technicians start to speak up on this complex issue.   You'll note that deaths in Stage I clinical trials are almost unheard of. Certainly no deaths in the UK for the past 30 years and only one major incident (TGN1412). So animal research remains a crucial step to protecting people.  Secondly, most animal research is not for testing drugs, it is for developing drugs and in that stage it is crucial. You can't cut up a human to see how a disease is spreading or how it works. How would you get a breakthrough medicine like the HPV vaccine (against cervical cancer) which is originally a mouse protein - without the use of animals?            Why? It's a fun way of looking at the scientific debunking of many animal rights claims   i see it  	100
 I love this story of his!  I've heard him tell it in a recording of a 3 hour lecture, just before a break.  Great punchline... :D   3   Why show up in the thread if you only came to impose a hierarchy, where only your version of anarchism is allowed?  It's evident in this thread and elsewhere in the sub that at least a few anarchists disagree about the particulars of personal property.   This is an effective response in many situations where people want to talk about "good cops."  Of course police officers are human beings, and many of them are reasonably nice people; as mentioned elsewhere, police work is attractive to a certain set of society for purely practical reasons (e.g. nice pension   pay, no degree required).  But these folks have dedicated their careers to actively supporting and taking part in a system that violently oppresses entire classes of society.  Debating whether the people involved are good or bad is generally a diversion from meaningful discussion about the causes of police brutality and possible solutions.   Wow...beautiful track.  A bit simplistic, but nice.   I recently acquired a few ounces of Plum Pudding, which is the first genuine English style blend I've smoked.  My first reaction was...wow.  How many distinct flavors can there be in one tobacco!  In particular, I was amazed at how nuanced and unique the smokey flavors of (I believe) the Latakia were.  I've smoked and enjoyed many blends by now, each with their own character and evolution...but nothing with this level of complexity.  And yet, I didn't find it harsh or overwhelming.  For those of you who are familiar with many English blends and with Plum Pudding - do you find the general qualities of this blend are common to many other English?  Are there specific other blends you'd recommend, knowing that I enjoy Plum Pudding?  How does it compare?  Have you had a similar experience when you first tried English style blends?   Other people are debating already.  Debate can be a powerful learning process; you don't have to be knowledgeable in a subject to have a useful debate with someone on that subject.   Ah, yes...these are all good points, and that is a fascinating read.  In fact, it offers solutions to most of the problems posed by OP.   Those are bold claims.  You believe that lobbying is less powerful as a political force than decentralized communication between individuals on the internet?  Why is it, then, that [voting behavior in America serves the aims of capital holders at the expense of the people](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online aid=9354310)?    In actuality, I'd probably contact all my friends and relatives and see what they were doing about it.  Isn't that what most folks would do?  I'm pretty sure with 100 or so twenty and thirty somethings + their parents and no private property rights we could figure out a reasonably self-sufficient existence for ourselves.  But how does that relate to my hypothetical?  You think everybody would get food by doing oddjobs for this guy?   No, no.  I appreciate that OP is genuinely trying to debate this, and that they have some basic understanding of debate being a contest of ideas, where one tries to show through reason that an idea is true or false.  There are many folks in this sub who think it's a great place to call people names and dismiss their ideas as unworthy of discussion on the basis of their ethnic, political, or ideological group affiliation.  At least OP is trying.  Why not try to refute OP's ideas, or to convince OP of some alternate point of view?   I guess you've abandoned the claim that 3rd world labor exploitation is a problem with non-capitalist 3rd world governments, and isn't a fault of capitalist systems and firms. :P  ...  You've offered several ideas about how to keep capitalism and lose exploitation of labor from poorer countries.  Imposing a minimum wage on foreign labor sounds like a great way to drive innovation in robotics and artificial intelligence, which would certainly reduce exploitation of labor forces.  I doubt that it could ever pass in a country committed to capitalism and democracy, though.  Just imagine an American Congressperson introducing such legislation!  It'd be political suicide; their capital-holding supporters would withdraw their financial and mainstream media support and pour millions into pro-exploitation opponents in the next election.   It's not necessarily idealistic.  I think gigacannon is saying that it's *possible* to create a good anarchist society, and that we could do it together *with a great deal of hard work, without which it would fail*.  Sounds pretty realistic to me.  Where does gigacannon assume that everyone will commit their time and effort?  While we're at it, why should such a thing require *everyone*?   I don't believe that's true at all, in this context.  If I had no means of obtaining food, I would not cling to my individualism and start looking for seeds in the wild so that I could grow something and eat it.  I would look for others who knew how to get some food, or who had food and might give it to me.  I don't believe that I'm unique in that.  If everybody had to work directly with others to survive because no imposed system existed, I imagine most people would start working together.  That doesn't require that everybody become selfless or that nobody ever screwed anybody else in order to get what they want.  It just requires that it's in most people's apparent self-interest to cooperate.  Incidentally, that's what we've got right now:  it's in most people's self-interest to go along with whatever imposed system exists in order to get their needs met, so that's what people tend to do.  Perhaps anarchist systems exist in which it's in most people's interest to cooperate with others in a decentralized, non-hierarchical way.   Hmm...I'm not sure that's relevant to Nihilozero's objection.  Don't you see how exploitation of 3rd world laborers, accomplished through the control of capital by multinational corporations in order to export and sell goods in capitalist economies is relevant to your claim that state and corporate capitalism isn't working?  If you believe that the problem is with the governments in countries where laborers are being exploited, and that existing capitalist systems are not responsible for it, you should at least formulate an argument in favor of this view.  It seems fairly obvious to me that the entities doing the exploitation are responsible for their actions, and that the system that enables concentrated control of capital by those entities is also responsible.   That's a very different and more reasonable claim than the one you led with.  I wonder if the anarchists here have a good reply.   Most of this is not true; you seem to have false beliefs about what we know about prehistoric humans.  We don't know that prehistoric humans had single leaders.  We don't know that they lived in small, scattered groups; there is some evidence that they lived in small family groups during some periods, but we certainly don't know. We have no reason whatsoever to believe that they lacked complex emotions *or language*, nor that they were any less rational than humans are today (unless you go back to other *species* with a smaller brains; farther than the time you're talking about).  Where you getting these ideas?  Has some great scientific discovery been made of which I am ignorant?   Pot calling the kettle black :/  PM_ME_YOUR_BBQ may not be familiar with anarchism, but at least they have some understanding of debate and are attempting to engage in it.   Interesting...  How can socialist economics be implemented without a governing body that collects taxes under threat of force?   Ah, for sure.  Without the deterrent of existing criminal justice systems, violence and fear of violence would be widespread?   You're saying that without a government and police force like we have now, individuals would have inadequate defense against the violence of others.  Right?   I suppose those things are both true.  How does that imply that anarchism could only succeed if all people were perfect?   It's a necessary and good comment for this sub; I hope to see many more like it.  /r/Anarchism is filled with hierarchies.   Go outside and play!   Then why are you posting in /r/DebateAnarchism?   OP made an argument in support of his claim.  You claimed it was a straw man.  You each have a burden of proof, but only OP has attempted to deliver.  If you want to debate, it's on you to show why OP failed.  Simply claiming that he has is no refutation.   Why isn't it true?  This is a debate subreddit.   Why couldn't it work without everybody being perfect?   Is there any specific statement made in the OP that you take issue with?  Your comment adds nothing to this.   You might really enjoy taking MDMA with a friend you trust, or perhaps alone.  Since you have a tendency toward anxiety, you should only take it if you can get a reliably pure and measure dose, and take a small dose to start.  [MDMA](http://maps.org/research/mdma) is a very beautiful and healing substance in the right setting.  At low-moderate doses (~100mg) with good hydration and no overheating it is perfectly safe.  It can help you get back in touch with feelings of love and empathy for yourself and others.  It's not a psychedelic drug, but it has some similarities.  Taking psychedelic drugs is a more challenging thing for a person prone to anxiety and perhaps depression.  You will almost certainly experience anxiety on psychedelic drugs.  It can be very good - a transformative experience, even.  You can also have very difficult and unpleasant experiences.  You anxiety could come up, and grow, transforming into a psychedelic fueled beast.  There are many things you can do to influence the kind of experience you have, and techniques that you or a friend can use to guide psychedelic experiences.  But you can't necessarily control this experience, and you may be terrified by that at times (as most people who've used psychedelics sometimes are).  So I see psychedelics as an undertaking, especially for folks who come to them with a particular negative experience they'd like to transform.  A noble and good undertaking!  But not one to be taken lightly.  I encourage you to try it out, though.  You should only use psychedelics if you can obtain a reliably measured and pure dose.  For example, you could buy a few grams of shrooms and a scale.  2 grams of psilocybe cubensis is a good starting point; it won't be very strong, so you can get familiar with what shrooms are like without feeling overwhelmed.  Then you can try 2.5 or 3 grams next time, if you like (a week or more later).   Psychedelics can burn you hard, but the mental health industry can easily convince you that there's little hope for great change and that you have to take these little pills forever that block out many aspects of human experience.  Whatever you decide to consume, be careful. :)   In many psychedelic and consciousness expansion oriented communities, I see this strong interest in forming new ways of conceptualizing or explaining consciousness and/or reality.  It seems to me like the most wrong-headed approach a person could possibly take, short of setting out to confirm an existing conceptual model of consciousness / reality.  In my life, the most important thing I have learned from my efforts to learn by exploring the depths of human experience is to accept the primacy of subjective experience.  I know that everything I have experienced and ever could experience has been just that - a subjective experience.  Every conceptual model of reality, every idea, every perception, everything has been just that.  You say:  But folks, it's just in your brain. Breathe, close your eyes, exhale taking your horizon to the farthest stars, the depths of the mind, reckon reality's weight, open your eyes and realize it's all in your head.  And I'm with you - with one small, but extremely important shift.  That idea, that perception, that this is all in a *location*, and in the *brain* in particular, is itself subject to that same truth - this is all in my head, my brain.  The idea and experience of location is located?  In my brain?  And what is a brain?  Another idea, ultimately.  You might say "no, no - the *actual* brain, the *actual* location!"  What's that?  It's the idea of a brain beyond the idea of a brain.  If I truly believe in a brain, that belief seems psychotic - it contradicts itself in an infinitely repeating spiral of brains.  It's not unlike the belief that "everything is one."  ^Everything ^is..^one?  ^^What's ^^one?  ^^Is ^^one ^^one?  ^^^AGHSGHGHGh  Similarly, if I believe my experience to be a completely separate entity from some other existent something somewhere else, that belief contradicts itself.  My conception of a separate entity is part of this experience; my conception of subjective experience is part of this experience.  There's no escaping this; nothing outside this, and nothing beyond this.  As human beings, we have this tendency, this habit, to go about conceptually modeling our experience.  It's an imperfect system.  In my experience, examining the edge case contradictions carefully has relaxed my attachment to it and allowed me to see it for what it is - an imperfect tool for dealing with practical problems.  So I don't try to conceptualize reality as an end in itself.  I'm curious about future conceptual models, especially those that come from analytic philosophers operating on the findings and ideas of scientists.  But I have no expectation that they'll come up with a model that doesn't suffer this same problem, because it's not a problem of lacking information - it's a problem with the system of mind.  Mind did not evolve in order to apprehend the absolute truth of reality.  It appears to exist in order to solve day-to-day practical problems well enough to keep us animals alive long enough to successfully breed.  ...  That act, though, of looking up into the stars, of taking in the most vast and expansive scene...and acknowledging that it's reality.  I don't believe that the words, the conceptualization if necessary.  It can provoke an incredible shift, to acknowledge that this experience of vastness is apparently quite small, between my ears, and so on.  The activity of a brain.  But to stick on that idea, believing it to be true...what a mistake.  Not to say that you've made that mistake, in particular; your thought gave me quite a platform to launch from, but I do not know what was behind it (nor do I mean to assume that you believe any thought I've shared above).  Look at what is there, before your eyes!  In your mind!  In nobody's mind!  Before any idea about any brain or cosmos or you ever happened at all...   He's pretty easy to deal with before he's snowballed on ganks.  He has terrible stat gain and limited late-game damage.  He can be hit with untargeted spells while invisible, because his position is revealed.  What's the big deal?   Fuck that.  I see people in all kinds of ethnic groups espousing naive liberal bullshit.   He didn't say they fired live ammunition - only that they pointed guns loaded with live ammunition at him.  It's a big deal.   Oh god no please don't this swimming nonsense into reddit.   You've assumed that the pineal gland and the third eye are synonymous.  Why?   I've experienced strong effects from binaural beats and other forms of brainwave entrainment.  I've never used streamed audio for it; I wonder if the effect still works on heavily compressed source material.   I see "check your privilege" as one of those memes that only this special brand of simple-minded idiocy brought to you by years of mainstream/social media consumption can make appealing.  It's function seems to be to let you feel knowledgeable and superior while crippling any meaningful discussion of the complexities of life.   Not checking privilege is not an error in reasoning at all; it is simply an omission, a non-act.  A fallacy is a specific use of faulty logic.  It is like making a mistake on a math problem; when revealed, it is indisputable.  Ignorance alone is not a fallacy.  In this example, the error is the assumption that one's own experience is great evidence for what others have experienced.  It's pretty easy to point out this sort of error to a somewhat reasonable person in a way that they can hear and consider.  This is a great way to change the view of an intelligent person who's not on the defensive.  Aggressive demands like "check your privilege" are not a great way to change a person's view.  Just imagine...  "Check your privilege!"  "Why should I check my privilege?  I don't see any reason to believe I'm privileged - I worked hard for what I have.  All you see is an educated white guy, but I grew up poor and my grandma is from Israel.  Anyway I feel assaulted and this person is rude and doesn't make sense.  Fuck these anarchists - I'm going back to /r/politics!"   To me, that seems like such a strange thing to care about and identify with.  A person who is 1/8th Native must have about 7/8ths of other ancestries - and likely another ancestry holds the majority.  Why should such a person identify so strongly with their Native 1/8th as to be saddened by their lack of obvious Native features?  I don't mean this to be dismissive or unkind - I'm genuinely curious about your views on this, as you obviously have first-hand experience and care about it a great deal.  But on reading this now, it seems to me that I have about as much reason to identify as Irish, having an Irish-born great grandparent in my family tree.  But it would be a bit silly for me to lament my lack of visible Irish traits, wouldn't it?   :/   Why is that a sad fact?  What's wrong with looking white?   What use can it serve to reply to a fallacious argument with "check your privilege," which would not be better served by pointing out the error in reasoning?  Any time fallacy has been committed, a direct and straightforward refutation can be made.  Why respond to faulty logic in a way that invites the person to miss the point entirely, when you could simply point out the faulty logic?   I don't believe that such people exist; there's no way to answer this question without acknowledging its baseless assumption that drugs turn people into nutters.   Hmm...yeah, sure.  Though it's far off topic.  You said:   News is easy to digest. The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that don't really concern our lives and don't require thinking.   lol, no it isn't. maybe the news you read is like that, but most news that actually is interesting enough to read has humoungous complex ramifications that not even a expert could fully understand on their own.  The article says that news is easy to digest.  Indeed, a great deal of news is easy to digest and trivial.  Instead of disputing this, you say that the claim is false because any news that's "interesting enough to read" isn't this way.  On a strict literal reading of the article's statement, you might think this is just fine.  But the argument's intent is clearly not to claim that every bit of news ever made is trivial and easy to digest.  It's talking about the general trend, the majority.  That there is some interesting and thought-provoking news somewhere is no contradiction to the claim that the vast majority of news is simplistic drivel.  In common speech, that would be said "News is simplistic drivel."  Kind of like how we can say "cats have four legs."  I'm not claiming that there are no three-legged cats when I say that.  * News is simplistic drivel * But *real* news is actually quite thought-provoking * Therefore news is not simplistic drivel  The conclusion does not follow.  You could characterize this as a variant of "No True Scotsman."  Is there some news somewhere that's actually quite complex and thought provoking?  Perhaps.  Does that change the rest of the news?  No.   I guess it doesn't bother you then.  You have patterns of thinking that lead to false conclusions, and you like it that way.  Oh well! :D   Haha, yeah.  If you accepted the idea that claims argued poorly are necessarily false, you'd have quite a collection of false claims...   There are important differences.  In particular, using a loan to start a business doesn't satisfy the hypothetical situation posed by your capitalist debate partner.  Although plenty of people use cash to start businesses, and occasionally even small businesses, this hypothetical is irrelevant to most compelling situations where anarchists and capitalist libertarians disagree.  Yes, sometimes a worker is able to generate enough money or equity to acquire means of production and work for themselves or even start a corporation.  But this represents a vanishingly small proportion of economic activity in capitalist economies on the scale of an actual state (let alone multinational economies).  In reality, the vast majority of economic activity comes from a relatively small number of entities that together control almost all capital.    Do workers ever start small businesses?  Yes.  Marxism has a word for these folks, and it isn't flattering.  They do not matter, and it does not matter if their contribution to the economy is simultaneously capitalist and ethical.  In any existent capitalist economy, they are utterly dwarfed by the true players - whose actions cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be construed as ethical.  For what it's worth.  There are many ways to go with this kind of hypothetical, but I honestly don't have any patience for it.  It's just a diversion from the actual problems of capitalism, imo.   Yeah...it's not salvia, and there's a good chance that its impregnated with dangerous novel synthetic chemicals.  Don't test it on human subjects.   Of course, of course.  It won't hurt, but it isn't something to rely on either.  Urinary pH influences the rate of elimination of amphetamine; perhaps taking a large dose of vitamin C or of citric acid (juice) would influence this enough to reduce the duration of an experience already underway, but I'm quite skeptical.  Coadministration with acidic juices is another matter, and certainly can effect absorption of amphetamine on an empty stomach.   Yes, that's true.  Although half-life doesn't translate directly into duration of effect, given such a long half-life I wouldn't expect the effect to be mostly gone by hour 6.  My experience with IR adderall was that I would not sleep for at least 8 hours after a low dose (10 or 20mg).  People do vary quite a bit in their ability to sleep on the trailing end of a stimulant drug experience, though.  I wouldn't take oral amphetamine past noon if I wanted to sleep at 10:30, but I also wouldn't drink a cup of coffee past 2pm.   This isn't true at all. :/   That's highly unlikely.  I did a quick search but was unable to find an easy, kitchen chemistry method for defeating the time release of dextromethorphan polistirex.  Perhaps it's out there.  There are whispers all over drugs forums about some post somewhere that reports a lemon juice method that works, but I couldn't find a reliable description.  If you're dosing tonight, I'd just take it as is.   Yeah, I have no problem with your answer dude.   The degree of dependence differs between them.  It's relevant.  Askdrugs is a harm reduction sub.   Dependence will occur with regular use of benzodiazepenes at a decent dosage in just about anybody...it should certainly be a factor considered in a decision between benzodiazepenes.  OP's doctor has surely considered it, and that may even be their primary reason for switching OP off Xanax.   Lorazepam (Ativan) is shorter acting than Clonazepam, which makes it a better candidate for recreational use.  However, it is slightly more habit forming; you'll likely have greater difficulties with dependence and withdrawal on lorazepam than clonazepam.  They have quite similar effects apart from duration in my experience.   Well, I think you'd benefit greatly from reading through your post with the poster up, identifying each fallacy you used.  I don't imagine you care.  But I thought I'd give it a try.  The errors in reasoning are there; your thinking is faulty.  Doesn't that bother you?   For sure...I had a good chuckle at the irony as I began reading, too.   It's not a news article.  It's a reprinted excerpt of an essay.   This is an edited extract from an essay first published at dobelli.com. The Art of Thinking Clearly: Better Thinking, Better Decisions by Rolf Dobelli  It's ironic for the Guardian to republish an extract of this essay, but it's not a news piece.  Did you read it?  It's quite obviously an analytic essay, which is about as far from news copy as you can get without being a novel.   This is an edited extract from an essay first published at dobelli.com. The Art of Thinking Clearly: Better Thinking, Better Decisions by Rolf Dobelli  Reading news inhibits your ability to distinguish the source of the material you're reading! :P   It's no refutation to simply claim that an argument is baseless, its author a moron, and so on.  You would benefit from a [basic education in common errors in reasoning](http://i.imgur.com/OOA8QzF.jpg).  Most of your replies contain at least one - all of which can be found on the linked poster!  If you truly believe that any specific statement in the article was false, you could do yourselves and us a service by attempting to refute it.  Go ahead - find a line or reasoning in the article with a conclusion that you believe doesn't follow, quote it here, and then show why it's wrong.   (Just in case anybody cares to read this long, tangential rambling)  Well...I don't have a particular take on plant consciousness, I guess.  But I don't have a particular take on human consciousness, either.  I studied cognitive neuroscience, comparative neurobiology, philosophy, and psychology for a few years at university.  I've practiced mindfulness and used psychedelics and other tools to learn about human experience directly.  I lost a lot of beliefs about life and consciousness through all of this, because I realized that I have no reason to believe that I am conscious - that consciousness is in any way particularly associated with me or my humanness.  There are things that it's like to be human.  There's something that it's like to see blue, to feel a touch, to think a particular thought, and so on.  These experiences depend on different parts of the human body functioning a certain way. Some of these dependencies are well mapped by scientists, like the parts of the visual cortex that do the calculations that map the edges of objects.  You won't see edges without that activity occurring.  But there's no particular reason why those cells relating to one another that way should look like edges; they do the math that calculates edges, but so can many things.  They're cells, but so are many cells.  People have told me that the perception of edges must be in the neurons that calculate the shape of edges, and other variations on that theme.  Well, which part?  Is it this neuron, or that?  Is it the whole network?  If so, then shouldn't any network of neurons have a subjective experience associated?  And what about other cells?  And what about non-cell molecules that are arranged similarly?  Etc.  There doesn't seem to be any way to draw a line between any particular thing that has subjective experiences (like a part of a network of cells, or a brain, or an organism) and some other thing that doesn't without entailing some logical contradiction.  And when I examine my own experience directly through mindfulness, I notice that things I take to be conscious, to be me, easily lose that quality of seeming awareness and dissolve whenever I cease to identify with them.  Subjectively, there doesn't seem to be any entity that consciousness is associated with in particular.  But there's something that it's like to experience everything I've ever experienced, and I have no reason to believe that's different beyond what I can experience.  So, I imagine there's something that it's like to be a plant, or some part of a plant, or any part of a plant, and that it's related to the way that plants interact with other things (the way that the particulars of human visual experience are related to the way our eyes and nerves and brains and so on interact with our world).  And I imagine there's something that it's like to be dirt, and rocks, and air, that's somehow related to what air and dirt and rocks are from other perspectives.  ...  It's quite funny to me, now, that to many people, the idea that plants (or bacteria, or rocks) have some kind of experience is controversial, is a claim that requires evidence.  Has anybody ever seen anything that wasn't some kind of experience?  Of course not.  So shouldn't the controversial claim, the claim that would require some great weight of evidence, be the claim that something somewhere *isn't* having an experience?   Great article.  Much of what they say about news applies equally to most of reddit.   Only the orientals are safe   Seconded.  Remember not to scrimp on quality thermal compound, either.  Correctly applied, it'll drop your core temperature by 12 to 16 C.   Really?  I read through the thread and I honestly can't see how banning Nyoza would improve the subreddit.  Is the goal to become a circlejerk where everybody sees everything exactly the same way?   I resonate with much of what you said, but I do feel that it's oversimplifying very complex social dynamics.  I see your opening as a kind of false middle ground appeal.  The existence of extremes doesn't imply that a middle ground would be superior to either extreme, nor that both extremes have their place - any more than it implies that one or the other extreme is superior.  Do you know what I mean?  It's very bold to claim that some balance between violence and complete obedience is the way of progress.  Many great things have been accomplished through violent revolution, and many great things have been accomplished through pacifism.  It's not obvious what any particular person or movement should do at any particular time.   Ho ho!  May the clear light of an unclouded intellect shine upon your ebony man-curls as the first rays of dawn!  May the frigid salty spray of incontrovertible insight dash upon the rocks of your chiseled captainesque countenance!  edit: seriously I wish you no ill.  cheers..   I never called you childish - I called your line of reasoning childish.  Was it a personal attack?  I don't think so, but it's debatable.  In the context of that conversation it was no more impolite than what it followed.  Anyway, goodbye.  I only have so much time and I'd like to spend it another way now.  I wish you the best.  May the light of reason one day shine upon your blessed black beard!   It's no lie.  Look at each reply you made.  Not one of them addresses the *actual claim being made and its underlying reasoning*.  You quote me, and then you attack me.  But what you don't do is make any specific logical objection to any specific thing I've said.  Debate is not just vehement disagreement going back and forth.  When you quoted me saying that your definition of racism is not common or useful, you support that I never claimed it was not valid.  You know why?  Because I never used the word valid, and you didn't make any argument to show that my argument entailed it not being valid.  If you had, then I could have conceded the point or offered  rebuttal or whatever, and we could debate.  Because all you've done is quote me and express violent disagreement, there is no debate to be had.  Do you see the difference?  It's about reason.  Logic.  Addressing the idea instead of making it personal.   Really...you tell me that pointing out flaws in your reasoning and trying to convince you to address the idea instead of abusing me *in a debate subreddit* is bad because I should "refute the central point, and not the character of the person" as per the rules.  In the same post, you look up my posting history, call me a libertarian because I've posted in r/bitcoin, and tell me to go back to /r/libertarian and leave /r/debateanarchism?  Meh.  I guess I'll give up on you seeing reason for now.  I keep trying to think of something to say to how you still think I've questioned whether your definition of racism is valid, but all I would say is what you already quoted me saying.  It's as though you don't speak English. :/  Ok bye.   I have seen similar things.  It's a real bummer to meet people who seem to be into anarchism, freedom, dismantling oppression, etc...and then it turns out they're the evil twins of white bigotry.  Like most anti-rational hate mongering, this too is weak and failing.  Yay :D   Come on!  I am not arrogant and I'm not a troll.  I'm trying to get you to engage in debate, which is the purpose of this sub.  Debate can only happen when at least two people agree to engage in rational discourse.  When you reply to my postings only to insult me or to pretend that I've said one thing when in fact I said another, no debate can occur.  Which is a bummer, because debate is excellent!  That is why I keep suggesting that you address the logic, the reason.  You know things that I don't know.  I know things that you don't know.  I could be wrong about everything I've claimed in this thread!  I don't know yet because nobody has attempted to refute me.   Why don't you follow the rules of this subreddit and its topic?  This is a debate sub.  If you disagree with an argument I've made, please tell me why it's flawed.  Then we could have a debate ! :D  I never questioned whether it was a valid definition, whatever that means to you.  It's internally consistent.  I said it was a useful concept.  But it's not a common definition.  I did a little reading and learned that it's a significant, but fringe definition used by some sociologists.  Perhaps its also common among some anarchist subcultures?   Your source wasn't relevant to my claim that its not a common definition.  You have yet to address that..  edit:  /r/Libertarian is not how I came to this sub.  There is little or no good debate to be had there.   Hey, I made a light jab at you while making a relevant point about your linguistics derail trolling, and I moved on.  My jab doesn't change anything about the value of the arguments I've made before, during, and after it.  Whether any particular argument I've posed to you is sound remains to be seen, as you have yet to address anything I've said...  Or, for that matter, anything anybody has said.  Every reply I see by you here misses the point and attempts to refute a straw-person.. at best.   Capn Blackbeard, I'm beginning to suspect that your interest in posting in /r/DebateAnarchism is not, in fact, to debate anarchism.  I've pointed out a clear and, at this point, obvious flaw in your reasoning - and your response is to flame me.  Why?  Why not refute my reasoning, as I appear to have refuted yours?   I never claimed that you are the only person who uses the definition of racism that, in this thread, only appears to be held by you.  I claimed that it is not a commonly held or particularly useful definition of racism.  That it's been used in a book, a blog post, and on an anarchist website is no contradiction.  Perhaps it would be more useful to discuss the use of this definition within various subcultures at present, or to discuss the merits and detriments of various definitions of racism, or to discuss anything at all without resorting to faulty rhetoric and personal attacks.   Blatant straw person argument - come on, Capn Blackbeard. blackrosesinwinter did not claim that words work just fine without any consensus of meaning at all - they simply claimed, quite reasonably, that language works without "having strict definitions for every word."  You're not trying to understand other people's point of view, or even to understand their posts in the most basic sense.  Why even talk?   I'm with you.  Capn Blackbeard has a boner for making everybody use their definition of racism, correcting people for using language the way they use language.  It's childish and accomplishes nothing.   You're just nitpicking semantics now.  Like several others in this thread, I don't think your definition of racism is commonly held or useful.  You should find a new word.  edit:  It's a useful concept, it just doesn't make sense to call it racism when the etymology and common usage of the word directly contradict your preferred use.    I really don't agree that they "only perpetuate racism," as using racism like that robs it of any power. If we can say that me calling a black person the n word, and them calling me a cracker are both racism, then its useless as a word because those are such qualitatively different things.  I suspect that you have a good point, but you've overstated it so strongly as to be absurd.  There is use for a concept that captures derogatory use of the word nigger, that also captures derogatory use of the word cracker.  If you think that racism should only refer to discrimination based on race that is directed toward people who aren't white, you should present an argument in favor (or at least present a coherent, rational position).   I've dealt with a fair amount of psychedelic anxiety.  My approach has been to buy a scale and measure doses, taking fairly low doses often as a way to engage with my anxiety and learn to relax with the experience of a drug.  It's worked well for me.  Over time, I've grown much more accepting of the loss of control that comes with high doses.  A scale that can accurately weigh doses of 10, 20, or 30mg is fairly expensive, but is an absolute necessity when preparing doses of a substance like psilacetin.  Psilacetin is comparable to psilocin and shrooms.  Just use the same literature as a guide you would use for shrooms, but dose according to specific advice for dosing psilacetin (like the advice from tozy92 above).   No - it's not normal.  But for now, try to take your mind off it, stay hydrated, don't take any more drugs until you've come down.  Relax.  But unless you start feeling worse, the best thing you can do now is to chill out and sober up.  If you feel worse, go to the ER.  Otherwise, call a doctor tomorrow, tell them you had chest pain that scared you, and get your heart checked out.  It's the only sane thing to do.  And, of course, **don't do any more stimulant drugs**.  And lay off the weed as well until you've seen a doctor and confirmed that you're ok.   Sounds like a pretty normal low dose experience.  Visual effects come at higher doses than effects on internal perceptions, mood, thought process, etc.  Though most would experience some visuals at a 3 gram dose, people vary in their response, and shrooms vary in potency.  I'd suggest trying the same dose with a proper week-long break from the SSRI before upping the dose, though.  But if that yields a similar result, he could try 4g after that.  Could be quite a different experience. ^_^   I disagree.  It sounds to me like he was quite conflicted, and tried to change what was happening while working there until he finally gave up and then *continued to try to change it from the outside*.  There's no need to demonize someone just because he happened to be a cop for a few years.   You shouldn't have.  Almost every piece of writing intended for popular consumption has some disgustingly common misuse of jargon that will offend any person who knows the field where that jargon originated.  Why let that stop you from reading a thought-provoking and insightful opinion piece by a former cop who should really know better than to call a magazine a clip?   The internet, unlike real life, never forgets.  That isn't a good thing.  People change constantly, and their past should be allowed to soften and...well, pass.  Yet I see a string of hateful comments from people who won't accept your apology, or at least keep their anger about things long gone to themselves.  Why hold on to things said years ago, views expressed that are no longer held?  Life is not like that.  Why behave so childishly just because you're on the internet?  If you can't forgive, at least let your misguided anger go unspoken.  It serves no useful purpose.   The negative effects that marijuana has on memory are substantial, and you have good reason to be concerned for your girlfriend's ability to perform in school.  Perhaps you could help her by sharing this excellent news from the world of science: [at least some of the negative effects on memory can be blocked by pretreatment with an NSAID or other anti-inflammatory food or drug](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/in-mice-anti-inflammatories-amelior-13-11-21/).  Your girlfriend could keep smoking just as she is now, but add some anti-inflammatory foods to her diet (e.g. ginger, turmeric) and take less of a hit to her memory.   If it does effect the trip, it will only reduce the effects of the shrooms.  So you have nothing to fear from an interaction; the worst case is disappointment.  Although by now, I suppose you've already tripped.  Please share how it went!  It could be useful information for another Celexa user searching reddit one day.   Yes, whey protein is absorbed very quickly relative to casein and common whole food proteins.  This is probably why it's so effective post-workout.   Yeah...JigabooFriday needs to share more details, this doesn't sound like any DXM-only reaction I've ever heard of.   That's true, but misleading.  Black market synthetic drugs often contain active byproducts of the production process.  Perhaps purity is not the right word here, as it's common for amphetamine to be combined with an inert binder and pressed into pills (which is obviously not a problem).  At any rate, I can't advise you about judging the quality of black market amphetamine as I haven't used it since my early college years.  It should be easy enough [in this day and age](/r/darknetmarkets) to buy some diverted pharmaceutical amphetamine if you have concerns about the quality of what's available.     If you get reasonably pure amphetamine, there should be little or no noticeable difference.  The only significant difference you should find is with Adderall extended release.  You can approximate the effect of extended release by dividing a single dose into two doses, taken several hours apart.  There will be minor differences in the effect and potency because of differing ratios between the two isomers of amphetamine.  Amphetamine is a chiral molecule; it exists in multiple, chemically equivalent forms that mirror one another but behave slightly differently.  In the case of amphetamine, the difference in activity between the two isomers is not great.  Adderall has a set ratio between them (1:3).  I'm not sure about street amphetamine's isomer ratio, but I imagine it varies.  That said, you're unlikely to be able to tell the difference at equivalent doses.                        Hello!  I've been smoking a pipe for a few months and enjoy it quite a bit.  I'm about to restock on tobacco and am looking for suggestions.  I've only tried a few blends so far.  I tried Orlik Golden Sliced and didn't really care for it.  I enjoyed Peter Stokkebye Luxury Bulls Eye Flake quite a bit.  I didn't like the smoky taste of a generic English blend I found locally, nor the ketchup of a Mclelland's bulk Virginia/Perique.  I don't have a clear understanding of what flavors and characteristics correspond to different varieties of tobacco, beyond some basics (e.g. Orlik probably burned hot because it's mostly Virginia, Latakia is smoky), so I'm at a bit of a loss going forward.  Anybody have a suggestion that someone who enjoyed Peter Stokkebye Luxury Bulls Eye Flake and doesn't like smokey Latakia flavors or ketchup might enjoy as well?  edit:  thanks for the suggestions, plenty of good ideas to go on for this restock. :)  	104
 I'm pretty sure he's trying to get insurance money   She doesn't look super concerned...   You should call him back.   Hooray for reposts!    Omg! 2spooky4 me! This sub sucks nowadays...   All about that flick bout that flick no tapping   That could be worst   Well I was just there with the Realtor, that place is beyond massive.

 Probably a mistake when answering.   Leaving them around can be demoralizing sometimes. I had a friend who'd leave copies of a political magazine around his campus, putting them in the library, coffee shops, so on, and they never got touched in his months of work. They were always visible too.    I had my height marked as 5'10 for a while because that's what my tailor told me I was. Met up with a girl who was also 5'10, found myself being three inches shorter. The more you know.   She's not? Oh.   Yes, so I can gauge their personality and see what we have in common.   It doesn't? shit.   I hope not. Where else can I validate my existence? :ccc   Your main is a little weak. It's fuzzy, not very clear.  Also, use "I" a lot less when starting your sentences so there's better flow.  I've never dated but I guess everyone starts somewhere.  Don't mention that.  Your "six things" are generic, try being a little more unique to catch someone's attention.  "I don't get along well with my parents."  If you're going to mention the above, try and spin it in a positive way. Ex:I don't get along well with my parents because they're not on my level.  You require your match to have a good sense of humor, but I'm not getting a lot of laughter from your profile.   Add a link to your profile   I care to an extent. I'd like to have a partner who I relate to with the type of work I do (non-profit). At the very least, I'd like a partner who feels like they're contributing to their community, however they see fit.   If you have a smart phone, do some self timer shots. That's what I've done, and it works out rather well.   Like your main! Good choice.  Attempting to get that one figured out right now.  So is every other millennial. Not really necessary.  Otherwise, not bad, but I'd some more activities in there with what you do in your free time (and try and make them exciting).   Everything feels very bland. You opener doesn't really say anything special to catch my attention. What's to separate you from other students at UW?   I can be active but as far as that goes at the moment is running on the treadmill  This is an awkward sentence.  I tend to be more active during the daytime.  Doing what? Expand.  I'd use the dog photo as your main as well.   Most of my visitors tend to be male too, as I'm also listed as bi. For some reason I thought I'd get high quality message from guys on occasion, but that's yet to really happen. All of them have been low quality.     Your "What I'm Doing" sections feels a little boring. There's some interesting stuff there that could be spiced up a bit.   Otherwise, not bad, and I like your main.   Nothing terrible. I'd say your personality sticks out well. Though I'm not much a fan of the main, since shirtless picks can be a turnoff to a lot of people (even though you're not showing a lot off, I could see it bothering some girls). Like most of your other pics though!   I did! It looks pretty cool. Seems it has a lot of community support.  But you're right, it's not revolutionary. But that doesn't mean what an NGO does, like your parent's one, isn't doing anything "useful". Until any revolution comes, it's the duty of the able and the willing to be as helpful towards the poor. Until then, any aid to the poor is useful, needed, and totally appropriate..   I disagree. Helping individuals is always useful. I work for an NGO which helps the homeless, and we manage to put clients in housing, help them find employment, and get the benefits they're entitled to. We're a "but, for" program, meaning "but for us, these people would be homeless", and typically that's very true, as we serve a rural area which is lacking in resources.  Now, are we revolutionizing the world around us? Are we changing things for an entire area? No. But we're contributing to the lives of the poor, and building their lives up. Sure, I could say that it's not useful to help people on individual basis, and I could say lifting these people off the streets isn't useful either, but that'd be a total lie because it's useful *to them*.   You want to aid the working class? Work with what you got right now until something else comes along (or until you change something), because the lives of the poor (homeless, slaves, so on) matter, each and every one. If you can't care for the individual, why care for the working class at all? If you can't put enough effort or care enough to aid those in poverty *right now* by any means necessary, regardless of what system is in place, then how can you ever help them?  Awareness raised in the consumers of first-world media does nothing.  Not all the time. Check out what happened to the CEO of Firefox when it was revealed (even though it had been public since 2008) that he donated to keep gay marriage from becoming legal in California with Prop 8. Once consumers found out, he was ousted from his job because he didn't reflect the values of his consumers. World changing? No. A strong message? Yes.   At the very least, consumer activism brings awareness to those outside of the anarchist movement, and boycotts are more easily sold upon the general public. By doing campaigns which are inclusive of nearly every ideology, you're able to bring non-profits and human rights groups to the table, who are much more active and influential when it comes to these sort of things (and so far I don't see any anarchist groups doing what you're suggesting).    The DMing was a bit much. I could see how that could be totally creepy to someone. Inappropriate.   You never know why people stop talking to you, but a lot of the time it has nothing to do with you personally.   I like your main, but as someone else wrote, nothing stands out. I don't get much of anything that makes you seem unique.  You could definitely make your TV job seem a bit more exciting.   The secret message no one seems to have gotten :cccc   Hi! I'm looking for an apartment/trailer/whatever or roommate deal in either Rock Springs or Green River. I'm able to sign up to a 6-mo lease, and at most can afford $500/mo total for Green River, or $450/mo total for Rock Springs (so I can have some extra gas money for my commute to Green River).  I've already called every listing I found in the classifieds for the local papers, so if you know an open place not listed there, shoot me a line. Thanks!   Whoa. I saw that speaker at a FEE conference and SFL Regional Conference. So weird seeing him on a LL video.  Thanks for sharing.   Well you see, since the Koch Bros donate to SFL, there's got to be shady business, right?  But more seriously, people think *way* too highly of SFL and YAL. They expect there to be some sort of conspiracy, where we're all getting told how to manipulate the beliefs of ignorant college kids.    Sure! It'd be my pleasure.   We never got any propaganda. You can see more or less what we learned here: http://studentsforliberty.org/webinar-program/list/  Our training and guidance was less about ideology, and more about organisation, handling funds, networking, etc.   That's awesome. I was probably going to do the same thing, but left to pursue different work.   ISFLC was still one of my best experiences. Seeing Jeffery Tucker plastered at a bar was amazing.   Whoa, so weird seeing another ex-SFLer here! What level of executive? Like, regional director? I was a campus coordinator.    Not helping directly, but there's a lot of discussion on how the state meddles with those only trying to help:   http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/search?q=homeless restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all   Just remember that atheists are still human, and humans are prone to bias, emotions, and mistakes. Not believing in a deity does not remove one of bigotry or hate.   I had totally forgotten about that. What an amazing putdown.    My parents sent me a care package, with two cans of clam chowder inside. I've never been so happy.   All these low gas prices are making me jealous. It's $2.75 for here in Central Wyoming. I thought it'd be cheaper here, cuz y'know, we can't all those oil fields.   I talked with a kid once who's parents were atheists, and they kicked his brother out when he turned to Islam. Don't know the full story though.  Beyond that, I'm sure this happens from time to time.   I suspect this is partially because they have basically no real-life organization or power.  They are organized on the academic level in the US. Students For Liberty, Young Americans for Liberty, the Mises Institute, Cato all have AnCaps within them.  But more so, I worked with AnCaps with Students For Liberty, and I found everyone to be pretty normal 20 something year olds. Can't imagine any of them wanting to hurt anything more than a fly.   All lives do matter, however, there are times where we need to have specific conversations about specific things. Your friend is shifting the conversation away from narrow, to general. This makes it harder to have workable dialogues for certain marginalized groups. And be mindful that the solving of LGBT and black issues will take different kind of work, as both come from different contexts. LGBT folk, for example, can hide the fact that they are gay, and so are able to avoid profiling form police, while black people lack the ability to change their skin tone, and so are more easily profiled and harassed by law enforcement.   And THAT is why I moved to Wyo.   Voluntarists certainly do have an understanding of that argument, they just disagree with it.    Even if I could find some common ground with a fascist or a nazi there is no way I would ally myself with them.  What if an AnCap offered you the chance to help the poor, to, say, help feed the homeless? In such an instance, what matters more; your beliefs, or the struggles of those who suffer worse than almost all of us?   When you say "side with" these groups, what exactly do you mean? Do you mean if some sort of anarchist commune was to start up, AnCaps would be excluded, or do you mean that if AnCaps held a rally against war, you'd refuse to participate? If it's the former, then I understand, but I don't understand the latter.   I myself will work with anyone who offers me a way to aid the poor. Ideology matters less than the horrible conditions our fellow human beings are living under. A poor man doesn't care who feeds him, just only that he is fed.   I work with a homeless program, and a lot of our clients hitchhike from place to place, and eventually wind up with us.   One guy got kicked out of his mother-in-laws, and had to take himself, his wife, and his 3 young kids from Billings, Montana to central Wyoming.    1) Mobile apps for Reddit, like Alienblue, allow upvoting and downvoting, regardless of what the subreddit has for rules.   2) There is an option to turn off "subreddit style" which allows for upvoting and downvoting  3) In RES, there are keyboard shortcuts for downvoting, which circumvent not being able to see them.    YouTube has the [Oxford Debates](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=oxford+debates page= utm_source=opensearch), and often think tanks will host debates. Also, there's [Question Time](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=question++time) in the UK, where policy is discussed a lot.   Hi all!   I moved to a different state for my service, and am thinking about transferring to one of the local four year colleges after I finish. Since I would have been here for more than a year by the time I would start taking classes, I should qualify for in-state tuition, but I'm not really sure. I know every school has different requirements, but does anyone else have experience qualifying for in-state tuition in a new state after their year of service?       I've found a few links and lesson plans via Google, but want to know what others have specifically used to aide them in their teaching of First Day School. This month I'll be teaching for the first time as my Meeting opens up a new First Day School to accommodate new and interested members.        Whether it's entire nations or small towns, are there any trends in spotting the causes of secession? Does a certain part of the population tend to be in a certain situation (extreme poverty, lack of good food, lack of political power, etc.)? Could we name similarities between, say, the push for Scottish independence, and the breaking up of Sudan, or is each secession (or the attempt of) unique?    Hello /r/wyoming!  I work with the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF), a division of the [Southwest Wyoming Recovery Access Program](http://www.swwrap.com). Our SSVF program helps homeless or at risk veterans and their families find sustainable housing by providing rental assistance, case management, and connecting the vet and their family to needed resources (food stamps, employment services, etc). We have offices throughout the state, and are expanding our locations in due time.  We are currently looking for partners to work with us in eliminating homelessness within our veteran communities. If you're unaware, 2015 is the year that veteran homelessness should end, as pushed by both the VA and Governor Meed.  Our partners would sign agreements (MOUs) with us to help refer homeless or at risk veterans and their families to our program so we can case manage and help them transition out of poverty (or the danger of). These partners can be municipalities, non-profits, for-profit businesses, or government programs. We're also really interested in developing agreements with landlords who are willing to house our clients (again, we do provide rental assistance, but we work to make sure the vet is able to live off on their own without our assistance by case managing their situation.  If you're at all interested in helping out and want to learn more, shoot me a PM or email at dmorris@swwrap.com, and do the same if you know a veteran who is homeless or is in danger of being homeless. We are interested in working with just about any entity, anywhere in the state of Wyoming.  Here's a [brief article](http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2014/01/06/news/20local_01-06-14.txt#.VJiriWvDUA) about our program by Wyoming Tribune Eagle.  Thank you, and happy holidays!  -Dan   News broke today that the US and Cuba will attempt to resume diplomatic relations, breaking a cold relationship between the two governments that has lasted several decades. Does this affect 2016 at all? Could the issue of Cuba play a large role in who becomes the next president? Or will it be a side issue, as more important matters take center stage during the debates? How do you imagine certain possible candidates responding to all of this, if they were a part of the debates?  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/americas/us-cuba-relations.html?_r=0         His account hasn't been active in the longest of times. Where'd he go?               Hi! I'm Dan, and I'm the most optimistic motherfucker you'll ever meet. In fact, it'll probably annoy the shit out of you half the time, but that just means you've got to try and up the anti to match my enthusiasm for everything.   Face and junk (on the right):  http://i.imgur.com/bmDh1Ya.jpg  I'm moving to Wyoming from Massachusetts soon. Wyoming, if you didn't know, lies in the middle of nowhere. Why am I moving there? I felt a little lost after a stint with college, and so I've joined Americorps to help homeless veterans get off the street, and give them a roof over their heads. I like helping people, and I volunteer often (mostly as a tutor). Like every 20 year old, I have no idea what I want to do, but I'm hoping it'll be something positive and impacting. The most rewarding feeling I get is giving my all for the betterment of someone else.   I get involved politics a lot, too. While I'm not grounded in all of my beliefs, I think it's important to be be a part of democracy. I'll knock on doors, hammer phones, or throw leaflets in people's faces for a cause I think is worth fighting for.   When I'm not being helpful to others, I'm playing civilization 5 (and losing), trying to get better at my shitty Chinese, reading the news, having arguments with strangers on the intertewbs (and losing), going around into the wilderness, or cooking myself food (and failing).   I'm an unemployment...I mean history major. Get me drunk, and I'll rant about US-Sino relations. Trust me, it'll be worth it. And on occasion I play dress up with my local freemasonry lodge, usually donning an old hat, sword, apron, and a pair of 18th century pants and shirt.  Like this: http://i.imgur.com/HqaveQ5.jpg  I mostly listen to chill music, chip tunes, alt-rock or alt-pop. Movies are sci-fi or thrillers. TV: 30 Rock, Parks and Rec, Lillyhammer, House of Cards, ST:TNG, The West Wing, X-Files, lots of animation (Bobs Burgers, Adventure Time, etc). And for reading: Phillip K Dick, history, law, public policy, and some Chinese novels which I struggle to understand.  I'm looking for friends, IRL or otherwise (no preference) to be silly with. I'm rarely serious unless prompted to be so. Typing, camming or using mics are all okay to me! Skype is my main mode of communication. I need someone who I can talk with pretty frequently, though. I'll be living far away from any meaningful civilization (it *is* Wyoming), so I may need the company!   Oh, and please be talkative. I can talk a lot, and need some sort of counter balance so I don't overload and explode.   Looking forward to our new immature friendship.         I'll be living in Wyoming soon, which has a population of 500,000 or so. I've noticed that not a lot of people from WY seem to use OKC (Craigslist is more popular), but those in the lower states (CO   UT) use OKC a lot more. I might be willing to travel that far for a date or two, but that seems kind of costly. Even if I do visit those states and find someone, would it be worth it? Are LDRs common for this part of the country? Is this how dating out here works for the younger crowd? Does it look desperate to be willing to drive 5+ hours for a date?  If anyone else has had experience using OKC in low populated areas, I'd appreciate your input!    I'll be starting my VISTA program next month, and I've had so many questions before my PSO. My supervisor has been absolutely wonderful in accommodating all my inquiries, talking to me whenever that's needed. What's more, I'll be arriving at my project site on Thanksgiving, and she's offered to take the day off to welcome me to the area.   With all the negative posts here, I thought it'd be good to share something positive. I can tell that she's working hard to make sure all the VISTAs in her state transition well to their new jobs.   So thanks Tammy! You've helped me be more calm about this huge change in my life.    In English it's easy to show stuttering by repeating letters (ex: "H-hello, how are y-you?"). How do you do this in Chinese. Can you?   Back when I was attending middle school 6-7 years ago, "Mousey" became a celebrity with all my friends. He roamed down in the harbor smoking and talking to people. I never met him, but I heard a lot of stories. He may have been the only homeless man in all of Scituate at the time.   I'm pretty sure he's since passed (I may have seen an obituary for him in the Scituate Mariner), but I don't know for certain. Does anyone know what happened to him?   Constantly we see posters being called out for fake stories in various subs, and we even have /r/quityourbullshit and /r/thathappened, which amongst other things, tackle posters lying about an event happening to them.   I can see why people would be upset at someone lying about their credentials ("As a lawyer/doctor/teacher...") as that could provide false information about a profession, or lying about factual things ("America is the smallest country in the world") but if someone lies about an encounter they had with someone or something, why does it matter if the story is false, if everyone seems to enjoy what they read?       As students head back to the classroom, those that are interested in activism have a lot of choices. Most of these groups are American, so feel free to add any other groups that are elsewhere in the world.   **Students For Liberty (SFL)** - A worldwide nonprofit dedicated to building a network of student libertarians of all flavors, from moderates to AnCaps. SFL gives out free books to student groups, sells activism kits (stickers, banners, etc), and probably most important, runs several worldwide conferences in the US, Europe and as of last year, Africa! These conferences can attract more than 100 students interested in the academic side of libertarian politics, with focuses on history, economics, and philosophy. These are a great place to meet fellow students who can work with on activism projects.   Do note that SFL does not have official clubs. You are free to start a "Students For Liberty at Big University" club, but your club will receive no special attention. All clubs registered in the SFL network are treated the same. Any club that is liberty-oriented is free to join the SFL network which can provide books, event invitations, and other things. Your club will also appear on SFL's website, giving you free publicity to students looking for fellow activists.   **Young Americans For Liberty (YAL)** - YAL is similar to SFL in its goal, but is American centric and is in the business of establishing registered chapters around the country. YAL runs a very structured system with club presidents and state chairs who help organize events and other things. YAL club members must pay membership dues, but are rewarded with club funding and activism kits.   YAL also runs state conventions, which are similar to SFL's regional conferences in their purpose of education and bringing students together.   **Liberty in North Korea (LiNK)** - Many libertarian clubs around the country partner with LiNK to host events in which LiNK volunteers talk about the history of North Korea and the hardships of the North Korean people. LiNK runs a modern "Underground Railroad" smuggling North Korean defectors out of China once they cross the NK-Chinese border. LiNK then sends these defectors to south east Asia where they are safe from repatriation by Chinese authorities. From there, the defectors are placed in safe havens either in South Korea or the US, where they begin their new, free lives.   LiNK will host an event discussing all of this on your campus. You may be required to pay an event hosting fee (which helps with their funding).   Something cool LiNK talks about is the underground trading systems which run all across the DPRK where residents buy banned goods, like movies, books, and music. LiNK happily refers to this as what it truly is: capitalism.   **Students For a Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP)** - This group runs several chapters around the US where students engage in activism that educates their fellow youth about the harms of the War on Drugs. SSDP advocates for the end of prohibition against marijuana and for sensible laws to apply to the drug. Some SSDP chapters will invite speakers to their campus.   **Leadership Institute (LI)** - If you're looking for activism grants, look no further! LI will grant American student groups money for activism related projects. Tread carefully, however, as LI has a less of a libertarian slant, and more of conservative slant (similar to the GOP). There are plenty of both camps working in LI, but if you plan on asking them for money, make sure your project isn't too controversial for your typical conservative. For example, they may not fund something directly related to AnCap, but may fund something about the harm of Obamacare, or NSA spying.   LI runs a handful of physical student training seminars across the country, and also hosts online training seminars for activist training.   **Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)** - FIRE defends the rights of American high school and college students, primarily focusing on the right to free speech in an academic environment. FIRE has an online database of colleges which have problematic rules in their guidebooks which may restrict your first amendment rights. If your school has a "red light" policy (clearly unconstitutional), they will write a legal memo to your school, and put pressure on them to change their rules so the fit constitutional standards, as defined by the Supreme Court.  If you believe your rights have been violated, contact FIRE immediately and they will assist you. If your school isn't in their database, ask them to investigate and they will look into it for you.   FIRE runs a yearly conference over the summer, and has speakers available for you to invite. They have publications on their website which inform you of your rights as a college/high school student.   **Federalist Society** - Operating at law schools only, the Federalist Society is full of conservative, moderate, and libertarian law students. They host speakers, form clubs, and hold debates to educate students from the right side of the spectrum in application to American law.   -,-,-  Feel free to add others! I'll put them on the list. I'm fairly familiar with all of these groups, so AMA (I served as a campus coordinator with SFL for one year).       I'm applying for a program I really want to get into, but neither of my references have filled out their forms yet. The deadline for applying is Monday. I did call and leave a message for the volunteer coordinator, but I'm curious as to if deadline extensions are common or even allowed.   Are Africans of a given country now seeing China more positively, negatively, or have their attitudes towards China stayed the same since China began becoming more economically involved with the continent?             Someone told me that the tobacco purchasing age went up to 21 today, but I did some searching and last month the town board of health apparently voted to keep it at 18, so I'm a little confused.    The other day I was driving home from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts after attending a conference. On my way home, I asked Google Maps to avoid tolls because I didn't have any cash. While messing around with my phone at a rest stop, I somehow turned this request off.   So I'm driving on a highway in New York and I come up on a toll. No biggie. I've had this happen to me in Massachusetts before, so I *think* I know the drill; copy my license plate number, and send me a bill in the mail. But nope! As I'm at the toll booth, I inform the booth worker I have no cash. She asks for my driver's license so I can be identified. I go to my wallet and...what? It's not there. I quickly feel around my car and can't find it. I tell the worker this, so she asks for my registration so they can still ID me and send me a bill.   Oh, I have that! I go to my glove box and...nope. The handle is stuck. I'm trying to open it, banging on it and jigging the handle, but it's really stuck. So now the worker asks me to pull over to some little station off the side to the road, after I've been holding up morning traffic for 5 minutes.   I oblige, not knowing what's going to happen to me. I pull over to the station, and wait for 10 seconds until another worker approaches my car and informs me that the woman behind me paid my toll. Relief!   So thank you anonymous lady. I don't know what compelled you to help me; was it my out of state license plate? Or my politically charged bumper stickers? Or are you just that nice to everyone?  So thanks again. I'll definitely pay it forward.   Edit: *butt. Doh!   Specifically, I'm looking to take the MBTA from Scituate to Salem for school. I know it's going to be hassle because I have to make several transfers, so maybe I should just drive. Does anyone else travel between the SS and NS?          I recently read Mao Dun's "Shop of the Lin Family" and "Spring Silkworms", both of which gave fascinating insight into what was going on in China during the communist revolution. I'm looking for more books of a similar manner, which through realism, show the history of China as it's happening.                   I can't count the number of times I've seen someone write something like "Reddit users are racist/sexist/homophobic etc.", and other negative general stereotypes. I've never seen another site have users attack their fellow user base, so does this happen anywhere else?   I'm looking for some walking canes for my friend who has trouble getting about. He has one, but I thought I'd buy him a nicer one for his birthday. Anywhere I physically shop for them?   I've been searching around for busses and flights, and the cheapest thing I found was a flight to Butte, and then a bus from Butte to Helena. Total comes to about $300, which almost makes it cheaper to drive for me. Are there any buses, flight routes, trains, etc. I might have missed that a re bit cheaper? Just want to make sure I'm not going past any possibilities.   Per example, if a country has ten parties to choose from in a given election, will more people vote in that election, compared to a country with two parties to choose from?   I'm reading [*The Opium War: Being Recollections of Service in China*](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Opium_War.html?id=baNDAAAAYAAJ), written by a British captain serving in China during the Opium War, and in it he mentions Malay pirates using kriis, and Chinese cock fighters equipping their cocks with kriis for fights. What is this weapon? I haven't been able to find anything on it. To quote the book:  "The cocks, which at the present day precent specimens of the finest class, were then trained much in the same way as in Europe, but were armed, in the place of a spur, with a broad flat blade, resembling their own favourite weapon-the kriis;..." [Pg 37]  "These savages [Malay pirates] armed with terrible kriis are in the constant habit of attacking plundering the coasting merchantman which they the more readily make a prey of from the circumstance both the Siam and Cochin-Chinese government forbidding her merchantmen from being armed." [Pg 36]  What exactly does this weapon look like? How common were they?    Antifa rallies generally seem to be full of anarchists, so I'm asking here. In the US, we don't really have any fascists. Pockets of them exist, but barely so. I could understand holding rallies near their home bases, like in the South, but this usually isn't the case. From what I see, the rallies are held in cities where there aren't any fascists gathering.   If I'm off the mark here, let me know. Otherwise, some help understanding this would be nice. Are they targeting world wide fascists, American fascists, or someone else?   Two weeks ago I became a Master Mason with the Freemasons. Basically I went from being an apprentice to an accepted, average Freemason. It was really fun.  AMAA about what it's like! I won't answer questions about our rituals (you can google that if you wish), as those are sacred, but everything else is open game.   Hi all,   Some of you have noticed my flair as I've been posting in this sub. My name is Dan Morris and I'm running to represent Salem, Massachusetts as a State Representative.   I've spent a year working with Students For Liberty as a campus coordinator, a student non-profit dedicated towards spreading the ideas of capitalism and limited government on college campuses. I've also been active with my local Tea Party (who aren't as bad as you might think). And I've also been working with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) on changing speech codes at my school, Salem State University.  I've even lobbied with them in Boston for a students right to have active legal council present during expulsion and suspension hearings with their school, due to such meetings being public record, allowing a court to ask for the transcripts of whatever a student said during these meetings, which leads to self-incrimination.   Some issues I'm running on:   Removing a state gas tax which is tied to inflation. You want to raise taxes? Fine (well, not really), but at least vote for raising them per year rather than sneaking in an inflation tie.   Marijuana legalization, and allowing non-violent first time offenders in prison for drug possession to be released back into our society.   Transgender equal access to all public facilities (i.e, bathrooms).   Working against the over arming of police  Establish a limited trial voucher program for low-income students to go to any school of their choosing.   I should also note that I am not an AnCap, but that's only because my readings have been focused elsewhere. I'll read Rothbard soon, I swear!  I enjoy hiking, gaming, reading alt-history books, and volunteer as an English tutor to immigrants and refugees in my spare time.   AMA!       Do any countries do this? I know some do the opposite, like Israel, where you vote for the party, not the candidate. But could just putting only names on the ballot be a good thing? Theoretically this would require voters to do more research on candidates, and prevent them from voting strictly on party lines.   When I joined a few years ago, I did so without finishing the BoM first. I mainly skimmed and read the chapter summaries. I've since finished it, but have met other people who were like me. So I'm curious if any folks here did the same thing. And is there anything wrong with that? There was just so much pressure to get baptized, and I wanted to as well. So I figured it didn't matter so much if my guy feeling was telling me I was doing the right thing.    I've been inactive with the church for a few years, but want to return. I'm 20, so I'm able to go a SAW, but I never went to one initially. When returning to the church, should I go to my local SAW or simply my old ward?    https://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=3UXCLCQO1U2B32FQM52VTK6YYAZ025      So [here's a Salon Q A video](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/04/23/ask_a_homo_how_should_straight_people_behave_in_gay_bars_video.html) where the speaker says that straights shouldn't go into gay bars.  I'm conflicted on this, because while I realize that there are few gay spaces around (like the speaker mentions), I still think allowing straights and gays to mingle in bars is a way to break down the barriers of division. And I could see how if this logic was applied to the opposite side-that gays shouldn't go into "straight" bars (simply meaning a bar which doesn't tolerate the gay community)-then that would cause some obvious issues.  So what are your thoughts on this?   In a speech to the eighth meeting of the central peoples government counsel on June 28, 1950, Mao said "The Chinese people had long ago declared that the affairs of the various countries throughout the world should be run by the peoples of the respective countries themselves, and the affairs of these should be run by the people of Asia themselves and not by the United States. United States' aggression In Asia will only arouse the extensive and resolute resistance of the peoples of Asia."  Mao and other Communist Party members talked much of making world peace. They also talked much of Taiwan, and taking it away from the grasp of the United States. How could Mao and other Chinese officials justify the taking of Taiwan, when the people of Taiwan wanted to self govern themselves, and that such aggression would certainly cause war?      Hey all, I'm looking to improve my Mandarin a bit and was wondering if any knew of any good Mandarin texts to read. I'm looking for things that are libertarian/ancap related, but anything relating to defending capitalism in general would be good too.   I need some cash for gas and to make a housing payment. I'm in school, but will be working by the end of the month. I should also get my taxes back soon.   Check my account history. It's a new account, but I'm a verifiable person. I can link you to my FB, give you my number, and do whatever else you want.    Sup. I'm Dan and I'm a college student in Salem. I can offer you a spot in my dorms to stay for up to two nights (university rules), and offer you some meals if you're homeless or struggling.   Let me know what's up!   Hi all,  My name is Dan Morris, and I'm running for state representative to represent Salem, Massachusetts in Boston. I'm running as a libertarian, but still identify with a lot of conservatives like Thomas Sowell, Barry Goldwater, and Margaret Thatcher.   I'm looking for advice on reaching out to voters, getting my message straight, or whatever else you have to offer.

Dan   Hi there,  I'm Dan, and I'm running to fill John Keenan's seat for State Representative this November. I'm running on a pro-charter school, anti-tax, and pro-transgender rights platform.   I'm originally from Scituate, but moved to Salem two years ago to attend Salem State University, where I'm still attending. I fell in love with the city instantly, and hope to remain here after I finish my degree.   My core issues is being a pro-charter school advocate. As an alumni of one (South Shore Charter Public School), I know how important these places are, and they deserve all the help they can get. The state moratorium on their expansion was recently lifted, which is great, but it should have never happened in the first place.  I also want to ensure transgenders have the right to access any public accommodation (there's legislation for that in the works). Salem recently made a great stride in protecting this important minority in our population, and I want to stand by them as they seek for more rights to access public accommodations and other public services.  And lastly, I'm anti-gas tax. Massachusetts recently passed a gas tax which is tied to inflation. The gas tax hurts everyone but those who passed the legislation. We can pay for our roads in other ways, like limiting MBTA expansion. Those saved funds which serves the east coast can be spent out west, which Beacon Hill likes to pretend to ignore.

 For a long time I've been doing weighted pullups by attaching plates to a belt with a chain, but lately I've been increasingly annoyed by the fact that the plates aren't stable, as they move back and forth. This causes balance issues and prevents me from doing the pullups as stricly as I want to. I'm thinking of putting a dumbbell in between my two 'lower' legs instead. I've seen a friend do this for weighted dips and it seemed to work well. Only downside is you need someone to place the weight for you, pretty much. Has anyone ever tried this and could give me feedback?  Thanks in advance.       It is, like some of the research I've read states, definitly a powerful fat loss agent. It doesn't work on cattle only, it works on humans too.   I ended my bulk 2 weeks ago, on December 28th, 2014, at 220 lb and around 15% body fat. During those 2 weeks of cut that followed the end of the bulk, I still ate like a pig (250 calories above my TDEE compared to 650 during my bulk). Even in spite of that, I lost over 20 pounds. However, I don't know of much of it is water weight and how much of it is actually fat, as it's not really possible to tell.   During the first week, I administered Clenbuterol orally, in tablet format. Each tablet is 20mcg; I started with a single tablet, and then administered one more tablet every day until reaching 100mcg. In the second week, I used the same daily quantity, except that I administered it in liquid form, through injection. I used a 18g 1.5" pin to draw, and a 23g 1" one to inject. Based on my calculations, 1000mcg of tablet format Clenbuterol is equal to roughly 1 mL of the liquid format, so I injected 0.1 mL daily during the second week (because 100mcg = 0.1 mL). You don't have to use both formats by the way, I just did so because I wanted to test both, to see which one worked best for me; turns out I actually had less of the side effects from injecting, although this might have nothing to do with the format of administration at all.   During those 2 weeks, I also administered 3 1000mg taurine capsules daily. As [studies](http://jap.physiology.org/content/93/5/1824) have shown, Clenbuterol depletes taurine  levels in the liver, which stops the conversion of the thyroid hormone  triiodothyronine into thyroxine. This, in turn, has been reported to result in painful muscle cramps in many users that I've talked to.   Training wise, I avoided all forms of HIIT; simply walking on a treadmill for about 45 min daily was pretty exhausting. I also followed a fairly standard 4-day heavy weight workout routine, with 2 days for upper body and 2 days for legs. This is because, like I said, my goal was to maintain muscle mass and strength as much as possible despite being on a lower caloric intake.   Nutrition wise, my fast-digesting carbohydrate intake cycled naturally, as I had none on rest days. On the other hand, my overall carbohydrate intake was pretty consistent (40% of my daily caloric intake every day).  That's it. If you have any other questions, throw them at me and I will do my best to answer them. That was just my personal experience by the way, it might not reflect what you or other people have experienced using Clenbuterol. Personally, though, I will definitly use it again. The side effects that I experienced (dizziness, night sweats, increased sweating, dry mouth) were definitly worth it!           https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=745943512150701 set=vb.305174699560920 type=2 theater notif_t=video_reply  Be warned headphone users, watching this video could kill you.  For me, though, it was so much motivation that I murdered my leg workout.  That strength though. Some high school football kids are impressive. Anyone knows this guy's name?                   There seems to be no serious research on the subject, and I cannot find an unbiased website (that is, one that doesn't sell AAS-related products) that discusses it.   Aside from the obvious dangers of using Lyothyronine alone, does it actually work? Is it more effective than if you use drugs like ephedrine only?    I just tried the vertical leg press for the first time today, at the end of my butt workout. I didn't think too much of the exercise, but I noticed my hips were flexing a lot more than on, say, the angled leg press machine.   I was re-reading [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173958) (also available in PDF on Google), and in randomized trials they found a link between hip flexion and degree of involvement of the gluteal muscles. Because of this, I'm thinking of adding the vertical leg press to my current glutes workout. My workout is currently this (some kind of experimental 'pre-exhaustion' butt day):  50% 1RM back squat 4x12-15 + Jump squats 4x12-15 superset  Cable glute kickbacks 4x-20-25 per leg  Barbell glute bridges 4x8-10  Does anyone else have experience with the vertical leg press? Not sure how to integrate it into my routine. Should I go heavy at the end after the bridges?           *1. [CrossFit's Filthy Fifty](http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/001550.html)   I'm not a big fan of the whole Xfit thing, but this is not for the faint of heart. Imagine doing a full body workout and high intensity cardio at the same time, and you get this, an extreme circuit training workout. You have to do 50 reps of 10 different exercises, with no break in between the exercises, and as fast as humanly possible while keeping a good form. I did this a couple times back when I was mostly concerned with losing body fat, and as someone who's more into weight lifting than cardio, this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's good for all athletes, because it challenges your muscular strength, muscular endurance and cardiovascular ability all at once.   *2. [Smolov Squat's Intense Mesocycle](http://www.seriouspowerlifting.com/3615/articles/smolov-squat-routine)  Possibly the toughest powerlifting and squat routine that exists. This is part of Smolov' 15 week powerlifting routine, the base cycle of which is also used for the bench press and a few others compound exercises. The whole Smolov routine is also known as 'The Test', because it will test whether you actually know what you are doing when it comes to nutrition and weight lifting.  This is by no stretch of the imagination a cutting program, and it is critical that you rest and eat properly, and that you lift with a good form. If you go through it doing everything correctly, you will come out a LOT stronger than you were before starting; if you don't, at best you will have poor strength gains, and at worst, you will also come out with an injury. If things don't go well during the base cycle, do not even attempt this.    *3. [Charles Poliquin's German Volume Training (GVT) method](http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/german-volume-training-build-more-size-6-weeks)  Possibly the greatest mass-building training routine, this isn't complex, or long, it's just brutally painful. 2 exercises in one superset, 1 push and 1 pull, 90 sec. of rest in between each superset, and 10 series of 10 reps for each of the two exercises, all with a 4-0-2 tempo. You're basically lifting for 20 minutes over a period of one hour. I did this recently, and made some spectacular muscular mass gains. I also ate like a horse while doing this.    *4. [Jason Feruggia's Complex of Time](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_six_toughest_workouts)  An extreme and heavy-weight version of circuit training that is mainly used by bodybuilders in their cutting phase. Possibly the best workout for losing bodyfat and maintaining muscular mass and strength as much as possible at the same time. Even though this is a workout designed for general conditioning and bodyfat loss, I would not attempt this while being on more than a slight caloric deficit.    *5. [Charles Poliquin's Deadlift from Hell](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/snatch-grip-deadlifts-muscle-growth)  This training program has a single exercise: the platform snatch grip deadlift. It's possibly the best weight lifting exercise that exists, and it's certainly one of the best muscle building exercises out there. You can add some complementary exercises, mostly ones that will help you with the deadlifting itself, but this exercise alone will leave your entire body exhausted. Do not attempt this unless you have mastered the regular deadlift form,  obviously.   This is my personal top 5. Do you guys know any other brutally hard weight lifting routines?  Edit: I'm not saying these are actually the 5 toughest gym routines. This is just in my opinion/based on my own experience. All these workouts are definitly hard, though. None of these are for the beginning lifter.      Just looking for feedback on how it went, if anyone did try it. I wanna try it, but I'm not sure if it's actually a good idea.                            http://www.steroid.com/steroids_side_effects.php#  I know steroids are a controversial topic and illegal in many countries, but, as an aspiring bodybuilder who has considered using steroids more than once in his life, this is the greatest read I have ever come cross about steroids.  It doesn't just say 'steroids are good' or 'steroids are bad'; instead, it takes every side effect usually associated with AAS use, and looks at what serious scientific studies say on the subject.   In my opinion, reads like this are a must if one is to form an educated opinion on the highly complex and controversial topic that AAS are.   You might think 'I have never considered using steroids and I never will either, so how should this be of any concern to me?'. Well, like I said, AAS are a huge topic, and a lot of people out there say different things about it, but very few of these people actually back up their sayings with reliable research. Also, AAS have been used by a lot of top-level athletes throughout the second half of the 20th century and into the first half of the 21st one, so this is definitly related not only to fitness, but also to the reality of the world in which we live as of currently, in 2015.                                             http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/bies.201400071/  I apologize in advance if the vocabulary is a little hard to understand for some, but this is a really interesting scientific article. Basically, it states that certain theories, like people's 'lack of willpower' to eat healthy and an evolutionary mismatch between our current environment and the ability to store food in the face of scarce resources, are not enough to explain food cravings and obesity like it was previously believed.   Instead, food cravings are mainly caused by an evolutionary mismatch between people and the bacteria that live in their gut; certain gut bacteria process certain nutrients better, leading to a power-struggle between them in which the dominant bacteria 'hijack' the neural axis between the brain and the gut and, in turn, influence us to eat the food products that contain these nutrients.   This is an important paradigm shift in our understanding of human eating behaviors, as it suggests that obesity isn't a result of an evolutionary mismatch between the humans and their external environment, but rather, a mismatch between the human body and the beings that live within the environment of which it is itself made.  I am truly amazed by this.   P.S.: if you want to gain insight into the subject, don't just read my short summary posted here. Read the article itself. It is far more complicated than just what I've said in my original post.   edit: I've realized that people have interpreted this as being an excuse to not eat properly and work hard in the gym. This article certainly isn't suggesting that, and neither am I by posting it. It is not my intention to give people an excuse to not do their best. Like some people have stated, this articles merely looks at the 'why's' of people have food cravings. I found it genuinely interesting and wanted to share this with you guys, as it relates to nutrition and fitness. That's it.   edit 2: I really wish I could re-do the title. I apologize for this title.   edit 3: This thread really exploded, I can't keep up with all the answers anymore. :/  However, I have read almost all of them, and I would like to address a few points. Firstly, I cannot apologize enough for the biased and somewhat misleading title. I would re-do it if I could, I assure you. Secondly, the idea of 'willpower' is never actually mentioned by the authors. They talk about how some scientists have argued that there is no 'self-control', in that the 'self' as we understand it doesn't actually exist, and is instead merely a set of highly contextualized cognitive responses based on fluctuations in brain activity. Another [study](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00650#.VJ9gB14CA) not mentioned by the authors of this article also found this. This is essentially where my idea on 'lack of willpower' comes from, but it is merely my interpretration. But as you can see, the idea is problematic in itself, as things like 'free will', 'self' and 'self-control' are hot topics within the scientific community. Thirdly, and most importantly, the author states that self-control ALONE cannot explain why we have cravings. This is where I messed up really badly in my title: I should have added the word 'alone'. The authors' main point is that previously prevalent theories on lack of self-control and evolutionary mismatch between humans and their external environment are not enough to explain food cravings; instead, they are primarily stemmed from a power struggle between bacteria in people's own gut.   Again, I am sorry for messing up the title. But I still think this article is definitly worth reading and discussing extensively.                   Basically, title. Although me and my girlfriend are pretty open about this stuff and she knows that I watch porn and doesn't mind, I never told her about what kind of porn I watch specifically, because I didn't think it mattered. But apparently it does.  She came across my web browsing history recently, and realized that I only watch lesbian porn. And she thinks it's creepy and doesn't understand why. I tried explaining to her, but the truth, I don't really know why myself. I've watched all sorts of porn, and lesbian porn is the only sort that actually turns me on. I'm not turned off by seeing another man's penis in a porn video, but it doesn't have any effect on me either. It's like watching TV and seeing an ad about something random you don't really care about and staring blankly as you wait for it to end so you can watch what you actually turned on the TV for. I feel the same way when watching most porn videos. The only thing that I enjoy watching and which arouses me is lesbian porn. But I don't really know how to break it down to my girlfriend.  edit: To add to my OP, she said that she doesn't know any other guy who exclusively watches lesbian porn, and she thinks it's creepy that I watch so much of it. She seriously asked if I sometimes imagine her having sex with another attractive girl that we know and that we always see when we go to the gym.               **Places**  -The Walled World: a reference to both Asgard and Midgard. Asgard was the realm of the Aesir gods. It was surrounded by huge walls which had been built by a giant. Midgard was the realm of the humans, and was surrounded by Jotunheimr, the world of the giants.  -Castle Utgard: a reference to Utgard, a stronghold of the giants in Jotunheimr.   -RBA's 'shifter village': a reference to the homeland of the Vaenir gods. They possess powerful magic, and keep the location of their home village a secret; no one knows where it is.   **Characters**  -Ymir: a reference to Ymir, a hermaphroditic giant who was the progenitor of all other giants. Ymir was born when the icy winds and the fire met, and from his body the two first giants were born. From the giant cow that fed Ymir, a humanoid was also born. The first female giant and that humanoid came together, and from their union the first gods were born. The third generation of gods would later kill Ymir, and use his body to make the world of the humans, thus beginning the age-old feud between giants and gods. It is said that, after Ragnark, the final battle between giants and gods, Ymir will be reborn into a human.   -Grisha Yeager: a reference to Surtr, a fire giant who fought and killed many powerful gods during the great war of Ragnark, most importantly Freyr, the brother of the Vanir goddess Freya. At the end of the war, he used his blazing sword to literally 'engulf the world in flame', and from the ashes a new world was reborn in which the humans and gods who had survived came together to start over.  -Freida Reiss: a reference to Freya, the Vanir goddess who lived in the world of the Aesir gods and who was renowned for her ability to alter the course of destinity by changing people's minds through the practice of a form of magic known as Seir (Seidr).   -The Beast Titan: a reference to Skrymir, the giant who lived at Utgard in Jotunheimr and would 'play' with his visitors by testing their strengths, weaknesses and limits.   **Concepts**  -Titan-shifters, 'mindless' titans and humans: in Norse mythology, the three most important groups are the giants, the gods and the humans. Although it is unclear which is which in SnK, in Norse mythology all three groups are related either through ancestry (both giants and gods descend from Ymir), interbreeding or both. The idea that, in SnK, titan-shifters, 'mindless' titans and humans all seem to be related could be a reference to that.   -Alternatively, the concept of titan-shifting could be a reference to the berserkers: in Norse mythology, 'berserk' means 'to change shape or form'; the berserkers were the warriors of the god Odin, and the most feared warriors in the world. This is because they would enter some kind of trance-like state before going to battle, which would increase their strength and endurance, make them immune to steel and fire and drive them insane in such a way that they would not stop fighting until they had killed everything in their path or were killed themselves.                     -A new monster found exclusively in ocean biomes (guardians don't count, they're generated structure-specific).  -A new block/resource found exclusively on and under ocean floors; maybe some kind of underwater flower (like algae) would be nice.  -More biome diversity using the biomes that we currently have.  -Smarter villagers and a new GUI that allows to view and interact with the villagers' inventory.  -More uses for the rare fish items that you can get from fishing and from killing guardians (clownfish, raw salmon and pufferfish); and fyi I know that they already have uses, but it's not enough.   -The ability to choose which painting we get, at least in creative.  -A recipe to craft sponges, so you have the choice to not have to explore in order to get more of them if you don't want to  -A use for the Enderdragon egg  -A silverfish-exclusive drop, so they aren't entirely useless  -A recipe to craft End stone       Am I the only one who thinks this?    1. The Enderdragon can be pushed around with pistons 2. The Wither can see players who are under the effect of an invisibility potion 3. You can hide light by placing a torch on the same block as an armor stand and then placing armor pieces on the armor stand 4. Both the Elder Guardian's Mining Fatigue effects and the effect provided by beacons are interdimensional 5. You can literally make floating grass and flowers by removing the block on which they are placed with the use of a 3rd party editor such as MCedit 6. You can place ghasts in minecarts and use them to push other mobs around 7. The gap between a fence gate and a cobblestone wall can be passed through by the Player, but not by other mobs 8. If you place an upside down slab next to a light block (such as glowstone), it will block light completely just like a full block 9. Dark oak wood fences do not burn 10. You can create a 'half-banner' by placing it directly above a full block          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4946TTiAQWo  Remember the guy from the Zipkrowd server who managed to make an XP farm using the Enderdragon? When the dragon dies, he takes 10 seconds to fully despawn and turn into an End portal. During those 10 seconds, experience orbs also 'come out' of his body and drop on the ground. But when you unload the chunk in which this process is happening before it is completed, the game 'forgets' about the process happening in that chunk and repeats it everytime you load the chunk again. This results in what is by far the fastest XP farm in the game.  It was previously believed that this only works with experience orbs, but in the video that I linked, someone managed to apply what I call the 'chunk-duplication principle' to diamonds, showing that it possibly works with all items and entities. I don't know if this was intended or not, but this effectively makes all items renewable, including diamonds, as you can see in this video.   This is not technically a 'farm', as items are duplicated rather than created, but in the end the outcome is the same: you can go afk and effortlessly get diamonds.            Either Rod is a lying piece of scum, or RBA, Eren's father and Kenny were all hasty ignorant fools.   All of them went to such great lengths to acquire the 'Reiss power', not knowing that it can only be used by people from the Reiss bloodline? RBA wasted half a decade of their lives and indirectly killed thousands of people just to acquire that power, without knowing that? Eren's father gave his own life to give that power to Eren, without knowing that it could only be used by the Reiss?   I refuse to believe it. I'm sure it's not everyone that can fully use that power, but I would also be extremely surprised if it was ONLY the Reiss people who can do so. Grisha MIGHT've been a fool who didn't know, but I'm sure RBA knew that they couldn't use it themselves... that's why they wanted to bring Eren along instead of just eating him and taking the power for themselves. Furthermore, in chapter 50 Reiner and Berthold looked like they had seen that power being used before. So, unless the Reiss have relatives who live outside the walls, there's no way Rod is telling the truth.   Also, in Norse mythology, the giant who builds the walls of Asgard doesn't do it just to 'give peace to humanity'. There has to be a whole lot more to this story than just what Rod tells Historia.       We now know that, 100 years ago, the walls were made by a titan who, Rod says, wanted 'to give peace to humanity'. However, is this what really happened? It seems now that the story of SnK is a re-telling on some of the Norse stories, at least metaphorically.   The 'titan building the walls' concept refers to the disguised hrimthurs (frost giant) who built the walls of Asgard, the kingdom of the Aesir gods, in exchange for Freya, the Vanir goddess, and the moon and the sun. The gods accepted the bargain, because they never thought he would succeed in 3 seasons, which was one of the conditions of that bargain. However, thanks to Loki's influence, the frost giant was also allowed to use the giant stallion, Svailfari. Because of this, he was going to succeed, and when the gods realized that, they told Loki to stop the builder of the walls or else they would kill the former, blaming him for the latter's success. So, when the walls were nearly finished being built, Loki turned into a mare, and charmed the stallion, taking him away from his duty. From this, the walls weren't finished in time, and also, from the union between Loki and the stallion, a eight-legged horse named Sleipnir was born.  Shortly after this, the gods found out that the disguised builder was in fact a frost giant, and the god Thor brutally murdered him.   Based on this, I think that, the truth is, the titan who created the walls and the 'crystal cave' asked for something in exchange for doing so, and that it wasn't just 'to give peace to humanity'. However, just like in the Norse mythology, the people who asked for that titan's help didn't respect their end of the deal, and then killed him. This is a very well known story in Norse mythology, and different versions of the same story are also found in other European cultures. So, based on the fact that there are already striking similarities with that story in SnK, I would doubt that this isn't what Isayama based himself on for the 'titan building the walls' story.  Also, here's my opinion after reading 64:  I hated how, as usual, the little pieces of information that we were given just lead to either the same questions or new ones. I did like Hanji's thought that the cave 'couldn't be man-made'. Indeed. However, I did enjoy all the action and seeing Kenny. I can't wait for Isayama to get into the details of his 'dream'. Also, poor Hanji. :(    In short, there is simply too much of a gap between the manga and the animated versions. Because of this, the community cannot and will not be one.  When the people who only know the animated version think 'Attack on Titans', they think dumb, scary-looking giants that eat humans. It's probably a little more than that for some people, but I'm overly dumbing it down to make a point.  Personally, I have read and re-read every single piece of canon material countless times, I have spent countless hours writing on and thinking about the story. I also have read extensively on Norse mythology, from which Isayama draws much of his inspiration. Because of this, I simply cannot have the same perspective as 'anime-only people'. I mean, I could put myself in those people's shoes, but it just doesn't feel right... It feels like a different story, so instead I choose to not discuss SnK with those people, because it ruins everything that SnK is for me.  When anime-only people think Attack on Titan, they think titans that eat people. But when I think Attack on Titan, first of all, I don't even think 'titans', as for me titans aren't titans, but rather, an isomorphic representation of the result of of a highly complex network of interconnected sociopolitical structures; the 'titans' are merely the literary 'recipient' used to portray the metaphor associated to that representation. I see moral imperative conflicts, oligarchism, the sociopolitical dimension of spirituality and technology and technological progress, etc. I see a story that takes place in a society with a history of conflicts and other types of interaction between groups that are based on common beliefs and purposes, bloodline, and perhaps other things as well. But to think that some people think of SnK as just 'a story about titans that eat people' saddens me, and yet at the same time I can't blame those people, because, based on how far the animated version is at the moment, there isn't much room for thinking beyond that. But like I said, it ruins the excitement that I get from SnK to hear those people's opinions, so I choose to avoid discussing with them about SnK altogether.  Some people will probably disagree, but basically, I believe that because of the huge gap between the manga and anime versions, each version is basically a different story and as long as the gap remains this big, we can never be a unified community. At least not without some effort from the manga folks to 'dumb down' their own perspective of the story to fit that of most anime-only people, which I personally refuse to do.                Well, Reiner did ask this question to Ymir.  So, what do you guys think?  Does the world in which the main characters live have a future?    I am guy. Pretty sure I like girls. I know, because I've been surrounded by girls all my life. Growing up my father was away for work most of the time, so the parent that took care of me was my mom. I have four sisters. Also, I have some guy acquaintances, but all of my good and best friends are girl. I have literally no male friends. In college, my faculty has 1154 students, 90% of which are girls. I am surrounded by relatively pretty and intelligent girls everywhere, 100% of the time.  And yet, I've never had a girlfriend, or any intimate relationship with a girl. I've never even kissed a girl outside of in a party context where everyone was wasted. Obviously I've had some intimate physical contacts with some of my female friends, but I've never touched the opposite sex's intimate parts.  When I was young, I thought that it was because of my physical appearance. So I started training really hard. But it's been 5 years now, I take care of my appearance and I'm pretty buff (all my friends keep telling me), and yet nothing has changed. I'm 20 year old, and by now I've figured out that it's obviously not about my physical appearance, but what is it? What is it that's wrong with me? I am surrounded by hundreds of girls, and yet I can't get any of them to like me as more than a friend. A lot of them say that I'm good looking, a lot of them say that I'm intelligent, almost all of them say that I'm a nice guy (I try really hard to be a genuinely nice human being), and yet not a single one of them has ever entertained the thought of having me as a boyfriend. Why?    I teach at a elementary school, and this year one of my kids is a boy named Ymir. His father comes to pick him up everyday. He told me the name comes from Norse mythology, the stories of which he's a big fan. No surprise here. I almost asked him the other day if he knows about Attack on Titan, but I felt it would be a little inappropriate lol. Now it bugs me big time, everyday I think of asking him. Should I?       As you guys saw, Frieda erased Historia's memories, but when Historia touched Eren (who took Frieda's memories through his father), she got those memories back.  Well, one of the laws of our world is that nothing truly 'disappears', things always change form or go somewhere else. What if, the way the power works, the user simply 'steals' the person' memories and keeps it within him/herself?  Now, we know that the memories of the entire population within the walls were taken away. I would assume that if a single person had so many memories, it would drive them crazy or something bad would happen. So what if, instead, the monarchy has been using the Wall Titans as 'memory vessels' that hold all the memories of the people within the walls?  And if people were to touch these titans, or the human within them (if there is one), they would retrieve all the memories that were taken away, and that is why the monarchy doesn't want anyone to know about those titans?  That's just another theory that I had, based on the idea that nothing truly disappears, and those memories must go somewhere when they are forgotten by the person.   What do you guys think?    I used mostly what I know about Norse mythology (on which SnK seems to be almost entirely based, at least metaphorically), and this: http://calorescence.tumblr.com/post/51450703198/did-you-know-the-inside-covers-of-the-japanese  I believe the story of SnK takes place in a post-apocalyptic Norse mythology-influenced world.   In the SnK universe, humans have been around for a lot longer than 2000 years. However, 2000 years ago, some kind of Titan-like being appeared. I don't know how, or why, or what he was exactly, but let's call him 'the original titan'. His name was Ymir, and he had three titan children. Two of them had children of their own together, and were the first of the 'true titans' to live. The third one mated with a human, and the children born out this union became the first generation of titan-human hybrids, that is, people who have the physical appearance of humans, but possess the powers of the true titans.  At some point after that, I'm not sure exactly why, but the titan-human hybrids killed Ymir and used his power for themselves. This started the age-old feud between true titans and titan-human hybrids.. This feud ultimately culminated in a great battle between the two. This great battle happened 2000 years after the death of Ymir, and  100 years before the start of the story. And 'To you, 2000 Years From Now' means that, 2000 years after his death and after the great battle between titans and hybrids, Ymir was reborn into a human.     The hybrids lost the war, and most of them were decimated. After the war, the surviving hybrids and humans sailed to a new world. During the war, the humans had mostly been collateral damage, being used by the true titans, who turned them into mindless titans that were capapble of killing the hybrids and stealing their titan power in the process. This continued being a problem after the war, so, to protect the humans, the hybrids used their titan powers to build great walls that would protect the remaining humans from their fellow humans who had been turned by the true titans during the war.  Even though the humans and hybrids look the same, and now live together as well, they are by no means the same. The noble families, who rule, are the descendants of the hybrids who survived the war; the 'titan nature' runs through their veins. And the rest of the people are mere humans, which is why they are looked down upon and controlled by these noble families. This is what the noble being tortured by Zackley meant, when he said that their flesh and blood are not the same.  And the other conflicts within the story are merely internal conflicts between the hybrids. The Ackerman were probably another lineage of the hybrids, until the Reiss lineage erased their memories and chased them out. I'm not sure who RBA's people is, but they are very similar to the Vanir in Norse mythology. The Vanir were a branch of the hybrids who descend from Ymir that I talk about in my text. Some of them possessed magical powers, they kept the location of their village a secret, and once sent three of their people to live in Asgard as part of a truce between them and another branch of gods who lived there, the Aesir. One of these three people was a goddess named Freia. In chapter 50, Reiner states that they must 'retrieve' Frieda's power, implying that it once belonged to his people.      In Norse mythology (on which SnK is based), Ymir is the giant from which the first gods and other giants are born. Then the third generation of gods kill Ymir and use his body to make the world, giving birth to humans and a bunch of other races.  Now I understand that, in SnK, Ymir isn't necessarily associated to the birth of everything (it's unlikely that the world of SnK is only a century old), so maybe she's related to the birth of titans or the titan power or something like that.  But there is nothing, absolutely nothing in Norse mythology that ever mentions Ymir coming back to life in any shape or form. So I'm trying to figure out where Isayama took that from. Any ideas?       I've been re-reading the chapters that involve the Beast Titan (aka Skrymir/Utgard-Loki from Norse mythology), and I've noticed one particular difference between their two powers that I feel is really important.  Skrymir doesn't have to do anything to control the Titans. And not only does he seem to control them, but more disturbingly, they seem to be aware of his existence. It's like they just know he's there, and, unlike all the other beings that we have seen so far, normal humans and titan shifters alike, they don't see him as someone that they should 'eat'.   On the other hand, Eren was seen as a perfectly normal human being and titan-shifter, except for that brief moment in which he used his Screaming ability out of despair.   I wonder if it's because their powers are two different ones, or because Skrymir's power is the same as Eren's, but 'turned on' permanently? Or perhaps it has to do with the fact that he 'made' those titans? Reiner told Ymir in chapter 46, if I'm not mistaken, that there was something different about those titans, that they could still move at night unlike the other mindless titans. And Reiner knew that those titans were Connie's village's people that had been turned by Skrymir.  I wonder if Skrymir can not only make his own titans, but if, when he does, they also take his orders and have characteristics that the mindless titan that we're used to doesn't have, such as the ability to still move around at night?    I feel like this is the most important and biggest question of the story.   Is the 'mindless' titan a failed or dumbed down of the titan shifter, or is the titan shifter an improved version of the 'mindless' titan? Or are both transformations two 'variants' of the same power?   The story has been pretty vague about titan history so far. We know that, over a hundred years ago, humanity was 'unable to match the overwhelming force of the titans', and so they made the walls on a new continent and then left there by boat.   Personally, I believe that the 'mindless' titan came after the titan shifter, and here's why.  Firstly, I don't think 'mindless' titans are actually mindless. They were made to only be aware of/listen to those with powers like the Coordinate's, and otherwise wander about in a seemingly mindless manner.  Secondly, I think that the fact that mindless titans try to eat humans is part of a set of encoded or pre-programmed behaviors that come along with being a mindless titan. If they eat someone who is a shifter, they can go back to their human form.   Finally, I believe Hanji's 'fusion' theory is true. When you become a titan, you fuse with some kind of material or entity, and mindless titans are simply the result of fusing completely with that material or entity.  I think that the titan power was initially some kind of weapon used in war: when soldiers become wounded, they turn into an 'empowered version of themselves' and can wreck havoc. But then someone else, who had a power like the Coordinate's, turned that weapon against its creator and made it suit their own abilities.   What do you guys think?       -Frieda Reiss: based on Freyja, a Vanir goddess who practiced the art of Seir, a form of sorcery that allows the user to alter the course of destiny.  -Ymir: based on Ymir, a hermaphroditic jtunn (giant) who is the progenitor of all jtnar. The two first giants were literally made from the body of Ymir.  -Castle Utgard: a major stronghold in Jotunheim, one of the nine worlds of Yggdrasir and the world of the frost and rock jtnar.  -Grisha Yaeger: his titan's physical appearance and actions throughout the SnK story closely resemble that of Surtur, a fire jtnar. In the events of Ragnark, a major battle in Old Norse mythology, Surtur fought and killed many important Norse gods, most importantly Freyr, the twin brother of Freyja. At the end of the war, he used his blazing sword to literally 'engulf the world in flames'.  Tell me if I'm missing any.           Originally, there were two gifted peoples with extraordinary abilities. One was a highly intelligent and magical people, of which the members could control people's minds and manipulate their memories in order to change their past or give them a new vision of the future. The other people was one with incredible physical abilities; their strength and dexterity were superhuman, and they could move just about any object, or complete certain tasks faster than anyone else. At first, those two people were travelling the world freely, helping people and making their dreams come true. However, eventually, the people who ruled became jealous of these people and started asking them to serve them and to do their biding. When these two peoples each refused, the rulers became mad, and ordered that they be captured or killed. They fought back, and most of them were killed. The few of them that remained were enslaved, and people started fighting for their possession. When the war had already been going on for decades, someone made the titan power. That person had grown tired of the endless warring, and came to the conclusion that humanity would never stop fighting, unless all humans were either turned into mindless titans or killed by those titans. Basically, that person's goal was to eradicate all humans using the titan power that they created.  When people started being turned into titans in large numbers and things became chaotic, the only ones to be able to survive were the two gifted peoples, using their abilities. Eventually, those gifted peoples came together and, in order to keep surviving, found a way to combine their respective power with the titan's. The ''magical'' people acquired the ability to control the mindless titans by accessing the memories buried deep within what's left of the human body within the titan, and the ''physical'' people became the titan-shifters, i.e., people who could enhance their already above average physical abilities by turning into a titan that has these abilities. In order to eventually free members of their peoples who had been turned into mindless titans, they also made it so that a mindless titan could regain his human form by eating someone who had acquired that titan-related power, so that, when a person got too sick or old, they could be eaten and allow someone else to regain their human form and therefore relive the lifetime that they had lost by being turned into a mindless titan.  After that, those two peoples came together with the normal people who hadn't been turned into titans, and they formed the humanity that used to live in the old world. However, people kept being turned into mindless titans despite their efforts to protect them, and eventually, they decided that the only option was to leave for a new continent that they had discovered. There, they combined the powers of the two peoples in order to create huge walls that would protect people from the ''titan plague''. Some of the most gifted members of the people with the incredible physical abilities were, with the use of the titan power, turned into enormous titans that could harden themselves to make walls, and then the most gifted members of the people with the mind-powers used those powers to order them to build the walls... Yes, because these people had to be ''mindless', otherwise they would age and not be able to protect humanity forever. On the other hand, for the people with the mind-powers, the task at hand put such a strain on their body that they died creating the walls, and this is why these walls were named in their honor. In the present day, some of the descendants of these two peoples are the Ackerman, of the ''physical'' people, and the Reiss, of the ''magical'' people.   Some decades ago, the two peoples started disagreeing on a lot of things, and as a result, the magical people starting plotting against the members of the physical people, in order to get rid of them. Eventually, they succeeded in chasing them away, and all of them either left the walls or stayed and had their memories erased, so as to even forget that they used to rule within the walls and have a special power. Some of those who had left the walls were eventually eaten and their power was taken by people who weren't from their people (RBA). The only member of the physical people who still lives within the walls and didn't have his mind wiped is Kenny, because he knew Rod personally and swore allegiance to him in exchange for being spared.  And that is the true story of humanity.   What if the reason he never takes the power for himself is that the person who has the power must always be eaten by another person at some point so that the power can continuously be passed from one generation to the next? What if the power is lost if the holder dies without passing the power to anyone?  Also, what if Rod Reiss is the one to pass down the knowledge of how the power works? To tell the new users how to use it?       'Who actually wants to kill people?'  I think if Grisha did what he did, it's because the Reiss must have done terrible things.   I don't think he would have brutally murdered 5 children just like that, and it must have been his last resort, so to speak.  Anyone else think that Rod is leaving out a big chunk of the story?    As you guys all know, the titan-shifter transformation is triggered through wounding. The human blood is mostly made up of red and white blood cells, the latter of which contain a cell necleus that, in turn, is made up of DNA sequences. When wounding occurs, it damages a layer of cells known as vascular endothelial cells, situated in the body's blood vessels and which are in direct contact with blood cells known as thrombocytes, of which the function is to stop bleeding. This process is called primary hemostatis, and results in the area of the wound repairing itself through complex interactions between the blood cells (thrombocytes) and other things in the endothelium (the area where the endothelial cells are in the blood vessel). My theory is that, in titan-shifters, when wounding occurs, the thrombocytes not only repair the endothelial cells, they also cause them to send a signal to the white blood cells, which, because their nucleus has been modified with whatever the titan power is, also trigger the titan transformation.  Things that make me believe the titan power is based on genome modifications:  -While all titans have regenerative capacities in their human form and the ability to switch between human and titan, their titan-shifter transformation's physical characteristics vary from an individual to another. In humans, the genome is what determines physical appearance, and the titan's physical appearance could simply be a distorted expression of the human's genome.  -It's been highly implied that the abilities one gets from the titan power are based on heredity  -Like I explained in detail, the titan-transformation seems to be triggered by something in the individual's blood cells.  What do you guys think?      The two great questions that we cannot answer are: 'What exactly is a titan?' and 'How did the titans first appear?' However, what we can say is that there seems to be two variations of what are called 'titans': the human who is stuck in his titan form and who cannot control his actions (the mindless titan); and the human who can switch back and forth between titan and human, who has regenerative characteristics in his human form, and who has distinct physical characteristics and abilities in his titan form (the titan-shifter).  In other words, the first variation has the purpose, or at least the indirect consequence, of either rendering the human being useless or making him dangerous in unpredictable ways or both; on the other hand, the second variation simply empowers the individual. However, the two variations have one thing in common: they are based on heredity. Also, because the titan-power is based on heredity, then the importance or value of one's bloodline is based on, not only the importance or value of the titan-power associated to that bloodline, but also on whether that bloodline has inherited any special titan power at all.  Family name is usually associated with heredity. In the real world, people who share a family name usually have a relatively recent common ancestor. In Shingeki no Kyojin, there are multiple examples of people who have a heredity-based titan power. Firstly, all those with the Ackerman family name possess a power popularly known as 'the Awakening', which causes the user to experience a sudden burst of power at a moment of grave danger (in other words, an environmental trigger), and then to be overall more powerful physically from this moment onwards. Secondly, in chapter 63 of the manga, Rod Reiss referred to his daughter Frieda's power, popularly known as 'the Mind-Wipe Power', as a 'Reiss power', strongly suggesting that only people from the Reiss bloodline  can inherit or use this power. Finally, when Eren received Frieda's power through eating his father, he received an ability that has been referred to by some of the story's characters as 'the Screaming'. This suggests that, when Eren received the titan-shifter's power, he didn't receive the Mind-Wipe Power, but rather, a power associated to his own bloodline. In conclusion, everyone can possess the titan-shifter's power, but the abilities that the power grants to the person are based on heredity.   Another example of the titan-power being heredity-based is the so-called noble families that live within the walls. According to Erwin, when interrogated by Darius Zackley's men, the members of the noble families implied that they couldn't be mind-wiped because of their noble blood. It is known that the noble families have been using the Reiss bloodline's Mind-Wipe Power to alter the memories of the people living within the walls. Based on the premise that, when used, the power alters the minds of everyone within a given area, it is safe to assume that, for purely practical reasons, those who are in charge of the society within the walls would have to be immune to the Mind-Wipe Power. Therefore, one possibility is that those who are deemed 'noble' within the walls are deemed as such because their hereditary power either counters or prevents the effects of the Mind-Wipe Power. This also reinforces the idea that the importance of one's bloodline in Shingeki no Kyojin is based on the type of titan-power that said bloodline has inherited.   Ymir is a character who illustrates the idea that, not only are the special abilities granted by the titan-power based on heredity, but also that some people have not inherited any special power.  From the time that she was a mindless titan (which we see in Reiner's flashback or when she ate the former's presumably titan-shifter friend, Berik) to the time that we see her as a titan-shifter, she remains seemingly physically unchanged. When she ate Berik, she received the ability to switch back and forth between human and titan, as well as the regenerative characteristics in her human form and which all titan-shifters seem to possess. However, she didn't inherit neither his titan's physical characteristics nor any special titan-related power that he might have had. This suggests two things: firstly, that, while the abilities to regenerate one's human body parts and to switch back and forth between both forms are common to all titan-shifters, things like the general physical characteristics and special power are based one's genome; and secondly, that some people's bloodline might not have inherited any special titan-power, which explains why her titan was still a 'regular' one after becoming a titan-shifter.  In conclusion, there are two types of titan: the mindless titan and the titan-shifter. While all titan-shifters can regenerate their human body and switch back and forth between their human and titan forms, one's titan's general physical appearance and special power are based on that person's genome. This would explain why the process of turning into a titan is triggered through wounding: the human blood is made up mostly of red and white cells, which contain a cell nucleus with DNA sequences in it; DNA, of which the human genome is made, is what defines physical characteristics in the real world. However, many questions are still left answered besides the two most important ones asked at the start of this essay. How and from which part of the human body is the titan transformation itself triggered? And, more importantly, which of the parts of the human body that are involved in the titan-transformation (if there is more than one) is/are responsible for the differences between mindless titans and titan-shifters? In other words, what makes it so that mindless titans are, in fact, 'mindless', while titan-shifters can still control their body? These questions might become partly answerable when more information is given about the functioning of the process that allows the titan-shifter's power to be transferred through a mindless titan 'eating' parts of a titan-shifter's body.            I think Grisha was originally just like RBA: he came from somewhere outside the walls, infiltrated the society within these walls and had the loose goal of retrieving the Titan power that allows the user to control people and of exterminating all the people there, who he saw as the enemy of his own people. However, at some point he realized that the real enemy was the noble families, who had the power he was looking for, and that the people within the walls were innocent, merely being controlled and kept in ignorance by those noble families.  He also correctly guessed that there would eventually be other people just like him (RBA) who would come to try and do the same thing. So, when he discovered who among the noble families had the power to control people, he went to them, explained them the situation, and then asked them to either give him the power or use it to protect the people or something like that, but they refused (perhaps because they didn't believe him when he said that people like RBA would come and try to kill everyone). Because of that, he decided that,  in order to stop what he saw as wrong (the noble families controlling the people but not doing anything to protect them), he had to not only take the power by force, but also to make sure that the Reiss would never have that power again. That's why he tried to kill all of them: to end the Reiss bloodline.  After he had taken the power from the Reiss, two things happened. Firstly, he found out that he had been too late to act, as RBA had already invaded and caused the death of thousands, including his wife. Secondly, I don't know how he found that out or why it's like this, but he discovered that, even though he had Frieda's power, he couldn't use it, but that Eren could. So he turned Eren into a titan with that serum and then made him eat him, thereby acquiring that power.  And that's probably what Grisha meant by 'You will be the one to avenge your mother': because the noble families were selfish and kept everyone ignorant, all those innocent people died... Eren's mother died. And Grisha wants Eren to use the power to kill them all, or at least to somehow stop this huge lie that the noble families created with the society within these walls.       What happens if an oriental, someone like Levi and Mikasa, gets the Reiss bloodline power? Do they technically become some kind of super powerful being?  What if that's what Grisha was trying to accomplish? Eren is half-oriental through his mom (maybe?), and now he also has the Reiss bloodline power, making him super powerful.       Isayama said that he would start answering questions, but literally 90% of what he did was telling us what we already know:  Pixis is the good guy; Zackley is an evil motherfucker who had it planned all along; The Ackerman have some kind of special power because of which they were discriminated; Frida could have been the real deal, but Grisha ate the f*ck out of her, and then he killed everyone else; Frida's power has to do with control/possession of memories.  I'm sorry, but personally, that was obvious to me a long time ago already. Some of this since chapter 62, and a lot of this stuff since even before that. Can't believe I had to wait a month for this ****. And now I have to wait another 60 days (yes, next month is a break) to be told even more stuff that I probably already more or less know?   Fuck off. Good luck, Isayama. I'm sure all the brain-dead anime only watchers will make you a load of money when season 2 comes out. Meanwhile, all the decent people who read your story will have to wait  for years before seeing it actually unfold. But I won't be one of them.    Hey guys, I recently started my own skyblock-like survival single player world, by making a customized superflat world with nothing but air in it and then adding the first block using a command.  However, now I'm having an issue. Basically when I get into the Nether, it isn't empty like the Overworld, it's just a regular survival world Nether. I'm wondering if there is a way to make it completely empty of blocks like my overworld?  Thanks in advance.       Am I the only one who noticed how obvious Isayama was being about this, in the last chapter?  It should be obvious to everyone who read chapter 62 that her main reason for going to the village was to see Historia who, back then, lived on a nearby farm, and that being nice to the villagers was just a cover-up. No?    I just thought of something crazy. What if the people within the walls have all something within their body that makes it easier for them to be turned into titans and used as a weapon? We know that a lot of people had their minds wiped in the past. What if, once someone with a coordinate's power has used his powers on someone by connecting to a certain part of their brain, it becomes possible for others with a similar special power to turn them into titans? What if that's how MT was able to turn the people from Connie's village into titans? Even crazier, what if that's what meant when it was said that Grisha saved a bunch of people from a plague? What if he had 'cured' a lot of people by reverting that change in their brain as a part of an experiment to better understand how titans work?   Maybe that would also explain why RBA wanted to slaughter everyone: they were afraid that, otherwise, all of the people within the walls would eventually be used to attack their village.   Just some late night thoughts I had. Maybe I'm completely wrong and this is too far-stretched lol.    I'll make it short, I've written about this before, but I wanted to make it more formal by making a post about it. I think the room under the chapel (where Eren is being held atm) and the room under Eren's house are both the same thing: some kind of 'control room'. I can't tell how many of these there are, but I think that the walls connect to these rooms from under the ground. When in this 'control room', the coordinate's power is particularly powerful, that's why Rod and Historia could trigger Eren's memories just by touching him near his spine. It's also from one of these rooms that users of the coordinate's power ordered the titans to create the walls, and from which they used their power to wipe the minds of the entire population within the walls a century prior to the start of the story. Grisha was probably going to bring Eren in that room under their basement once Eren had acquired the coordinate's power, and wanted to carry out a plan of his own with that power, but something didn't go as planned.  Also, a theory on why RBA want the coordinate's power. First, titans aren't exactly 'mindless'. They're made to only listen to those who have the coordinate's power. That's why it's called the 'coordinate' by Reiner, because the holder can 'coordinate' titans who otherwise wander in a seemingly mindless manner, trying to eat humans as part of a set of 'hardwired' or pre-programmed behaviors that comes along with being a titan.  When humanity still lived in the old world, someone started turning everyone into titans, and humanity was overwhelmed by the sheer number of titans. So the monarchy left with a few people and left the others to die to titans. However, a few managed to survive somehow... This was RBA's people. Having the coordinate's power would allow them to save what remains of their people and reclaim the land.    Let me know what you guys think, if this makes sense, if you think I'm right, etc.         I believe that, at least a hundred years prior to the start of the story, some people were transformed into the titans that make up the walls right now, with the ability to manipulate the physical matter that consistutes their very being (the titan-like body) in various ways. However, they had to be 'mindless'; this is very important, because like we've seen with Ymir, when 'mindless', the human somewhere within the titan doesn't age physically and can therefore live on as long as he/she is in that state/form.  However, I believe 'mindless' is the wrong term. Titans were made so that they will only listen to/be aware of the existence of the people who possess what Reiner called the 'Coordinate', and will otherwise wander about in a seemingly mindless manner, eating human beings as part of a set of pre-programmed behaviors. Basically, those people can 'coordinate' the titans to do certain things. This excludes titan-shifters, for which I have another theory that I won't discuss here.   Back to my theory of what happened, the strange room below the Reiss chapel is a 'control room' to which the wall titans are connected. I believe that there are 3 rooms like that, one for every wall, and that another one is what Grisha's basement is. This is why the walls seem to expand underground, because the physical matter that makes up the walls connects the titans to these rooms. This connection not only allows those who possess the coordinate's power to control all the wall titans from those rooms, but also gives them a massive quantity of energy that they can use to use their abilities on a much larger scale than normally, like for wiping out the memories of an entire population. This is why Rod and Historia can trigger Eren's memories just by touching him when he is in that room - because the massive amount of energy coming from the walls makes Eren's abilities particularly powerful.    However, using the coordinate's power on a large scale puts a lot of strain on the body and can therefore be deadly for its users. The 3 women who wiped out the memories of an entire population probably died doing so, and this is why the walls were named in their honor, because of their noble sacrifice. Regardless, if they were able to do such a thing, I would assume that a single user of the coordinate's power using his abilities to maximum efficiency in one of those control rooms would be able to do something big. I think Grisha wanted to use Eren to carry out that 'something big', and it was something so big that the user would have died in the process, and that's why he couldn't do it himself. He was probably going to get Eren to have the coordinate power, bring him to that room (the basement) and have him use his powers to carry out his own plans. But obviously something went wrong, but that was his original plan.    ...that the RBA invasion took place on the same day as Grisha's attack on the Reiss family at the chapel.  I'm not saying that RBA and Grisha are related, or even that RBA, Grisha and the Reiss family are all related, although RBA want the Coordinate's power, which Eren now possesses, and which the Reiss family at least used to possess. So I'd say there's a good chance that this is what links them all.   In all cases, I doubt Isayama would make those two incredibly important events take place on the same day just to troll us. I think that, whatever business the Reiss were doing below that chapel on that day, both Grisha and RBA knew precisely that it was going to happen on that day and that's why they both chose that day in particular to make their move. Perhaps it has to do with something having to happen every x amount of days. Who knows.  But my point is, it sure as hell isn't a coincidence.         In the Japanese text that they show in the animate, it is said that the monarchy fled the old world because humanity was unable to match the Titans. Yet it also says that the monarchy used the Titan's power to make the walls on the new continent. So, basically, they could control enormous Titan-shifters to make huge walls, but they couldn't control these Titans to fight off the Titans themselves?  Isn't that contradictory?    http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v12/c047/16.html  What exactly is Berthold referring to, when he says that to Ymir?    Isayama said in an interview, a while ago, that by the time the story ends, Armin and Eren wouldn't be friends anymore.  Given what we know now, do you guys think we're in a better position to explain what might be the reasons for that? Basically, what will cause them to not be friends anymore in the future?    If Grisha was already a shifter when he attacked the Reiss family, then who did he eat to become one?   The only people who come from within the walls and who can turn into titans seem to be the members of the Reiss family, one of whom Eren got his titan-shifting powers from.   Does that mean Grisha came from outside the walls just like Ymir and RBA?        In the anime, it is stated that, a long time ago, humanity was plagued by a war that had caused the death of most people already when the Titans appeared and humanity, severely weakened, was unable to fight them. Then the monarchy made giant walls on a new continent and a small group made up of the richest and most powerful left on that new continent to escape the Titans.  What do you guys think this war was(or is if it's still going on) about?  Also, an interesting thing to note... The monarchy could use the Titans to make walls, but not to fight off the Titans themselves? Sounds like a contradiction to me.    ...is just really hairy as a human?  I know it sounds dumb, but Berthold sweats a lot, and his Titan is all about releasing hot steam.  What if Monkey Trouble simply has a lot of body hair as a human?  Everyone's going crazy with these theories about how he's a true Titan and the original Titan that started it all and all that whacky stuff, but I think he's just a Titan-shifter with some Coordinate-like power and who happens to be really, really hairy as a human.  Am I the only one?   Basically, on that day, this is what happens:  -While RBA are invading the walls, Grisha is on his way to the only freaking chapel of its kind within the walls where Rod Reiss and all of his kids (except Historia) are supposedly praying because of said invasion.  -We don't know exactly what happens once he gets there, but it ends in a bloodbath: Grisha slaughters and eats everyone except Rod Reiss.   -At some point after (not necessarly on the same day), again, we don't know exactly what happens, but Eren turns into a mindless titan and eats his father, becoming a titan-shifter and acquiring the Reiss children's memories in the process.   And THAT'S IT. All the rest is speculation at this point. If the goal of this chapter was to tell us what went down that day without going into the specifics of how titans work, I'd say it's mission accomplished.  Also, we can make some conclusions out of this anyway:  -Grisha must have had one hell of a burden on his shoulder, because no one starts murdering defenseless children unless they've gone fucking hopeless;  -Eren is screwed, period;  -Erwin's question 'why is Historia so freaking important?' has been partially answered: she is the last living Reiss child;  -It's no coincidence that the RBA invasion and that the chapel massacre went down on the same day, from a literary perspective. So RBA   friends and Grisha are definitly linked somehow;  -Grisha knew the Reiss family and what they were about. We don't know how much he knew about them, or whether he knew any of them personally, but he was definitly aware of their existence and he had definitly seen them before.      I mean, regardless of what his reasons were... Is there really anything that justifies slaughtering a bunch of children?  It's true that RBA caused the death of a lot of people, but they were brainwashed kids, so I can't really blame them.  On the other hand, Grisha was a fully grown up adult who perfectly undersood the implications of his actions.   What do you guys think?    ***Over 107 years ago, before year 738***:   -There are some serious and perhaps intentional controversies. It is stated that humanity used to live on another continent in a war-torn world when the titans appeared and it was unable to fight them off. As a result, a small group made up of humanity's richest and most powerful decided to leave to a new continent where huge walls which would serve to protect humanity had already been made. Their goal was to create a world 'free of sins, eternally without strife'. The trip was rough, and only half the boats made it. However, if humanity already possessed a power that allows its users to control titans (and which was used to make the walls themselves) on a seemingly large scale, then how was it unable to 'match the overwhelming force of the titans'?   -Some time after that, the Coordinate's power is used to wipe the memories of the first generation of people living within the walls, so that no one can remember what happened before and society can start anew, free of titan-related knowledge.    ***Year 770***:   -Angel Altonen, a weaponsmith, creates the first version of the 3DM.  gear.   -A 'child of titan' is born. A mother gets eaten, and then regurgitated by a titan who spits her body over the wall after eating her alive. Inside her belly, a living baby is found.    ***Year 773***:   -Ymir is born, somewhere outside the walls.    ***Year 785***:   -A large number of people, including Ymir, are turned into mindless titans.    ***At some point between 785 and 844***:  -Reiner, Berthold, Annie, Marcel, and possibly other people are turned into mindless titans, but then somehow become titan-shifters by presumably eating other titan-shifters.   -Frida, Historia's sister, visits her at the farm where she lives. She teaches her how to be educated as well as, presumably, how to use the Coordinate's power. However, on their last meeting, she makes her forget everything she taught her until they can meet again.   ***Year 844***  -Mikasa's parents are slaughtered by thieves, but Mikasa herself is saved by Eren and his father. Eren's father adopts her as his child and takes her in with his family.   -Ilse Langner, the last survivor of a Survey Corps expedition outside the walls, encounters a titan who mistakes her for Ymir, and then eats her alive and burries her. The titan is seen crying over her lifeless corpse, and the events are recorded by Ilse in her notebook before her death. The notebook is found in year 845, by Levi and Hange.    ***Year 845***:    -Reiner, Berthold, Annie and Marcel are on their way to infiltrate and destroy humanity, and to retrieve the Coordinate's power. On their way, they encounter Ymir, who somehow eats Marcel and becomes a titan-shifter in the process.  -Some time after, Reiner, Berthold and Annie start the process of destruction of humanity by making a whole in the outermost wall. They also use the confusion that ensues to infiltrate humanity and find information about the Coordinate's power. Ymir also uses the confusion to infiltrate the walls.   -On that same day, Grisha, Eren's father, goes to a chapel where the Reiss family is praying. There, he turns into a titan, slaughters everyone except Rod Reiss, and eats Frida, who can turn into a titan as well. Some time after, he turns Eren into a titan and gets himself eaten by him, therefore giving him whatever power he acquired by eating her.  -Some time after, Eren has his first dream in which he sees memories of Frida.   -Some time later during that day, Eren, accompanied by his sister Mikasa and friend Armin, sees his mom getting eaten by a mindless titan and vows to exterminate all titans.   -2 days after the invasion and the events at the chape, Kenny and Rod Reiss go to the farm where Historia lives with her mother. There, Kenny kills Historia's mother and Rod orders Historia to, from then on, live into hiding under the alias 'Krista Lenz', which is also the name of the girl in the book that Frida used to show her. This is presumably done to protect her Historia from Grisha.   ***Year 846***:   -The government sends over 250 000 people to their death in order to solve the food supply shortage issue.   ***Year 847***:   -Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Reiner, Berthold, Annie, Ymir, Historia, Sasha, Connie and others join the Trainee Squad.   ***Year 850***:   -All members of the Trainee Corps mentioned above graduate and most of them join the Survey Corps.  -Eren turns into a titan for the first time, which makes Reiner, Berthold Annie suspect that he might be the one they're looking for (the Coordinate).   -Annie and Berthold use their titan form to further their plan and try to capture Eren which they now suspect. Reiner is also shown working with Annie, although he does not use his titan form.   -Annie is discovered as the 'Female Titan' and captured, although her titan technology makes it impossible for the Survey Corps to interrogate her. In the process, bits of the walls are removed, which allows the Survey Corps that the walls are probably filled with giant titans.  -At some point during that year or before, another titan-shifter, known as 'Monkey Trouble' infiltrates the wall. He discovers that humanity speaks the same language as him, and that they have developed the 3DMG to fight off titans. He later tests how effective that technology is by turning Connie's village into titans through unknown means and ordering them to attack members of the Survey Corps. In order to protect her comrades, Ymir turns into a titan and fights the mindless titans. Berthold also comes close to turning into a titan in order to protect himself from Ymir, which he initially perceives as an enemy, but changes his mind at the last second when he realizes that she is protecting him. It is unknown whether Monkey Trouble is still within the walls.   -Also at some point during that year, Rod Reiss sends his men to question and then assassinate Pastor Nick, whom he believes has been giving away information about the true identity of his last living child (Historia).  -Shortly after, Reiner and Berthold suddenly reveal their true nature and mission to Eren, and turn into titans, engage in a fight with the Survey Corps and end up leaving with Eren and Ymir as hostages.  -Later, high up in the trees in one of the giant tree forests within the wall, Reiner and Berthold have a conversation in which they discuss Monkey Trouble, Ymir reveals that she spent 60 years as a mindless titan until she ate their friend Marcel, and Berthold admits that he and Reiner had to go through to the same process as her (eating another titan-shifter) in order to escape their mindless titan form.  -The next day, the Survey Corps goes after Reiner and Berthold. Eren manifests his Coordinate's power for the first time and saves everyone from them by overwhelming them with mindless titans. However, at the last second, Ymir decides to go with Reiner and Berthold and saves them.   -The following weeks after these incidents are about the Survey Corps trying to and ultimately succeeding in overthrowing the monarchy. Historia and Eren also discovers important parts of their respective histories during the 5 years prior to the start of the series and Historia now believes her father to have been an ally of humanity all along.          That night when Reiner broke through the wall, he must have seen him or Berthold and he most likely knew that they were titan shifters, given what he knew about titans and based on the fact that he was probably a shifter himself.  I wonder if that's what triggered the sequence of events that happened afterwards. We know what went down at the chapel happened on the same day that Reiner broke through the wall. I wonder if Grisha knew this was gonna happen and was waiting for it to actually happen to start carrying out his plan, or if he used the confusion that followed to his advantage.   Maybe Grisha knew all the children would be gathered at the chapel to pray and figured it was the best occasion to slaughter them all? Whatever happened, I'm sure it's not a coincidence that this all went down the same day as when Berthold and Reiner invaded the walls.      We know that the whole scene where Kenny kills Historia's mother and then Rod tells to her to live under a different name happens only 2 days after the events at the chapel.  What if Rod and Kenny did this to protect Historia from Grisha? If Grisha wanted to kill all the Reiss children for whatever reason, then surely Historia would have been his next target. But maybe Grisha ignored what Historia looked like or that she even existed, but Rod didn't know this, so to protect her, he killed everyone that knew her and then made her change her name so that Grisha would never find her.   Obviously Grisha died not long after the events of the chapel but Rod probably didn't know this either back then.   What do you guys think?   I'm basing this on the fact that Rod seems to genuinely care for his children and doesn't come off as the villain as I initially thought he would be. Also, if Grisha was able to kill the Reiss children despite the fact that at least one of them could turn into a titan, then his titan must have been quite dangerous, and Rod might have felt that if Grisha attacked them again, he would not be able to protect Historia from him, and so he figured that her best chances of survival would be if he sent her away from him. That's just a bunch of assumptions though.   Also, now that I think of it, Historia did say, in the latest chapter, that her father 'didn't have any other choice than to kill Pastor Nick' or something like that. Perhaps that was also to protect Historia?    The fish can that Ymir found at Castle Utgard was his. I'm convinced now that he spent quite a bit of time within the walls as a human before turning into a titan, turning connie's village into titans and then leaving. That's how he knew that they speak the same language.   I know it sounds crazy, but what if he did? Imagine the following scenario: in an alternate timeline, humanity is destroyed by RBA and their people because the Reiss family is unable to protect the power and it is stolen from them. The power itself needs to be transfered from one generation to another every, say, 50 years, and it's during that time that humanity is the weakest because the new holder is not able to use the power to full effectiveness yet. This is why Reiner refers to that power as the 'Coordinate': because it's a given point in time during which the power is the easiest to steal, in other words, it's a time coordinate.   Grisha returns in time just some time before RBA invade humanity in order to thwart their plans. He goes to the chapel the night the transfer is supposed to happen, interrupts it, transfers the power into Eren instead, and hopes that by the time RBA's people figure out that Eren is the new holder of that power they're looking for, he will have had enough time to go to the basement and learn how to use the power to protect himself and humanity from them. By doing so, the power is never stolen, humanity is never destroyed, and Grisha has altered the course of history.   What do you guys think?    What if Reiner called the special power the 'Coordinate' not because it happens at a given location, but because it happens at a certain point in time? What if he meant that it's a 'time coordinate', a certain point in time at which the power gets passed down from one generation to the other and humanity is therefore at its weakest?   I'm going to make a bold claim here, and say that the night the fall of the wall happened, the Reiss family wasn't just praying, they were also preparing the ritual to transfer the power. What if the power has to be transferred after a certain number of years?   I'm going to make an even bolder claim, and say that Reiner, Berthold and Grisha all come from the future. That's why Reiner and Berthold have a seemingly more advanced Titan technology. In an alternate timeline, RBA manage to destroy humanity and take back the Coordinate's power. However, Grisha knew this, so he came back in time as well, hoping to alter the course of history. That day when Reiner destroyed the wall, he knew very well that that wasn't a regular mindless Titan, and that was his signal for the start of the invasion by RBA's people.   In an alternate timeline, humanity got destroyed because the Reiss family were unable to protect themselves. So that night he went to the chapel, tried to convince them that he needed to take the power in order to protect humanity, but they obviously refused to believe him, so he had to take drastic measures. He got into a fight with them, killed them all, took the power, and gave it to his son.   He was hoping that, Eren. not being suspected by RBA, would have enough time to go to the basement, learn how to use the power, and save humanity from the Titan invasion. I'd say this was a huge gamble, and it almost failed, but in the end it did work, as Eren was able to use his power to get away from Reiner in chapter 50.   What do you guys think? I know the story Isayama takes inspiration from is big on time travelling, and this would answer a lot of questions about the mysteries of the story so far.    I don't know if you guys remember, but in a conversation with Hanji, Erwin said that the question that would answer all the questions was basically: 'Why do the Reiss want Historia even though she doesn't have any power?'  As of chapter 62, I still feel like this is really true.    My theory is simple: what if Grisha made a mistake that night at the chapel? What if he lacked an important piece of info or something simply didn't go the way he expected?  I've concluded that it's impossible to determine what really happened that night, because not only do we have too little information about the exact series of events, but we also know little about the Titans themselves. In fact, at this point we know so little about them that it's impossible to determine whether the Reiss are something special or rare. What I mean by that is that there might be other people like the Reiss family out there, or other people with a ''Coordinate's power''. All we know is that they have something related to Titans.   Furthermore, not only do we not know what happened that night, but we also ignore both what exactly happened between him and his son and how much time passed between the events and the chapel and the events between him and his son.  Finally, we also ignore Grisha's intentions, knowledge and background or life experiences. Why did he do this? How much did he know about the Titans' nature, and about the Reiss family and the Coordinate's power and the relationship between the two? How did he come to acquire all of his knowledge? That's possibly the most important thing, or set of things that we do not know about. At the very least, it's safe to assume that he was very aware of the Titans' existence, and that he knew of methods to turn people into what we call ''mindless Titans'' as well as methods of turning mindless Titans into what we call ''Titan-shifters'' (people who can turn into a Titan, but also retain control of their human body and can switch back and forth between the two forms). It's also likely that he possessed the physical means to turn someone into a mindless Titan, but that's not certain.   But that's really all we know about him. A lot of what we've been told about him feels intentionally vague, and what we have been shown about what happened that night could very well be intentionally misleading. So the only theory I feel that it's reasonable to come up with is that he made a mistake, that something went wrong somehow. The thing about science is that it's often extremely reliable unless you have a relatively large sample to work with. So if something did, in fact, go wrong that night, then we can assume one of two things: either he conducted some experiments on Eren, and the latter didn't respond the way he had anticipated, or there was a crucial piece of information about either the Reiss family, the Coordinate's power or the Titans themselves that he didn't have and which caused things to go wrong.   Regardless of what happened, I feel like, ultimately, it all comes down to 2 distinct theories: either Grisha getting himself eaten wasn't accidental and he wanted that to happen for some reason, or something went wrong which caused him to get eaten. In case he did get himself eaten on purpose, it might be because something went wrong and he did that as a last resort. At this point, the only thing that I'm truly convinced of is that something wrong that night for Grisha, and that's what lead to things going the way they did, regardless of whatever really went on that night.     ...Is how he became a Titan-shifter in the first place.  We know he didn't eat anyone from the Reiss family, because he murdered them all some time after becoming a Titan-shifter himself.  So he must have eaten someone too, but who? The only titans within the walls that we know of are the Reiss family, Eren and his father. The others come from outside the walls, and are very different from Eren.    Furthermore, eating another Titan-shifter cannot be the only way to become a shifter yourself, because otherwise, how did it all start? But if Grisha knew of that method that doesn't require the eating of someone, then why did he sacrifice himself to Eren? It must be because eating was the only way he knew or had access to, which means that he must have eaten someone in order to become a titan-shifter himself.  Clearly, he knew how to turn people into mindless titans because he did it for Eren, but who did he eat to become a shifter himself? Forcibly, there must have been other people within the walls who were titan-shifters in the past. Either that, or he comes from outside the walls.   Also, what prevented him from doing whatever he had in mind himself? What made it so that he had to give the power to his son instead? His sacrifice cannot have been accidental, because he became a shifter himself and could turn people into titans, so he must have known how the whole process works.    When he said 'you're the last person in the world who should have this, Eren', I know he was referring to the Coordinate's power, but what did he mean by that?  Is it because of Eren's personality, which Reiner thinks makes him unfit to possess that kind of a power? Or is it because of Eren's circumstances?  At first I thought that he simply meant that Eren should not have possession of this power because he does not know how to use it and has no one to teach him how to do so, or because him having it could make it easy for some people, like the monarchy, to steal it.  But now I'm starting to think that he might have meant that Eren is an impulsive, irrational brat who is not the right type of person to hold such a burden...  In all cases, regardless of whether Reiner is 'evil' or not, it's at least safe to assume that he knows more about this power than most if not all of the other main characters at this point, so if he says that Eren should not have it for whatever reasons, then I trust him. I'm not saying he's right, but he's the only one whom I feel has enough information about this situation to have an opinion about it.

Zackley tells Erwin that even though he wanted to overthrow the monarchy as well, their motives for doing so are very different.   Then there's a discussion between the members of the Survey Corps, they talk about a chapel were members of the Reiss family were killed years ago, and conclude that they should head there.  Then the story switches to a large cave, where Historia tells Eren that her father has been an ally of humanity all along.  Then Rod Reiss tells Eren that even though he has never been here, he should have memories of this place.  Then Rod Reiss and Historia touch Eren's back, and then Eren has a flashback of the Reiss family praying in a chapel, then his father (Grisha) setting fire to the chapel, and then his father extracting the Titan's power from a Titan that looks like Historia.   Then Rod Reiss says: Do you remember your father's sins now?  Then Eren has another flashback, his father cutting his own arm off and then himself in his Titan form attacking someone.  Then Eren has an horrified look on his face.  End.    Basically, I think all Reiss girls are ''vessels'' for the Coordinate's power, and that Historia is merely a back up one.  From my understanding, the Coordinate's power seems to be a special version of the Titan's shifter power, and, in order to acquire that power, the user has to become what the reddit community calls a 'mindless Titan' first.  So this is what happens: upon birth, the Reiss girl gets turned into a mindless Titan, and then literally eats her predecessor (the Reiss girl who had the Coordinate's power before her), acquiring both her power and her memories in the process. I'm unable to explain for what purpose the previous holder's memories are acquired, but perhaps it has to do with the nature of the Coordinate's power itself.  However, in case the Reiss girl is, for whatever reason, unable to acquire the Coordinate's power, then there needs to be a ''backup vessel'' that can hold the power until there is a girl from the following generation who is ready. I think Historia is that backup. She is an unlawful heir, and not a true Reiss, but she can still hold the Coordinate's power. However, because this heir is not legitimate, it cannot have a will of its own. That's why Historia was not killed, but also not raised properly. Because her mother didn't care, she has low self-esteem, lacks self-control, and struggles to create relationships. Therefore, she's easy to be toyed around and controlled by Rod Reiss until another Reiss girl is born and ready to eat her. In other words, she is the perfect backup vessel for the Reiss family.  Also, I think this is why Geographia was teaching her. She was teaching her how to use her power properly to serve the Reiss family in case she is actually needed as a vessel, but was also making it so that she forgets all of what she knows unless she's in presence of Geographia, so that she can do nothing on her own.            ...all have the same last name?   You know, for Levi, can I understand, because he did say that Kenny kind of raised him when he was a kid. So I can see how Kenny giving him his last name would make sense.  But Mikasa... what does she have to do with all of this? Is it because she's an 'Oriental' (whatever that's supposed to mean), and Kenny and Levi are that too? Are they supposed to be related by blood? Or is Ackerman some kind of code name for people who are part of a particular group or possess some kind of special ability or are special in some way? Is it a codename for people who are 'Orientals'?  I re read through a lot of chapters, especially those in which Mikasa and Levi are involved together, and I found nothing about this. In fact, I'm pretty sure the fact that Levi and Mikasa have the same last name is never mentioned or brought up in any way whatsoever. Kinda strange. They've known each other for, what?, years now?, and they've never discussed that?   And now Kenny also has that last name and there isn't anything said about it?   Am I missing something crucial here? Are we supposed to actually know what that means and I'm just retarded?    I'm surprised so few people are discussing this, but in the chapter 50 extra, Historia reveals that Krista Lenz was the name of the girl in the book Geographia was making her read in that flashback. That girl was also seen doing something with the Titans.  Does it mean there was actually a girl named Krista Lenz who lived at some point in the past? I mean, if she was in a book about the Titans, and Rod Reiss also used her name for Historia, it can't be a coincidence...    At the end of chapter 50, the narrator (which appears to be Historia), says 'I couldn't understand Ymir's actions at that time...'  Does that mean that what we're reading right now is humanity's past narrated from Historia's point of view?    After all that's happened to him, I wonder if he understands... if he understands that it can't be as simple as just 'murdering all the Titans', that there are actual people to blame for everything that's happened to him so far, and that these people sure aren't just Reiner and Berthold. Most importantly, I wonder if he understands that there is still a LOT of things that he can't and doesn't understand about himself, about the world surrounding him?  And if he does understand all these things now, I wonder if it will tone down his constant range, and make him take a more rational approach to all this?   What do you guys think? Basically, my question is, has Eren grown psychologically, or is he still the same angry fit brat who wants to murder all titans?    She refused to tell him what she knows about the world and Titans, and she ran away with the two people he hates the most at the moment.  After chapter 50, do you guys think Eren sees her as an enemy?    Why? Because we're all expecting a crazy reveal... some awe-inducing, insanely complicated scientific explanation behind the whole Titan thing. And Isayama is a mangaka, not a scientist with decades of research on humans' central nervous system under his belt, so he's not gonna be able to live up to those expectations. At least not to mine.   I know this is going to be controversial, but hang in there for a second. I believe that, the manga at least, has been hugely popular so far because of the extent to which it is shrouded in mistery... Everyone is eager to know about what exactly the Titans are, about the world's history, and about everything that relates to that, such as whether Monkey Trouble is a titan shifter or something else, who are RBA's people, what is the Coordinate's power, where is Grisha and what has he done to Eren, etc. And so the hype about all those mysteries is building up, and the expectations have become incredibly high.  But when shit hits the fan, and the time for Isayama to give us all the answers to those mysteries comes, is it going to be as awesome as everyone is expecting? Like I said, everyone is waiting for some crazy scientific theory maybe mixed with a bit of fantastic stuff, but in all cases, something that gives everyone the nerdgasm they've been building up to for years... And there's a good chance that Isayama isn't gonna be able to come up with something like that. That it won't be nearly as complicated or original or mind-blowingly awesome as everyone is hoping.   Anyway, I might be a negativist, a pessimistic... But that's what I think. And to think that makes me sad, but thanks to that I'm avoiding building my hopes up super high only to fall from my high horse down the road.    Ok, I don't know if I'm the only one with this issue, but I've been trying to build a witch hut farm using this design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_531937991 feature=iv src_vid=PzR0hfkhxmE v=RGynJ0yOhmA  I've used docm77's 1.8 fix, and the side with the comparators and repeaters works just fine, but the other side, the one with just the comparators, doesn't work for me, and I can't figure out why. Basically, the pistons that are supposed to push the redstone blocks just don't get activated on that side. To be more precise, it's also the side with the glass blocks.  Anyone knows why this is happening?   Am I the only one who wouldn't be surprised if we learned, at some point in the future, that the Titan's power was made as some kind of war weapon? It's been implied that the world of SnK has been at war for centuries. What if the Titan's weapon was the result of a major scientific breakthrough that had then been used as a weapon to turn the tide of a world conflict?   If you think about it, it has formidable war-related applications: You can turn enemy soldiers into mindless giant zombies that turn against their own people by trying to eat them; You can turn your own soldiers into 'war machines' with super-human healing/regenerative capacities and which become vastly stronger upon being wounded; If your soldiers ever disobey you or become unfit for warfare, you can replace them by having someone else eat them...?; You can increase your soldiers' lifespan by turning them back into mindless Titans when you don't need them for warfare...? (since it's been shown that humans don't age as mindless titans).  And, on top of that, there's also that mysterious power that Reiner referred to as the 'Coordinate' and which seems to be very special... Do I even need to mention the formidable uses that this power can have? With this, you don't even need to fight the enemy, you just need to mind-control them into obeying your orders.     Personally, I don't. I merely see them as illustrating the moral complexity of the story, and that there is a lot of going on outside the walls, and that there are different factions whose interests are clashing.   Sure, RBA have indirectly caused the deaths of many innocent people by tearing a hole in the wall. But then again, how many innocent people did the Survey Corps kill and that could have possibly regained control of their human form? Also, the monarchy has killed countless people who were a 'little too smart' on top on altering the memories of entire generations.   So yeah, I don't see RBA as evil. Just another one of the story's factions/groups with its own interests. At this point, every group in the story has been killing and doing arguably evil things in order to serve its own interests.    In chapter 50, when Eren first manifests his Coordinate's powers, Reiner says that they 'must retrieve it' referring to the Coordinate. In the dictionary, to retrieve means 'to recover' or to 'bring back'. Therefore, when Reiner says that, it is implied that his people once had that power.  We know that the monarchy has had that power for at least a hundred years. Now if the Coordinate's power was stolen from RBA's people over a hundred years ago, why did they wait this long to send people to try and retrieve it?  Also, Berthold implied in his conversation with Ymir that he had spent quite a bit of time as a mindless Titan too, unless he ate someone, possibly a Titan-shifter.   My theories is therefore that most of RBA's people were turned into mindless Titans some time after losing the Coordinate's power, and spent decades unable to control their body until some of them found a way to return to their human form. And I also believe that this only happened in recent times, which is why it's only now that they sent warriors to try and retrieve it, instead of, say, 50 or 30 years ago.  So, about RBA's age, I'd say, based on everything I just wrote, that there's a good chance that they are actually decades old just like Ymir.    A lot of people are trying to come up with elaborated theories as to why Reiner chose THAT timing to reveal  his identity and finally try to carry out his plan of bringing Eren back to his 'hometown'.  In plain terms, I don't think there is any elaborated theory here. I think he simply lost it, and went full retard. It's true that they were being suspected of being Annie's accomplices, but they obviously had no idea about that. Besides, the Survey Corps had no way of figuring out their real identity unless they blatantly made use of their titan's powers in front of them.   They could have used their position as soldiers within the Survey Corps to keep gathering useful information and eventually come up with an elaborated to kidnap Eren relatively easily and safely.   But instead, Reiner decided to reveal everything just like that, at a random place and time when the entire Survey Corps was chilling just a few footsteps away from them. It doesn't make sense, especially when you're a highly trained soldier who was entrusted with the task of carrying out a very important mission (wiping out humanity and bringing back the Coordinate).   I think this was very unprofessional of Reiner and Annie, simply put. Berthold didn't want Reiner to do this, you could clearly tell, and in a way he is the only one who carried his mission until the end... Reiner became conflicted and did something that had clearly not been thought through, and Annie developed a soft spot for some people that she could have easily killed when it was necessary (like Armin).   TL;DR title pretty much, Reiner went full retard, and Annie too, and that's why their mission failed in the end.         and actually make Eren get eaten and die.  Because, let's be realistic here, everyone is expecting Eren to not get eaten and everyone is expecting the Reiss family and Kenny   friends to ultimately fail.   But I think the story would take a very interesting turn if, for example, Historia does get Eren's power, but then turns against her own family and the monarchy, and ends up using her new powers against them and saving the Survey Corps from all dying. In fact, I think any scenario in which Eren as well as some other Survey Corps members end up dying would be quite interesting and completely unexpected.   But obviously this won't happen because Isayama isn't GRM and this isn't GoT... Although Isayama did say in an interview that he was planning to make SnK a 'everyone dies in the end' kind of story, but that was before the story got insanely popular worldwide, so yeah, I have low hopes here...    It's technically impossible that having a mindless Titan eat another Titan shifter be the only method to become a Titan shifter yourself, because if it is, then how did the very first Titan shifter come to be? There has to be at least one if not multiple other ways to become a Titan shifter.  Now I'm starting to think that the Titan's power being transferrable through eating is either an unwanted and unplanned side effect of the whole thing, OR a later modification that someone made to turn the Titan's power against its maker.  I think something like this happened: Someone made two variants of the Titan's power, one that neutralizes the enemies by turning them into mindless creatures that will turn against their own people by trying to eat them, and another much more powerful version where the user keeps control of his body and becomes a powerful human weapon. The first version was used on the creators' enemies, and the second one on their allies.  However, later, someone turned that weapon against its creators, by making it so that the mindless Titans can 'steal' the second more powerful version of the Titan's power by 'eating' those who possess it, also regaining control of their human body in the process.  I think RBA's people were on the 'brink of extinction' (i.e. in the process of all being turned into mindless Titans) until a few of them managed to capture enemy shifters and have their own people eat them. Berthold did imply that they had to eat people. I'm also not sure what the Coordinate's power has to do with all of this though, but I'm pretty sure that having it would allow them to turn the tide of whatever war/conflict they're caught into, given how powerful that power actually is when the user knows how to use it to the fullest extent. Also, Reiner did say that they must 'retrieve it', implying that they once had control of it, so they must know how to use it.           I mean, come on, this was a little too easy, right? These old noble men, all they do is spit out a lot of big words. And when you stop listening to those big words, they become powerless.  The real final battle/faceoff will be against Kenny   friends, who not only possess the anti-human 3 dimensional gear, but have also been shown to be far more skilled and to have far more knowledge than the other people serving the monarchy.   These people are probably where the Reiss family is, and that place is also most likely where Eren is being held. They are obviously the people with the actual power within the walls, and if the Survey Corps can't defeat them, then I believe they won't have made any significant progress, even if they got rid of the old noble men who, when you think about it, have no actual power and are only there to look good while the Reiss get the dirty job done with the help of Kenny   friends. Think about it... Even if now the masses know what's really going on, all they have to do, once they have Eren's power, is use it to wipe everyone's minsd and then boom, everything that the SC has done so far is in vain.   Also, I believe that Kenny has always been a part of this... Even when he was murdering soldiers in the capital, it was also in the name of whatever purpose he's serving right now. I'll even take it a step further, and say that he is the mastermind behind all of this, at least in the present day (since the walls have obviously been up for longer than he's been alive). In other words, he's been running the show for a while now. Either him, or the leader of the Wall Cult is the actual leader within these walls. And right below that leader is Rod Reiss (in terms of power/influence).        I think the link between them is simple. Historia is the latest member of the true royal family, and Eren somehow possesses the Coordinate's power.  Rod Reiss doesn't want to eat Eren himself (like Hanje said), he wants Historia to do it. Whatever happened to Geographia (the person to previously have Eren's power and who looked a hell of a lot like Historia), it's obvious she doesn't have that power anymore. Maybe she's dead. We don't know her fate yet, but it's irrelevant for now.   In all cases, if the monarchy still had her power, they wouldn't have told Erwin that they are 'waiting for those guys to have that power', they would have used 'that power' already instead, and people would have been mind-wiped already by now.   There's a lot of complex theories out there, but I think it's that simple. The plan is for Historia to eat Eren so that the Coordinate's power can return to the Reiss family.      We know from the manga and anime that, originally, humanity was on the brink of extinction because of war. One day, a bunch of rich people left in boats and made it to a new continent where walls had been 'prepared' for humanity to live in and where it would live in a world 'eternally without strife'. Then they altered the memories of the first generation and made all outside world knowledge taboo and all that stuff.  What if this was originally done with good intentions? Humanity was at war for whatever reasons, and then someone started turning people into mindless Titans, hoping it would rally the different nations under a single cause as they would have to work together in order stop the Titan's 'virus'. However, this backfired, and the war escalated as those different nations tried to have sole possession of that Titan's power.  Over time, some people saw how vicious humans were in their natural environment, and how the Titan's power had just made things worse, and they started dreaming of a better world. In other words, what if those people originally wanted to create a legitimately happy functioning society, also known as a utopia? A world free of not only technology that makes it easier for humans to kill each other, but more importantly, free of the Titan's power, which, in the past, had clearly failed to bring people together.  However, their enemies were strong, and so they still needed to use the Titan's power themselves if they wanted that dream world to become reality. They knew that their society would never work if people knew that there was actually something outside, so they decided to use drastic measures in order to make it work.   Over time, like in all typical utopic societies, some of the people in charge became greedy and selfish, as their immense wealth and knowledge started getting to their head. And that's why we have people like the fake King Fritz in the current story. But I believe there are also people with good intentions and who have kept the original goal of having this better world in mind. I believe Pastor Nick to be one of those people: When he saw the struggle of the masses within the walls, it affected him deeply, but he decided, based on what he had been taught, that things would become much worse if he let out the secrets of the world, and so he was genuinely ready to die in order to protect them. And in the end, he probably did (although he might have also been killed because they suspected him of giving away some of those secrets, but that's another story).    Now, obviously, I'm not saying that all the people currently in power are not corrupt and selfish assholes. In fact, I believe they are deliberately portrayed as such. But my point is that this world within the walls, which by now is clearly a lie to the reader (and by that, I mean that there's clearly a lot of going on outside and these walls aren't all there is about the world), was originally created with good intentions  Also, was it right to take away people's free will and keep them from finding out about the world outside through whatever means necessary, even if it means murdering those who are a 'little too smart'? Well, probably not, but I don't think anyone can question the genuine desire to make the world a better place from which this whole thing started.      I think the reason why we're only seeing tiny bits of what's going on with Rod, Historia and Eren is because Isyama is slowly building up to something big with this whole scene, and by big, I mean a piece of information that is big compared to what we've been spoonfed so far.  I could be wrong, but I believe Isayama said in an interview that Eren would learn a 'horrible truth' around volume 15, I believe this is what he is building up to right now and that we're gonna learn about it in chapter 63 or possibly even 62.   Now, as to why Historia is talking so casually with Rod while Eren is in chains on some kind of altar, in my opinion, it's either because Historia has been brainwashed into believing that whatever the hell is going on there is fine, OR, in a plot twist, it's because she's playing along until the Survey Corps shows up. OR, in an even more twisted plot twist, this isn't actually Historia, but a relative of her family that looks a lot like her, and Historia is being held captive somewhere else.     I cannot tell you from where I got this, but all I can say is that comes partially from 4chan and also from another Chinese source who has apparently obtained some info on things that will be revealed by Isayama in the next 3 chapters, starting with a flash back involving Erwin in 61.  First, what my source tells me is that there indeed titans in the walls, and that these titans are a means of controlling the masses. The real people in power are the noble families, who possess the means to 'activate' or 'call forth' those Titans and have them alter the minds of the people, like Geographia did to Historia. Apparently it has something to do with their huge size, but this was too unclear for me to state much about it.   I know it's hard to believe, but bear with me here, you will see this all unfolding in the next few chapters.     ...for the Survey Corps when that's basically what they've been doing since the start of the story - killing humans?   It's been shown that humans who were turned into Titans can be brought back to their human form, which means they are still alive.  In other words, they've been killing breathing humans all along.    This is what got me into SnK in the first place: the hope of seeing badass Titan fighting scenes. The Clash of Titans arc made my wish come true, but all it really did in the end was leave me wanting much, much more.  I had initially thought the Clash of Titans arc was merely the beginning of it all, but never was I so wrong... All we got afterwards is people with no Titan form, shooting at each other with 17th century guns.   Whatever the Titan's power is, it's obvious by now that the SnK world is full of people who possess it, so why not give us Titan fighting, Isayama?   I'm sorry, but the current arc is super-extra-mega boring. I want Muay Thai fighting Titan shifters and godzilla-sized ones. I want pure destruction! If the Coordinate's power is really as important as Reiner says... if the old world societies have really been at war with each other for centuries like the story seems to imply... then why isn't there a bunch of people trying to retrieve it? Why just RBA?   Sounds like what's going with their 'hometown' would be a lot more interesting to read than this boring ass excuse of a story we've got going at the moment.    http://calorescence.tumblr.com/post/51450703198/did-you-know-the-inside-covers-of-the-japanese  'Unable to match the overwhelming force of the Titans, humanity was forced to sail to a new world. At this time, most of humanity had been annihilated, but the majority of this was at the hands of their fellow humans.'  'In the new world, great walls had previously been prepared.'  This is contradictory, because we now know the walls were made using the Titan's power, and if they made the walls using that, it means they knew how to use it. And if they knew how to use the Titan's power, then how could they have been 'unable to match the overwhelming force of the Titans'?  Or maybe that's what they wanted everyone to believe?  Somebody explain this one to me.    It's hard to see that if you can't read Japanese, but at some point in the anime there's some text shown and which basically states that, long before some people even left for the new continent where the walls would be eventually, the world was war-torn. And because of that, there weren't many humans left.  I'm wondering why the world was at war. Any idea?   What if Lod Reiss actually IS the highest authority within the Walls, and the reason why Kenny isn't answering to him is simply because he's working for someone OUTSIDE the walls?   IMO, it's either Kenny is working for people that don't live in these walls, OR the actual authority is the leader of the Wall cult, and he has hired Kenny to make sure that no one finds out the truth about the world in which they live. That would make sense, since, in ancient times, the religious leader often had more power than the king himself.    From pages 42 to 45 of chapter 48, I think there is a lot of foreshadowing, and I'm saying that having a good idea of how Isayama does things.   'Being hated by people...' - Picture of Eren: I think this means Eren will be hated by everyone because of his powers.  'Only the time that we were acting as soldiers was... enjoyable...' - Picture of Reiner: He will never be able to fully go back to who he was before the attack on the walls because of his time spent with the Survey Corps; he will have an identity struggle.  'Please, somebody... I'm begging, somebody please find us' - Pictures of Ymir/Berthold: I don't know what this could mean specifically, but I think it hints at how all of the shifters have miserable lives and we will learn that in the future.  'Somebody will have to stain their hands with blood' - Picture of Armin: Armin will have to learn how to become an evil motherfucker who slaughters a bunch of people, basically. This is trending with his character development so far, so it makes sense to me.       When Berhold says this to Ymir:  'It can't be helped if you don't remember. It was the same for us, too. Eren doesn't seem to remember either. So that's how it works....'  What exactly is he talking about?    Erwin said that by fightning Annie and all, they had chosen the lesser of two evils.   Well, what if that's what RBA have been doing all along so far, choosing the lesser of two evils? What if they had no choice? What if the survival of their own people depends on whether they retrieve the 'Coordinate' or not?   Ymir told Eren, referring to R B, to not 'make such small fry his enemy', implying that there are some much more dangerous people out there who are probably the ones behind all this. Also, the way R B have been talking ever since the big reveal, it sounds like there's a part of them that didn't want to have a part in all of this, that they would have actually preferred to be simple members of the Survey Corps fighting Titans in order for humanity to survive.   Ever since that big reveal, many people have been portraying them as villains, but something tells me that they're merely pawns trapped in a great game of chess that some people (or at least some sentient beings) are playing.   Anyone else feels this way? By the way, I'm not justifying their actions, I'm just saying that it's probably a lot more complex than just a bunch of kids being sent to destroy humanity.    She was right when she said she wanted to take Historia away because the world inside the walls would soon turn to hell.  Pretty sure that's what's happening right now. It has begun. First the end of the monarchy, which leads to chaos. And then the Titans inside the walls wake up, rise and march.    I've noticed that the term is used quite a bit in the story. In fact, RBA all seem to refer to themselves as 'warriors'.  I wanted to know what that could possibly mean, so I've done a little bit of research, and what I found allowed me to come to many interesting conclusions.   If you look up the definition of the term in any dictionary, you will see those 2 definitions:  1) Someone who is experienced or engaged in warfare; a soldier;  2) Someone who has shown vigor, courage or agressiveness in an activity, cause or conflict.  However, it's actually more complicated than that. I've done a bit of research. In our modern world, the term 'warrior' is mostly an anachronism, referring to the Middle Ages, when most states recognized warriors as a separate caste within an army (knight, samurai, etc). These people usually had high athletic abilities and fought on the ground with nothing but an armor and some kind of weapon.  Nowadays, the term that widely replaces warrior is 'soldier', and the only exceptions are in the context of propaganda, when people are being encouraged to take part in a conflict or cause. In other words, it is mostly used metaphorically.  Based on this, the question here is: are there actual warriors, people trained specifically for combat and recognized as such within their  own society, in Shingeki no Kyojin? In that case, 'warrior', I would guess, refers to people who possess/have been given the Titan's power and are trained to use it for military purposes. I'd say the answer is yes, because I think it's highly unlikely that some random kids would have this kind of power and be sent into enemy territory to carry out a dangerous mission. Wherever RBA come from, people are probably trained for this kind of thing from a very young age and warfare is probably an omnipresent thing. In other words, is it probably a highly militaristic society.   If I'm right, this also tells us a lot about the level of technology they have in Shingeki no Kyojin. If people could blow each other up in a few minutes using nuclear bombs like we do, there would be no need for a thing such as the Titan's power. In our society, warrior castes, that is, people who actually fight themselves and use their athletic abilities as their main 'weapon', started disappearing as technology started advancing rapidly and warfare started becoming more of an intellectual thing. In fact, nowadays, that's what warfare is: entirely an intellectual thing, and very little manpower is actually required. Just fast planes and anti-missile shields and missiles that can reach their target from super far and nuclear bombs that can destroy all life in a relatively short period of time.   To say this differently and also conclude, their technology is probably very limited outside of things that relate to the Titan's power. In fact, if some religious freaks used the Titan's power itself to build those huge walls, it's probably because it was the most efficient way of doing so. On the other hand, I would guess that Titan's power-related technology is probably a lot more advanced than we have been shown so far. For people outside the walls, this whole Titan thing, whatever it is, is probably a widely known and common thing that everyone uses for various purposes, or at least for war.         So it's pretty much canon now that there's a whole world full of human beings outside of the walls, right?  I mean, first, in the anime it says that, a long time ago, a bunch of well-off religious men made huge ass walls using the Titan's power and then brought a bunch of people with them there by crossing the ocean with boats.  Secondly, we know from the manga that RBA clearly come from somewhere outside the walls.   Also, it's been hinted in the manga that the government erased the memories of the people who came from outside of the walls. Add to that the censoring of books, suppression of technology, religious propaganda, etc..  If this isn't the author telling us 'The people Inside the walls have been living one big lie for over a century now', then I don't know what it is.    Wikipedia defines eating as 'the ingestion of food or other object, usually to provide heterotrophic organism particularly for energy and growth.' Maybe some of the Titanized humans rely on some source of energy, but by no stretch of the imagination do they need any kind of food in order to survive. We've seen what happens when they eat human flesh: it just stays in their body, and when there's no room for it anymore, they just start regurgitating it.    So why do Titans manifest the behavior of 'eating' human flesh? Well, in the past, I was totally puzzled by that question, but I believe the answer's been given to us in one of the recent chapters, through that conversation between Ymir and Berthold about Ymir's past. Out of that conversation, we can come to two inferences: first, when humans get turned into mindless Titans, there's still some part of their body that remains somewhere in there, and they are still conscious to a certain extent, although they have obviously no control of their actions; and secondly, through a process that involves a mindless Titan literally ingesting the body of a Titan-shifter, the former can acquire the latter's power and regain control of his body.    Now, based on this, here's my theory:   I believe that, at the start, there were at least two people at war with each other. One of them somehow developped what we know as the Titan's power, and then made two variants of it: one that would not only render their enemies powerless, but also turn them against their own people, by transforming them into mindless Titans that are programmed to try and 'eat' humans; and another much more powerful variant that would allow them to empower their own people and turn them into weapons of war (aka the Titan-shifters).    However, later, someone else acquired that Titan's power and turned it against its creator, by altering it so that people who would be turned into mindless Titans would be able to steal a Titan-shifter's power through a process that would involve ingesting his body.    I know it's somewhat far-strected, but there are two things that make me believe this.    First, we know from the anime that the world outside the walls is a war-torn one, and that the first generation of people who came to the world within the walls were lead by a bunch of religious, well-off men who wanted to establish a war-free society. Furthermore, it was said that the walls had been created using the Titan's power prior to the arrival of the people there, which implies that the Titan's power existed long before that.   Secondly, we know from both the anime and the manga that the society in which RBA live seems to be a typically ruthless, warfare-oriented one, in which people start training for fightning at a young age and fight all their life.    Based on that, I believe that the people living outside the walls have been at war and fightning each other using the Titan's power for a very long time, possibly for centuries before the start of the story. And it's easy to imagine how having the Coordinate's power would allow RBA's people to turn the tide of that war/conflict that they're in.   Anyway, tell me what you guys think. This is my theory on why Titans try to 'eat' people even though they get seemingly no benefit from doing so, based mostly on that conversation between Berthold and Ymir about the latter eating the former's friend who was most likely also a Titan-shifter.       Hanji told Erwin that, if they found out why the people in power within the walls want Historia even though she has none of the knowledge about the Titans that people in the family usually have, they would solve all of the mysteries.  Well, simply put, I think that something has changed and now Historia is the only suitable person within the Reiss family who can receive the Coordinate's power. Remember, Kenny Ackermann didn't mind coldly killing Historia right in front of her father the last time he saw her. If he still wanted to kill her, I think he would have done it a while ago.   I believe that a certain Titan's power can be passed from one person to another, and that, somehow, the memories of those who had that power previously can be accessed. That's why Eren's father told him 'their memories will help you'. That's also why Eren can have 'visions' of Geographia.   The way I see it, the Coordinate's power was always possessed by a member of the Reiss family up until Eren, and that is why they are the real royalty. The last person to have it before Eren was the mysterious mind-wipping girl (a.k.a Geographia). How do I know she was a member of the Reiss family? Well, first, she was taking care of Historia, probably because the latter was a relative, and also because she was the only one who could have a contact with her without getting in trouble due to her powers. Secondly, in his 'vision', Eren sees her living in luxury, almost like a princess.   Now, why Historia would be the only suitable person, well, I'm not sure, but I have a few theories. Maybe, a simple reason is that she is the only/last living member of the latest generation of the family, or maybe only certain people can receive that power and they want to know if Historia is one of them.   Anyway, tell me what you guys think. But I'm almost certain that Geographia was the previous Coordinate/had the Coordinate's power. In chapter 54, in Historia's flashback, when she wipes her mind, there is the exact same visual effect as when Eren uses his power to command the Titans against the one who ate his mother. That can't be a coincidence. Furthermore, Geographia seemed horrified by the idea that Historia could someday grow up to become like her... Probably because she had to do a lot of 'dirty work' using her powers.            Please, tell me, does it exist? I need to know for scientific reasons. :P  Searched on Google, couldn't find anything.    WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SNK WORLD IN GENERAL:  -The old world, where all people used to live before some of them left for what is now known as the world within the Walls, was already war-torn before the appearance of the Titans.  -Some of that old world's richest people left for a new continent, the world within the walls, over a hundred years before the start of the story. However, there are still people living in that old world nowadays (RBA's people). There seems to have been a religious purpose in creating the world within the Walls (in the anime it says that they wanted to create 'an ideal world, without sins').  -The memories of the first generation of people living in the world within the walls were altered somehow so that they wouldn't remember life before the Walls. There is also at least one person proven to have mind-altering powers (the Mysterious Girl).  -The royalty of the world within the walls is not its actual highest authority, as the Central Military Branch does not seem to work for the King (Rod Reiss).   -The Walls are not only around the world in which what is known of humanity lives, but also beneath it. They were seemingly made with some Titans' skin-hardening ability and those Titans are still dormant within them, possibly as a result of the absence of light.   -The Walls were 'made' before the arrival of the humans on the new continent.  -The language spoken by the people within the walls is not the only one spoken by humans throughout the world at large. For example, at Castle Utgard, there was a food can with inscriptions in another language on it, and Ymir was able to read it.   -Reiner, Berthold and Annie were originally humans turned into mindless Titans until they somehow became Titan-shifters. Whether this was done by eating other Titan-shifters or through another method is impossible to say based on current knowledge.  -Ymir went from a fully-fused Titan to a Titan-shifter after eating one of RBA's friends who was also a Titan-shifter.  WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE TITANS:  -The Titans are in reality humans whose body has, except for the spinal cord, completely fused with the material of which the Titans are made. After fusing, that person still 'exists', but cannot control neither his human body nor his Titan one. Furthermore, while fused with the Titan, humans do not age, and if they ever go back to their human form, they will have the physical age of before they fused. Finally, the process through which humans are turned into Titans is unknown, but does not require physical contact. Also, the only sentient being who was shown as being able to turn humans into Titans is the possible Titan-shifter known as 'The Beast Titan'.  -It's possible to alter the process that turns humans into Titans so that the human will not have completely fused with the material of which Titans are made. Those people are known throughout the community at large as 'Titan-shifters'. These people can both turn into their Titan form and go back to their human one at will, although being a Titan seems to be physically exhausting for the human and, therefore, those people can only be Titans for a certain period of time. What causes this is unknown. Furthermore, it's also possible to alter that process so that the person's Titan will have altered/enhanced characteristics that makes it a lot more threatening than the average Titan, or that makes it serve a specific purpose, such as height, hardened skin, etc..   -Some Titans, both regular (a.k.a fully fused) and Titan-shifter ones, seem to rely on light from the sun in order to move around, and to be inactive at night. Although this is not the case for all of them.   -Regular/fully-fused Titans seem to be able to gain a Titan-shifter's Titan-shifting abilities by literally eating him.. This might explain why all Titans try to eat humans: unconsciously, they do so in hope of eating a Titan-shifter and being freed for their Titan form. This behavior might be encoded into the (or at least one of the) process(es) which turns humans into Titans.   POSSIBLE BUT UNCONFIRMED TITAN-SHIFTERS:  -The Beast Titan, the Titans within the Walls, the Titan in the book that the Mysterious Girl showed to Historia.   UNCONFIRMED THEORIES ABOUT THE TITANS:  -It's possible that being a Titan-shifter is physically exhausting due to the human body and brain having to control a large quantity of physical matter (the material of which Titans are made).   -It's possible that, if a Titan-shifter stays in his Titan form for too long, he will start fusing more and more with his Titan until he has lost of control of his human body and become like the mindless, regular Titans.  -It's possible that a Titan-shifter's Titan is influenced by the person's human body's characteristics or vice versa. For example, Reiner is physically strong and bulky, and therefore so is his Titan. Another possible example: Berthold's Titan is enormous and therefore releases a lot of heat, which makes Berthold sweat a lot in his human form.   -There might be multiple processes that allow humans to be turned into Titans. The one used by the Beast Titan might not be the only one. It might also be possible to turn a human directly into a Titan-shifter; that seems to have been the case for Eren. Just like Ymir, Eren underwent some memory loss while undergoing the process that allowed him to become a Titan-shifter. This might mean that the process which turns humans into Titans modifies something in the human brain.         How did RBA know that what they were looking for (the person with the power to control the Titans) was within the Walls in the first place?  Also, why does the royal family want Historia, when she is not eligible for the throne and has none of the knowledge that the other members of her family seem to have about the Titans?  Same for Ymir and Reiner and Berthold. They seem to regard Historia as an important person, but she has no freaking clue what's going on. They seemed to believe that Historia could help find them find the person that turned out to be Eren, yet she is as ignorant as the others.  Why? Am I missing something here?     I mean, for what god damn reason would you NOT read the manga version of any story when it's the original, most accurate version of it that exists?   Is Annie dead??  Will we ever see Reiner and Berthold again? Will we ever see their history, how they grew up and the events that lead to them being sent to the walls to find the Coordinate power?  How did they know that what they were looking for was within the Walls in the first place?  Did they undergo the same process as Ymir, that is, they wandered mindlessly until they ate another titan-shifter? (Berthold seemed to imply that when talking to Ymir)  Are they considered some of their people's strongest 'warriors'? Or are they considered weak and we will see some much powerful titan-shifters in the future?   What do you guys think???     http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attack_on_Titan oldid=614559035 diff=614617202  It's still waiting for review, but I've added this part to the 'summary of the story' part of Snk on Wikipedia:  'However, as the story progresses, the plot shifts in focus, being centered more around Historia Reiss, a young girl who is a member of the Survey Cops and whose mysterious royal family is suspected of knowing the truth about both the walls protecting humanity from the Titans and the Titans themselves.'  It could use some tweaking, but you guys get the idea. This might be a spoiler, but people can't expect to visit Wikipedia without coming across a spoiler. Also, saying that the story is merely about Eren, Mikasa and Armin fighting Titans (which is basically what the Wikipedia description says atm) is simply not true. That was basically the story up until chapter 30 ish... and ever since then, the story has been more and more about Historia Reiss, her role within the royal family and about how that royal family is linked to the secret truths about the Titans as a whole. If you look at Eren's role from the POV of someone who's reading the manga, he is merely one of those people who happen to have the ability to turn into a Titan-like version of themselves (he also has the 'coordinate's power', but considering that we know this power is transferrable, Eren himself is nothing), and I actually believe that Historia plays a more important role than Eren in the story now. We'll see how the plot evolves in the upcoming months, but to say that the story is still only about Eren and his two childhood friends fighting Titans to save the world is plain wrong. That ended when the Clash of the Titans story arc started, and since then the story has been about something much deeper.          Hey guys, not really a question that can be answered, but I was wondering if in the future there would be a story arc where we see what Reiner, Berthold and Ymir do after the end of volume 12, that is, them travelling to Reiner's and Berthold's hometown and seeing what happens to Ymir once there and all that stuff.  I think it could be very cool. :)      If Eren really was a mindless Titan who wandered outside of the walls and then ate someone with Titan-shifting powers like Ymir, then why doesn't he remember any of it?  Ymir remembers it well enough to know for how many decades she wandered mindlessly.          There's something that struck me as odd in volume 12.  In the extra pages of volume 12 (http://imgur.com/a/T6yk3#LeKKqp4), Reiner asks Ymir 'why did you come to OUR territory?'  What exactly is Reiner referring to, there? He is considering the Shiganshina district as their territory? Does he mean the Titans' territory? Does that mean he consider himself a Titan and not a human?    At the end of volume 13, Historia says that she's never gonna forgive Ymir for siding with Reiner and Berthold and leaving with them instead of staying by her side. Although it seemed like Ymir did it more out of pity for them rather than because she wanted to side with them, but anyway, Historia doesn't know that.  Do you think she was just angry and confused or they're really gonna be enemies from now on? (if they ever meet again, that is)   There's a few things that I don't understand.  Reiner seemed to believe that having Historia on his side would help him find the person that turned out to be Eren.   It was also said that the Reiss family is the actual authority within the walls.  Yet, Kenny seems to obey to someone that isn't Rod Reiss. Does that mean Kenny is working for someone outside the walls?  Also, what does the Reiss family represent? They know about the secret of the walls, I guess? But even if Reiner knew that the Reiss family knows  about the walls, what's the link between these Titan-filled walls and Eren's ability to control Titans? Could it be that Eren can make these Titans break free from their 'wall form'? Or does Eren have some other power that he's not aware of yet?  I'm really confused.       Ok guys, here's a crazy theory that I came up with.   In the extra pages of Volume 13, Historia strongly hints that Krista Lenz is actually the name of the girl in the book that the mysterious lady with the mind-wipping powers used to make her read.  (You can find these extra pages here http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/2416)  This in itself is a big revelation, but I'm going to take it further and say that the girl in the book is actually the mysterious lady herself. My bet is that the wall-worshipping people are also those with the mind-wipping powers and who wiped the minds of the first generation of people living within the walls (this is confirmed by Erwin's father who was taken away for discovering this).  Now in the book, we see a girl worshipping a Titan. My theory is that the mysterious lady is also the girl in the book and her real name is also Krista Lenz, or at least she's a person related to someone who actually existed and whose name was Krista Lenz.  Crazy theory I know, but that's what I think.       This is my theory based on all the info we have so far from the manga and various other official sources.  My theory is, simply put, that an order of religious people created a 'dream-world', in other words, a perfect world where people could live based on their ideals.  To me, it seems obvious.  We know that the walls were 'made' by someone beforehand for humanity to live in them.  We know that the memories of the first generation of people living within the walls were erased.  We know that religious organizations have a big presence in the story, and that people from that religious group inside the walls are bent over on keeping the truth about the walls secret.  So this is what I think happened. A bunch of religious people wanted to make their own little world, so they made the walls. But it's one big lie, and since we know only the rich and powerful left for that world, the rest of humanity must have survived somehow and is still occupying the world at large.       Hey guys,  I'm not sure how to explain this, but if you buy the actual physical copies of the volumes, there is 'hidden' Japanese text at the bottom of the pages.  I'm also not sure if it's a manga or anime spoiler, because it appears in some of the volumes that already have been animated, but here goes:  A long time ago, humanity lived on another continent. It was a war-torn world, and a lot of people had already died because of the endless wars.   Because of this, humanity was severely weakened, and when the Titans started appearing, it was unable to face their overwhelming power.  So the humans decided to leave for another continent. It had also been decided that this new continent  would be 'sacred' and 'protected from sin', and so at the time the Walls had already been 'prepared' (not sure about how this word translates) for humanity to that end.  In the end, only the most rich and powerful embarked on the boats that would go to that new continent. The trip was harsh, and by the time humanity had arrived, only half the boats were still there.  Soon, however, the Titans started appearing on the new continent as well, and it was decided that humanity would never leave the walls again to protect itself.    That's it. Sorry if it's not well translated, I tried my best.    My own interpretation: Based on this, the world within the Walls was made as big one lie, as a dream world where the outside world doesn't exist and those in power lie about it. Also, most people who didn't leave the continent probably found a way to survive.        http://white-screen.jp/?p=32621 Do not get emotionally attached to any character, Hajime Isayama did say in an interview that most of them would die before the end of the story.

 I think there are probably some 'good' elements within the intelligentsia that are probably trying to expose things. I think Assange might be one of those conduits...    claim 6 dependents like I do...    Look through Tom Dilorenzo's work on Anti-Trust: -  [The Origins of Anti-Trust](http://mason.gmu.edu/~trustici/LAW108/The%20Origins%20of%20Antitrust-%20An%20Interest%20Group%20Perspective.pdf)   [The Truth About Sherman ](http://mises.org/daily/331)  [Monopoly, Competition, and Antitrust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBYopktmL6Y)  I would also recommend: -  [Tom Woods: Robber Barons and the Progressive Era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VA9VZeox3g)  [Rothbard: Man Economy   State - Monopoly and Competition](http://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10a.asp)   She couldnt really believe that right? I mean shes just trying to get attention right?   RIGHT!?   Also, equating "trickle down economics" with bussiness job growth is just stupid... these are the people running the country... Either a true believer, a complete idiot, or evil...   Who liberty is being infringed upon by Cliven Bundy? The liberty being lost in that situation is Cliven Bundys... the arbirary line being drawn in that situation is STILL THE GOVERNMENT...  Bundy in my view actually has a legitimate homestead claim on that land predating federal regulation. In the legal sense its a matter of original appropriation and mixing of labor with the land that the family has established.   Thats not to say that the land isnt truly the property of Native Americans which Im sure used the land before whites. They have the claim of original appropriation and in my view a right to the land. but within the current legal paradigm Bundy has more right to the land than government...   Thats completely different. Private property rights prevent that and even if you do I can seek compensation in the courts. Governments cannot own property. Borders are nothing more than the outlines of the territorial monopoly of the state.  Individuals have the right to travel while not infringing of others personal property. Just because foreigners enter the country doesnt mean they are just going to be going all willy nilly crazy and "come live in your house, eat your food and fuck your girlfriend..." lol thats obviously absurd.  I agree wholeheartedly that immigration should not be subsidized though. Just like it is not moral to prevent someone from following their own feet with the monopoly of force called government... it is likewise not moral to force taxpayers to pay for them...   Most arent ready to identify all as human beings having the same unalienable rights. My liberty doesn't somehow become null and void just because I cross an imaginary line drawn arbitrarily on a map by politicians... Every individual has the right to travel to better his circumstances...   The startling thing is that there are probably around the same amount of 'illegals' fleeing the United States right now for freer countries and better opportunities.   I agree with your proposal. People are not 'illegal' just because government gives them that designation. They are free. The problem with immigration policy as this article points out is that it is subsidized. The drug wars affect also should be considered. By ending the drug war, opening up borders, and killing subsidies, the market will put these people where they are most needed and most productive.   	7

Hell, we slaughter and imprison billions of animals for food every year; if we, as a society, can't even bring ourselves to stop eating them in every meal, what chance is there for anything even resembling rights?   /r/postnationalist    ok ill stop putting that in the titles~   Northern Quebec is mostly populated from Haitian descent immigrants according to this map. But then again it's only 30 people who account for 7.5% of the population....So that makes sense. I am quite surprised at how many Filipino people there are. I would have said Chinese or Vietnamese would be higher.   Northern Quebec is mostly populated from Haitian descent immigrants according to this map.

Make a debunking of the myles powers videos    If your culture can't handle a Mexican / Muslim guy mowing lawns / whatever your culture sucks    big labor is definitely partly to blame -- western labor hates competition  another factor was basically no media sources supported it..   /r/postnationalist celebrates our multicultural society   still, calling for development in poor countries hardly makes him a "statist"    ArfMeow is a funny and clever troll  +1   thats not what seymour hersh said   ty   Especially when most immigration now is refugees from European supported wars    Japan is a closed society who can't admit their mistakes    Seriously?

It's a nice exercise.     although I support the supposed aims of the TPP it does appear to be a flawed document      i guess its not bad economics so much as funny economics  SOURCE: I STUDIED ECONOMICS IN COLLEGE   plus if u literally exercised 16 hours a day.. thats like 3200 calories  whereas if u eat less..  tops 500 calorie deficit/day   i dunno the whole time i was watching it  i was like  WOOT 3d dinosaurs  try smoking a j before~   to be fair thats more than most redditors (and my econ 102) and i love my PN bros   nice!   whoever replied u r shadowbanned   not like anyone is gonna read a 2 day old thread..      Anyone good at fighting games never loses a single game to button mashers    Maybe he was a fraud    "legendary" is right    Working out 10 hours a day is more than any diet restrictions.. No?    Why is there a bag of mini oreos here anyway?!!   But if u walk 8 hours a day that's 1600 calories burned..

Currently there are are two kinds of vessels in the US Navy, submarines and targets.   china doesnt need carriers, they just need to sink the US carriers.. apparently some subs can get right under them easily   http://www.quora.com/How-vulnerable-are-the-US-aircraft-carriers-and-battle-groups-to-enemy-attack    Their are numerous links, pics and articles demonstrating a submarines ability to get in position, sink below a thermal layer and in complete silence launch a salvo of devastating weapons. The response from the carrier group would be immediate, total and savage but the sub is still invisible and depending on its next steps, stands a very real chance of surviving. Diesel Electrics and Subs using Air Propulsion drive shafts have long been discussed and studied to learn tactics to defend against. The Swedish navy 'rented' an entire Sub and crew to the U.S. Navy to work against, the six month tour ended up extending to two years such was the realisation that these subs were very dangerous to carriers and large capital ships  A carrier battlegroup is difficult but not impossible to attack. There is some vulnerability to submarines as well as cruise missiles that fly very low. The important thing to take into account, however, is that these weapons have fairly short ranges and are sophisticated enough that few adversaries posses them. The only "mid-ocean" risk would be from Russia (or a former Soviet country) that has a nuclear attack submarine. Non-nuclear submarines and cruise missiles will both operate within several  hundred miles of an enemy coast. The weapons of a carrier battlegroup are of sufficient range that they can stay outside of the range of these weapons and still attack the enemy.  Several countries have developed very quiet non-nuclear submarines. In a conflict, however, the ASW forces associated with a carrier battle group will be actively looking for these subs. The sub hunters are using combinations of active and passive sonar buoys, helicopters with dipped arrays, as well as other tools. While not every target can be defended like this, it is likely that a carrier battle group will be well defended.  Another commenter pointed out the risk of anti-ship missiles like the DF-21. There are several problems with those systems, not the least of which is that they would need to be targeted accurately against a moving target from a long distance away. Second, the ballistic variants look an awful lot like nuclear missiles, and so could lead to an inadvertent nuclear escalation.   **Aircraft carriers are a remnant of WWII and would not last long in a full-fledged conflict where modern technology is used**, but that is not their purpose today.

Myles touches on the freefall     the US fight against the Filipino "insurrectionists" at the turn of the century remains a blank spot to most Americans. There are some very good reasons for this. Most people don't like to be reminded that the US was an openly racist major power more interested in trade than in freeing the natives of the Philippines. It is disturbing to read about American heros like Teddy Roosevelt denigrating the "niggers" who inhabited the island, and soft-pedalling widespread torture by the US military (most notably the rather nasty 'water cure'). It is also interesting to read how many people did not value the islands that much themselves, but felt that they were needed to be our springboard to the China trade -- which was going to make everyone rich, of course! It took the Japanese empire at its worst to make the US look like a friend to many Filipinos, and this book tells why.   Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899-1903.

I link back to here too    Did I miss my shot?    yea apparently they left their names off but just allowing this lawsuit to proceed is enough really   yep. doesnt matter how long u lived there, always a visible "foreigner"   An excellent telling of a period that most Americans and Filipinos know little or nothing about. With America's new ownership of the Philippines, we were drawn into a second conflict once the Spanish were routed. The insurrectionist movement against America brought about a bloody and savage war that cost tens of thousands of lives. The third phase was the attempt to subdue the Moros, some of the toughest and most fearless warriors on the planet. The troops involved thought they would only be fighting Spanish regulars and then sent home. Rather, many spent years fighting in jungles and swamps against a clever and determined foe, and many were then shipped off to fight the Boxer's in China in 1900, only to be returned to battle the often fiendish inhabitants of places like Sibago Island, Jolo and Samar. A classic account and ranks with "Muddy Glory" and "Little Brown Brother" to name but a couple. There isn't much written about this conflict, but the information is out there. These lessons should have taught America about getting involved in smaller nations affairs.   An excellent telling of a period that most Americans and Filipinos know little or nothing about.

This is also a study in racism; how allegedly "superior" Anglo-Saxons needed to "civilize" and "Christianize" the Filipinos, many of whom were Catholic. Overall, this book is a good primer about a shocking and somewhat vile episode in American history. High School history teachers in particular should read this book and include it in their lessons about the outcome of our "splendid little war" with Spain. It is a sad truth that as a result of this conflict, America did not seem to learn anything about the nature of guerilla warfare with a people fighting to be free of foreign control. Our failure to profit from this episode helped propel us into another such quagmire in Vietnam, a nation not too far from the site of our earlier fiasco in the Philippines.

In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved. Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone. The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise. The phrase "our little brown bothers" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1] , 2[2] and 3[3] . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all "terrorists" as a direct substitute for "nxxxxx" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed. Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers). Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks BIEBER were.   0o   yea i wonder about that too!! they wouldnt return it to the germans..   basically if the USD collapses they have a huge hedge.. although [whether or not gold is also overvalued is tricky to say](http://i.imgur.com/xaQqG4f.gif)   The plaintiffs argue that, by deliberately concealing information about the efficacy of the vaccine, other potential entrants into the mumps vaccine market were precluded because of their presumption that the U.S. government would not create additional contracts for new vaccine products while the [Merck] vaccine had a 95% efficacy rate, U.S. District Court Judge C.

They slowly began to realize that their major foe was not really the formally constituted, but in many ways ineffectual, Philippine Army; rather, it was the Filipino people, who, having finally gotten rid of the Spanish, were unrelentingly and implacably hostile to American imperialist designs. The implications of this understanding were fully realized only later and in the bloodiest manner imaginable. But as early as April 1899, General Shafter gave grisly portent to the future conduct of the war: "It may be necessary to kill half the Filipinos in order that the remaining half of the population may be advanced to a higher plane of life than their present semi-barbarous state affords."7  The American command had presumably been taken in by its own press releases.

In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved. Similarly the US resorted to what are now called "War Crimes, "Crimes Against Humanity" and "Genocide" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented "concentration camps" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok ("mountain(s)" in Tagalog - source of our word "boondocks") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as "protective hamlets" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was "every able-bodied man" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.   The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise. The phrase "our little brown bothers" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1]  , 2[2]   and 3[3]  . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all "terrorists" as a direct substitute for "nxxxxx" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed.   Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).   Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.   The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to "achieve US policy" but the Muslim MILF/Huks never were.   its stupid to assume irans state media is lies while our media is truth   too bad most peoples bubble contains american sniper, zero dark thirty, nfa football saluting soldiers to the USA USA drumbeat   i wonder if he ever thinks about it heh   they knew it wasnt gonna pass   I'd vote Democrat too if they ended the Mexican apartheid    Ya especially if you post them a bunch    I definitely agree he sometimes went after too low hanging fruit!

Ya this seems like a reasonable argument    got to be honest, the guy knows his stuff.. i mean, he knows a ton of the common points that ive seen and has pretty reasonable answers as well  i found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiYplRaHBDQ   how did u know~   the biggest english language internet forum videos section doesnt allow you to question police authority.   nottheonion is part of the cancer, they banned me for nothing as well   the most unconvincing video i ever saw was NISTs simulation of what happened in the towers  it falls apart completely different than it did in reality   hey at least thats a different flavor than the american style we get here 99% of the time   dont tell me we are defending the vietnam war now too..,   https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/39ezan/what_are_the_officialmainstream_explanations_for/   im wondering what peoples explanations are for the 3 collapsed buildings! and why they fell in on themselves in such a clean fashion..   hey that sounds kind of reasonable, fuck if i know   yea i thought it was a good discussion and havent seen any official explanations   What are the official/mainstream explanations for the persisting heat at ground zero, and the inability to put out the fires for so long? Truthers, why is that explanation wrong?  According to the government's own website[1] , the hottest spots on the surface of Ground Zero were over 700 C (1292 F), and even after 5 days of efforts by the firefighters, the hot spots were still above the melting point of aluminum (1221 F / 660.3 C). Some conspiracy theory sources reason that this was because thermite makes it's own oxygen and can be used under water.   so where did the thermite residue come from and what caused the fires so hot and long lasting they melted steel?  What are the official/mainstream explanations for the persisting heat at ground zero, and the inability to put out the fires for so long?  According to the government's own website[1] , the hottest spots on the surface of Ground Zero were over 700 C (1292 F), and even after 5 days of efforts by the firefighters, the hot spots were still above the melting point of aluminum (1221 F / 660.3 C). Some conspiracy theory sources reason that this was because thermite makes it's own oxygen and can be used under water.   nah i just stole the comments from elsewhere   yea i acutally support them personally   Lets assume you are right, someone just lied about thermite in that peer reviewed study, this still does not detract from the point that all the evidence suggests that some form on thermitic material was used and thus the official government conspiracy theory is a complete made up fantasy story  ____  NIST claims that WTC 1 amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called irrelevant, given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.  -----------  **Physical Evidence**  -----  * [Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMAs 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study](http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf) * [Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled The Deep Mystery of Melted Steel, which said:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html)   gt; Steel  which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit  may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire.

Do something else instead. Do something good for yourself when you feel the urge to smoke. This is a technique that can be applied to many challenging areas of life. When you have a bad feeling creeping in, use it as a direct stimulation to do something good in place of it. It starts a new kind of habit and a new kind of addiction: getting addicted to becoming the kind of person you really want to be. Don't give up.   This went on for many months, and eventually led to me just buying regular cigarettes again, rolling tobacco, and becoming a heavier smoker than I ever had been before. When I decided to quit again after seven years of steady smoking, it was extremely challenging, probably one of the hardest things I had faced up till then. I did it cold-turkey and didn't use any method other than distraction. I don't think willpower would've worked for me.

Oh so sorry m'lady, it's not often you see a beautiful woman such as yourself on sites such as these. You must be very intellectual, are you an atheist by any chance?   It's a secret or I wouldn't understand?   Here's the thing. You said a "black person is in prison." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies blacks, I am telling you, specifically, in Ebolatology, no one calls black people prisoners. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "negro family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Niggerae, which includes things from niggers to negroes to lightskins. So your reasoning for calling a black person a prisoner is because random people "call the black ones prisoners?" Let's get sandniggers and mexicans in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a nigger or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A nigger is a nigger and a member of the negro family. But that's not what you said. You said a black person is a prisoner, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the negro family niggers, which means you'd call lightskins, sandniggers, and other races prisoners, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?   My friends joke that I am Jewish because I have a big nose, guess I am Jewish now!   Which guy?

 I'm here to make a Rio joke   I can't think of willem dafoe the same after seeing his dick and balls in Antichrist   As did I my friend   I immediately thought of Lapras   She's still Cordelia in my eyes    The capital letters spell POOT USA down the side.      Are you dumb, that's the point of this fake video   Chicle yum   Nice funnyjunk bookmarks my friend    His arm looks severely long and deformed from the shadow...   If I see this damn picture one more time, I'll call Zach Braff and make him unfollow me on twitter    Hey! Who turned out the lights? Hey! Who turned out the lights?   That fuckers face is so accepting, like that shit happens to him every week    Nice 10 year old repost    We also have them in Iowa, OP isn't special   Booker DeWitt is still my fave    Whenever I hear popped corn I think of Ned's Declassified  *edit: which is incidentally also said by Lincoln    Nice stain   I can't go through this stress again, I just can't    I sense some Jonathan Coultan in my future    They actually did take South Park off.   Well, Matt Smith already shaved his hair and announced he's leaving the show by the end of the year. So after John Hurt has his season or two, Matt Smith will use his regeneration.    If I see this stupid gif one more time...   What's up, teefury friend    I'm confused, why is there a tardis?   She doesn't even know about it yet.   I LOVE TO FUCK I GOTTA FUCKIN PROLLEM   I've had at least 3 reddit stories in my local news. The Hitler teapot was on it today.   I'm intrigued... But how would this get back at the husband at all? He's just slowly I investing bones, nothing happens.   Excuse me OP, I've seen Homeward Bound 14 times, Chancw got hit by a porcupine and this didn't happen. We caught your little game, time to throw in the hat    Change temperature to match temperature outside, rake in the votes   You're never too old to do heroin this morning    The fact that he recently shaved his Doctor Who locks means Season 8 will be only about John Hurt   When I grow up I want to want to be rich. I don't want it now, but I hope soon I will.   Too bad he's still Sylar in my eyes   Last night's Game of Thrones made it apparent that bears aren't pussies   Probably the same one getting raped on Tosh.0   Teefury swag   I'm gonna need some sauce good sir   I AM LRRR, RULER OF THE PLANET OMICRON PERSEI EIGHT    Your name is too great, spacedong   I'm not    Did you do acid?

    I dunno, that stud on the left has that Chris Farley thing going on. Pretty sure he's also a famous athlete.   I've seen them at my local Sports Authority. They seem nice enough with decent quality. It's hard to tell until you try them on and see how they fit and how well they grip.  I think people recommend the Addidas and Nike because it's what they know not necessarily because it's the best shoe.    Depending upon what they are used for it might make more sense to put them on the inside.  Back when I was a kid loading UPS trucks in college we used to two those with our fingers just to mess with them. It made it look like the package was mishandled when it wasn't.   When you make it obvious that you don't trust the people doing your work they will probably mess with you.   I am if you want me to be. :-)   You can still buy those on ebay. I think the memory of them is better than the reality. But everyone at school used to have one of those.   lol....That's exactly what being a dad is about.    Wow! You look fantastic!   Saw this a while ago and was really impressed. Thanks for sharing this.   Didn't Chris Hanson already do this?   I'm honestly not sure how you could say it was boring. It was predictable for certain. But it was certainly action packed.    Typically I'll do some back work like face pulls or rows. I also like doing some ab sets.  But as long as you're not taking up 10 minutes between sets who cares what you're doing?   Pacific Beach. It's in front of the Mossy Nissan dealership, I saw it last night on my way to the gym. I had to look twice.   It's not creepy if you just give advice then back off. You could say something like "I've done the same thing, what worked for me was to lower the hooks".  For the record, I back into the bar too depending upon the rack I'm using because I hate looking into the mirror.  	14
 are the Muslim extremists? sorry, too soon Ik.  Seriously though, these 'sound' as though acts of true desperation. It is not as though NK has a lot of allied countries.  Worrisome as the economic situations of the poor keep plummeting in so many places globally.

Thank you op. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogi_people  The Heart Of The World-The Elder Brothers Warning (documentary The Kogi Elder)    http://vimeo.com/103812927      About: ""The Heart of The World: Elder Brother's Warning was filmed by Alan Ereira for the BBC in 1991 "In a desperate attempt to prevent further ecological catastrophe and destruction, the Kogi Mamas broke their silence and allowed a small BBC film crew into their isolated mountaintop civilization to hear their message and warning to Younger Brother (those (un)conscious people who mashing up our environment). The subsequent messages and warnings were voiced in this documentary. After the documentary was filmed, the Kogi Mamas returned to their work in isolation and asked outsiders to not come to their land. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Kogi soon realized that their message and warning had not been heeded by Younger Brother, and instead, as they had predicted, many catastrophes occurred and the natural world continued to be devastated at an even more rapid pace.[7] In turn they contacted the same filmmaker twenty years later to give one final message. This became Aluna, a documentary made by the Kogi Mamas themselves in which they give a second warning and say that they have chosen to share their secret sciences with Younger Brother so that Younger Brother can help change the world for the better."  ok I am now lost in the internet discovering these people:)  Will edit if I both find more fun stuff   remember to post.     oh?      she dumped him apparently: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2068177/Patrick-Swayzes-niece-dumps-Neo-Nazi-husband-just-months-wedding.html   I want to see itty bitty jars of marmalade from it eventually please! https://gardeningonthego.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/making-marmalade-from-the-calamondins/   apparently I like zucchini. want to trade?   oh those man-hands!   cos now it can be   pretty well on target it seems: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-behind-dreaming/   took him a while:)   thanks for linking   ok so if a ..Catholic , did such a thing, do u not think the pope would speak up as to it's not reflecting the Catholic religion as a whole?   or a Jew, would not the chief Rabbis speak up?

The Pass was actually confirmed as results of an avalanche   That is what you said initially.      Then you tossed in a Wiki page, the first sentence of which refers to 'avalanche' as "plausible":"but avalanche damage is considered one of the more plausible explanations for this incident.[4]"   It goes on: "Possibly negating the avalanche scenario is that investigators saw footprints leading from the campsite, with no obvious avalanche damage noted."   /u/Iamnotyours makes a very good point regarding these 2 incidents.   you have a source?   ty!

"PETA euthanizes nearly 90 percent of the animals it takes in, a rate often criticized by other animal groups. PETA defends its practices, referring to itself as a shelter of last resort - a place that provides a merciful death for animals too sick, old or otherwise unfit for adoption.  But state regulations call for a minimum holding period of five days, said Debra Griggs, president of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. Pickups are also required to be reported to a locality's animal control.  "In Maya's case, PETA did neither of those things," Griggs said. "It's a serious violation."  Aside from that, she said, the video shows "a happy, healthy, sweet dog on its own property, and that flies in the face of everything we believe in - not only about our pets but our property rights in general."   google something like 'pakistan breaking agreements list'. have fun.   gee why don't I trust your response..   they are outta their fn minds   so. this was after or before or during Va Tech?   As has been mentioned a lot, your mom is beautiful!  What a lovely photo of a happy woman:)     Thank op, and I wish much love   happiness for the newlyweds   for yourself.   Opinions are influenced by one's gender though, IMHO.    Forced wearing of the hijab, or of any other enforced clothing, will often have gender-specific reactions as to 'how important is it?', as an example.  Let me see what people are saying..ah ok, here ya go: http://www.ted.com/conversations/23808/how_does_gender_affect_formula.html  oh and 'gender bias' is a thing. Google.   The hijab is a VERY obvious sign of the oppression of the female populace, it those countries where it's wearing is not a choice.    Google always thinks I am a male.

Young Michael Brown was a tall, large teenager, he looked like a grow man, ' he was 6' 4" (1.93 m) tall and weighed 292 lb (132 kg).  Mr. Brown was 18 years of age. An adult.  I can understand how intimidating a young man of that size might be.  Michael may or may not have been a bully; reports say he was much better than that, but the video!!  I give my warmest heart felt condolences to his parents, family, friends.  I know of no one with a perfect child; we are each   every one, simply human.  Now why burn down you town?  Honest it is a very bad reflection on the black/white relationships here in the USA.  Please calm down out there, peaceful protest will garner far more support than the videos of a liqueur store being broken into,the toy store, the etc. shops.  sorry  am rambling, it sucked to have to call my son (working in a Newark hospital, just to review the 'if you get stopped by an officer keep your hands in plain site on your steering wheel. If you are asked for ID tell the officer that you will need to reach into you back pocket, ask is that ok?  Always speak respectfully."   If you should get arrested, call your parents! You are entitled to a call. Keep your mouth shut until you have  a lawyer, say nothing.  But for goodness sake , the images of looting in the community liqueur store, toy r us, etc you all are setting back race relations like 50 years!!

That makes sense somehow, thanks:)      I paid my rent, gave my son a 125 check   took him out for an inexpensive dinner for his birthday,  ( he is in school). I spent 25$ to renew antiviral, bought some little food, am basically ok atm.  But I am literally down to pennies, and was wondering if I could borrow 35$ from someone until my next pay day, 11/21.  I know many are in much more need, I am happy to have a roof, a wonderful child, lights   internet access, but naturally all my grand planning has left out a few odd things like a prescription renewal, and that cup of coffee I usually buy before my 12 hour work days a couple of times a week.   I have no idea how this works, how money gets moved about, but scouts honor I will pay back the 35 next Friday the 21st (will probably be after work, like 8pm ish est)  I have had backpackwayne added as a friend for ages, unbeknownst to him, as at one point I was having terrible trouble finding a job that could pay my rent in nyc, and he was so wonderful in offering advice and listening to my laments!

Not a druggie, not a drunk, work at low $ job atm, planted daffodils (free from the city), love life, love my family, love tghis sub, and always wish I could help more.

Teen Driver Charged In Hit-And-Run Death Of Ariel Russo, 4, Accused Of Dragging Police Officer September 3, 2014 5:05 PM         I'm an American with deep respect for the members of our military. Today I have heard countless people wishing others a "Happy" Veteran's Day. When I think about my great uncle's mustard gas poisoning; what my father saw liberating concentration camps   afterwards, returning with yellow fever from Panama; my brother's stories of being dropped behind enemy lines in Vietnam..well I just weep, and say a very quiet 'thank you'.  I can't seem to bring myself to think of Veteran's Day as 'happy' knowing the hell so many have gone through. While it was still armistice day, I can see people using 'happy', but now? My question is this: What sentiment would you folk like to hear on Veteran's Day, today   in the future?   thank you all.   I just came online, and my multi bar is gone. Anyone else getting this? Any clues why this has occurred?   My Italian aunt (mom's sister) has always told me that my father's father was 'black Irish'. Now I have gone on the assumption that this meant he had dark hair/brown eyes, possibly a remnant (in my eyes) of that dang Roman invasion of ages ago.   However! I have searched 'black Irish' here   in r/history   r/Irish history   /r/ Irish....only to find that Montserrat video:(   So! Please historians, more in depth info pretty please???               Someone please explain why I need to wait 8 minutes between saying "that's old" and saying "you all seriously need to stop making me laugh, my computer is getting nervous.   And yes, you do totally win!"  umm seriously, tell me what is it that I am doing too much?  '  (after my original wait time expired said"no nipples?" to the naked woman/man poster. Still was required to wait another 8 min.)  WHY???  also what is the FC named? May take me until tomorrow to ask that here. And yes I saw the side post link, put it did not work on this differently advantaged comp of mine.                                    I haven't received any notice to go to court, just a letter from landlord's lawyer telling me to pay or they will begin court proceedings. I know I will have to go, but am so afraid of an immediate lock-out.    Will I get any time to finish packing?    Please help, I need info!!!      Seem's to me I read BBC, CNN, Huff.post and just see redigested news I read here first. (BBC is actually much better, please forgive me). MSNBC also seems so slow.    So please tell me where I can find the newest, most honest news please!??!?  EDIT: goodness I love Reddit:) Thank you to you all so far.   bah humbug!

Thanks for responding but could you explain some more?   Who took those pics? Did you use the timer thingy on a camera?   To be honest... its for porn. Anyway my parents use OpenDNS to filter and there is almost NO WAY to get past it. I have found a proxy that isn't blocked but it cant play videos. halp xDD (Tor is blocked) Videos please. Don't give me a subreddit like /r/gonewild or a site with gifs or pics   Can I has old PC? xDD   Cat Mating... damn, nothing came up...

I don't have a lot of money to buy a good pc and am never lucky enough to find anything good at thrift shops. I also would like a pc that could be easily upgraded when i get more money so it would slowly become better and better. Right now i have a 2009 pc with a integrated graphics card, a core 2 duo and 6 gigs of ram. The mother board is to old to support new stuff. Thanks!!   A mod that replaces all signs with easy to read rainbow comic sans with a addition sign with doge on it. This would be great. xD but I am serious.   Interesting. But...

Sorry this is probably a stupid question but I couldn't understand all te stuff I found on google haha   I use my PS3 as a dvd/blue ray player xD. Don't know if it has that.   but how would i get the dvd player to let me choose which film i would like to play?   I'm am stuck at 66/68. How to fix?   It is useful in some ways but it would be better if you could play at the same time.   When I heard of family sharing I thought, Great! I can play a game with my family without buying it more than once! But no. Say you want to play Monaco with your brother. You can't play at the same time! It is silly. You can share games but not play at the same time! I think it is really silly and pointless. '_'    I NEED a link or a site used to make this. It looks amazing.   I relate so much   ^^^   *facepalm* thank you. I do not know geography. D; Thank you 3   I know im derping so much right now xDD   Where is this!?!?! I need to go...

 I hear you, however, I dislike the idea that anything that isn't our reality or a future possible reality is fantasy. Like surrealism, magical realism, postmodernism, and other styles don't need to be lumped in with fantasy when they are doing different things.    That probably includes multiple translations of the same language. Like the King James Bible is only one of the English translations.    My understanding is that the "fantasy" elements are not really real, but myths and that his inspiration was early English mythology and early romances, not modern fantasy novels.       Yes, it's odd of her to simultaneously claim the book isn't Fantasy enough and to claim it should be called Fantasy   In the same interview that made UKLG mad, Ishiguro says his book was mainly inspired by Westerns and Samurai films. I'm not sure he is afraid of acknowledging "genre"   Yep, also while book reviews are more objective at big magazines, the fact that a book even GETS reviewed is often because publishers or publicists have connections at the major magazines or because there is a big marketing budget. And even if books are often reviewed by people who don't know the author, interviews are frequently conducted with friends and placed in big magazines.   There's never going to be a way to "objectively" get the best books published and reviewed and praised. But honestly, despite the nepotism, I trust the professional publishing world to be more honest than the world of purchased Amazon/Yelp/Goodreads reviews and Kindle sales ranking manipulation.          There's a lot of talk in this thread about blurbs don't make readers think books are good. But I don't think is exactly the point of blurbs. I think the point is more to "position" the book, so if you like dark fantasy novels and you see a book with blurbs from famous dark fantasy writers you think, "Oh, maybe this is worth checking out." Or if you love avant-garde literary fiction, and you see a book with blurbs from experimental literary writers, then you are more inclined to pick that one up.   So it isn't really about making you believe that the avant-garde literary book is better or worse than the dark fantasy one. It's about guiding the readers to your book based on their established tastes.    Sadly, things are only going more in this direction since publishers feel pressure from the self-publishing world where all the best sellers are lowest common denominator romance, formulaic SF, Twlight imitations, etc.   That's just where the money is. You can't really blame agents and publishers, gotta blame readers for reading that pap.        Now, after taking them semi-seriously one too many times, when I see a book with blurbs primarily (or, especially, only) from other authors I don't even bother.  Typically I only see that in debut author's books who haven't had any reviews yet. Even if a book is badly reviewed overall, once it's gotten a dozen reviews or so you can normally pick out a few decent quotes to make it seem like it was praised.   This is true for films too, where every film, even like 2 Twilight 2 Transformers: The Reboot part 3 have positive quotes on the posters.        Also, isn't the NYT lost mostly bullshit?  It's way more trustworthy than the Amazon rankings, but still able to be manipulated. As the poster below says, it's based on a sampling of book stores around the country so can't just be manipulated through one source or one small time window (you can spend a few thousand, or even less, on your own book and rocket to the top of Kindle lists)   Eh, the problem here is that the writing world is much smaller than most outsiders realize. If you are a SF writer, say, and you go to conferences and comicons you will meet tons of other writers and you'll interact with more on social media and your agent will represent others and your publisher will represent even more. Point being, almost every conceivable endorsement will have SOME connection to you.   This is true for any genre.   Maybe he just wants to end blurbs altogether, but there's basically no way to do blurbs or any kind of endorsements that won't have some risk of nepotism.        Are dogs therefore not animals because they existed before the word was thought up?  There's no authorial intent or societal context for a dog, though. OTOH, intent and context do play a part in whether something is written or read as "fiction" or read as religion or myth. That's why I brought up the Bible, which is read by some people as truth and other people as pure myth.   If the Bible was written today, it would be a fantasy book, but the Bible and the Odyssey wouldn't be written today... not like they were back then, because the authors would have a different context and intent.   You know what I mean?    I get a bit annoyed by the way 'literature' picks the bones of genre fiction. The thought process seems to be: if genre fiction is good, it stops being genre and starts being 'literary'. That's a very sinister way to distort the dataset.  I'm totally, 100% with you here. However, I do think it goes both ways. There's a tendency for genre writers to try and lay claim to authors of the past (or even the present!) who would never consider their work to be part of those genres. There's a huge history of non-realist work in literary fiction that is constantly being claimed by different genres (SF, fantasy, horror, whatever) even when the author lived in a time of those genres and didn't consider them an inspiration.   It can get pretty comical with a dozen different genres trying to claim an author. I've seen people argue that Kafka is truly a magical realist, or truly a fantasy writer, or truly a horror writer, or a proto-science fiction author, or an early post-modernist, etc.    I think it's pretty sad that people feel the need to change the work of authors to fit their own backwards feelings. That's one thing. But it becomes a real problem when you are doing this for the books you are making kids read. If you think someone is too young for a book, sure. But don't give them a censored version of it.    Definitely had the opposite experience: being absorbed by a book but then when I finish thinking "huh... that didn't really go anywhere" and a few days later thinking "I... can't even remember anything that happened."   Again, I didn't use the word "censorship."   If you want to redefine the word "censor" in a way totally different than every English dictionary, okay, whatever.     That films tells the story of Joan's trial in a deeply more intimate way than a book could.   I don't see any reason why this is true. There are tons of books that deeply and intimately move people. In fact, people commonly say that they love books BECAUSE they feel more intimately close to the author or characters.   It's true that film can do some things that books can't, but more "deeply intimate"? Nah, don't think that's true.    Also, "reading" is a rarer activity. Everyone and their mother watches TV and movies, but only a small percentage of the population reads more than 2 books a year.    Reading is, in general, a much better means of conveying information and knowledge than any of those other things. You can learn way more from two hours of reading than you can from two hours of TV watching, even of a documentary. Your brain just processes words faster.   In addition, reading is more brain-intensive in that you have to imagine and think over every sentence, you can't passively watch in the way that you can TV or movies.   That doesn't mean that some shitty self-published YA vampire series is more "intellectual" than HBO's The Wire though. But as a general rule...   "Censorship" wasn't in the title.   CENSOR transitive verb :  to examine in order to suppress or delete anything considered objectionable censor the news; also :  to suppress or delete as objectionable censor out indecent passages  Obviously it's not government censorship, but removing objectionable material is still censoring even if it's a parent doing it for a child.    Well, I guess we get into the question of how much the Odyssey was believed. I'm not a scholar on this subject, but it seems it existed in the kind of nebulous zone of old folk lore where it wasn't 100% believed but was considered somewhat true, part myth part history.   That's pretty different than, say, the Lord of the Rings which no one believes is real at all.    Yeah? I haven't read the Ishiguro, so can't comment, but I think it's weird to claim that actual myths and folk tales are "fantasy," which is a modern genre that uses myths and folk tales as inspiration but for different ends.   I mean, is the Bible a fantasy book in your opinion?           I'd like to see someone write a book about "needing to find a missing pair of sweat socks" and "existential nihilism" that can hold my attention. Good luck with that one  That's not SO far from the works of Thomas Bernhard and he is a literary genius            well... it is an article on a literary device, not sure it's name dropping to list examples!    Of course I know they're "worth" reading and I know the show and the books differ and go in separate directions just as The Walking Dead has  To this question, i'd say the Game of Thrones show is FAR closer to the books than TWD. The latter has killed off major characters who didn't die anywhere near that point in the narrative, or else kept people around long after they died.   The Game of Thrones /ASOIAF are basically the same, plot-wise, for the first two or three seasons. They've started to diverge a little now, but it isn't dramatic... yet at least.    They are not very well written on a sentence level. Martin got his chops in TV writing and they read like scripts: plot, plot, plot. Very little effort put into the language or even mood and atmosphere (until books 4/5 when he starts to relax and get looser.... part of why people like those books less).   But the plot twists and characters are great, and the books fly by. If the idea behind them appeals to you, worth a read.    yes, they do. But, as you say, the good stuff is sandwiched between collections of .gifs or art stolen from tumblr.    But it's very similar to how a LOT of big media companies (Buzzfeed, Dose, Huffington Post, Bustle, etc.) operate. Not all of those are tabloids, but they repackage the work that other people have done and crank out content as fast as possible without doing any original work.                  Do you feel the same way about all arts careers? Like grad programs in music, theater, dance, or chef schools?        People don't understand that an MFA is not like another grad program. You're never going to see that money back if you pay for it.  Sadly, this makes it exactly like most grad programs in the US in 2015 :(   I'm in favor of MFA programs in general, or good ones at least, but it's insane that there are 300 programs in America! If they take an average of 10 fiction writers, they are pumping out 3,000 a year. 30,000 in a decade? That's way more writers than there are even spots in shitty literary magazines               On the one hand, I agree that being creative (and exercising!) is godo for people. On the other hand, I do think our culture has this idea that writing is fake profession and that "anyone can do it" and it can't be taught, etc. There's common phrases like "everybody has a novel in them" and just a general sense that everyone could be a novelist. There ISN'T a sense that everyone could be a professional marathon runner, or even that everyone could be a painter or chef or actor.    Well, again, the legal part of a contract is normally handled by a lawyer. What agents do is negotiate for you, as well as get you past the slush and know (hopefully) what editors are right for your project. An IP lawyer can't do those things.   Also, for 99% of writers a 15% rate on your advance will be much less than an hourly rate for a lawyer... that's before even factoring in that an agent can up your advance from what you'd get on your own.    I assume you are suggesting agents are rip-off artists of some sort. I have to disagree. I'd bet basically every legit agent pays for themselves by upping your advance, and they protect rights for writers. (Most agents work at agencies that have bar-passed lawyers on staff that go over the final contracts)   This is a weird argument. Tom Sawyer? Huckleberry Fin? The Jungle Book? A million books with teen protagonists and read by teens were published before TKAM.   Even for more modern YA work, The Catcher in the Rye and Lord of the Flies predate TKAM.    true, Ishiguro doesn't seem like a genre snob to me.             I think that's true, but I don't think that's Laura Miller's claim. She doesn't think Game of Thrones is for children, and that was her counter-example.    I hear you. I mean everything I've read makes me think it's fantasy, but i'll wait to actually read it to form a real opinion.       Is that true? I know tons of male agents. Wouldn't surprise me if the split is 60-40, but doubt it is "overhwelmingly" female   got this is one of my favorite books. Hope you like it!  The poem is intentionally shitty so don't worry so much about it. The real story is in the commentary. You could read the poem quickly once, then the commentary if you'd like.    "I have 10,000 thermo nuclear bombs buried beneath each city on earth and will kill every human on earth if you write one more poem"     I frankly think that initiatives like National Novel Writing Month are insulting to real writers. We dont have a National Heart Surgery Month, do we? Im being intentionally provocative there, obviouslybeing a good or bad writer isnt a matter of life or deathbut Im also serious. Great writers are as rare as great heart surgeonsmaybe even rarer; I dont actually know anything about heart surgeons. But I would argue that it takes as much time and work to perfect their craft, in addition to having talent to begin with that most people just dont. What I really object to is this notion behind these initiatives that anyone can write a novel, and that its just a matter of making the time to do it. Thats just not true.   Yeah I'm not sure I buy the argument, but thought it was worth a discussion.    I haven't read the book, but I saw some other people arguing that the book is more of a straight allegory/symbolist book than a true fantasy book in the vein of GoT.   That makes sense to me as a distinction between true fantasy and something using the fantasy form.    haha, great reference      I bet some people will dislike what he says, but I thought it was refreshingly candid                      There's a lot more steady work in freelance copeyediting, proofing, or fact checking than in freelance writing.   Sometimes you can make it work if you get a good regular gig at some place that writes textbooks, or corporate newsletters, or something like that.   It's nearly impossible to survive as a freelancer writing interesting essays or book reviews or whatever for culture websites. Those articles are done by staff writers or else freelancesr who are doing it less for money than to get their name out there and promote their books.       A simple writing style about rich WASPS instead of a complex, lyrical style about poor southerners?   Cheever maybe?             I went to public American school and studied everyone from Doestovesky to Shakespeare to Beckett, Wilde, Camus, Bronte, Faulkner, Hemingway, O'Connor, Marquez, etc.   I mean, to each their own, but it was a very broad range of work from all over the world.     My favorites:   * Borges  * Cortazar   * Bolano (I'd recommend The Savage Detectives or By Night in Chile as starting point)  * Aira (rec: The Literary Conference)  * Marquez (rec: 100 Years of Solitude)   * Marias (rec: Bad Elvis)  * Ocampo (rec: her stories)        been out of school for quite awhile now and I still hate classic literature.  This kind of statement baffles me, honestly. Because "classic" literature is a category that spans 500 years, every country in the world (or at least a couple dozen from what's read in America), and dozens and dozens of styles of writing.    I think teacher's in the US are really letting their students down over this.  That said, I DO think that most English classes (and most HS classes of any kind) don't teach stuff in the most interesting ways. I'm a rabid reader and published writer, but I hated the focus on "themes" and plot details in HS classes.    I didn't write the list and the list claims to be American authors. I do think everyone on the list LIVES in America, even though Zadie Smith and a few others are from other countries.       Because there are a huge number of black authors in in a huge number of countries and "racism" is not the only thing they write about...  Anyway, give some of the authors on that list a try! It's a good list of authors from the ones I know.    It just reads like the statement of someone who has barely read any black authors.    Well I"m already getting down voted by the silly people who think SJWs a real thing!          How many of the books in that article have you read?    Good example of how the "art just wants to be free" mindset really hurts writing. Yes, people still want to write even if they aren't making a lot of money, but the writing is more rushed, less researched, etc.:    The previous day, Id spoken to John Vaillant, one of Canadas most acclaimed literary journalists. He said he knows writers who are rushing to finish important, research-heavy, non-fiction books in a matter of months  books that would normally require years of work  because thats all they can afford to do.   You have good people doing half-baked work against their better judgment and inclination, he said. Im seeing writers make those compromises.         Good post! Agree that there are different people who are snobby AGAINST complex, experimental or "serious" fiction for different reasons.    To clarify a bit with some examples, "clarity" is just one tactic and just one way of writing. There are many reasons to not be clear. Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49 has a convoluted plot to intentionally mirror the paranoia and conspiracy atomosphere the protagonist finds herself in.   It's basically a rule in horror fiction/film that making the monster less clear tends to be scarier as the audience imagines something scarier than you can describe or show.   Mysteries and "puzzle box" shots/books/films have unclear elements, characters, and actions to keep the reader guessing.   Poetry often uses big or complex words for the musicality of the language.   And on the sentence level, dense and complex sentences can convey things that clear ones can't. Faulkner and Nabokov say things that Hemingway and Orwell can't, and vice versa.   None of the above is to say that complex writers are necessarily better than clear and simple writing. It's all preference.    I think you can be a snob without being pretentious. For example, if you think--as people sometimes say here--that literary fiction fans or even fans of "realism" instead of fantasy (say prefer John Green to Harry Potter) are fakers with boring tastes who don't have imaginations large enough to appreciate Tolkien and Rowling is just as snobby as a ivory tower lit professors saying people who read Tolkien and Rowling instead of literary fiction are peasants. You know?    Those are your preferences, not facts.    I like those books, but gotta disagree a little. My biggest complaint about Martin's writing is that he frequently TELLS what he just SHOWED. Specifically, his characters internal thoughts tend to just restate what the action and dialogue already presented to us:   "Do you hate your traitorous father?" Jeffery said, holding his knife and sneering at Sansa. "Say yes or feel my wroth."  Sansa tried not to show any emotion. "Yes, I hate my traitorous father."   *Not really! I actually love my father but I'm afraid Joffrey will hurt me if I don't agree with him!"*     French. France has a huge and amazing literary history, and from a historical/cultural standpoint it is the second most important and referenced Western literary tradition.    while I'm not the OP, there is plenty of hate for any book that is dense, complex, "postmodern," or overtly intellectual on reddit and in the culture generally. Infinite Jest, Thomas Pynchon, sometimes all "literary fiction," hell sometimes just reading foreign literature gets you called pretentious.    yep, also... 90% of the people who use that term have no idea what it means. They think it means snobby or overly smart or something, but that is not the definition.    attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.  Pretension is affecting knowledge/skills/talent that you don't possess. It isn't being really smart or writing smartly if you actually are smart. Or reading a smart book if you are smart. (Hell, nothing wrong with reading a smart book if you aren't smart either.)   Oh man, I know what you are talking about! We live in a very anti-intellectual age where people love to talk shit about "snobs" and "ivory tower elitists" who... dont' really exist, while lauding anything that sells well as automatically good whether McDonald's or Twilight.   I get reading whatever you want to read, but it is utterly bizarre how many people actively look down on readers of complex or dense fiction. Like, you don't like Infinite Jest or Nabokov? That's fine. The fact that someone else DOES like those books doesn't make them horrible snobs. Actually, the fact that you turn your nose up at people who read literary fiction makes you the snob.     But, though many writers published late, I'm sure they weren't just laying bricks through their teens and twenties. I'm sure many of these people read a lot and maybe dabbled in writing,  But he didn't say "dabble" in writing, he said you had to be "seriously" writing as a teen. I just think that's wrong. Like, I know a lot of published writers. A few of them wrote a lot as teens, but most didn't start writing, certainly not in a serious capacity, until 20s or even 30s.    I guess... but I can't imagine that's what he means. I doubt many people start reading books in their 40s, you know?    Show me where I said that literary writers need an MFA? Show me where I said that people need to be "technical writers"?   Your weird argument about what constitutes the best is silly because what is "best" depends on what one is talking about. The "best" Hardboiled Detective stories have different qualities than the "best" postmodern metafictional novels. There's no one standard to writing. My point there was that the vast majority of MFA students will not succeed. You have to be at the top of your game to make it as a literary writer, as defined by the people making the decisions (editors, readers, whatever.) I was not advocating for some static or even objective standard of "best writing."    Dude, you keep making arguments against things I never said. I NEVER claimed that you "need" an MFA to be a writer of any kind. I NEVER said you need to be a great "technical writer".... what the hell does that even mean? Being able to write really complex sentences?   I never used the term "technical writer" just as I never said people need to go to an MFA. Hell, I never even said an MFA helped! The only thing I said is that an MFA indicates that the students want to pursue literary writing, not EL James stuff. That's hardly controversial.   You gave me a list of BRILLIANT writers. Ray Bradbury and George Orwell ARE two of the best writers ever. They were brilliant, inventive, powerful, and just all around awesome. They don't disprove anything I've said. They were hardly only "good enough" but not great!  You seem really excited about fighting strawmen here, but it seems like, at best, we are just talking past each other.      I hear you, but he still said you had to be writing and had to be starting as a teen. That's where I disagree.   I think you and I are on the same page though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	200

You can read the rest on my blog: http://investingmy.com/sapurakencana-5218-kl/   Anyway, just to tl;dr, this is a company I feel pretty good about. Feel free to share your opinions.    **BACKGROUND**   SapuraKencana. What is it? It used to be solely in the oil and gas services industry, laying pipes for upstream suppliers. The company started out as Sapura Bhd, which was specifically involved in OCSS (Offshore Construction and Subsea Services), before merging with Kencana Bhd in 2012 which was primarily a FHUC (fabrication, hook-up and commissioning) provider. Basically, the oil and gas industry is broken into 3 different industries  upstream suppliers who do the actual drilling and procurement of oil, midstream suppliers laying the pipelines or providing the equipment for the upstream suppliers (i.e. transportation of oil), and downstream suppliers who do the processing and refining to turn the crude oil into something actually usable, such as petrol or kerosene. Then there are the integrated oil majors, sometimes known as integrated oil or super majors, such as ExxonMobil, BP or Shell, which do all three. Sapurakencana in this context used to be a midstream supplier, laying the pipeline and transporting oil for the large oil and gas majors in places where they dont deem it feasible to do it themselves. It also supplies oil rigs to these companies so that they are able to drill the oil in the first place.  However, with the recent acquisition of Newfield Malaysia in 2013, SapuraKencana has effectively dipped into the upstream market by participating in the actual drilling for oil. It is clear with the recent acquisitions that its CEO, Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin (Shahril) is trying to transform SapuraKencana into an integrated oil major. In the same year, SapuraKencana acquired the entire tender rig division of Seadrill Ltd, a major midstream player in the US market, in exchange for some cash and a 12% stake in SapuraKencana (which has since been pared down to 8%). This effectively made it the largest tender rig operator in the world.     **RUNNING THE NUMBERS**   **Net profit**   Net profit has shown pretty decent y-o-y growth, rising 60% last year and projected to match last years performance this year. 3Q/2015 results have already surpassed the previous years full year results by 16%. Revenues also increased proportionally, likely coming from the acquisitions.  Depreciation for the nine months to 3Q/2015 was RM 829,919, while finance costs were RM 513,459. Im going to assume that CAPEX for the next 3 years or so is going to average about RM 1Bn, based on the depreciation figure. Finance costs on the other hand are a bit troubling. As well see later, debt has been rising even after the acquisition.  **Capital structure**   The company has approximately 6 billion shares outstanding, giving it a market capitalization of around RM 17bn at the current share price of RM 2.80. In comparison, it has a whopping RM 14bn in debt which incurred interest of RM 500m in the nine months leading up to 3Q/2015. Debt:equity is 1.2x; which does not factor in payables, which if included brings the liabilities:equity ratio to 1.8x (high payables is common in oil   gas companies). At this point, the company is levered to the hilt. The fact that it was able to reach this point is impressive in itself, much less any consideration that it might be able to further increase its leverage. Im sure its strong brand in the region had been a key factor in helping it acquire this magnitude of financing in the first place.  The first question which springs to anyones mind is whether the company can continue to service its interest and principal obligations, in the context of the falling oil price environment. Its unlikely we will ever see $100/barrel oil again, although consensus is that oil will revert back to about $60-$70 in two to three years time. So the question is, can SapuraKencana survive over the next two to three years?  The answer is a resounding, if not quite reassuring, yes. The company has a RM 30 bn orderbook, which at current revenue levels is enough to maintain performance for the next three years, albeit at zero (or possibly negative) growth. Obviously, things are not as straightforward as that, however if the company can continue populating its orderbook at even slightly slower rates, it should be fine. Alliance Bank states that the company would have to maintain its orderbook to sustain its contract burn rates. Even in the worst case scenario, the company is well-recognised and well-connected enough that refinancing debt (albeit at higher interest rates) is always an option. Having said that, the bigger question and the elephant in the room, is whether the company can redeem its debt in full in a reasonable amount of time. Any debt which remains on the balance sheet will incur interest charges, which represent a fixed share of profits going to debtholders. For reasons yet unapparent until the 2015 financial statements come out, it seems that debt has increased by RM 3bn in the nine months to 3Q/2015 despite no significant acquisitions taking place, not including an additional RM8bn Islamic note signed in Jan 2015 which was not captured in the 3Q/2015 statements. No equity investor in his right mind would buy shares at the current price (9 Feb 2015: RM 2.80) without a serious plan in place to reduce the debt burden. The CEO has said he expects to debt reduce to US$ 3bn in 3 years; however, how he plans to do that while maintaining present growth rates is anyones guess. Debt:equity levels have to reduce within the next 10 years AT MOST  without artificially diluting equity holder  if equity investors which to see a profitable ROI on their investments today.   In any case, here are some finer details about the debt. Interest payments are currently at about 4% of debt  some sources claim that it is 1-2%, although Im not sure how theyre getting to that. The 4% figure is impressive anyhow, given that corporate debt on the largest companies in the US is going for about 5% average. This is no doubt contributed by two factors: firstly, its brand and connections to the Malaysian government (a bailout in the event of a catastrophe is highly likely), and the fact that it has access to international barrel-scrapping interest rates. A few minor points to note are that: i) the debt is denominated in USD, ii) the company doesnt really participate in any currency hedging, and iii) the recent spike in MYR-USD rates have been beneficial for the company since it reports earnings in MYR. Another related possible cause for concern is that RM 9bn (possibly increased since Jan 2014) of debt is maturing and payable in 2 years. Thats right folks; it has to front RM 1.50/share of debt within 2 years, something which is only possible via refinancing. While this is no cause for alarm due to the high likelihood of refinancing, remarkably little details have been provided regarding what this debt relates to and why the maturity date is so short for such a staggering amount of debt, as well as why it was structured so unusually to begin with. Is it a bridging loan for the eventual sukuk-tization of the debt? Was it a sale and leaseback agreement for the Seadrill assets? Nobody really knows. Its something to stay incredibly conscious about, thats for sure.  In any case, heres the bottom line. As weve explored above, the company is in growth mode and is expected to continue its impressive rate of growth through further acquisitions, given its vision of becoming a fully integrated oil major. Since oil and gas companies do not typically have a lot of free cash flow (FCF) after reinvestment, it can only do so in one of two ways: take on more debt or issue equity and dilute shareholders. So far, management has been extremely prescient about the effects of diluting shareholders, and theoretically picking up debt is an optimal way of maximizing returns. However, it is approaching dangerously close to the possibility of default risk in the event of a global economic catastrophe. For instance, if a hypothetical world war were to suddenly break out, the company would definitely fold.   I wont go into a full breakdown of each segments performance, as my goal with this article is to give you a broad overview of the company with enough detail to fill in the blanks yourself, but not to unnecessarily overwhelm you with numbers. If you need a more detailed breakdown in one or two areas, I hope you can do a simple Google search which can bring you directly to the source, as opposed to me throwing the entire kitchen sink at you (which will make this article about 3x longer). I found a good site which aggregated the majority of its past three quarters performance here: http://m.kinibiz.com/tag/shahrilshamsuddin In any case, it seems that the companys cost management has been ebbing up and down over time. Its not a cause for concern but it indicates that successfully battling the two fronts of stellar revenue growth coupled with excellent cost management is not an expectation you should hold dearly should you decide to become an investor.   **Other**   Besides that, none of the numbers represent anything out of the ordinary. You can scan them yourselves in the balance sheet, profit   loss and cash flow figures in the tables above; the material items from each statement are listed below their respective tables.     **ANALYSIS**   Ok, so heres the lowdown on the company. As you all should already know, the company has been going on a massive shopping spree over the past few years. Starting in 2012, it merged with Kencana Bhd to form SapuraKencana as we know it today....   *(continued... http://investingmy.com/sapurakencana-5218-kl/)*                               ^   https://www.scribd.com/doc/142919907/BabyDick-Capital-Investor-Presentation            Something like 'fetch'. Use it everywhere you go.                   I remember an article a few years back saying that e-readers would become increasingly cheaper to produce once scale can be achieved. Well, the opportunity seems ripe for the legions of bankers, nurses and engineers who read MILLIONS of PDF files daily on what are basically mini-sun displays. Why are e-reader monitors still so exclusive and so expensive if the demand is so apparent?               Am establishing global dominance, but just fired marketing department due to budget cuts. Need help to SEO my brand.             In one of his books in Techical and Fundamental Analysis, Jack Schwager tells to story of the technical analyst and the fundamental analyst having dinner together.  As the fundamental analyst reaches for his glass of wine, his sleeve brushes his steak knife off the table.  Both men watch as the steak knife tumbles through the air, as if in slow motion, and sticks in the fundamental analyst's foot.  "Why didn't you move your foot?" asked the technical analyst.  The fundamental analyst replied, "I was waiting for it to come back up."  Never try to catch a falling knife, or pick the bottom of a downtrend.  You will be wrong 85-90% of the time.                           http://i.imgur.com/AdWA9Ix.gif         Poor guy here, send hummus.    *Source:*   Scroll to the comment section of this BusinessWeek page, or Ctrl+F "mozumder": http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2015-01-17/elon-musk-and-spacex-plan-a-space-internet#r=rss  For convenience, here's the comment in full:   mozumder  alonsoperez  3 days ago   This is not going to happen. Musk has no idea what he's getting into.  I worked on the original Iridium satellite phone project. I built a simulator for the entire network, and the handset uplink bandwidth was 2400 baud. Yep. Just 2400 bits per second.  Now we can do things like improve coding efficiency and maybe add a little bit more power to the satellites (although Iridium satellites are huge already) or perhaps bring them a little closer to earth, and at the very best case we might get 10x improvement. So now we're up to 100kbps.  That's not even 2G speeds. And who's going to want that, especially now that 3rd world countries have already solved the internet-access problem with 4G-LTE cell towers?  If you want faster speeds, you'll need expensive tracking dishes or phased-array antennas, and at this point your market size dramatically decreased. Pretty soon your market is going to only be 10,000 or so airplanes and ships. That's it. (lol @ the idea that there's going to be 200 million customers.. try 20,000 instead.)  After all that, you'll still never get close to fiber-optic speeds, which are hitting 10GBps now for the corporate world, literally a MILLION times faster, and doesn't have the power-cost problem that wireless does.  Sorry Elon Musk, but this is a dead-end project. Many smart people have already tried to solve this and failed, and you're not adding anything new.      Hi I'm Zack, the imaginary guy who captured your imagination together with Jenny (XOXO), Carly, mysterious guy X, and OP. You may have always wanted to get the story straight from the horses' mouth, (rather than sleazy Jenny) but I understand that's sometimes a little hard to do with imaginary people. But Reddit is amazing - it connects the physical realm with the imaginary realm! So ask away! I won't hold back!         Or any other number of wheels, I'm not racist.

We're a relatively small shop, so we usually don't create models - we just work out the details in our heads and make the decision. Since it's a low priority concern, the job was delegated and re-delegated until it's reached me. So... here I am, seeking advice on reddit.  I've been doing my own research for awhile before it crossed my mind that some of you here may have done it before. Basically, what I've done so far is just a basic risk parity model and constructed an efficient frontier, which might satisfy someone who hasn't seen one before (i.e. the client) but probably not my bosses. I don't think he's looking for a full blown statistical thesis on the relationship between Brazillian oil wells and Chinese political dynasties, but if anyone could share their experience it would be greatly appreciated. For context, we're looking at 4 regions - USA, Asia Pacific, China   ASEAN.   Thanks!  P.S. I've seen some of the geographical diversification studies while Googling around -  it doesn't need to be that complicated. We're just looking for something respectable which can still be explained to the laymen.

 wat?   Why does it make matters worse that he's happily married??   http://www.youtuberepeater.com/PlayMiniVideo?t=0 s=1 e=13 vol=90 v=TAryFIuRxmQ   I hitchhiked in Guatemala. It's kind of the way to get around - just jump in the back of the pick-up that they are invariably driving! Completely uneventful - it's honestly the taxi service when you get out in the country    As a student, you kind of have to accept that you will be asked to participate in ways - ways that you may not exactly enjoy or perhaps not see the value in. The best policy is to buck up and get to it. It will last a semester, and then you can go back to not participating on facebook. If you object to sharing personal information - then don't. Put the minimum up for participation in class and then delete afterwards.   My husband managed to get through all of law school by only buying one book (one that he actually wanted to keep). His secret? Interlibrary Loan.    The fuzzy gum drops showed up on a golf cart. Crowd immediately congregates. I snap some pictures and catch one of the first-responders who had touched one of the mascots. In the photo she is looking at her hand as though she had just gotten to touch Jesus Christ himself.    My family was at a Catholic festival next door to our house, and my dad was playing craps. My brother, probably about 4 at the time, yelled "COME ON, DADDY NEEDS A NEW PARACHUTE"   There was also an incident when I was in kindergarten where my mom had volunteered for a field trip and the teacher had written her name on the board. I came home and told my mom that the teacher had misspelled her first name, which is Amy. How had she spelled it? Mrs.   I think it was the three letters that thew me...   Saw a Civil War chess set being advertised on tv (Limited Time Offer! Buy now!) and asked my mom what the "Silver War" was.     Just got back!! It was awesome! :)   Most of the witch hunts didn't happen during the medieval period/Middle Ages - it happened in the oh-so-enlightened Renaissance. The Malleus Maleficarum, (literally "Hammer of the Witches", and essentially a "how-to" manual for witch hunting) wasn't written until 1486, and subsequently published in 1487. It was helped on massively by the advent of printing in the West (1450s). It was so inflammatory even the Catholic Church condemned it as false in 1490.   Also ladygamer - I honestly sometimes just avoid multi-player altogether. I like to play after work to de-stress, and hearing an array of sexist insults (kitchen jokes on the low end of the spectrum here), getting hit on (uh just want to play my game, oh, and I'm married), and then being called a tease because I'm not interested is not exactly relaxing. I end up playing single player games just to avoid the abuse. Which I will be the first to recognize is not helping - but my evenings are precious and I don't want to spend them trailblazing.    I have flat feet which in turn cause an internal leg rotation which in turn equals ouch knees and hips. My doctor actually recommended that I sleep with a pillow between my knees!   I even have a puzzle of the center of the triptych :)   I have always loved this building and the behind the scenes tour is definitely worth it. Not shown in the post is some views from the catwalk that goes atop the entrance way (not inbetween the front windows) - it allows for a great view of the murals. Also, there is more to see in the president's office - perhaps I'm a nerd, but I thought the built-in file cabinets are sweet. Last but not least - the private dining rooms, especially the ceiling fresco of Cincinnati, but also the upper conference rooms that have been restored fully as well.   Loved it so much I got married there a little over a month ago :)   China even falls under these same categories - it has a very large number of minority groups and have been ruled by a few of them over the many centuries. The whole conflict over Tibet is a great example of this. Whatever we may think most current nations really are "made up" and fabricated over centuries - even well established countries. Even countries isolated to an island have had multiple ethnic groups with multiple countries (Hello, Scotland succession!). Even Japan, a traditionally homogeneous gene pool have had it's conflicts (southern islands, Ainu, etc.).    At least in some states there is a committee that flags questionable vanity plates. A friend of mine interned there and had found one with "PONFAR" on it. She flagged it and then had to inform the entire committee about the Vulcan mating ritual. By all accounts they stared at her for about 30 seconds and let it through :)   I've been inspired - I would definitely love to attempt something like this soon!   Especially if you've seen Doctor Who - DON'T BLINK   And as always in art, the details have always been the difference between the real deal and a knock off.    More brutal...and she already has a boyfriend.   I have to put forth Jim Grobe at Wake for doing the  most with the least. I mean this in a broad sense of not just talent, but also dealing with resources. Let me explain:  Wake has never been known as a football powerhouse - hell, we're the third smallest FBS school (behind only Rice and Tulsa) with only 4,000 or so undergrad students. That's not a whole lot of alumni to draw from in terms of funding...they're dedicated; but it was pointed out in the Orange Bowl in 2006 (which they lost against Louisville), that if every living alumni and student went to Dolphin Stadium...they still wouldn't fill it up more than half way.   So, they comparatively don't have the alumni base to donate the big money for the football program. Being a small private school also means that we don't have a ton of in-state or other fans just because...say like, UNC or OSU.  Secondly, Wake is a top 25 school that is highly competitive and academically very challenging. It's hard for dedicated athletes to keep up with both. And there are definitely not a whole lot of majors to "hide in". The classes sizes are very small and the faculty is not disposed in the slightest to give the athletes any extra leniency.  All of these things lead to smaller resources, and fewer opportunities to recruit top athletes. Yet somehow, Grobe has managed to make competitive teams with what he has.  TL;DR: With few monetary resources and an environment not conducive to big programs, Grobe has managed to make something out of nothing.

Hilarious with metalocalypse fans....fuckin' bizarre when they're not   Freeze them!! FREEZE THEM NOWWW! /endAaahnoldvoice   How cute!!  Google Translate didn't lead you wrong...at least not too much! That is indeed the kanji for carp, but often times Japanese people just use the katakana -  - which is, admittedly, not as aesthetically pleasing. So using the kanji is just somewhat formal.   I could nitpick your kanji form - but that would just be insufferable - and it's definitely good enough for non-Japanese speakers!!  I too am in the same boat of hyperactivity - no Crisco exorcisms though! I haven't been able to just watch television since I was a kid - I always have to do be doing something with my hands!   Moxie is also older - 1876.    yeah it really is just because of the "Iron Man" connection - which was played in Iron Man 1.   I find that most bands will usually only have one design in a female version...if  even that. The options are usually pretty slim...   I love this building so much I'm getting married there in about 3 months :)  	31
 Giraffes -   I've never seen a giraffe, I never want to see a giraffe. They just terrify me. They're colossal, their neck weighs the same as a small car, they have the ability to kill a pride of lions, they also have a 20inch tongue.       Old people. They have more memories, more jokes, and more life lessons.    'He's 24 months'   Your child is 2.    'You study law? You'll be useful to keep around'   Oh my god! So original! Never heard that in my two years of study!    Getting food in different clothing    'MURICA   My brother is 18 years younger than me. When he was 6 he asked me why, when he was cuddling his teddy, did his 'willy not stay floppy'.    A lot of Runescape. 'Going Wildy'   In sex scenes when they 'finish' and they get up and carry like there's no semen trickling down the woman's leg.   	10
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Winter Finale is here! The Dreaded Sandwich Maker! Easiest Cellphone Disarm in History! I'm starting to feel genuine sympathy for Mr. Hollingsworth - it keeps raining bricks on him.   1. Aside from the domestic violence, who's more right - Miles or Mr. Hollingsworth - when it comes to how important being elected mayor is?  2. Is Eli actually unstable and unreliable?  3. Is Miles just as messed up as his father? 4. Could Becky just walk onto the team and do the routine like that?  5. Is miles being the "Arsonist" another unneeded twist? 6. Is Frankie right about how the girls will abandon Zoe after powercheer is over?  7. Eli and Clare return: is it all-clear or a disaster in the making?   And a bonus question: what'd ya'll think of Season 14 so far?    Hidden ICarly Reference!!!! Dream Sequence! I'm starting to feel like the most beleagured character on degrassi is actually Mr. Hollingsworth.   1. On a scale of 1-10 how ironic is it that Degrassi has a teen character try to tell an older character how to appeal to teenagers? 2. Why is Zig not in trouble for not wearing a shirt in school? 3. Is it awesome that they made a reference to the original degrassi?  4. Winston as blackmailer: plausible or WTF? 5. Is Zig amazing for standing up for Zoe against the rival cheer captain?  6. Is Zoe right that she has more to lose than Frankie? 7. Should Frankie want to make Zoe pay?   Author's note: I apologize for the lateness, technical problems.        I'd first like to say that though i bitch about triles, it's refreshing to see a tv show that treats a gay relationship just like every other relationship on the show.   An episode full of pain and suffering for everyone.  1. Is Tristan a sucker for going back to Miles after how Miles has treated him? 2. Zig: Should Zoe get with him? 3. What's more unlikely: That Alli would blow Clare's secret, or that there'd only be one girl Alli knew who was pregnant in highschool? 4. Is the Zoe-Hunter storyline a commentary on the ineffective nature of harsh interrogation techniques?  5. Is it wrong of Alli to use having or not having sex as a punishment against Dallas? 6. Is Zoe the villain of this story arc?  7. Why would the principal assume that Zoe was behind degrassi nudes, instead of it being a specious accusation or being done without her knowledge by the other cheerleaders?      Least favorite character in degrassi history: Grandma Baker. Mini-Morning Cakes: Best name ever for Muffins! Becky: Standing up for herself in public!   A little bit of a surprise for Clare.   1. Why did it take this long for someone who would report degrassi nudes to find out about degrassi nudes?  2. Does this episode totally nuke the blackmail plot?  3. Why was imogen not at all punished for carrying around and displaying child pornography in a school?  4. Will there ever be a problem that Maya and/or Miles does not make worse through their own poor choices? 5. Is Imogen right about jack cheating?  6. Is "Clare is living proof!" the best burn of the year? 7. What will Clare Do?   All told a pretty good episode, lots of action.       The return of singing to degrassi! Degrassi continues to be totally predictable like a comforting old friend! Miles is amazing looking in uniform! Miles crushing Tristan's heart! Jonah is bigger than he looks (he's Drew-sized!)  1. Why does the cheer squad think that finding the blackmailer will prevent them from continuing? 2. Is Drew's jealousy justified?  3. Why do they continue to use grace as super-hacker (that's not even how cell tower triangulation WORKS!) instead of just writing sensibly? All answers accepted. 4. Is Lola adorable or annoying when she talks? 5. Is Miles' problem pot or that his friends are crazy enough to throw an intervention for pot?  6. Did Miles make the right choice to leave the accident scene?  7. Since hunter is (evidently) not the blackmailer, who is?   The thing with Grace literally upset me. It's gotten to the point now where it's damaging the show's reputation; what is it, some kind of half-assed teenaged CSI?    Best line of the season: "Our cupcakes are very good, sir!"   1. Is this the first blackmail plot in degrassi history?  2. Is it good to see Alli and Dallas again, or is it still to soon?  3. Is Tristan a bad influence on Miles? 4. Does Miles having an actual problem dilute the meaning of Maya's storyline? 5. Is Dallas right to question Alli's commitment to him in light of her not being willing to have sex with him?  6. Is Miles smoking marijuana, or a magical drug that turns you into an asshole?  7. What should the Power Cheer Squad Do?   Kind of a mixed bag of an episode. I found the Alli-Dallas plot a little to pat and a little to perfect. Loved the power cheer arc though - Very Excited for next week's episode!       Eli pouring something god-forsaked and green into a glass at the Dot! Lots of computer intrusion! Laptop abuse!  1. Does maya need serious psychiatric help? 2. Is it surprising frankie would be this moral and upstanding? 3. Is Hunter right to be upset that no one defended his sister on the team? 4. is imogen's inability to handle polyamory directly related to her inability to notice 10 other people standing in a small room with her? 5. Does anyone else find it incredibly immersion breaking every time they "hack" a computer? 6. Jack and Imogen: best couple on the show or best couple anywhere? 7. Is it refreshing that Hunter (the seeming psycho) is a nice guy, while Maya (the cute girl) is a raving psycho?  All told a really fun episode! I am glad they at least touched on polyamory, if they backed away from it in the end. Look forward to hearing what you all think.   edit: as an aside "in four colors!" is a comic book reference.      A totally new set, complete with shiny orange jumpsuits! Yay! Spinner! Yay!   1. Should Becky go see Luke in jail? 2. Why and how does Tristan know so much about Clare and Eli's relationship?  3. Why is Eli doing a total change of heart from literally the last episode? 4. Has Zoey's descent into madness hit rock bottom, or will it get worse? 5. When did Eli get a fresh pint of guts poured down his throat?  6. Is Becky right to blame Luke for her life's current problems?  7. What do we think of the new guy with the awful haircut?  Author's note: sorry for the late deployment time. I had a heck of a time finding the episode tonight. All's well that ends well.   Just didn't want anyone to think i'd abandoned ya'll tonight.  Edit: and, quiz is up!    I'm Dethb0y.  I'm not really fit for the picture frame.   I post and read, mostly. I mean, not a lot or anything, but some. I enjoy the news subs especially, and some of the more specialized smaller subs about military stuff. Just recently joined /r/books to see what it's like.  I want to keep on as I've been keeping on.  Video games, military stuff, programming, writing, there's a huge list of stuff i'm into. I like to stay very very busy!   Glad to see this sub is here, as i figure'd i'd give my somewhat belayed introduction to reddit! I hope the sub gets really big and full of interesting people and things!   The Return of Eli! A new teacher! An ugly shirt! Canadian food almost no ameican teenager would know! Eli finally says something we wish he would have said 2 seasons ago so we could have more focus on something beyond Eclare! Yayyy!   1. Is Eli's return a positive or negative for the show?  2. Would Zig have won the arm-wrestling competition had Tiny not distracted him? 3. Did the writers use Clare and Drew's parents to voice the questions and concerns brought up by the fandom?  4. Is Winston right to be upset at Tristan and Miles?  5. Is Clare delusional to think that things haven't changed?  6. Should Eli be mad at Clare about this situation?  7. Will Eli and Clare end up together forever, or is Clare's famous Plan shot to hell and dead forever?  Author's note: seen the whole episode now.   Frankie's eyes bother me; don't know why, they just do. Lola wears the best shoes! A Cam (dead kid) reference AND a dream sequence!!! Rollerderby.  Every time grace talks about computers my inner dev writhes in agony. "Sure, let me do a few weeks worth of development time in a few hours, no problem. "  1. Which is worse: making homobphobic jokes, or assuming miles is just "going through a stage"? 2. Zoey: sliding into madness, or already a legitimate lunatic? 3. Has any writer on the show ever actually used an online dating srevice? 4. When did this show completely go off the rails to the point where it has a legitimate plot about the creation of a for-profit child porn distribution service? 5. Is the rubber room teacher the best teacher at degrassi? 6. Is Miles justified in being upset at Maya developing OCD about his safety and well-being?  7. The return of drew and becky: Best thing ever, or disaster in waiting?   I can't even.   Miles making a horrible choice! The return of Grace, speaking truth as always! "Like I Care" should be the Maya catchphrase of the season. Becky whipping out the interrogation techniques! Maya looking like someone's twisting a knife in her at seeing people experience joy!  Usually i struggle to come up with seven good questions, this time i struggled to come up with only seven.  1. Who will long-term win the Machiavellian game between Miles and his father? 2. Why is no one freaking out at Zig getting naked pictures of 9th grade girls? 3. Is Drew making the right choice to be involved?  4. Has Zoe truly put the baggage of the past behind her, or is she merely putting up a strong front? 5. Mike Dallas: Best Teen-Dad or overly judgemental?  6. Should Becky have stood by drew, or is how she's acting totally reasonable considering? 7. Are Zoe and Zig truly done, or will it be resurrected?   I look forward to hearing what you all think, and towards the next episode!       An action-packed setup for the rest of the season. I look forward to all your thoughts on it - i've missed you guys!  1. Drew and Becky: Cutest Couple, or Nauseatingly Cute? 2. How's Clare handling the pregnancy? 3. Why is the school taking donations to fix storm damage?  4. Is what Zoe did right? 5. Is it an awful idea for them to claim condoms are ineffective? 6. Finally a storyline where someone's gay and their family doesn't approve - is it long past time for it? 7. What does everyone think of the premier!?          Badger was kidding. Please return. We miss you.                                          *Another* school dance! No graduation this season! Trees falling! A canadian learns about the american healthcare system! There's rain which apparenty   fills canadians with fear! I get my Drew-Becky together time! Clare-Eli is on lifesupport!  Author's note: I really honestly didn't know what to even do for this quiz. the whole damn episode was 100% serious, and i'm not a 100% serious kind of   guy. I fully expect that there'll be stuff i can't cover in 7 questions that people will want to talk about, so consider this a free-for-all.  1. is anyone surprised there's no graduation at the end of this season?   2. Is drew a tragic or heroic figure?  3. Is tristan's affection creepy and overly intense?   4. Who should Zig go after, Maya or Zoe?   5. Should everyone who gets to know Miles run for the hills?   6. Is Eli the ultimate chess-master?  7. What should clare do about her condition?   I still want to know if that is tristan's natural hair color or if he's the most dedicated hair-dyer in history.        Zig Novac: dealer with a heart of gold. A brief mention of the other guy who molested zoe! Becky's family is the worst on earth! Zoe is avenged! Blatant disregard for legal procedure!  1. Was it disappointing that becky and drew got found so fast?   2. Is it surprising that Zoe got thrown off West Drive for drug abuse?  3. Is Miles the most selfish person in the entire trial for wanting his friend to pejure themselves for the sake of his relationship?   4. Is the anti-drug PSA with zoe somewhat degraded by the fact that she makes drugs look like a lot of fun?  5. Has there ever been anyone on degrassi more deserving of getting smacked down then that reporter?   6. Is it right of Maya to flip out over the thing with Zoe and Miles?  7. How many times will someone give Zig money to escape the gang?   So what does everyone think about the Zoe assault storyline? Eager to hear your thoughts!   Disclaimer: I *loathe* court room drama. That has colored my view of this episode pretty heavily. A rare degrassi dream sequence though!   1. Does Zig have a phobia of phones or of the name Vince?  2. Why doesn't simpson have the reporters removed from the school before Zoey sees them?   3. Is it a thing in canada to have a class on orienteering?   4. Is court room drama the most boring drama?  5. Is the gang member intimidating, or not very scary?  6. What kind of class lets 2 students be 3 hours overdue on their first orienteering trip and not send out a rescue party?  7. Is this the start of Drew-becky?     The return of Mr. Simpson! Imogen: reminding us she's insane. Becky: taking a leadership role!   1. Is imogen right to adjust the designs of her fashions, or should she stick with what she thinks is best?  2. Is this mr. Yates first time with forbidden love?  3. Is Tristan the single worst person to have an illicit affair with in all Degrassi?  4. Why does degrassi have what looks like a full-scale back stage and dozens of people doing makeup and hair?  5. Is it wrong of becky to make winston work around someone he mentioned he was uncomfortable around?  6. Is imogen a hero for saving us from seeing Tristan do his song and dance routine again?  7. Was the fashion show the stupidest extra-curricular, or merely it's most over-priced?  Author's note: I just found out a friend of mine passed away so i might be slow on the responses for a few days. Please don't take it personally if that's the case. Stay safe out there.      fair warning: the episode kept skipping around for me, so if i missed something awesome, apologies. Also, is that Tristan's real hair color or does he dye it?  1. Tristan's song at the beginning of the episode: Awesome or Cringe-worthy?  2. Would the tristan/teacher storyline be different if it was a female student?  3. Is it ever appropriate for a highschool teacher to give a highschool student hard liquor? Be creative!  4. Is pot a problem, or just something people do?   5. What should Tristan do in an ideal sense?  6. Was the Imogen/Jack storyline put in to directly contrast the Tristan/Teacher storyline?  7. Is becky a buzz kill or does she have a point?  I look forward to hearing what all of you think!       In this episode: Twist ending! Becky being stereotypical Highschool Girl! Drew single-handedly creating the Drallas ship! Mr. Hollingsworth finally swimming in his own pool!   1. Is it surprising that zig was in the gang dealing drugs *before* he got kicked out on the street?  2. Grace: are her lines awesome or merely amazing?  3. Is it worse meeting a younger guy online, or getting your arm broken by some dude you met in paris who then moved to canada to be with you?   4. Is drew's suddenly acting with sense satisfying, or unlikely?  5. Would the situation with becky be different if the genders were switched? (ie, if some guy went and stalked a girl he met on an online game)  6. Will Double D be the new meeting place for degrassi people post senior year?  7. Is becky's mother deluded or actually evil?   I look forward to hearing what you all think.   They should have named this episode Some variation of "Awkward". It was full of (sometimes painfully) awkward moments. And a rare Jenna-Connor appearance! And Hollingsworth's wife saying "aboot".   Personal note: the video game sequences made me want to tear out my eyes. Repeatedly.    1. Is Dallas a wise man for avoiding the drama, or should he support Drew more?   2. Has Imogen's parents both being very intelligent and forward-thinking tainted her view of all parents to make her think they'll be as reasonable?  3. Do most people think drew is stupid or just really unlucky, or some kind of combination of both?   4. Should Becky be more understanding of her brother's situation and at least try to see it from his side?  5. Did they literally invent the most generic computer game and gamers in history for this episode?  6. Does Drew look different when he works at Mr. Hollingsworth or is it just me?  7. Has Zig's storyline gone from compelling to incredibly boring?   Kind of a mixed bag to me. I didn't like that Tiny turned out to be a Nice Guy; i didn't like that everything got tied up so neatly. Some fun moments, though, to be sure.  1. Has anyone ever mentioned that Zig's family is from Serbia before!?   2. Tristan: Speaking good sense about telling miles, or hopelessly idealistic?  3. Art show idea: Pretty cool or chance for writers to be stupid?  4. Is the zig storyline resolved annoyingly quickly?  5. Is it the single most hypocritical thing ever on degrassi for Alli to lecture anyone on boys?   6. Is it awesome when the writers break the 4th wall by using fandom names for pairings, or is it merely amazing?  7. Why is a song about how much you hate someone grounds for suspension, but throwing an axe at someone's picture merely cathartic?    And we're back! I absolutely adore the shirt grace is wearing in the first scene. They actually admit what season it is (Spring time). Tristan may be a redditor - he wears a fedora?  1. Does degrassi have far to many extracurricular clubs for it's student population?  2. Is springtime in Toronto nice enough to go swimming in a lake - bear in mind, they say that spring just started?  3. Is Maya the most absolutely hopelessly naive character currently on the show?  4. Why is Zig so bad at insulting people?   5. Is tristan's line ("Oh my Ganja") the best line of the entire premier?   6. Is Chewy the worst kind of geeky guy?  7. Is it incredibly relieving to have someone who actually says "guys suck" to one of the people who needs that message most?  All told, a really good start to the season! I look forward to the next episode, and what you all think of this one.  It's good to be back.             The winter finale, in which i learned that Canada has Dairy Queen.   1. Who looked more adorable in western garb: Clare or Drew?  2. Was it surprising that a school like degrassi would allow kids to bring toy guns to school?  3. How awesome is it they mention Cam, even if not by name!?   4. How did eli know where to find Clare and Drew?  5. Is zig so stupid that he'd not notice that a revolver (With exposed chambers) has no bullets in it?   6. Clare and Eli: Is it over, or will Eli lure her back with his epic love?  7. Maya and Zig: Hooking up or staying friends?   I can't wait to hear all your thoughts on the winter finale of degrassi!    A rare eli sighting! Some very meta stuff, like Team miles, and Zoe acting like an actress! References to things that happened a few episodes ago! Good stuff.  1. How did mile's present get on Maya's table? Did he sneak in or what?  2. Is Maya making the worst relationship decisions since Alli?  3. Is tristan's plan to exploit Zoe's tragedy fundamentally sound, or morally bankrupt?   4. Zoe's audition: Genuinely upsetting or cheesy?  5. Rat: deus ex machina, or accurate representation of teenage girls and rats?  6. The Clare-Eli breakup: Will Eli show up to win Clare back, Again?  7. Does miles have a point about Zig and Maya, or is he just being unreasonably jealous?   The trophy scene at the end? Must have been from wisconsin, because it was Pure   Cheese.   1. How inconsiderate does someone have to be to not even contact their lab partner about not being able to make to the science fair?   2. How awesome is it that Mr. Bhandari remembers events that otherwise would never get mentioned? Props to him for having a memory, unlike everyone else on the show.  3. Tristan: being lured by a cunning predator, or is the teacher the victim of innocent love?   4. Is dallas right that the judge was a racist, or is he merely an officious little bureaucrat?   5. Was the weird camera thing during the drew-clare exchange effective or just jarring?   6. Is Mr. Bhandari the best adult in the entire series in terms of actually being an adult?   7. What's everyone's thoughts on the end of the racism story arc? Began and ended in 2 episodes!    Not only a mention of Simpson being connor's guardian, but tackling a race problem and a bombing! Quite an episode.  1. Drew and Clare: Adorable partners or practically already dating?  2. Tristan: Good to finally see some of his family life, or pointless drama.  3. New Teacher: Going to make the move on tristan?  4. The racial issue: well handled, or ham-handed?  5. Writers Collective: Great tool for learning, or rubber room for hippies?  6. Who will win the science fair: Alli, Connor, or Other?  7. Is Clare's "little crush" on drew not so little?   Tristan and Zoe made me genuinely lol. The reference to a "horse drawn carriage" is pretty amusing, to - because is that not JUST what eli did? Zig is serious romantic competition for anyone on the show. That last scene was pretty amazing.  1. Was Maya wrong to not tell Miles about Zig moving in with her before it happened?  2. Becky: did she get the best possible resolution to her situation?  3. Zig: Still in love, or just pissed that someone has maya and he doesn't?  4. Grace and Tristan: the start of a beautiful friendship?   5. Imogen: To nice and understanding to be real?  6. Jenna: why is she always getting into public humiliation predicaments?  7. Did Miles hammer a nail into his own coffin by narcing out Zig?  As always i look forward to your comments, thoughts, and answers!    Really, this is one of my most favorite episodes this season. I loved beckys ring in the dinner scene.  1. What is a "sweetheart semiformal", and most importantly: When in the year does it take place?  2. Why does the school not take the theft of Maya's laptop seriously?  3. Is the Imogen and Becky situation wierd or amazing?  4. Is Maya's concern for Zig altruism or being attracted to him?    5. Does Jenna deserve someone as awesome as Connor?  6. Is Zig moving in good for Maya, or the end of her and Miles?  7. Will Jenna and Connor win King and Queen of the Sweetheart SemiFormal?   I look forward to hearing all your great responses, and am looking forward to next week's episode!   Extra Long episode!!!!!!! Will maintain at 7 questions though, because Tradition. This episode had several "special" features - including "camera vision" and zoe having flashbacks. Kind of wierd, not sure i liked that. Also the copy i watched (on teen nick) had some annoying skips, so, if i missed some massive plot point: that's why.   1. Why are there so many rarely seen people in this episode? First mile's sister's twin brother, and Becky's brother!? And that random girl that showed up for dance practice with Zoe and Mile's Sister? Zig and Grace?   2. When did Imogen become the voice of moderation and reason, concerned with rocking the boat?  3. Was the overall message of the episode well-managed?   4. Does this episode fall into the "communication trap" - where the problems would all go away if people just meaningfully communicated with each other, without fear or prejudice?  5. Who the hell is the short-haired judge at the sing off?   6. Is Miles a sociopath or merely an idiot?  7. Is it a total cop-out to have a throw away character be the guy ~~who shot Mr. burns~~ assaulted Zoe?  All told i really liked this episode and think it was pretty well done and entertaining! Look forward to hearing what all of you think :)   Drunk!Zoe may be the single hammiest acting i have seen in recent years. Maya's "You care about your father, or you wouldn't spend all your time trying to upset him" is the most cutting thing i have heard someone say on the show in a while.   1. Is this the first ever degrassi dream sequence?   2. Would drew be so easily misled, or teen drama bullshit?  3. Why does rocky have his own cellphone?  4. Maya: reasonable voice of wisdom, or miserable party-pooper?   5. Leo-Dallas: Perfect, or Unsatisfying?  6. What does everyone think of the continuing slow slouch towards Claire-Drew?  7. Is this the end of mile's turmoil, or is there more to come?      Is this the episode where they remind us they have people like Connor and Winston still on staff? And let's not forget little Rocky! I'm a little baffled what time of year it is on Degrassi.  Also, Mrs. Hollingsworth's necklace during the confrontation scene was amazing.  I gotta say, i genuinely liked this episode and really enjoyed it. The beginnings of Clew, some great Alli-Dallas moments, and all the Miles drama. Episode was even uploaded to teennick in a hurry.   I can't help but feel this may mark the second episode of a return to a more classic-feeling degrassi.  On with the quiz.  1. Should miles try harder to win over his father? Or should his father be more understanding of his son? After all, their family, regardless.  2. Maya: What happened to her new look?   3. Mr. Hollingsworth's (not-quite-confirmed) affair: Shocking Scandal, or disappointingly mundane?  4. Alli: Finally making the right choices, or misisng out on a great opportunity?  5. Car changing scene: Touchingly romantic or Awkwardly Forced and contrived?  6. Miles: Will this make him cynical and jaded, or will he maintain his innocence a bit longer?  7. Dallas: is he about to go beat a frenchman named Leo?    In some ways, this episode feels like a throwback to old degrassi, especially the drew arc with the mother yelling at him. A rare glimpse of maturity. The underclass girls talking to Imogen made my head hurt.  1. Zoe: Overly clingy, or attentive, caring girlfriend?  2. Is Imogen (and the dress code situation) a commentary on modern activism?  3. Jenna: Worst friend ever, or merely emotionally disabled?  4. Drew: Biggest asshole on earth or merely stressed out highschool senior?   5. Ali and Mike Dallas: best partners/friends ever, or start of another Alli Mistake?  6. Hollingsworth: Great boss, or ulterior motives?  7. Zoe: Will she and drew end up together in the sunset, or will she remain bitter?   Poker game was my favorite part of the season so far. Teennick continues to disappoint with technical problems.   1. Drew's exchange with Zoe about Dallas being a good kisser: throw out to the fans or throw-away statement?   2. Imogen braless in class: Is she that clueless, or fanservice?  3. Drew: Is it wise to threaten Miles with blackmail like that in his own home? Will it have repercussions?  4. Is it better to have fun building a volcano, or to stress yourself out doing research about cancer and organic food?  5. Drew: Is he in so far over his head he'll never see daylight, or getting his just desserts?  6. Imogen: Fighter for justice, or over-reacting nutbar?  7. Zoe-Drew: Is the age difference really that big a deal?  I really enjoyed this episode, and look forward to hearing what you all think about it.      What an amazing episode! We have Maya trying to fit in with people she's barely ever around, we have Grace with a speaking role, the beginnings of a (presumably) ill-fated Drew-Zoe hookup, and of course the token appearance by Tristan doing makeup. All told, not a bad episode at all.  I have to say as an aside that the previews for the season kind of ruin the zoe-drew thing for me. Maybe i'm just reading to much into it though.   Anyway, on with the quiz-questionnaire!!   1. Rubber room: Realistic or bizarre teen-drama trope?   2. Maya's New Look: Awesome or awful?   3. Is Maya's response to the rubber room a result of being in a stressful situation or the result of her wanting to win Zig back?   4. Zoe: Is her hooking up with drew a power move, or does she genuinely like him, or both?   5. Neck-Bruise: is it the next cuckoo-bananas? Can it please BE the next cuckoo-bananas?  6. Gun: Cruelest prank or funniest prank?  7. Rubber-room kids: Disturbingly harmless, or refreshingly naughty?   I look forward to seeing your (always insightful and often witty) answers!    I had many technical difficulties tonight, thus the late quiz. All apologies!  So we have the Bandhari Beatdown! The Drew Shoot Down! The Return of Alli's Parents! The Worst birthday surprise in history! The deepest hole ever dug by lies!   On with the quiz!    1. Why did Alli's mother immediately abscond with the coffee, not even giving any to Alli?   2. Why did they not do a scene of drew arguing for a live monkey mascot? It would have owned!   3. Zigs Return: Awesome or Awful!?   4. Maya: Has anger issues, or justifiably upset at her (hithero unprecedented) treatment by the school?  5. Leo: Was he actually trying to do the right thing, breaking up with Alli? Or was it just one more manipulation?   6. Is it just me or is Jenna looking a little rough?  7. Wedding Day Beat-Down: Over the top or awesome drama?   So what'd we all think? A suitable return for Degrassi? I'm eager to hear your thoughts.                     Me and a friend just set up an Overload (Using the most recent version of Overload) server, and neither one of us have any items shown in NEI. The space where they go is there, but there's no items. Putting in a thing to search for doesn't turn up any items.  If i mouse over something and hit "u" it shows me the recipes it's used in, and the same goes for if i hit "r" (It'll show me the recipe, i mean). The NEI interface is all there, it just displays no items to the right hand side.  Is there any known fix for this? Is it even a known problem? Any help would be much appreciated.  Edit: evidently disabling galacticraft fixes the problem   Got a new puppy that screams all night in it's crate, so i've been getting no sleep, and almost forgot the quiz!!! So, here we are, the Fall Finale.   1. Maya: Is tristan right about her and Zoe being essentially the same? Or is Maya in the right asking him to sabotage the performance?  2. Bianca: better or worse then Eli?  3. Drew: Is it wrong to exploit Adam's death to get Bianca to spend time around him?   4. Bizarre Thanksgiving Dinner Skit: Funny or Strange?  5. Tristan: Peace-Maker or Hopelessly Naive?  6. Eclare: On life support, or Healthier than ever?  7. What do you think of the Fall Finale?   I feel a little bad for saying we don't know tristan all that well - this episode was all about him. Well, sort of. I mean we still know nothing of tristan or his family life or his dreams, but we know he likes to act, and they spent time re-affirming this.    1. Is the switch from serious interpersonal issues to totally banal high school drama jarring or welcome?  2. Eli: is his transition from dedicated boyfriend to distracted college student realistic, or merely set up?   3. Should tristan just own what people perceive him as (and play to his strengths), or should he continue to try and break type?  4. Winston: Why does he pick now to suddenly start interacting? The dudes' been barely there the entire season; suddenly he cares about things?  5. Is tristan legitimately short-sighted enough to think that being in a *performing group* is the sort of thing someone can keep secret from their best friend?   6. Was the Eli-Clare scene poignant, or merely tragic?  7. Does drew not understand the meaning of the word negotiate?   A very maya-centric episode. Clares character continues spool down. Alli continues to make poor choices (or does she?). And a rare jenna sighting!   On to the quiz!  1. The maya-being-bullied storyline: are they handling it well?  2. Miles assaulting maya's attacker: totally cool or implausible tv drama? Why were there no consequences for anyone for that?  3. Hacking Sequence: worst thing this season, or merely exceedingly corny?  4. Mike Dallas: what? he turned into an alcoholic because he was no longer playing hockey? Why was he no longer playing hockey?  5. Maya: Is she winning the war while losing battles?  6. Zoe: to evil to be real or all to real?  7. Alli: Where are her parents and guardians in her decison making process? It's like she lives alone in a box somewhere with no one to turn to for help or guidance.   Continuing the "season of drugs" we have mike dallas drinking and skipping school. And Leo's drunk on rage.  1. Refresh me: Has maya ever been seen singing or playing guitar before? Let alone talking about a music career!?!?  2. Couldn't clare and alli study for the SAT together? Isn't it the same test for both of them? Why does clare have to specifically tutor Alli?  3. Mike Dallas, captain of the sports team, is engaging in risky self-destructive behavior? Why? Since when?   4. Does Leo have a legitimate point, here? I mean, sure he went to far, but isn't he basically right that Alli decided things for him, omitted important information, and then proceeded to take action on his behalf?   5. Miles: can't stand to see anyone succeed, or has a point?  6. Leo finally snapped: Will Alli take him back?   7. Is the bullying not Maya's fault?    Another week, another degrassi episode. Lots of plots got tied off this episode, although a few strings were left conveniently dangling...  1. Is this the season of drugs?  2. Why does becky think anyone knows why adam tried to get ahold of her? He left in the middle of the night in a stolen vehicle, after all.  3. Is the Clare chemo-brain story line interesting or boring? For that matter, is she as a character winding down and being kind of boring?  4. Tristan: stupid from love or merely desperate?  5. Has miles really forgiven tristan for what he did or is he just making nice?  6. Zoey calling Clare on lying: is it a low point in clare's life, or the lowest point?  7. Why did imogen change outfits in the middle of the day, at school? Will take all suggestions.    An episode with basically no plot progression, just ground-work laying.   1. Imogen: glad to have her back and being her schizotypal self, or annoyingly cute!crazy? "Becky! So stealthy!"  2. Long-distance relationships, will it work for Clare and Eli? He looks like might have a distraction (the kind who throws inflatable balls and watches new wave cinema)  3. Articles about Zoe: would clare be better off telling the truth (that Zoe's an ego-manical, self-promoting liar) or telling a glamorous but untruthful story? What would old clare do? Would Zoe even do an interview if she knew how clare...was?   4. What magazine editor gives a highschool kid less then a day to write an entire article with interview? Will the magazine ever be seen again?  5. Clare: Harmless side effect, or lethal illness return?   6. Is Miles father actually abusive or does he merely have high expectations?  7. Is Zoe's character a direct reflection of the writers frustrations with various actresses on the show throughout the years, or is she merely a trope... or is she both?  Editor's note: It was a real pain to get this episode working; teen nick needs to seriously upgrade the way they deliver the episodes, because the current way is so unreliable.   Kind of a mixed bag, episode wise. We see Zoe at her worst, Drew at his (hopefully) lowest, Clare being Clare and Leo leading a dance revolution of a sort.   On to our questions.   1. Miles has a sister?!?!?  2. Why does clare get to wear the cute safety glasses?  3. Leo: Does he have a point, or does he deserve the hate?  4. Is drew seriously wandering around with a harem of young girls doing his dirty work?  5. Zoe: Literally turning drew into a whore for drugs. I cannot even think of a question here; it's just so messed up.  6. Becky: Hiding her pain, or has she forgotten adam entirely?   7. Will Zoe's Faux-Friendship with Maya turn authentic due to Maya's charm? Will the sun rise tomorrow?   So that happened. Stuffed-Friia asked me to do this weeks' quiz and discussion, so here it is.  1. Leo: Biggest disaster, or biggest disaster ever?  2. Zoe: Secrets and instability; is she the new fiona?  3. Clare: Can't handle being shut down. Will she stand for it or give up? Where is Eli?  4. Alli: Worst decision maker, or worst decision maker ever?  5. Text Memorial Assembly: Cunning aversion of expected behavior, or are they just setting us up for a much bigger event later?  6. Why is degrassi's student council so large? The UN has smaller committees then them.  7. Drew: should he stop taking his medicine, or keep taking it for the action it's now caused in his life, including getting his dream beach party done and landing him a possible new tv-star girlfriend?      Long-time reader, first time poster. It's not that creepy - but it's creepy.  So, few weeks ago, i'm sitting in my house - it's like 9 am. My dogs start barking, and someone knocks at the door. I open the door, and it's this little dude - acne scarred face, thin, nasty looking. I say "What's up?" he says "Im really hungry, can i have some food? Just canned goods or something?"  He's really polite, i mean REALLY polite, and he also asks me to fill a 1-gallon jug with water. I give him two cans of beans and fill his jug and tell him to have a nice day, and even have kind of a positive vibe about the whole situation - helping those in need and what not. Even make an FB post.  So, about two hours later he's back: asks for something "other then beans" and if i have a smoke. Still feeling generous i tell him i got some Zatarans, and offer them to him. He kind of invites himself in, and *scavs through my girlfriends ashtray* while he's talking to me, still real friendly and polite.  He steals (I can think of no better word - he took without asking, and sort of commented he was taking them) some cigarette butts, i give him some zatarans and 3 cans of coke, and he leaves. I figure that's the *definite* end of it, and am a little miffed he just invited himself in.   The third time, he just let himself in and said "hey are you busy?" before i could even get out of my chair. At this point, he tells me his friend stole his coke and could he have another, and apologizes for bothering me.  At this point, i'm nervous. Anyone who'll just blow into your house is a little off, and this guy's giving me the crazy vibe pretty strong. He's also totally not intimidated by me, which is unusual, and he's also acting like we're friends or something, which is even stranger.  So i give him a coke, tell him not to bother me again, and close the door behind him and lock it. I'm pretty well convinced if he walks into my house without me there he'll rob it just because he's so familiar with it.  Three days (of me locking my doors and living in paranoia) later, he shows up again. I tell him, exactly: "Fuck Off" when i open the door, and slam it in his face.   A few hours later i'm outside and he walks by and sort of makes an apology to me for bothering me and then just keeps on walking.  It turns out (From  3rd party), he was the brother of a friend of my brothers. I hadn't seen him in so long that his new appearance (emaciated and sickly) was shocking, and he was, in fact, mentally unbalanced.   Hopefully he leaves us alone now, but I'll still be locking my doors when i leave the house unattended.         	150
 Isn't that a very closed-minded, unfair and naive way of rating movies? For example, a movie without any actors or a silent movie without music would for example score 0 on acting and/or sound design automatically?   La femme qui se poudre (1972).   I use a scale from 1 to 5 to rate movies, so a perfect score is 5/5 for me. Here are the 26 movies that I've given the highest score possible:        * Banshun (1949)      * Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956)        * Smultronstllet (1957)      * Jalsaghar (1958)      * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     * Pickpocket (1959)    * Le trou (1960)     * La notte (1961)      * L'eclisse (1962)     * Nattvardsgsterna (1962)        * Sanma no aji (1962)          * Tystnaden (1963)       * Suna no onna (1964)      * Andrey Rublyov (1966)      * Tanin no kao (1966)       * C'era una volta il West (1968)     * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)       * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)       * Solyaris (1972)      * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)   * Zerkalo (1975)       * Stalker (1979)        * Krhozat (1988)         * Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     * Stntang (1994)        It's far from one of my favourites, but it's indeed a good movie. One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's best performances.   It is! Quite good and gritty with a nice soundtrack.   I wouldn't care.   But then again, Iranian films overall have really bad distribution from the start. All of the movies I mentioned have at least been released on DVD.   Yeah, the best one of them all. Solyaris (1972) by Tarkovsky.   2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972). They're also way better in my opinion.   Five of my favourite Iranian movies:     * Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)    * Khaneh siah ast (1963)    * Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)   * Nun va Goldoon (1996)    * Ta'm e guilass (1997)      Five other Iranian movies really worth seeing:      * Avaze gonjeshk-ha (2008)    * Ayneh (1977)      * Gaav (1969)     * Sib (1998)    * Ten (2002)     Kiarostami's Koker trilogy is of course a must see too, but I tried not to only name movies by him. But be sure to watch Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) and Nun va Goldoon (1996), those two are great gems from Iran. Nun va Goldoon (1996) is also directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Samira Makhmalbaf's father.   I've seen it. Not that horrible, but too thin, simple and a bit superficial for me to like it more. I got the feeling that the movie wanted to be too much at the same time.   It's not really one of the top choices for me at all when it comes to what I want Criterion to release. I would rather see a release of Gummo (1997) then.      Your choices are not bad. My list would probably look like this:       1. Spalovac mrtvol (1969)        2. Les yeux sans visage (1960)        3. Possession (1981)      4. Onibaba (1964)        5. Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)        Two-Lane Blacktop (1971).   Mulholland Dr. (2001).   Hiroshima mon amour (1959), 90 minutes of perfection.   Tanin no kao (1966), Stalker (1979) and Solyaris (1972).   Hiroshima mon amour (1959).   Dead Man (1995), his best one.      Solyaris (1972) of course.   Stalker (1979).   Andrey Rublyov (1966) and Marketa Lazarov (1967) are both amazing in their realism. Both of them are dealing with a main character each, but they also portray rivalry. The first one dealing with the fighting between rival princes and the Tatar invasions, while the last one deals a lot with two different clans. Both movies also deal with religion and how it affected the Middle Ages.   I would say that these ten are the best ones:      * Antichrist (2009)     * Eraserhead (1977)        * Hxan (1922)               * Krkarlen (1921)    * Les diaboliques (1955)            * Les yeux sans visage (1960)       * Onibaba (1964)       * Repulsion (1965)     * Rosemary's Baby (1968)     * Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)       Edipo re (1967) by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The screenplay is adapted from the famous Greek tragedy by Sophocles. The movie starts for example in pre-war Italy, but the setting is later changed to the ancient world. Probably worth to know. But basically almost the entire movie is set in the ancient world. Good stuff. If you want a good biblical story, check out Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964). That one is also directed by Pasolini and is a great and interesting retelling of the story of Jesus Christ.      Have you seen Stalker (1979)? One of the best science fiction movies ever.   The controversy surrounding Greed (1924) by Erich von Stroheim is very interesting. There's some stuff written down about it on [Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/yfy9vl6).   Nice stuff. That movie is truly a masterpiece.      My top three:     1. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      2. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)     3. Belle de jour (1967)           They'll probably show up soon. I just think we have to wait some more. Nothing else to it.   The ending of L'eclisse (1962) is fantastic.   Ten of my favourite horror movies that shouldn't be missed out:      * Eraserhead (1977)    * Hxan (1922)    * La chute de la maison Usher (1928)     * Les yeux sans visage (1960)     * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)     * Onibaba (1964)      * Possession (1981)    * Repulsion (1965)      * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)    * Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)       Are you referring to Meatballs (1979) by Ivan Reitman? If so, it already has been released on Blu-ray. [Here](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Meatballs-Blu-ray/427/) is the US version and [here](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Meatballs-Blu-ray/41364/) is the Canadian one.   I don't know if I would call that an essay really, but then again, that term could be quite vague. Most of it consisted of objective facts. I was expecting something more and critical. It didn't give me any new insights either. Anyways, it's always nice to see Tarkovsky getting some space here. It's a great film nonetheless.   He truly was! Yeah, I love that picture too. They were so cute. And I like what Kurosawa said about his movies:       *"To not have seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun."*   I've seen several threads about it here. And it gets mentioned now and then in all kinds of places. It's even the most successful Irish film of all time if you look at the box office. The reception for it was mainly positive, there's somewhere over one hundred reviews for it at Rotten Tomatoes for example. So I wouldn't say that it's an unknown movie really. It also won some awards and got some nominations.       But to contribute with a film to the thread, I'll say Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. I posted about it in similar threads before, but I can't recommend it enough. To take an example, only 148 users have rated it on IMDb. It's rarely mentioned overall. It doesn't even have an official DVD release. I hope it gets a Blu-ray release one day, it really deserves it, or a double format release. One of the most underseen masterpieces of Japanese cinema of all time. Such a great film.   Scandinavia.   Well, the Blu-ray releases by Criterion are not the same region as the standard region in Scandinavia for example. So you have to get a region free player or one that plays that certain region to be able to watch them. Or do something else. It's a lot easier with DVD releases though, that's usually no problem to fix.   Because I use it as a standard on the Internet. English isn't my first language. And I don't like some English titles, so I always stick with the original ones, as those are the original titles and nothing else. Also, every movie has an original title, some movies don't have English titles at all, so I don't want to mix it either.   I don't like region codes at all either, it sucks. Especially for us in Europe when it comes to Criterion for example. And a good region free Blu-ray player seems to cost quite a lot too.   I don't know if you missed it, but there's already several Blu-ray releases of it. One [German](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/86439/), one [Spanish](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/124960/) and one [Australian](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/98243/). Arrow Films is also releasing it in July this year, [here's](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/128699/) a link to that one.   If you mean Gallipoli (1981) by Peter Weir, it actually got released on Blu-ray today. There is [this](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gallipoli-Blu-ray/125128/) edition and also [this](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gallipoli-Blu-ray/125494/) one.        Anyways, ten movies I have seen that should be released on Blu-ray:           * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    * La maman et la putain (1973)    * Mujo (1970)    * Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)    * Quatre nuits d'un rveur (1971)     * Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969)     * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)    * Suna no onna (1964)     * Tsuit no zawameki (1988)     * Un homme qui dort (1974)     And ten I haven't seen that really need to be released on Blu-ray:         * Al-mummia (1969)     * Ashani Sanket (1973)    * Der brennende Acker (1922)    * Gu ling jie shao nian sha ren shi jian (1991)    * Khesht va Ayeneh (1965)      * L'amour fou (1969)      * La nouba des femmes du mont Chenoua (1979)      * Ragbar (1972)     * Tobenai chinmoku (1966)     * Qing mei zhu ma (1985)          Well, the big studio flicks are the ones that gets the general public excited and hyped, there's no doubt about that. I'm not a big fan of Marvel from the beginning, so I don't really get let down by their movies, because I know quite much what to expect from the beginning. I would say that the best movies usually (or more like always) are those that aren't a part of Hollywood, Disney and Marvel.   Can't say I'm excited for any of those really. At least there's other interesting stuff coming.   La peau douce (1964), Viskningar och rop (1972), Sanma no aji (1962) and Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) are some of my favourites when it comes to the latest releases. Sanma no aji (1962) was an upgrade though, I don't know you count that too. It's going to be interesting to see what's coming in the future, they'll probably announce new releases quite soon.   Film Comment and Sight   Sound (also published by BFI) are great and interesting sources, as someone already mentioned. IMDb is great for information mostly, like production details, cast, filmographies etc. There's really no other site that is as universal and complete as IMDb when it comes to that. Be sure to check out the external reviews by critics on IMDb though, you will found links to many different sites (including Sight   Sound) that together will give you a massive amount of all kinds of reviews.   Is it sad that people are different when it comes to taste?   Popil i diament (1958) by Andrzej Wajda. And yes, it's great! One of the best polish films ever made. It's a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is fantastic in his role. Probably the best movie dealing with Poland's war and post-war history. If you have the slightest interest in cinema, this movie shouldn't be missed.   Well, Murph also wanted him to go find Amelia, so he also had a reason to leave. I think Murph mostly was satisfied with Cooper keeping his promise, that he would return to her. I don't think one should put that end scene you mentioned as the main focus, how long he stayed there or how long he didn't. I didn't like the movie, but for me, it was entirely because of other reasons.   There's no set release date yet. I think they will announce new releases in a couple of hours or maybe in a day or two, they usually do it in the middle of the month, so we'll see if it's going to be announced. If not, I'm sure it will come in the near future.   It looks probably amazing. It seems that it will be released by Criterion on DVD/Blu-ray too, which sounds even more amazing. And I hope they will restore more of Ray's work soon.   It's not my favourite by Bresson either, but it sure is a great movie. I love how powerful it as and still so minimalistic and spare. I'm a big fan of Bresson's special film theory and his rules, so this is entirely a movie in my taste. Everything is stripped down to the barest essentials. Every composition is well-thought out, everything we see is supposed to be there and Bresson really knew what was important and what was not. The editing is totally uncompromising and unbending, everything is beautifully shot at the same time too. The movie overall is claustrophobic and gloomy. I also like how it's quite deprived of humor, drama and feelings, but still manages to be powerful and nuanced without villains and heroes. Bresson's movies were special, there's really nothing like them. I think this movie is a magnificent reconstruction. I have to rewatch it soon! Bresson surely was a master.   Interesting stuff. Polish cinema really has some gems to offer. He's picked out some great ones. It's just too bad that I live thousands of miles away from the cities that are having the event.         The Game (1997)?   I would also say that it's one of the best silent movies ever made! It's very special and well done.   Great! I hope you'll like it!   If you haven't seen Repulsion (1965) by Roman Polanski, it's of course essential.   Here's 15 documentaries I think would be very interesting to see in the collection:       * Araya (1959)     * As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty (2000)     * Dead Birds (1963)     * Dialogue with a Woman Departed (1981)     * Diaries Notes and Sketches (1969)       * Feng ai (2013)     * Forest of Bliss (1986)    * Fragments of Kubelka (2012)     * Ladoni (1994)    * Pour la suite du monde (1963)     * Pripyat (1999)    * Resan (1987)     * Sayonara CP (1972)     * Taiga (1992)      * Tiexi qu (2002)      Since I haven's seen them, I can't say why and so, but they just look very interesting and I surely want to watch them. It's also intriguing when Criterion releases stuff you haven't seen. Also, some of them don't have Blu-ray releases either, which would make it even more fitting.   Sure, I've seen 26 of his movies and from what I have seen, he surely is one of the great ones. These are my three absolute favourites:     * Nattvardsgsterna (1962)      * Smultronstllet (1957)     * Tystnaden (1963)         Some other essential ones in my opinion:      * Ansiktet (1958)    * En passion (1969)     * Fanny och Alexander (1982)     * Hstsonaten (1978)    * Jungfrukllan (1960)     * Persona (1966)        * Skammen (1968)    * Ssom i en spegel (1961)    * Viskningar och rop (1972)    I can also recommend his TV mini-series Scener ur ett ktenskap (1973).   I have only seen the first one, but I thought it was very silly, ridicilous, boring, ugly and mostly full of bad comedy. I guess I'm not a fan of the childishly Disney tone it has.   I know at least that I would have Werckmeister harmnik (2000) and No Quarto da Vanda (2000) on my list.         Stanley Kubrick. No doubt about it.   Yjinb (1961) is a good starter that's quite accessible. I don't know if you have seen Per un pugno di dollari (1964) by Sergio Leone already, but that movie is basically a remake of Yjinb (1961), so if you watched it, you will probably recognize the story. If you don't mind the length and have no problems with it, Shichinin no samurai (1954) isn't really a bad choice either. It also has pretty much every key element Kurosawa is known for, so you will get quite a good overview if you start with it. If you don't want to start with a samurai flick, I would go with Ikiru (1952), it's easy to like and has a quite sympathetic story that's easy to relate to. I know many that started with Rashmon (1950) and loved it, it isn't one of his longer films, so that is one option too. It's a bit more complex than Yjinb (1961) though.   They do! Two good movies!   The Room (2003).            Isn't it quite obvious that the majority of people hanging out in this subreddit really likes superhero movies? Look at the news, the discussions and what gets upvoted, it's quite easy to tell if you've been here a while. By the way, I don't know if your second question was meant to be the same as the one in the topic or if you meant anything specific about the industry?   Isn't this a great opportunity for you to rewatch the movie then? And isn't it supposed to be you choosing what you yourself think are the best negotiation scenes? It seems like you aren't trying at all.      I don't know if I would say that he's that underrated, but maybe not recognized enough and that his movies are quite underseen would be a better description. As for the downvoting thing, it seems that users on this site tend to downvote quite much that they've never heard of or anything similar overall. I don't really like the voting system at all, but that's another discussion. Anyways, Terayama did some good stuff!   Well, as I already said, the site isn't anything for me and I won't use it in the future. I don't use any similar sites either. I was just curious about what the suggestions are based on and adding a bit of contructive critique.  There's already similar sites with different filters too:      [http://agoodmovietowatch.com/](http://agoodmovietowatch.com/)       [http://www.suggestmemovie.com/](http://www.suggestmemovie.com/)     [http://www.random-movie-picker.com/](http://www.random-movie-picker.com/)     [http://5000best.com/movies/](http://5000best.com/movies/)         That's just some examples. So your friend should try to come up with something special that makes his site differ from the lot. If he wants to make his site unique. Maybe he doesn't.                                                                                                                       	121
                The problem is that whichever war we are at, it does not determine who is right, but only who is left.    That is just amazing! I'd frame it and put a red paper for background - I think this looks better than most art.         sausages   Interesting that we could protect against UV radiation with the pill, but that poses another question - how would that effect our kidney or liver?

 Thank you! :) nice to see some positive comments   Hey asshole, I only made an account because SO really likes reddit. I wish I could really just jump through the internet sometimes and punch people in the dick.   Geez, fuck off. Leave him alone.   Spoiler alert: you're the cunt, and you never going to get any.   Hey, girlfriend here. Thanks to you guys who defended me. When I handed this to him, I flat out told him that it wasn't my design, so I didn't pass it off as mine. Second, I did what I did out of love. I had an extra canvas and I knew he liked that poster, so I wanted to paint it because what does just buying a poster really say about how you care for someone. I had one day to do it, between work, school, and driving an hour each way to see him, and it's hard for me to be creative under stress. Because of that I didn't really have time to do my own design but I wanted him to have something I painted. So for the record, I fucking love that kid, and all this is meant to be is a gift :)  	4
                                                                                              Hey guys I am glad we have set up camp in a new subreddit, but I am wondering how we can take control of the original subreddit again. If we can oust the rogue mod. I would personally volunteer to mod the astrophysics page. I just hate to see some troll take over like that.                Hey I have had an idea, what if every week or every month or something we posted a city or area that we want to map and then everybody works together to map that area for the week.  We can make it fun by taking a before and after screenshot or something.  I just think it would be a fun way to make a lot of progress on specific areas to help and make the map better.     A lot of times there it just feels like you can map for days and days but not much progress is being made.  I think this would be a fun way to realize a lot of progress in a specific area very quickly, and help keep people enthused.   PS: Please submit your thoughts.      A few days ago this ask reddit post asking about divorse made it to the front page. (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2mk3kp/divorced_redditors_why_did_you_get_divorced/)   Here Huffington Post article from 3 days ago literaly going through and copying the top comments.  At least they cited Reddit with hyper links. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/21/why-people-get-divorced-_n_6200210.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular)                              I have read the osm wiki on it but I still feel like it is a bit vague on when you should use one over the other.  Does anyone have an opinion on which to use, and when?         I recently decided to take the leap from the ID editor into JOSM I expected it to be a difficult transition but I didn't expect it to be almost impossible.  I have enjoyed editing in the ID editor, but it does have its moments of frustration,  it lags when you haven't saved for a while, you cant zoom out to get the big picture which can get claustrophobic and make large edits hard to impossible, and it wont load large objects completely, which can get confusing. For all of these reasons I decided it was time to try JOSM.    I expected things to be different and more complicated, but after finally booting up JOSM and trying it out I have found I have trouble even drawing a simple road, much less getting back to the power editing i am used to.  I cant figure out how to pan the the view and every time i try i just end up drawing a new way.  The list goes on.   What I have discovered is what I really want is the simplicity of the ID editor paired with the ability of JOSM to edit large areas. Is there anything like this out there?    I feel like i am stuck in the middle, where the ID editor is starting to feel confining and limiting, but JOSM is so complicated, that i end up spending 5 minutes just trying to trace a simple road.   Edit: thanks for all the help the shortcuts make a huge difference, thank you for all the help guys.   So i am trying to buy a motor and ESC's and it was recomended to me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2le7uo/trying_to_build_quad/clu1ha0) to use a motor that has a max draw of around 6-8 amps with a 10 amp esc, you can see the links.  The problem is the ESC's are out of stock.  Is there any problem (besides extra weight) with going with a [20 Amp ESC](http://www.myrcmart.com/rcx-20a-sky-simonk-brushless-esc-for-multicopter-24s-p-8063.html) instead of the recommended [10 Amp ESC](http://www.myrcmart.com/product_info.php?products_id=6994)?   Edit:sorry The motor is this one here http://www.myrcmart.com/zmr-1804-2400kv-micro-outrunner-brushless-motor-clockwise-p-6281.html   I am trying to build a quad for as cheap as possible.  I have a 4 channel transmitter and receiver but that is it.  I am wondering what combination of ESC's, motors, and logic boards would be cheapest.  Please be specific I have flown quads and planes before but they have always been RTF or minimal assembly.            So I have been doing a lot of mapping in southern Mexico and Guatemala  There is this one spot of complete forrest, but it is gigantic.  I am wondering how to go about mapping this? one giant polygon? many small polygons?  Are there other options?  As you can see I have already drawn two relatively large polygons.     Forrest area I am referring to [here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/16.1448/-91.0193).   Ps: Also if anyone is looking for a project this area is almost completely unmapped. Would love help if anyone is interested.         How did you deal with it?   Did it end up breaking you up?   What would you watch out for?   For anyone else playing the Volvo Ocean Race Game do you know what the wind change scheduel is?  It seems to be every 12 hours but it seems to be slowly shifting over time.      So we know now that comet [Siding Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2013_A1) is not going to hit Mars, just give it a close shave.  When it was first discovered though we were not sure. My question is If the comet were to impact Mars how would that affect the two rovers, [Curiosity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_rover) and [Oportunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover), that are currently on mars?         I just finally updated to .24, and while the new boosters are really cool, they seem like they are just a bit too powerful for the game. What I mean is with my very first rocket I managed to build a single stage to orbit. All I did was put two large fuel tanks and the super powerful quad engine on and tada I made it to orbit with fuel to spare.  That just seems too easy and defeating the purpose of the game.    Edit: To clarify I am talking about the new super powerful engines and super large tanks not the little white SRB's.         So I am mapping in the middle of nowhere in Chiapas Mexico and i come across this little town (http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=17/16.48792/-91.30753) unlike many of the other towns that I have seen in the local area, this one seems to have a cleared out area at the center of the town which looks an awful lot like a runway.  What do you guys think?  Is it a runway?   Edit: (http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=17/16.56118/-91.36165) This is another example this one seems much more likely to be a runway but would like to know for sure before i go runway mapping crazy.   Edit2: Now that I am getting way farther into the back country I am seeing this a lot more.  I am seeing a lot of towns that also don't seem to have any roads leading to them which would make it seem very likely that these are grass runways, which seems to be a common phenomenon in jungle villages of Central and Southern America .   Edit:3 This is a real thing, many central american towns do not have any roads, and their main connection with the outside world is through small bush planes.   Examples:   *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSUbcFGzc4s   *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YIzR9TisUg   I have seen so many posts where the two different posts are linked to the same content, but one has made the front page while the other has 3 votes.  How is it that links to the same thing can have such different results?

I have looked it up(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon), but it still doesn't make sense to me.      For people that are from places with stricter islamic law how do you date?  I know some of these countries are pretty restrictive on how males and females are allowed to interact.      I have noticed the county line in my area is drawn in the wrong location. About ten years ago the county obtained a significant amount of land moving the boundary 3-4 miles how do we get this changed?  Edit:Here is the county in question http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2528711#map=10/35.7632/-80.7063 Here is a link to how the county should be drawn http://www.co.iredell.nc.us/Departments/Planning/images/officialzoningmapbig.jpg The south western Corner is obviously different the new county line includes the end of the peninsula.                                                            I understand that the computers in an airbus will not let the airplane preform beyond its minimums and maximums for example the computer will not let the plane stall.  I have heard that these computer imposed limits make it so that the pilot can not cross control an airbus i was wondering if this was true?   I just watched a movie called The Snow walker, it was a great movie, I would definitely suggest it if you haven't seen it.   For those that have seen it, what did you guys think, especially about the ending?  [**Warning spoilers**]  I thought the ending was so sad I was wondering what the meaning of her foot steps ending, and the white owl were.   In my opinion I really wish that they both had made it, it was so sad when she disappeared to die, and the scene of him creating a tomb for her and him putting her things inside, was almost more sad for me than when he couldn't find her.         I have seen quite a few videos of kerbals walking around without their helmets.  How do you do this?                                             Hello Everyone My friend who is a little person is thinking about taking flight lessons.  I was wondering how he would be able to accommodate for his short stature.  I think the main issue would be reaching the rudder pedals.  Does anybody know what is typical for something like this.   Hello I am trying to decide wether to install the Ferram Aerospace Research mod and i was wondering if anybody who had done it before had any opinions what are the advantages, disadvantages, annoying things.  Right now I am running remote tech and Mech Jeb.      Hello I am a private pilot and earned my license about 8 months ago, so I am still pretty new.  I was wondering if there were any recourses on the procedure for interacting with class B and C airspace, so I could study.  I have worked with a  control tower before but have not had the chance to go into class B or C space and wanted to study up so I don't screw it up when I do need to fly into controlled space like this.                  Ok so yesterday I hit a few caches and found a couple trackables.  Neither were in the inventory of the caches online.  When I went to log them it let me grab the trackable but now it will not let me drop it off it only gives me the option discovered it and write a note when i try to log it.  Anybody know whats going on?   I am playing the in career mode and am currently sending some landers to Minmius to get a bunch of science.  The only problem is because Minmius has lower gravity, the thrust to weight ratios change in their SOI.  I have given them very small Engins with low TTWR but I am afraid when I get there the engine might still be too powerful (lowest power setting is still too much).  Is there any way to calculate the change without actually going to Minmius?  Basically TWR of 1 on Kerbal is equal to x TWR on Mun and x TWR on Minmius.                            I am in the career mode and currently have a rocket with a very low thrust to weight ratio 1.3-2.5 depending on what stage I'm on.  When this is the case is it better to fly higher than normal (normal = 10,000m) before starting my gravity turn? does it make any difference?  	138

 Doesn't everything really start at the end of a screw?      Cite your evidence please. And show me where there was a consensus, not just one economist going out on a limb and claiming there would be a crash.   Economists' opinions mean nothing. They are not very good at predicting the stability of the economy. A majority of economists thought things were going fine in 2008 before the market crashed.  They're glorified historians. And I don't mean to insult historians, at least they're honest about the fact their work deals with more the past than the present.   Just finished Ready Player one by Ernest Cline. Looking forward now to his next book, Armada.  	5

 Had the MP said this about Jews would you be saying it was understandable. Romas are treated like lesser humans in large parts of Europe.   Karzai made his bed let him sleep in it. Karzai is a US creation. We don't need to prop up his corrupt regime anymore.  EDITED: Grammar   GOP to Republican voters: Let the power brokers decide   I don't understand where you get this. Most Democrats oppose the Citizens United decision. Also in many smaller places where Democrats are in control efforts have been made to curb contributions and bring in some sort of public financing.   Tom Delay's indictment never stopped him from making appearances on numerous news outlets.   This is why Republicans want no campaign contribution limits. Those silly trivial limits forces them to break the law.   It leaves people of color who have saved the housing stock to start over in another neighborhood and not reap the benefits of their good work.   Where do they move? Eventually some of them move into a box in some back alley.   You are correct my experience was in in the 70s, 80s and 90s in New York City maybe the process has changed. However, it is does not change the fact that lower income people are displaced and Whites end up with a desirable neighborhood.   Renters leave because they can not afford the neighborhood prices and rents.  Home owners leave in the second wave as home prices rise and commodity prices rise. Their $60,000 home is sold for $200,000. The home is resold for $400,000. The home owners do make money but miss out on the windfall.  The end result Whites takeover a neighborhood in which the people of color have protected the housing stock for decades.   Having been pioneers of gentrification in a number of neighborhoods I find the study flawed. I am White. I saw the vast majority of people of color displaced. First the renters went but then the home owners sold out because the money they were offered were too much for them not to accept. Also the prices in stores changed upward forcing lower income home owners to seek more affordable communities.   One neighborhood changed from African-American to White and in the other Hispanic/African-American to White. Just because you don't have to move the economics may make moving the best alternative. In the end the benefits of the new gentrified community changes are lost to the long-time residents renters and home owners.   Taliban actually banned opium production in their final year of power. The Taliban found opium production against Islamic teachings.    Of course his probation will be shorten for good behavior. /s   If an accomplice to a bank robbery destroyed evidence would they get probation. I think not. White collar criminals need to pay the same price as other criminals.    If Vitter wins he would fit in with all the other crooks and scoundrels who were Louisiana governors.    Please check out the photo of Festival mascot Hamish the Haggis.   It is not meanwhile. It is because of these "unfortunate" derivative contracts that JPMorgan makes billions more each year.   That only took 13 years to realize. The opium/heroin trade is the backbone of the Afghan economy. When the Taliban was in power they willing fought the heroin trade while the US has been partners with the opium warlords.   The Egyptian military is taking up the club that the Arab Spring forced Mubarak to put down.   Just what everyone thinks, Florida's "stand your ground law" is too strict. /s   Homophobia is becoming as unacceptable to large firms as racism. Would be great if sexism would become this unacceptable.   When banks sets side billions to pay expenses it leaves less money to lend. Also setting asides money to pay expenses effects these financial institutions bottom line. JPMorgan had their first not-profitable quarter under Jamie Dimon because of JP Morgan's write down of their $13 billion fine.   Gov. McCrory may be right that Congress doesn't do much but would he leave a majority White district without representation for a year. I think not.   But it was one of the last chance attempts by Tea Party wingnuts.  EDITED: added the   The statement "that comedian is crazy, insane" is really true.   A glacial lake is formed by a glacier gouging the earth and then as it  retreats it fills with water.

There are many valleys that are glacial that do not have significant glacial lakes.   I used Reddit's search function and it did not flag the submission. Sorry for the double post.   I was explaining that the trench didn't have to be filled with water but just covered by the ice.

A persons well being from a chemical spill should not be determined by where you live.   Not necessarily. If girls are offered a course which is dominated by boys, it is not enough to just say choose. Girls in this case need to encouraged, mentored and incentivized to take the courses which allow them to succeed if they take the AP test.   Not if the trench is filled with ice.  EDITED: changed tench to trench   The large banks probably have already figured out a way to use this loophole to continue all their current banking operations.   No classes, no computers, no mentoring it makes it hard to take an advance placement test.   This is the equivalent of the rich eating cake while throwing crumbs to the poor.

I think you need to rethink your comparison of CNN to FOX.    First, I'm not liberal. Second, your reply just makes Zucker's point.   OP: That was the name the BBC used. This was a sentence from the  story. I agree the correct country name is Myanmar.   CNN is running third in the cable news ratings. Fox is number one in the news ratings. CNN was tired of being dumped on by Fox. CNN sees itself as the only impartial news source. It was time to take the gloves off and make Fox's relationship to the GOP the issue.   We do know that but this is coming from the head of a major news network not a Democrat or the political left.   Just want to point out the businessinsider.com story was posted at 9 AM this morning more than 8 hours after my original post. While Mediaite story was not blogspam the story was pulled because the site was an unacceptable domain. Mediaite is on that list because it's stories are blogspam.   Rachel Maddow Show original story about Christie is only available as a video clip when I posted it. So there is no real way to put this story on r/politics.   Really fascinating read about how the E Coli bacteria evolves. Certainly a must read for those who don't believe in evolution.   NFL contemplating postponing the Super Bowl./s   Are the down votes based on people thinking this story is blogspam? The [original Dallas Morning News story](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140106-ted-cruzs-dad-backs-tea-partier-katrina-pierson-for-sessions-seat.ece) is not very informative either. The Post story adds some context but neither piece will win a Pulitzer.   I doubt that the victims of unsolved murders are 50/50 White and African American since the majority of murder victims are people of color.   You seem to be justifying the disparity in solved vs. unsolved cases. When you see a racial disparity our first instinct should be to see these differences in light of our history of racism. What I am seeing in this discussion is an attempt to justify the facts by blaming the victims.   This is what the [Innocence Project says about eyewitness testimony:](http://www.innocenceproject.org/understand/Eyewitness-Misidentification.php)  Eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions nationwide, playing a role in nearly 75% of convictions overturned through DNA testing   It is not just the Fed but every vote in Congress is now a political battle.   When did police have to have the most unreliable evidence, eyewitness accounts, to solve murders.   The fixation on "no snitching" as the reason for the higher rate of unsolved murders of Black victims seems to be an attempt to excuse often shoddy police work in poorer neighborhoods. Often the victims are people police consider criminal themselves. Lets not blame poor police work on the African-American community. That's blaming the victims.   Or a Republican   That stance is too brave for Gov. Cuomo.   His analysis that being white saved him a trip to jail is so true. His story should make everyone understand the marijuana laws are unjust and should be repealed immediately.   This certainly is a way to keep track of Russians who participate for later retribution.    A well written look at a former Republican Congressman turned doomsday prepper.   Being fined is just the cost of doing business. Prison sends a message.   Retry, it is available.   We couldn't expect any other outcome.   Pipelines have less risk of explosion but when they do leak the damage is significantly larger. Pipeline explosions also are more catastrophic.   Because as you know dogs only speak in English. /s   This looks like the last mass murder of 2014. Hopefully this year will be a better year.   I regularly read the AP wire, BBC, The Guardian, the Independent, Reuters, CNBC, Bloomberg, France 24, Christian Science Monitor, ThinkProgress as well as smaller blogs and news sites.   I certainly have not felt that. The news media has been pumping this story hard since Snowden claimed "mission accomplished."   The power of a $3 billion donation from the Saudi's   Added: Gen Giap's ability to win wars against vastly superior forces without actually conquering his enemy is legendary. His ability to know how to use his forces in inflict the heaviest losses and to effect public opinion in the home country of his enemies was revolutionary in the art of war.   Diem Bien Pho was a campaign against the French in 1954 in which the French were drawn into the city and then surrounded. The French spent weeks trying to break out of the now blockaded city. Troops that were sent by road to free the city were ambushed. The campaign turned the French public against their colonization of Vietnam.  The Tet offensive was a total attack across South Vietnam by VietCong and North Vietnamese forces against US and South Vietnamese forces during Vietnamese New Year in 1968. Fighting was fierce with battles raging in many of the major cities. Supreme firepower by the US won the campaign but the violence turned a majority of Americans against the war,   Well that leaves maybe a quarter of the elected officials in one party.   What would Pope Francis do?   This will be taxpayer money. Churches are non-profits and are not subject to taxation.   Vietnamese Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap for Diem Bien Pho campaign and the Tet offensive.   Please explain who has dual Israeli citizenship?   Have we heard anything from the birthers on this situation? Renouncing your Canadian citizenship doesn't make your a natural-born American?   Can you say presidential candidate Cruz?   However, what is good for Fox may not be good for the US. /s   Yet, there will be no consequences for Rep. Issa. When gaining political advantage becomes more important than the facts we have a national crisis.   This definition stops most discussions of political movements from r/politics. When I pushed the issue I was told I was arguing with the mods. The consequence would be banning. I only asked questions.  EDITED: Added last sentence   When I mean all out civil war, I mean armed territories that each faction holds, ethnic cleansing and armed military actions on a daily basis by both side. They are close but the two sides are not there yet.   How much longer until an all out civil war breaks out in Iraq?    Another step towards an all out civil war.   This is the second mass shooting Thursday in Louisiana.   John Miller's reporting has always been more law enforcement PR than news gathering.   Maybe I've been to too many Ranger games excluding 93-94.   This is the beginning of a period of extreme violence in Egypt. The military has become everything Mubarak wanted it to be.    Hockey without beer is like winter without hockey.   Christmas is all about the boxes.   What a great beauty. Merry Christmas to Maggie and all the other kitties of the world.   If you cause an uprising on Reddit do you get banned?   This predator (humans) has the brain power to try to repair the damage it does.    Failed to adapt to DDT and rifles.   California condors and buffaloes were going extinct on their own? I don't think so.   I have to agree, if a species is going extinct on its own we should not be involved, However if that species is being driven extinct by human activity then there should be a debate about what humans should do.   This is investigative reporting at its best. This is an in depth look at how the US waged a covert war in Columbia.   This sounds new and fresh but it is not. For years industries have spread their contributions to supporters on both sides of the aisle. What is somewhat new is the tech industry is becoming more involved in street politics. Tech gurus have spent their money lobbying not in retail politics.    Phil Robertson has a free speech right. A E as his employer can say that Robertson's speech has injured the television company.   When does this headline read criminal charges about to be filed?   This amateur may have done more damage than good. Hopefully this person hasn't destroyed the value of this site.   David Cameron has as much sense as the last politician to say "mission accomplished," George W. Bush.   Just a note ThinkProgress is no longer an unacceptable domain on r/politics.   Worked for me. I'm not sure why your system gets that error message.   Like the Westboro Baptist Church there will be some open carry advocates who will use the law to make money and push the envelope.   It seems that thinkprogress.com has been unbanned. This is one of the four articles from thinkprogress.com today that have been allowed without receiving the unacceptable domain tag.    I think thinkprogress.com may be unbanned. When I posted thinkprogress.com stories before they were autobanned within 2 minutes.   [This post from has accepted at r/politics from the banned site, thinkprogress.com](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1smyfb/lobbyists_circumvent_disclosure_rules_while/    This s a story from the banned r/politics site thinkprogress.com.   That's a good point.   So in Fauxland it is OK to discriminate as long as your not a government  body. For government bodies they can discriminate as long as they have a good reason.  EDITED: Spelling   This is why old school journos were so angry at the entire idea of selling space "above the fold" back when the issue was ad placement on paper.    I posted this article to r/politics and it was banned because it is from a banned domain. This domain is banned because it is blogspam. Read this article and tell me how it is blogspam? It is an example of articles posted at thinkprogress.com. Again, why is this site banned?   An in depth review by an award winning journalism site of how justice may be for sale in state Supreme Courts. The lack of disclosure leads to the perception that justice may not be blind.   Pulitzer Prize winning website turns its spotlight on the problems of the elderly and ill in prison. They explain how the elderly are held hostage by prison bureaucrats.   Kristallnacht was not a secret to the German people. The ethnic rivalry between Serbs and Croats is not a secret.    Taking collective concertize action without a union is still covered by the National Labor Relations Board. Workers will not be fired for their absence on the day but for any past infractions.   These one-day strikes has gotten some interest with some national unions but organizing multiple locations of national company is very difficult. Add in the the transitory nature of the worker force it becomes nearly impossible.   What next Harvey Milk ended homophobia?   It is one think to face the consequences, it is another to took the blame. The question is how did CBS get this story.? If S S was given an inside track to have the book on 60 Minutes because it is an affiliate of CBS then corporate heads should role. If Logan met the guy and thought the story was credible then heads at 60 Minutes should roll as well as hers.   Here is the [BBC trying to put a positive face](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25151974) on the continuing economic stagnation in the industrialized world.   I hope you don't think I way to go back into Iraq? The problem is we went into Iraq without a real understanding of the geopolitics of Iraq and/or the Middle East. To Bush 43 they were all Arabs.   Turkey believes these lands were theirs and the all Kurds are really Turkish people. By the way Turkey has entered Iraqi Kurdistan on a number of occasions since 2003 to show their territorial claims and to pursue Kurdish rebels.   I'm not questioning if there could have been a stable political structure built in Iraq. However, if you break it you ought to fix it. That is why the US invasion of Iraq was a fool's errand from the beginning.   Yes. The territorial integrity of current day Turkey is very important to the Turkish people. There are issues with the glory of the Ottoman empire and the Turkish control of a sizable part of the Middle East.   Twenty year before that it was the end of the one earner households.   Your correct but the US did change the balance of power within Iraq without an adequate political infrastructure. The new Iraq was doomed from the beginning to a violent future.   The Turks believe a Free Kurdistan would increase the demands that western Turkey be annexed to the new country. They fear an increase in rebel attacks. That is if the Iraqi Kurds gain independence. The Turks would believe a Syria/Iraq Kurdistan would be a direct threat to their national sovereignty.    Turkey has said that they will not abide with a free Kurdistan and will use military force to stop it. With Turkey being a NATO country this would have many ramifications.   There is a sickness in Ohio.   Everyday this goes on the possibility of Iraq splintering apart into three separate entities becomes more inevitable. The Kurds are banking on this to establish a formal Kurdish homeland.   Thee were indications in the last election that the GOP was paying people to do traditional "volunteer work." The Republicans were moving groups of supporters in and out of states to bolster operations. The problem is many of these paid workers were traditional free worker (i.e. diehard activists).   The anti-regulatory wing of the GOP is taking on the party's foot soldiers. This may lead to a McConnell win but may also lead some groups to bolt the party for a more politically pure party.   This seems to be truly wishful thinking. The economic underpinnings of most of the developed world's economies, excluding China and India, are shaky at best. We will knew when the end is near when consumers feel free to spend like they did in the first half of the last decade.    I think it is more likely r/politics has been rat-fucked by Republican operatives. R/politics is a valuable property and control of it would be a coup for GOP dirty tricksters. The end of r/politics as a reliable source of info on the Republican political operations would embolden the GOP to continue to fight against one person - one vote.   When workers don't have the resources to buy the goods they make it is a sign that the economy is going to tank.   This is a joint project with "This American Life." The stories take an in-depth look at how housing discrimination continues till today with little or no federal enforcement.    The understanding of abstract concepts allows students to develop critical thinking skills. Plus algebra two is just rudimentary math in these days of advanced technology.   A great look at the the problems of stopping off-shore crimes. The Center for Public Integrity has been been doing groundbreaking work on this subject for the last year.   It is amazing in this day and age that young conservatives are so self-absorbed that they didn't realize the reaction their stupid prank would engender.   A deep dive into Medicare. This story shows how Medicare doesn't even take the simply steps to curb cost overruns.    U/theredditpope has been at the center of the controversy at r/politics. Beyond the banning of sites he has been forcing people to delete posts if they wanted to remain on r/politics. He has deleted posts from discussions without telling the poster. He has refused to listen to criticism and ridiculed redditors on r/politics on other subreddits. His actions will reflect on any site that wants him as a mod.  I wouldn't be a mod on any site he is associated with. He represents the worst of reddit.  It is your choice but I feel you are devaluing r/politic.   The struggle at r/politics is not limited to one single subreddit but it is actually a fight for the future of reddit as an open and free community. It may sound melodramatic but there are political forces outside of reddit who want to stifle the influence this site has on the internet. It may sound conspiratorial but there is enough evidence to believe this is what is happening.   U/theredditpope has been a leader of the censorship efforts at r/politics. By making him a mod at r/politic you are giving him political cover. There is no reason for him to be a mod at this site except to make himself look good. Read his comment history and say that he is an appropriate mod for this site.   Que?   The House has ethics rules but they just don't use them.    The Kasich miracle is not such a miracle.   This is someone who thought he was going to be chosen as the next Secretary of Homeland Security.   Eric Cantor is taking after Gerald Ford who couldn't walk and chew gum.   Nothing in that statement is even slightly factually unsound. Yet this kind of statement gets you labelled a 'denier' in the same vein as a holocaust denier? Can't you see that it's this shit right here that turns so many people against the climate debate?  [Most people are not against climate change science.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/13/climate-change-red-state-opinion-america-study)   Solar panels increase the profitability of electric companies but they are asking the utility commission to add a monthly fee to solar panel users. There is something real wrong here.   The House is to busy doing nothing to take up important legislation. With 2014 being an election year the likelihood of the House passing immigration reform in in 2014 is nil to none.   But there is only one party as policy which is racist, homophobic, xenophobic, anti-gay, anti-transgender, anti-woman, anti-labor, anti-poor, climate deniers and supports policies against poor and working people. Not  a complete list.   When George Bush the younger was president no one counted the number of Dems or Reps on a particular bench before deciding if one of his appointments should be approved. For the GOP there is no limits to the ways they will try to maintain their failing fortunes.   This just in: The American public wants to take back some of the wealth that is being stolen from them.   Well that certainly is a reason to gun down a group of people. /s   A fascinating look into the Ayatollah Khamenei's financial empire.   That doesn't seem to be a lot of money for Bank of America. When we talk about tens of billions that would get the bank's attention.   The smog adds a multiplier effect. Smoking + smog = geometric increase in lung cancer cases.   There is no marketplace for Iranian oil at this time because of the embargo. They would take a lower price to get hard currency into their coffers.   But would Iran or even Iraq go along with OPEC when they are in desperate need of cash?   But OPEC no longer has a stranglehold on oil prices. OPEC could try to hold back their product from the marketplace but there is a real possibility their efforts would fail.   Just because you don't use your mod account doesn't make you any less of a mod. I think it would be better to own your mod position and your politics.   That is right when the Seminoles said it was OK the issue was settled. That is not true for NFL's Washington team or the American League's Cleveland team.  Those who demand political orthodoxy are not the "PC crowd" but the political right, who use litmus tests on a number of issues before you can join their inner sanctum.  I find it poor taste for an r/politics mod to diss progressives so cavalierly.    If you substitute a derogatory terms for African-Americans or Jews or Hispanics would you still said that. Non-Native people cannot decide for Native Americans what they feel is an insult and/or a demeaning term for a football team   As I've said several times the mods want to take the politics out of r/politics.   I personally am not a journalist, nor do I need to have a degree as one.  Now that your expertise has been established, please go sit in the corner with the mods. Please let those of us who know and love politics run our site.   Thanks, AdelleChattre for reaching out to Wonkette.com. This site was in the forefront of progressive political reporting on the internet. This means very little to the mods who probably were still in diapers when Wonkette was a must read.   For more analysis on other marijuana legalization efforts read [Thinkprogress](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/11/06/2898651/cities-voted-remove-penalties-marijuana-possession/)   For a more detailed analysis of this poll [see Thinkprogress.](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/06/2900771/obamacare-public-opinion-press/)   I"m sorry if it seems like I was singling you out. I was making a point to a large number of responses I had to that post both publicly and privately. I understand that you can still post, read and vote on r/politics after you unsubscribe. The act of unsubscribing says to the mods that they are winning by driving out the undesirable elements. By staying we say we will not be driven out by your arbitrary actions meant to drive away progressives.   Cutting back food stamp subsidies will certainly make this number go up. Thank you Republicans.   I understand why some want to unsubscribe, However, it is known fact those in power will never back down without a fight. When you say I can resubscibe you are saying you are willing to come back after some us do the hard work. I understand you don't want all this chatter invading your computer. Don't want to fight that is OK.Then just stay and cheer those of us who are willing. If we lose then unsubscribe. Don't give up the fight before the battle has begun.   It takes a whole subreddit. Stay and fight do not unsubscribe.    Happy cake day. You have a present from the mods. After the mods broke r/politics they promise they will fix it at some unspecified time in the future. Have a nice day.   We don't really need apologizes. We need a full reexamination of the changes. Why is it so hard to say they were wrong and scrap what they have done up until now. The mods now have our attention. Let's do this together and do it right.   Don't unsubscribe that is what those who are trying to break apart r/politics want. If we want to bring politics back to r/politics we have to stay and fight.   Have to second your post. I would also point out adding 10 ten new mods and then instituting new posting policies seven days later has the feel of a coup. Especially when the new mods were not involved with r/politics before being elevated to mod status.   Keep up the good work. There is no way we will allow the mods to take the politics out of r/politics.   Published in [Macromolecules 2013, 46 (15), pp. 6209](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma4011457)   Yes but drugs on the reservations are a major problem for a significant number of tribes. Many reservations are drug and alcohol free to follow in their ancestors way and forsake the White culture. The chances that a tribe would do this would legalize marijuana is very small. In fact if the national prohibition ends reservations would probably be one of the last places in the country where you could not smoke.   The idea that the mods of r/politics have no idea of the Daily Mail's political culture is a sign of your inexperience and political naivete.    Think what the reaction would have been five years ago?   You take on Snooves, who once tried to ban me for posting too frequently from the AP. I want to expand it to the current state of the mods.  Mods like GuitarFreak027 and avnerd have little or no interest in r/politics looking at their user histories. Yet these two mods got or retained full permissions on this site. Others like maxwellhill, anutensil, mrmajorly and Samuel_Gompers who used to have full mod status are relegated to secondary roles even though they are regular participants.  It is these actions along with the banned list that make it seem like there has been a coup. When we look at the political make up of the mods the site has seemed to take a severe turn to the right. This is not a left or progressive site put it does have a majority of users who are left of center.   The community didn't lose default status because we were too left but because the discussion too often was toxic. The way to improve the site is not to kick out those left of center but to moderate the tone of the community.  The mods have lost the trust of many us and we ask them to reconsider their decisions and restart. There is no shame in going back and redoing what has already been done. I don't see any other way for the mods to regain our trust.  Take a deep breathe and lets give it another try.   It is not a loophole but a recognition by the federal government that Native peoples are sovereign peoples living within the borders of the US. They follow our federal laws just like other states but they can make their own local laws. Even under these circumstances Native people populate the US military in greater proportions to their actual population than any other racial group in this country. So I don't see they are getting anything that they don't deserve or are owed.   Tribes have casinos, do not collect cigarette taxes, have their own justice system not because some state which was built on and around their lands gave them anything. Tribal rights are protected by treaties just like the ones the US has with most of the nations of the world. Understand Native peoples were here before there were states.  	187

 My boyfriend was always on reddit so I decided to get an account to see how pointless it was.  That didn't work out so well.   Mom -  "I'm disappointed in you."   A few weeks after my dad tried committing suicide, when I was about 9 years old, he looked at me and said "you're the reason I hate myself."   My mom and step dad were fighting and it was time for me and my older sister to go to sleep.

That would be the creepiest thing to watch and it wouldn't be be enjoyable, yet I kinda wanna Google it.   I feel kinda really sad   Wat    RIGHT!!!!   I got flashed by the picture before the words actually showed up   I was thinking the same thing   weird it doesn't say that for me, sorry   This is the second post       Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I just wanna write stories     	15
 Q: What do you call a cheap circumcision?  A: A rip off.  Only ever get groans of disgust lol   Took me 8 reads to realize there was nothing wrong with it. You rotten redditers    I read that as "and it was the highlight of my life"  I really need to read more carefully when I'm on reddit...    I recently hit that age where I'm doing it twice a week, aflush with cash, and confident in life and my assertions of right and wrong (lol let's see how long that lasts). Still living with my Parents (both of whom are undergoing serious midlife-crises). Life is good :)    *of Well good! I'd far prefer for abused people to grow up and become happy and productive members of society. Unfortunately for me, I'm stuck with my asshole of a cousin who, for some unfathomable reason, has decided she doesn't want to fit in with the demographic that you so eloquently pointed out exists. Imagine that.    But you're not *just* a cum bucket. You're a cum bucket filled with nerves who just said that it feels great.    *little boy walks in. Sees grown man laying on floor with pants around ankles urinating straight into the air. Little boy walks out*   Nearly every major pc game that has come out after 2014 is unplayable unless you have an $800+ computer. I mean, I can turn down the graphics and visual settings pretty dang far, but when you're playing with the same resolution as an ipod touch things are just a little bit ridiculous.    I know one abused girl. She is a huge asshole. She also happens to be my cousin and lives with me.  I dunno where you got your info but from personal experience abused people are jerks. Everyone always says "you don't know what she went through" but I mean c'mon, it was for like a year when she was 6. That's no excuse to be an ass.    Wait but you just said sex feels great. If you believe that it feels great, why are you not doing it?    Yes they are   I CAME IN LIKE A-   http://cdn.meme.am/instances/250x250/55671949.jpg  Laughed my ass off at this    Would you rather watch porn of your parents or with your parents?    Oh from chat roulette?    I'd have Miley Cyrus stop singing and start doing por-  Wait a second...    Oh you poor thing    That's true. You've got that going for you. Reddit loves you 3   He's dead Jim    I had to read this 3 times before I accepted the fact that it was real    He says where you WOULD put your finger. Not just where it's physically possible to put it.   	21

Would be cool to see how much money programs get from their conference and how much comes from big games like this    I'm in arts and sciences (iphy) and want to take a basic marketing and maybe a management course. I have an opportunity to work in pharmaceutical sales for a bit after school before graduate school.

For Colorado, Ski Booker. Shooting 37% with 2.3 turnovers a game. He has 99 FGA, the next highest on the team is Scott with 67 FGA. The only think Booker contributes is steals and assist.   edit- now he goes 7/14 for 20pts today. of course.       Went to doc two months ago after sleeping 8 hours in 3 days. He gave me 5mg ambien. Worked well as a half dose, some nights I needed the full 5mg. Just started my 3rd bottle, fell asleep at 5am, 5 hours after taking it. Sleept til 11am.  Then this time I took full 5mg at 12 am, a half at 1am, and at 2 am.

Game is Friday at 6pm in Boulder. Stubhub tickets are selling for $6.  Colorado is ranked in the top 30 nationally, predicted 6 seed for the NCAA tournament.   I recently found out Eldora used to have night skiing but haven't seen anything on why they no longer offer it. Below is a night trail map. I'm guessing it had to do with forest service, night traffic on the canyon, or not being profitable. I've night skied at Keystone and it was empty but  I figure night skiing would do better at Eldora since it's so close to Boulder.    http://www.coloradoskihistory.com/images/eldora_overview_1.jpg        Title says it all. Yes it is more basketball relevant but we're at the time where  other sports overlap. I wanted to post here to keep things a bit civil versus r/cfb and r/collegebasketball people yelling at Eachother.   Has the UNC scandal changed your view on players receiving payment?  Personally I would be for taking for away scholarships and paying players under $100k. I'm not in favor of more successful schools getting to pay more money, then they just keep buying more talent and competition is gone.       I just signed up for skicarpool.org and it's pretty active, is anyone signed up with something  better? I'm looking to help people carpool, everyone knows i70 could use a break       Since Colorado and Wazzu are the bottom two but unfortunately don't play each other, I'd like to open up a discussion of predictions if they did.   Colorado- 0-6 (2-7) key games- overtime loss to Cal and UCLA   Wazzu- 1-5 (2-7) key games- win at Utah, close games against Oregon and Cal  Edit- pretend Halliday is playing    Got my first eldora pass (college discounted) and have never been. I'm looking at driving up for opening weekend, is it worth it? I've done A-Basin when they have just a few runs open and enjoy it but don't find it to be worth the drive since you spend so much time in line.  Also, anyone that wants someone to ski with, I'm in Boulder with epic local and eldora passes             Looking at getting an eldora pass to go along with my epic local. I didnt get much time to drive i70 last year and want to get more days in so eldora is a huge appeal. It's $179 for the season pass, prices go up to $229 on Nov 4.   I don't know anyone who goes to eldora, anyone looking for someone to ski with?   Also anyone with epic local.       http://ev12.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetGroupList?groupCode=MB linkID=colorado shopperContext= caller= appCode=  Site crashed for a bit this morning, Arizona is almost sold out. Get tickets now!   http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics                      I will have the epic local college pass but because of my schedule I won't get out to summit as often as I'd like (enough for the pass to be worth the money). I'm also considering the Elodora college pass ($159) since it's closer to Boulder.    I've never been to Eldora and know it's smaller but the bus from Boulder is a great appeal. I saw it's added to the WP/Copper pass which will add to the crowds.   Would it be worth getting the pass for days that I can't make it to summit? Is the terrain/snow as bad as they say?          I searched the sub to see if its been asked and I didnt see anything so I will be another EMT B student asking a question.   Is it worth keeping your class books after completion and passing the registry exam for review or reference?       I'm currently an under grad finishing General Chemistry 2. I will be taking Organic 1 in the spring. I have looked around at general prerequisites for school and found a wide range from only general chemistry, to requiring biochemistry (some survey some full). Which level chemistry did you finish with and how limiting/excess was it when applying to programs?            Will take as low as $40 credit   I have a camera but it can't do night scenes very well.  I would love a picture of the flagstaff star with Venus (which is very bright the next few days) and maybe even the moon in the shot.  I'm sure any photographers reading this may think it could make a great shot. Maybe with CU or any other boulder landmarks as well.  Anyone willing to take the shot and post it?   I'm sure you get a lot of these questions but I'm looking for a good study guide for the EMT-B exam. I won't be taking it until this summer but there are way too many options to choose from.    just what title says, thanks    For any of those who have their name on their job shirts, do you use full name, first name last initial, or first initial last name? The latter seems more professional but patients would typically call you by first name which is easier to remember if it's right on your shirt.   tapped out started crashing for me a few hours ago. After I tap the continue page it will load for 5-10 sec then crash. I have tried reinstalling the app and turning my phone off/on. Anyone else experiencing this? Iphone 5/ios 7   I have a pair of 2012/13 liberty helixes. I bought them used and they had a demo binding on them (removed before I bought them). I was able to center mount them and rode them 3x before season end. I am considering remounting them to cab forward. I had salomon suspects for 5 years before this pair and had those center mounted as well. On the helix i was having difficulty staying afloat in the powder and initiating turns on groomers. I'm not sure if this is from not being used to the ski or if i should move my binding to cab forward.  so should i try moving them knowing that once i do they are stuck there for good, and how should they hold up with 3 binding mounts done?  i tried finding a ski gear subreddit and the best was wintergear with no activity, if this should be in a different subreddit i will happily move it.   Season 8 ep 1. Quinn says Barney wants to ride down the isle on a bear. The ring bear?  Caught my attention while watching today    I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Gilbert white memorial flood maker next to Boulder Creek at Broadway. I have been searching for good pictures of the marker with the flood waters, kind of like a snow stick at ski resorts. I have only found pictures with the marker when flood waters have receded. Does anyone know of any good ones?    I wish i was good with graphics but Im not. I would love to see something like this with the events of the boulder flood, maybe even extended the whole front range.    is there a way to change the default view back to month instead of week?  also, i find it annoying how "zoomed in" the times are, only showing a few hours before you need to scroll.          not seeing the game thread and cant find a steam, any help?   last year vail gave a college discount on the epic local bringing it down to ~$350.

I know this girl personally and her charity has really taken off recently. I know she would love some more support. Here is the description written by her--  Hi! My name is Emma Rose. I am a 17 year old Leukemia (ALL) patient. I was diagnosed with cancer in January, 2012. It has been a tough year, but I am finally feeling better. I am in the maintenance phase of my treatment. Even though this is the "easiest" part of my treatment, it still consists of daily oral chemo and almost monthly spinal taps until May 2014. Since my diagnosis, so many people have helped my family and me in many ways. Now, I want to do something to give back. I want to help other kids with cancer who are also being treated at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We collect comfort items the kids can use during their stay- especially pillow pets, soft blankets, fuzzy socks, iTune gift cards, ear buds, packs of gum, leggo kits, nail polish, glow sticks, and crayons. Our newest Wishlists are on Amazon. If interested in donating gifts to help the Kids at Children's WI, please go to Amazon, click on Wish Lists and then search for Emma Rose. We just completed a major donation drive called "Movie Night". Thanks to the generosity of our followers and WE Energies' donation of 100 copies of Honor Flight- The Movie, we were able to put together 100 movie tubs for the kids. Each tub contained several movies, popcorn, candy and other items for the children and their families. The tubs were given to the children on the HOT Unit, in MACC Clinic, in the BMT Clinic and at Ronald McDonald House. Since the children cannot go to the movie theater, I wanted to bring the movie theater experience to them. Thank you so much! Please make sure all donations are new and in their original packages. All mail and packages can be sent to Emma Rose, PO Box 485, Thiensville, WI 53092. Thank you so much for your generosity!  Emma Rose   r/snowboarding is legit, /r/skiing doesnt have enough park, lets get it      rewatch the first episode. Its even better with the knowledge after watching all other episodes. pick up things you missed, and find things more humorous                   I saw in a thread someone commenting that they thought every character would meet the mother before Ted. Well, they were right according to the CBS president. They all meet her at the wedding before Ted and he only meets her after a big chunk of the season is done. I believe they said before that he meets her on the train returning from the wedding                  Now I already expect to get down votes shoved up my ass for this thread but I dont care because my life doesnt revolve around reddit karma.  Before you downvote and click back without reading, read a bit of this.  Why do people hate the Miami Heat? The answer- they all jumped on the hate train.  1. Heat fans are bandwagon fans. Id like to argue that its cooler to hate the heat than like them. So by hating, you joined that band wagon. I became a Heat fan when they drafted Wade. I watched Wade a season ticket holder for Marquette. I never cared for the bucks because they never caught my interest. You dont have to be a fan of your local team, everyone has their reasons for liking a team. I was a fan before Lebron and the Big 3 yet everyone assumes Im a fan because of Lebron. Wade won Miami's first title in 2006. Before someone says "Jimmy Butler played for Marq, shouldnt you be a bulls fan? No. While I love to see how well he is doing, Wade is still my favorite Marq player. Not just because of skill, but how he is off the court. Read up on his divorce and life with his sons.  2. "Lebron is a traitor/sellout"- Cleveland didnt have a chance of a title in the near future so Lebron went somewhere he could win. So what? Every player in the NBA wants to win a title. Its a lifelong dream for professional athletes. If your a Cleveland fan who hates lebron, you should be hating the management for not building a better team before lebron left. I dont mean a team around lebron or a superstar team, just a better team.   3. The heat are a superstar team. So what? Part of basketball is trying to build a great team that will build a franchise. When you play pick up games you choose the best players first dont you? Do you all hate the Jordan era bulls?   4. Bosh is a dinosaur. I dont mind people saying this. Its true and the memes are funny. Thats no reason to hate a player though. There are plenty of uglier players.   5. Lebron is compared to Jordan. Thats the standerd for basketball, everyone is looking for the next jordan. Lebron has MVPs and Olympic Medals. He doesnt have the rings but look at his past. Cleveland had no chance. He made the finals his first year with the heat, won the finals the second year, had a 27 game winning streak the 3rd year. He is a damn good player. He is not Jordan. Having him compared to jordan is not a reason to hate him. NBA analyst will always compare great players to Jordan. Kobe gets compared. I dont hate Kobe for that or for being a great player. I dislike him because he has a record for being a selfish asshole who was accused of rape.... (Tosh.0 anyone?)  I'm not saying theres no reason to hate the Heat. Im just saying you should have your reasons and be able to back them up. My reasons listed arent perfect but they are a start. There are reasons to hate Miami, but be able to back yourself up so you arent just another person riding the hate train.                 What if Rose has not returned because the NBA secretly made him wait until the Bulls v Heat series. Im not saying this is true or possible, just a thought that sort of fits.  1. Heat beat bulls for a couple games, but not by a lot.  2. Rose returns in game 3 or 4 3. Refs influence game or everything just seems to go against Miami 4. Rose and the Bulls take the next games needed to win the series 5. Bulls Heat rivalry heats up 6. Lebron leaves Miami  7. 8.  9. NBA Profit?? $$$               Be great if someone could turn the hand into a downvote  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEcpJLRqZ-g   Anyone have any links for streaming CU vs Oregon St?

       Is your friend on Reddit? You mentioned it was inspired by depression, which is the main reason I like it; I have clinical depression, too.

 I love your hair! And you have a gorgeous figure as well!   Hey there! I actually designed the whole thing on graph paper and made a paper version of it before I started. I used the paper as templates for the design and cut the scrap leather. I used a stitching awl for all of the white stitches. The lace work was done with suede strapping and a leather hole punch. I measured off all the holes I made. When I attached the bottom I used a super heavy weight leather and a softer leather over it. I had one side of the stitches done up the tube part and I flipped it inside out when I finished the stitches on the bottom.

 That's the point. They treat others how they would like to be treated. #TrueHeros   Found the issue! CPU-Z is saying the Multiplier keeps jumping from x16.0, all the way down to x4.0 - which is bottlenecking the GPU, now what's causing the CPU Multiplier to drop?  Edit: 'Underclocking' the CPU seems to of solved the issue. Hm. Could it be PSU related I wonder?   I've looked at any recently installed programs and removed them all - Issue persists. :(   Hmm. My long guess is that the GPU 'crashing' aka no signal caused by GTA has upset something in the windows files, as I've had to force the computer to shut down, due to having no display.  Hmm. I'll try booting windows disk and checking for any issues. Thanks for the brainwave.  Edit: No issues found   Hmmm. Nothing installed recently, I'm also running windows 7 in Aero mode, and have turned off all unnecessary processes and services. =o   Any game, any settings - Issue persists :(   That's what I was thinking, but then I remembered that it was working fine a few days ago... With the same CPU, so there has to be an issue somewhere. :\   **Edit: FIXED. I don't know exactly how this resolves it, but I noticed the CPU temps going high, and the CPU multiplier bouncing all over the place, so I 'underclocked' the CPU to x12 instead of x16, and it seems to of solved the issue. I'm not sure how this fixes it... but It did =o**  [THE ISSUE (Reddit didn't wanna link)](https://imgur.com/JOHznwS)  Okay, hey guys, so I'm having an issue with my GTX 980, as are some others, and I just can't figure it out. It was working flawlessly a few days ago. #Sadface  This has happened before, I just switched the power cables to the ones provided with the GPU, and it was solved. But now it's back.   As you can see, there are multiple drops that keep reoccurring every X seconds. It happens in every game on any settings.  **** **Things I've tried so far:**  * Set Nvidia power settings to performance  * Set windows to performance  * Set pre-rendered frames to 3  * Turned off Vsync and put everything to low (still happens)  * Ran Microsoft Troubleshooter.... hah just kidding.  * Ran it at different resolutions  * Looked for Driver updates (even though it was working fine on the same update before)  * Running on Win 7 Aero  * Shut off services and processes that are not needed  * Full defrag on all hard drives (except SSD)  * Checked over wires, nothings lose  * Ran Windows 7 Disk searched for errors - none  * Removed recently installed programs  **** **Computer Information:**  [SPECCY LINK](https://imgur.com/DIUpnQ4)  [CPU LINK](https://imgur.com/p0lP0Y9)  **** Extra note : Problem seemed to have started when the GPU crashed a few times on GTA (the system kept running, the GPU was turned off though, no signal.) I'll post the solution when I figure out what's up, for anyone else having this issue. **** *P.s. Razer Krappen 7.1s have ~~great~~ terrible audio quality. Don't buy.

 Yes, this is it! Thank you so much! I've been searching for this forever!   Sorry, not those either.   Hmm... That's not it, and I don't think either of those bands would play it. Thanks though! Found some nice new music!   I've only heard the song I'm looking for twice. Both times it was played on a radio station that plays bands like: AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and other bands, mostly from the 70's and 80's. I think it has piano, drums, bass, vocals and flute for most of it. Just one man is singing. I can't remember any of the lyrics to it. Please let me know if there is anything else that would help!   Edit: It's not a rock song at all. It sounds like it should be on an easy listening station or something like that  Edit 2: I took a look at some more Jethro Tull songs and the one I'm looking for sounds a lot like Jethro Tull's [Serenade To A Cuckoo cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh4GZJlQCfY) except with a singer and more upbeat.

If hypocrisy were illegal, think of all the politicians that would have to go to jail.  It's up to Americans to not re-elect the hypocrites.  Don't get me wrong, I don't condone what Spitzer did and I'm not saying that it wasn't hypocritical of him, but it is a sex "scandal."    It looks like it might be Cupertino, CA in the lower left corner of the image.   I think they've been hiding him in one of those super-secret-torture prisons.   At least it wasn't a sperm whale.

Sadly, it's a punch line in the gut :(   No real oversight though, just a facade of oversight - just as in everything run by BushCo.   Poor Bush, he had a little tantrum on the teevee this AM saying how the terrists win if big business has to follow the rule of law.  Bush is a joke.   Fuck Bush.

We didn't hear things like this leading up to the Iraq war either.     Halliburton   ...and on the 8th day, he created war.  War without end aaaAAAAAaaaAAaaAAamen.   Still no word from Vitter or Craig...   I am sure Halliburton is the only company big enough to pull off a project that big.   Because republicans are held to a more lenient standard.  Why no impeachment call for Vitter or Craig or any other of the many many corrupt republicans?   WoooHooooo!!!!   Does this mean we have to learn kung-fu?   Vitter...   I wonder if Fox News will put an 'R' next to his name.   Or Cheney would nominate himself as VP...   again.   You are letting him off too easy.   Rove deserves to be treated as he treats others.  That is maybe just a taste of what he got.   I guess just wishful thinking.   :0===I   Did the dems even get off the bench yet?  Are they dressed for the game?   Last term Lieberman.

          For me it's Rich Piana (or as I call him, Richy Poo).   I'm doing this to play The Witcher 2 in anticipation of The Witcher 3.      There's a lot of hype for The Witcher 3, so I was wondering if it's worth playing The Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360. (I don't have a powerful PC, so I can't play the original Witcher.)   I feel very guilty about accidentally killing my dog (I was playing with him near the top of the stairs, and he fell down to the basement, breaking his back, so I had to put him down), so I am going to start fasting to punish myself. I am not sure how long I should fast. I am thinking 90 days. Is this appropriate, or should it be shorter or longer? (I'm not overweight or anything, so there isn't any weight that needs to be lost.)    And why were you admitted?  three times for me  1. mania  2. anorexia  3. catatonia    The Witcher 3 looks like an interesting game, so I was wondering if I have to play the previous games. I have an Xbox 360 and an Xbox One, so I have the ability to play the second and third game. I see that the first game is only available on PC, so as my PC isn't powerful enough to game on, I am unable to play the original game. Am I OK with only playing the third game, or should I also play the second?         I ended my last ketogenic cut at 106 lbs (from 205 lbs), which led me to a psych ward. I then gained 44 lbs eating whatever I wanted and not exercising. I have since lost 10 lbs after re-starting keto. My question is: when do I stop cutting so I don't end up in the same place again? The bodyfat calculator put me at around 19% bodyfat. Due to my last extreme cut, I have really no muscle whatsoever. I'm pretty sure I would be considered skinnyfat right now as I have a slight belly and man boobs. Indeed I don't want to bulk quite yet. Should I cut to 120 lbs?    I'm going to be near a Trader Joe's tomorrow, so I was wondering what to keep my eye out for.   I'm undergoing a series of ECT treatments (on #9) for catatonia. Does anyone here have experience with ECT?   I started keto last February at 206 lbs and ended at in October at 106 lbs, which led me to a psych ward, in which I had to go back to carbs and gained 44 lbs. Now when I say I want to go back to a ketogenic diet, they dismiss it as "the eating disorder talking." How do I convince them that keto is a legitimate diet?    [Here's the bodybuilding.com page if you don't know what it is.](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/gaspari-nutrition/superpump-30.html)  I took two scoops of it and now I feel really bloated.    I started cutting in early February of this year at 205 (obese) and am now 138. I have been on a ketogenic diet throughout the cut. I'm 17, male, and 5'7". I heard that after a long cut you're supposed to slowly add back calories (reverse diet). How do I go about this? How many calories do I add per week? I have been cutting on 1,400 calories.   I have cut down from 205 (obese) from February of this year to 138. The body fat calculator at my gym says that I am around 12% bodyfat. I am male, 17, and 5'7". I didn't start tracking calories until 71 days ago, so I can't say what my calories were before I started tracking, but as of 71 days ago I have kept my calories at or below 1,400. Is it necessary to reverse diet to maintenance calories (adding a set amount of calories each week until maintenance is achieved)? If so, how would I go about this? How many calories would I add per week?    I've been using a cheap food scale that lately has become very unreliable. I want to be able to track my macros accurately, so I would like to buy one I can rely on.   I started running in intervals a few days ago on a track, walking on the curves and running on the straight part, this lasting about an hour. I have since experienced outer ankle pain in both feet. I am male, 17, 140 lbs, 5'7", and am running in Kinvara 5's. I have just started running, so I am wondering if this is typical beginner's running pain or if I'm doing something wrong.    I know that eating too much protein in a day will kick you out of ketosis, but what if you eat like 80 grams of protein in one sitting (but staying below the protein limit for the day)? Will eating a lot of protein in a short period of time kick you out of ketosis?      I am cutting on 1,400 calories (around 105 protein, 101 fat and less than 20 carbs). I am 17 years old, male, 5'7", 152 lbs, 18.4% bodyfat. I'm running ICF 5x5.    Right now I'm taking a cheap fish oil which has 300 mg of EPA and DHA combined per capsule. I take 6 capsules a day. Is this a good amount to take?      I'm 17 years old and I'm only 5'7". Am I doomed to a life of a manlet, or am I tall enough to not worry about this?   I was thinking about buying the Merrell Trail Glove 2. Is this a bad idea for someone beginning to run? This shoe appeals to me because it could double as a shoe for lifting and running. Should I instead get a dedicated lifting shoe and a more traditional running shoe like [this](http://www.adidas.com/us/product/mens-running-cc-rocket-boost-shoes/IEU81?cid=D66285 breadcrumb=1z13071Z1z11zrfZsvZu2Z1z13y9l)?      For me it was Californication.               Arm hair on one of the Women is disgusting, and to be perfectly honest it offends me. Why do the Women refuse the shaving?

When I press the power button, a green light (which usually flashes once when it is turned on) flashes 3 times, stops for a few seconds, then flashes 3 times again and repeats the process indefinitely. No picture or audio. I unplugged it for about an hour and plugged it back it with no change.   I have a Toshiba 46SL417U LED TV.

I also use the elliptical and bike. I'm not a very big runner.   I'm running a full body program, which means I do squats and deadlifts on the same day. I like to squat in adipowers and deadlift in chucks. I also do cardio post-workout, for which I use running shoes. Would it be considered weird to bring all 3 of these shoes to the gym?      For me it's squatting ass to grass while most everyone else is doing parallel/above parallel. I always feel like going up in their face and shouting, "ASS TO GRASS, BUDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!"                              Or are they more for competition/maxing out? Also, are they for an advanced lifter, or are they ok for all experience levels?   the Walk of Shame?         With keto I find it very easy to fast for long periods of time without getting hungry. What is the maximum amount of time one should fast?

Is this quality beta alanine? Do you recommend something else?               My right pec is out of control. It is bouncing randomly without my consent. Why.         I like to drink Monster Zero Ultra. It has 2 grams of erythritol per can (no other carbs). Is this ok?               Mine is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Also, how often do you eat Quest bars? Do they make you stall?         I want to really care about the characters like I did in A Song of Ice and Fire.         On a cold Friday afternoon, I had come home from school. I had been thinking of the gym all day. I was hungry, didn't have any lunch. In fact, I didn't eat because I spent the money. For the past month I was saving up for something. Something special which I bought at GNC. I was surprised they didn't ask for ID; I was pretty sure the cashier noticed how nervous I was. Anyways, my mom asked my how my day was when I got home, but I ignored her. I have more important things to do. I run to the bathroom and unpack my bag. In my school bag is a white plastic bag from GNC. I open the bag, first removing the receipt and flushing it down the toilet to get rid of the evidence. My heart was racing now. I unpack the creatine monster from the bag.  I wonder what people will be asking me when they see that I will be 50lbs heavier. Should I say I was just eating a lot? I remove the label from the tub and tear it into a thousand small pieces. I flush that down the toilet, too. It is time now. I run up to my room when my mom ask me what I am holding. I panic, sweat drips down my forehead and my teeth chatter. "Mom, it's just for a school project". "What project?" "I don't know mom I just started it!". A tear runs down my cheek. I run upstairs and open the creatine, scooping upservings into a clear water bottle. What have I gotten myself into? I fill it with water and drink it. There is no turning back now. The creatine monster is inside me now, it will control me. What should I do if I die? I cant let my family know about this.  I open the creatine tub and throw it all out the window; a white cloud of mysterious dust sparkles into the wind so graciously. I feel the substance taking control of me; I am now the monster. I walk downstairs, its time to work out; time to get big. Now I worry, I don't want to get too big; people will think I use steroids. I do use steroids. No I don't. Creatine. All I see is the weights now, I am almost downstairs when I hear "Do you want a cookie I just baked?" I know I do not have time for this shit now. "No mom I do not want a fucking cookie." I walk in the basement and drop to my knees before the weights, tears running down my cheeks. I turn to the right and look at myself in the mirror. Oh god, what have I done?   I call Quentyn my Quenty Bear. Victarion is my Vikkey Bunny. Strong Belwas is Belly Boo Boo.    12 Thai Curry traditional wings with 2 containers of blue cheese   When my Quenty Bear died. :'(      No, not your name, not your job, not your hobbies, not your personality. Really, who are you?      Are you getting the regular version, Lannister version, Targaryen version, Stark version, or Amazon limited edition dragon statue version?      (Don't say "Get a bigger size." That's not the problem. They fit perfectly.) I bought a pair of Under Armour ["Core"](http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13050949) compression shorts, and after less than 3 months of wear, a hole appeared at the leg seam. Both leg seams were falling apart.  I'm thinking of buying a new pair of compression shorts. How do I prevent them from breaking down? Is there a certain way of washing them? Should I get a different brand/model?            Best Buy is offering Lannister, Stark and Targaryen slipcovers for the season 3 blu-rays. I already have the Lannister slipcover from season 2. Should I get the Stark, Targaryen, or both?   I heard somewhere that Cersei killed Tommen. I read the last part of ADWD anticipating this scene.    For me it was Quentyn Martell. I threw my Kindle across my bedroom when I read his death scene. I just sat in my bed crying, wishing that it wasn't true, that my Quenty Bear wasn't dead. It threw me into a deep depression for months, mourning the loss of the best character in ASOIAF.      I noticed DLC is still being released even after the Game of the Year Edition came out. I was going to get the GOTY edition, but not if an edition will all the DLC will come out in a few months.                     It has been written.          Same as beer pong but you fill the cups (same size as beer pong) completely full with Everclear. Has to be pure Everclear, 190 proof, no mixing it with juice, you have to chug it all down with no breaks, and no chaser.         Is so, why were you depressed?            Is this some sort of inside joke?      there's nothing wrong with fapping. it's completely natural. grow up.   How long is a small penis? How long is an average penis? How long is a large penis? Also, do you care about penis size?   I just started keto a week ago, and I have no stamina to do cardio. I am usually able to use the elliptical for 1-2 hours, but in the past week I can only do it for a few minutes. I still have enough energy to lift as much as I've been doing pre-keto, though. Is this just a symptom of the induction phase? If so, how long will it last?    They have like 25 grams of carbs...how is that keto-friendly?   Tired of bacon and eggs everyday. What do you eat for breakfast?     	132
 Other than the cutscenes stuttering the game is ace.   Yeah Queens Wrath was a joke, same content just re-skined pink. Same story missions re-purposed... The Queen requests kills, so go do this completely unrelated story mission. Makes no sense Bungie.  Haven't even tried Iron Banner, not even going to bother... The only thing that made me even remotely interested in the event was that gear and lvl actually matter... Seeing as thats not the case, I really dont care enough to try it.   I was watching your movements to see if they match on screen and it's surprisingly accurate.   Going to try this out tonight.   The Hulk was French?   Except when you try to use the sprint so you can slide... and it doesnt work... you just walk forwards and crouch like a dumb arse.  Thats why this cooldown annoys me.   Tell me about it, the amount of times I've gone to sprint and slide in for a melee kill only to wind up walking forward and crouching...

Guess I won't be doing that seeing as we're now down to 4 hours till release and still no pre load available.

Special ammo sould be like heavy, limited / random spawns and you lose it if you die.  It won't stop the abuse but it'll cut it down a bit.    I doubt the tradition let alone knowledge of Halloween would have survived hundreds of years after the collapse of human civilization...  But hey, I could be wrong.   All the time, same with the PS Store just loading a blue screen with O in the bottom corner.   1.5 Million non-biodegradable balloons released.  Because fuck nature for a short spectacle right?   Destiny, your character, the events in the game... It's all a Vex simulation...  The Grimoire cards for the Vex detail how the VEX are running simulations of reality to better understand and predict human behavior in order to preempt our actions.   One of the cards calls them the Architects.  While playing the game and you die, if you look in the top right you can sometimes see your cause of death as "The Architects"  Meaning you are indeed inside the Vex simulation and your life was part of the simulation where you failed.  You come back to life because they reload the simulation /  it cuts to another simulation to see what the outcome could have been.  Seeing as the Vex operate out of space and time for all we know everything including your initial resurrection has not happened yet or may never happen... It's just a simulation of one possible outcome.  TL;DR, You're in the matrix.    The Ghostless Guardians, they know whats really happening in the grand scheme of things. They're following you, waiting for the right time to bring you into the fold... to bring the Traveler down.  *dun dun dun*  Nah, I have no idea haha.   Because Sharknado had an estimated budge of: $1,000,000.  Meanwhile Dredd has the estimated budget of: $50,000,000.  So why not make a second Sharknado, or 50 for the same price as a "big budget" flick that people want to see? Even if it is only to say they've seen it or like it ironically...         Think about it, he looks the same, acts the same and he disappears then reappears like magic always with something new to sell...same as Merchant.  Also thanks to Las Plagas he's able to live for centuries, unfortunately for  Xur though Las Plagas has left him all Cthulhu faced.  Thoughts? Complaints? Agreements?   So as expected there's a few already a few up on ebay at the low low price between $400 to $500+  So if there's anyone out there that desperate for one... I say wait haha.         So I got around to watching [The dark backward](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101660/) last night and am now looking for similar movies that have a grimy, bleak feeling too it.  The only other movies I can think of that compare are   [Bad Boy Bubby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106341/?ref_=nv_sr_1)  and  [Gummo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)   They're intriguing in a weird sort of way, so pass me any other movies you may know in the same vein as above!                              After re-watching the Pokemon series Se01-Ep09 I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Universe itself.  In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.  Then they show the Pokemon battle simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.  So my theory is that in the Pokemon universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games as a Pokemon trainer simulator based on their research and their battle simulator. They released it as a training simulator to help up and coming trainers learn about pokemon etc.   This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team. such as:  * "I'm the game designer!"  * "I wrote the story!"  * "I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"  * "Me? I'm the programmer!".  None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon universe itself.  Or something...  *EDIT*:   The games have some semblance to the real Pokemon world with the characters and locations etc. It also makes sense to add Team Rocket and other real world events to show the dangers and characters you'd meet in each region.  All the while telling a game story thats unrelated to the real world.

Each image has a description, tap the "i" in the bottom right.   Images are high res and can zoom in with minimal loss of quality, a few would make good lock screens /backgrounds.  Not sure if it's on the us store, if it is check it out.         Howdy all,    Recently back in Melbourne after backpacking around Murica for a couple of months, I've scored a job doing outbound cold calling for funeral insurance and needless to say it bites the big one haha.  I have 6 of years experience with Telcos, customer service, tech support, provisioning and more.   Sooooo anyone here work in any call centers that know of any positions available, possibly pass on my cv?  I've been on seek and Gumtree religiously the last couple of weeks and had no luck so I figured why not see if anyone here can help me get a foot in the door.   Thanks in advance if anyone can help.   Howdy all, I was recently over in NZ and a friend gave me a PSN card as a going away gift... But seeing as my account is an AUS account I have no use for it..  So I pretty much have a free $30 NZ PSN credit voucher available to give away.  If you have a NZ account and want this credit all you have to do is simply guess the  digit/letter where the "*"is in the code and it's yours!  "*"MQD - D6N9 - GB4A  Best of luck and enjoy   UPDATE: Code has been redeemed buy u/adelope, congratulations!   My vita has been stuck on NAT3 since I got the thing and can't play anything online.  I've already tried every option regarding port forwarding for the specific games and PSN itself, I've also set a static ip for the vita.   I was looking through the firewall settings on the Thomson tg782t router and noticed some options for dmz but everything I've tried doesn't seem to work and I lost all Internet connectivity on all devices... which was resolved once I deleted the settings.   So is there anyone out there that has the same router and knows enough to set up dmz for a specific ip without breaking the entire network itself?   Or should I just give up and buy an actual good router instead?         Howdy all, I've been playing on and off for a year or so, but never put in any real time or effort... I want to change that haha.  I'll be moving back to Melbourne within the next week odd and was wondering if anyone on here either plays the ol' blues harp and is willing to teach a beginner a few things. Or if anyone knows of any decent priced places that provide harmonica lessons?   I did have a quick look online but I'm not sure where to start or who/where would be good.   Any advice is appreciated.   Cheers   Morning all! Just arrived in your fine city 30 odd minutes ago, have nothing planned for the day so thought I'd try to annoy fellow redditors.  If anyone isn't doing anything later today feel free to hit me up, we can go grab a beer or something. I'll be chilling around central park mostly.  Oh and this city is massive by the way, beyond my expectations haha.   We get it, Microsoft has changed their drm and online policies.   Stop posting it as new news when it's been posted every damn 5 seconds for the last hour.   Hey all, what's there to do and see over here while visiting for a few weeks?   I also saw a thread a while back for the global meet up but the was no follow up/confirmation on the location, any updates on that?   So who wants to help arrange the (first?) Palmy global meet -up? If no one, I can do it myself haha.   It's as easy as confirming how many people are going to show then booking a venue!  So who's interested? Suggestions and ideas?   I know palmy is small an all, but surely there must be redditers out there to keep this sub active?         It arrived at my local store today so I caved in and bought it... I know I could have imported it bla bla bla   All i'll say is, it better be good since all I've heard the last couple of months is constant praise and adoration from everyone and their dogs...   Though I have a feeling I'm going to be severely underwhelmed.  Either way I will be back to give my impression of the game... positive or negative.   Afternoon all,   Sorry for the slow update regarding this... but ya'll know how it is. The event will be held at [Dash Paintball](http://www.dashpaintball.com.au/front1.html)  Right now Im looking to collect the names and numbers of all that will be attending so I can book in the preferred date and arrange the transport.  So if you are interested throw me a message with your name, number and preferred date for the event. (I will be going through the old thread and messaging those who said they were interested for confirmation as well.)  I look forward to seeing how many are still interested, hopefully enough to make two teams for a days worth of paintballing awesomeness!  [In case you missed it, here is the original thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/13cj78/rperth_paintball_meet_up/)   Sooo... I hear the world is going to end this coming friday? Something about a Mayan calendar prediction?  *shrugs* Either way, its a good excuse as any to have a pool party!  So in saying that, If no one has plans for the coming apocalypse why not spend it drinking MaiTais, listening to some music while relaxing in or beside a pool? There may even be a BBQ!  I live central east perth, most know that already but for those that do not, throw me a PM for more details / address etc.  Oh and limited drinks will be supplied but I recommended BYO just incase.         Anyone else notice this? She is completely irrational and unpredictable, her actions towards the Governor have little to no justification or motivation other than she gets a bad vibe from him... And I mean Rick has treated her worse than the Gov ever did... with her personality she wouldn't let that slide, but this fact will be completely ignored for the sake of the story progressing.   Hell I wouldn't have her around my group incase someone accidentally gave her a wrong look, shed prob off them then disappear into the woods.  At least in the comic she had a damn good reason for doing what she did. In the show... she's a paranoid mute clusterfuck with a sword... So far tv Michonne has been a disappointment, other than being fan service for sword zombie kills she's near useless.   Sooo it's me again haha.   I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!) I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8   It will of course be held on a weekend, the date is open and likely not to be till after christmas / new years as most people will have their calendar full at this time of the year.  I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.   If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)   The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself, usually between $30 to $70+ depending on the amount of paintballs you require.   I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/  Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?   And for the alcoholics among us, I will try to arrange post drinks back in the city somewhere (most likely at Moon   Sixpence) where we can get drunk and regale on the events of the day.   I would really like to make this into a proper event, make a day out of it, the winning team will even get a Trophy!  Thoughts? Good idea, bad idea?   Howdy all!  Hope everyone is taking advantage of this amazing weather and is getting out and about, not locking themselves indoors on Reddit like myself.  I'm bored and have nothing to do, so it's either loiter around the in city, head to a beach, stay at home or Go Carting!  Anyone interested in coming along? I guess 3-4 people would make it more interesting.   The only place I know of is in Belmont: http://www.kartworldbelmont.com.au/ (8 Cowcher Place Belmont WA 6104)  If interested let me know.  *EDIT* For those interested we'll get this started in about an hour. 1:30pm So anyone who wants to tag along simply show up at Kartworld around that time.  We of course wont be able to race straight away and will be waiting in the queue so there will be plenty of time for any late comers to slip in.  *Double Edit* Those who are responsable adults can get there easily with cars, those like me using public transport it will take roughly 40 mins from the city centre and a bit of a walk... just an FYI    Sooo I caved and decided to buy the retail version rather than digital and I tell you what, I am happy I did.. at least now I can return it...  First of all it doesnt require an online pass so this is a major plus for those who may want to share/trade the game with friends.  Now onto my first experience with the online side of the game... I'm yet to be able join a game past the loading screen. In essence the exact same issues that plagued Resistance: Burning Skies online multiplayer are still present.  The game goes to join, shows matched players and then begins to load... aaaaand then booted back to the main menu, I have repeated this time and time again only to have the same thing, this is present regardless of the game type I choose.(I have rebooted the Vita, double checked my network/router setting and everything is perfect)  So either the servers are at capacity at the moment or the game really is a simple reskin of R:BS, multiplayer issues and all.  In saying that, I'm willing to wait a week incase a patch is released or it is simply the servers being overloaded.  Am I the only one experiencing this issue?   (Side note: My connection is more than adequate for playing online, especially for handheld gaming, I am also on NAT2 on my Vita yet I am unable to join a single game... those familiar with trying to join a game in Burning skies both pre and post patch will know what I mean.)   Yeah you, in the tank....  Just finished watching Se1Ep1: Days gone by again, so damn good. Its amazing to see how the show has changed, in pace, characters and their development, hell even the walkers have changed from being hinted as retaining some of their former self (the walker girl at the start picking up her stuffed toy, the wife trying to open the door) to being shown as mindelss drones.  that's it, just stopping by to see if we can get some discussion going on for probably the best pilot episode for any show ive ever seen. XD   Ladies and gentlemen, (and gingers)  The night has arrived, we'll kick things off from 6ish onwards. I've decided not to decorate the place, too much effort haha.  There will be drinks and snacks / food, but feel free to bring your own if you wish. Also movies, bring any you wish to share, or a hard driveif you just want to show up to pillage other peoples haha.  Seeing as it is still a halloween / horror themed night, dressing up will be encouraged,  but I have a feeling many people will not.   So im watching it for the first time as I type this and my god, Christian Bale, the man commits to every role he takes on doesn't he. He was near unrecognizable at first, how on earth did he lose so much weight, just skin and bones...  Oh and the movies good so far, not sure why I waited this long to watch it.   The night of Friday the 2nd of November has been decided upon as the night for the movie night. The night will start from say... 6-7pm and go for as long as people are willing to stay.  Bring movies, bring food, bring drinks, or simply just bri g yourself.  To those still interested either post here or PM me and I will reply with the address etc.  Also, will people be making an effort to dress up? No pressure, not expecting anyone to.   Ladies and Gentlemen,   I present to you a proposition of sorts.  I have been over in Melbourne the last few weeks and will be back in mid next week, as such I would like to arrange a Reddit movie night!  On the 26th of October or the 2nd Of November I would like to host a Horror movie marathon in honour of the night that is all Hallows Eve. (or the 31st if enough Halloween purists are out there)  - Location: East Perth, Central City at my place. Enough for 6 people on couches, plus more on various seats. - Dress code: Casual but dressing up is encouraged. - Drinks: Will be supplied, beer that is, possibly a ghoulish punch of whatever I find to mix at the time. (Or you can hit one of the three bottle store nearby)  Movie selection will be strictly horror, or any film that induces fear... (Yes Deaditor that includes Spice Girls.)  This will only go ahead if I know for certain enough people will show up. So I know how much effort or if any effort to put into making this  happen. (decorations etc)  So what say you? If interested let me know and I'll pass on more details.         Deaditor and I are out and about at Fibber McGees in Leederville, if anyone out there is bored and feel like a few cold drinks on this fantastic afternoon. The more the merrier as they say.  If you show up, we're out back, just look for the odd ones out from the footy fans.         So I'm on my way to work and theyre setting up some thing for qutting smoking, seems to be a good 10 - 15 race cars. Does anyone else find it amusing that they would try to help people quit by using cars to pump out noxious fumes?  Its like *here, quit smoking and breath this in instead*  Thats all, if anyone is in the city during the day have a look.   Howdy again all,  Since my last attempt at a movie night failed miserably, thought I'd try again this weekend.  Aaaaaand it also turns out this Friday is Friday the 13th, if no one has any plans(curse you folks who know of the dress up parties) I propose a horror movie marathon! Same details as before, location is central east perth, 2 couchs that should seat about 6, bottle store across the road, bring your own snacks (though pizza being delivered is a very likely possibility)  Basically looking to have a few people over, drink and watch bad movies till he early hours. Bonus points for keeping the neighbours awake as well.  If interested send me a message, oh and if not enough people show interest I'll call it off and also stop asking haha. (hoping for at least 3 to 4 people to make it entertaining)   Howdy all,   I know this may be late notice but anyone up or a movie night tonight?  I have no plans and don't feel like going anywhere... so I thought I'd try to drag you guys here XD  the movie night will be at my place over in east perth, central city so its easy to get to.  I have 2 couchs so could seat 6 or so people.(they fold out to beds if required) Bottle store across the road for any alcoholics that need their medicine XD  I have quite a selection of movies ranging from classics to downright abominations....  If interested shoot me a message, I only ask that you bring snacks and any movies you might want to watch, oh and that your not a troublemaker of course. (also, I heard there was a snes at notsosillynorwegians movie night? Well I don't have one, only a ps3... but if anyone wants bring one, by all means)  On that note, I look forward to hearing how many/if any are interested, can reschedule for next week if need be.   *Edit* so this has be rescheduled for next weekend. If still interested send me a message and ill get back to you with the address etc.             So a new cheat has been found for Unit 13,  while in a mission press:  up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, X, O.  It's a variation of the Konami code and it changes the screen filter i.e: lowers the resolution so it looks like doom, inverts the colours, makes it look like ink drawn on white paper etc.... basically keep putting it in to change the look of the game, there's a good 5 or 6 variations.  Also, anyone know how to get the dancing and other hidden trophy?   Sooo, has anyone else noticed there's pretty much nothing coming out until mid/late may? Guess I'll have to replay my current games.   Hi Perth Redditers!  Im not sure if you can help, and im sure you get quite a few of these posts on here... but I am in dire straights at the moment and desperately looking for work. So I thought I'd try all avenues, cant hurt right? I've already done the usual, seek, Gumtree, Hays etc to no avail...   So a bit about myself, im 26, from NZ although I have been in Melbourne for about 5 years or so. All my previous work experience has been call centre based, fully trained, cert 3 in telecomunications,  cert in QA, training in conflict / dispute management.  Each position was either Customer Service or Technical support / helpdesk roles. I have a very professional phone manner, excellent time management skills and high attention to details, proficient in many systems.   Sooooo, if anyone knows of anything along those lines that may not be found in the usual channels to job seekers, as ya know, its often who you know, not what you know.  Or if anyone knows of any positions available doing absolutely anything ill take it... washing Cars? ill take it. laying bricks, ill take it. handing out flyers, ill take it.   As long as its not illegal im willing to do it.  Again not expecting much, but its worth a try right? Thanks for the time anyone out there may have put in just reading this... even bigger thanks and even a beer for anyone who can help out.     	110
 Two brothers peered out of their house window into an all-consuming darkness, darkness capable of hiding any truth. Yet the darkness was easily and abruptly interrupted by a speeding car's oncoming headlights. The brothers saw the car drop off an object, a being... something, into the darkness. It was quite an odd event. What followed was the distinct sound of a rattling bell. The brothers who had recently lost their dog of eleven years were quite intrigued. The two boys remember no sound better than the rattling bell on their dogs collar. The younger brother spoke in a hopeful yet ecstatic tone, "I think that was a dog!" he claimed. The older brother, Mike, quickly let a dream transform into reality. He foolishly affirmed that he and his brother had just come across a sign from God. Mike claimed, "God wants us to get Jake back," (Jake was the name of the brother's late dog). They walked along the road, whistling their mouths and clapping their knees. They were noisy but driven by the potential of a new companion. The brothers found it incomprehensible that locating a dog they had just seen would prove so challenging. They went at it for several minutes leaving loud echoes in the streets. Then they came along a wooded area adjacent to the road. They heard a familiar sound... a bell ringing. Although eerie, the brothers uncontrollably had a smile thrust upon their faces. The smiles however wouldn't last; the brothers were instantaneously thrown to the ground, yet the force doing the throwing was not that of a dog. The brothers were thrown to the ground by a mysterious man, a man as ominous as the darkness that swallowed them. The man held a face of pure evil and power, a face reminiscent to that of the Joker. This was unsettling for the younger brother, who was an avid supporter of the Batman franchise. The evil face proceeded to murder the two brothers with ease. He sliced their throats with a sharp blade and smirked at their inability to scream. The brothers suffocated on their own warm blood, as it filled their weak lungs. The evil faced man stood up and skipped away in joy, ringing musical bells in his left hand. He laughed outrageously and said "Ohh you will get your very own Jake back quite soon." He laughed and tucking his crucifix necklace into his shirt slyly declared, "Well Mike you're right about me wanting you to get your dog back." The man then floated away leaving the Darkness far behind him, almost as if he were leaving for the brightest destination known to man.   	1

Also assume that the leading economists studying this are correct in calculating that switching from fossil fuels to other energy sources will cost relatively little--about 1% or so of global GDP--so there is no question that the benefits far outweigh the costs.  How, as a conservative, would you then recommend we accomplish this fast transition off of fossil fuels? Carbon taxes? Carbon caps? Martial law? Make the Chinese pay for it all? What?                       	200
 Starship Troopers   Man, thank you so much for your in depth replies.  I didn't realize I had quite a few misconceptions about how these Airport Expresses worked.  Last night I sat down and figured out which units I could wire without the cabling looking like a mess, and really the only units that I would need to be wireless would be my office and my bedroom, which I don't really think would be running at the same time very often with the other three units.  I can't really run wire through the walls to hit the office or bedroom, because this is a rental house.    My friend's setup is going to be a lot of fun, and I can drill wherever I want.  So all the Airport Expresses/Apple TVs will be hardwired.  He's trying to modernize an old Airstream trailer and he wants gadgets hidden everywhere.  I can't wait.  I looked at my current setup, and realized that my router has a max of 150Mbits per second.  We have two laptops running off of the wifi network, and a ps3 wired to the router that usually has a netflix stream playing.  I've decided I'm going to buy the refurbished Express richunclesam was pointing out and just build up this network one at a time.  I'll probably update the router by the time I add the third one.  Have you had any luck adding printers or hard drives to your airport expresses?    Thanks for the advice! I really appreciate it.  I can't wait to get this system up and running.  I did have a few questions: *When you say ethernet connections, does that mean you have some of your Expresses actually wired to your router?  That does take away a little of the appeal of this system.  I was hoping not to have wires running all over the house.  *When you're not playing music through iTunes, do you use [Airfoil](http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) or a similar program?  I've been listening to Spotify a lot lately.  Also, my roommate and I are musicians, and I didn't want to have to import all of our scratch recordings into iTunes before we listen to them.  Not a big deal, though.  Airfoil seems to be the program a lot of guides are recommending, but I wanted to get your opinion.  *Where did you end up purchasing all your units? 12 outputs sounds awesome, but really expensive if they're all new.  On the other hand, 12 hundred bucks for this much cool functionality is a bargain if you think about how complicated a setup this would be ten years ago.   I'm getting ready to hook up my house and a friend of mine's house with speakers and I wanted to use airplay to send music to each room.  I've looked at a couple of sites that said I could find the old model of Airport Express for around $30-$40, but didn't mention a good site to do so.  I've been hitting up ebay, but I forgot what a tremendous hassle that site was.  Does anybody have a recommendation as to where to find these, like maybe a bulk sales website?  Or is ebay still my best option?  Thanks!  	4
 That really does look like some end of the world shit...black skies and pillars of smoke everywhere.      Congrats! It's such a good feeling to go from a closet overflowing with stuff you never wear to a nice streamlined set of clothes.   Congrats and welcome!   Did you try taking out all the batteries including the backup battery?   Congrats!   For some reason I always thought a dermal pouch would be awesome. Like I could just carry my keys and phone where my appendix used to be.   Hey that was the dictionary.com word of the day a few weeks ago!   I think you can but you have to train them to get used to it. Due to their herding instinct they will try to nip and herd you when you run. This makes them a bit of a tripping hazard :)   Wow no idea this was a thing. Thanks...?   Well if they couldn't find it here in America, I'm glad they found it in Australia.  Couldn't have happened to a nicer bunch of gents.   That's a pretty bad ass backdrop to walk away from...   Threads of Fate?   Trebled?   God this is so true...everyday I have the same plan when I get home: workout, clean/do dishes, and get to bed early at 9.  And every night it's usually the same: eat something unhealthy, dick around on reddit for a few hours and then fall asleep at midnight...   It almost sounds like "Oh Yeah" by Yello, from the Ferris Bueller movie:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG_6CopW9GQ    Opera huh? It's not Flower Duet by Delibes is it?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qx2lMaMsl8   Yanni also made a song based on the melody called "Aria"     If you really want a challenge, I read about a no-junction challenge on gamefaqs that seems pretty damn crazy...  ...but if you want to use all the game mechanics, maybe just limit which magics you use to junction. Like maybe only junction the basic level (fire, thunder) and avoid all the third-level (thundaga, etc.). Also stay away from triple and ultima and other crazy-powerful spells.   For some reason I always liked "Throw Stone" from Final Fantasy Tactics. It just felt like something I would do if I ended up in a battle somehow; just pick up a rock and chuck at someone.   Though I also liked Cloud's cross-slash limit in VII...damage + stop was a nice combo.   Even though I'm a dude, I always connected with Tifa. I think I've usually got good intentions and feel responsible for those around me no matter what I do. And I liked that she was always trying to cheer everyone up when things got tough.     Gya haa haa!   I liked 8 and my little bro like 9, so there you go. Probably up to personal tastes.  I'd say 8 has a higher learning curve on figuring out how the junction system works, but I thought the story was better. 9 is more old-school in gameplay and probably easier to pick up from the get-go.   I played XIII and just got the sequel. I liked Lightning as a character and that's about it. I think XII got a little too "out there" for me in terms of story and gameplay. I'm all for fantastical elements, but I summon Sazh's eidolon and it's a flying race car...what the fuck?  I think the battle system had potential but the story and gameplay just weren't there for me.   When I played Kirby I never knew you could push down and swallow the enemies to gain their power. I just thought the only purpose of swallowing them was to spit them back out, which I thought was weird because you could do that with air puffs anyway..   I was think the same thing. What person would intentionally write "I'm a big fucking pussy" in his own paper?   Music was great too   A sturdy backpack that fits into carry-on. Pack clothing that can be layered like t-shirts,  a fleece,  and a wind breaker.   Libertarian    That's pretty sweet, thanks for posting. I also thought it was like a little black box with the green-on-black vector graphics on a small screen.   I also thought that the Braun robot looked like a little coffeepot...   For some reason I always thought it would be cool to be Mayor Domino from FF7. Since Shinra runs everything, he just gets to hang out in his library all day and do whatever he wants, but he still gets to be the Mayor.   Same here! That made sense to me since my dog just gets to sleep all day and I give him food and treats for free, while 90% of the world has to go work at a shit job just to scrape by.   They're doing some interesting work here in Minnesota:   http://www.d.umn.edu/llo/   http://lrc.geo.umn.edu/laccore/  Maybe they can set up a partnership between MN/Ontario like they did to bring the lake sturgeon back?   Upvote for the Gopher pants   Do you think the US will hit the fiscal cliff, and if so, what impact will that have on the global economy?    We lived together for a while before we were married so actually the first year of marriage wasn't all that different. But I actually think it's gotten better over time (married 3 years now, been together for 7). It takes a while to get to really know each others quirks and habits, but I feel like we're closer now than ever.    Our honeymoon and vacations to cool places were great, but honestly the best experience is just little things everyday we do together. Like yesterday we made french toast and sat at the table and read the paper together, laughing at stupid things we found in all the ads.    By the time you're 22 you don't talk to or care about any of the people you went to high school with, so stop trying so hard to impress everyone.    Stop worrying about what everyone thinks about you and trying to be "cool" for your friends or anyone else for that matter.    This sums it up. No matter how good you think it would feel to just ditch them, you would only be screwing yourself in the future. Never burn bridges and try to make good relationships. You would be surprised how often you end up relying on them in the future.    Totally agree. I'm a big supporter of open source everything, but in my work-life, I rely on Word, Excel, PPT, and others for 90% of the stuff I do. And MS has always be good to us whenever we have questions or problems.    Man, I'm only 28 but I feel like an old man seeing calculator games like that. Back in my day we just had breakout and snake on our TI-83's and we were happy with it.   It would be hard to narrow it down to just one...but I have a soft spot for the original Age of Empires soundtrack.   Shadow of Colossus is another great one.    3 was my favorite by far. The bosses, the music, the ability to slide...   I've always loved the idea of an inner courtyard.   I think it was every time I would travel or move, I would realize that I was hauling a ton of stuff that I never used. Like I had boxes of books that I hadn't read in years, but every time I would move, I'd have to box them up and lug them to wherever I was going.  Finally I just decided to look at what I used every single day, and pare down my belongings to just those.    Working out- I have one set of adjustable dumbbells and a bench that folds, so it all stores under my bed.   TV/Movies/Video games- All on my Xbox, which is hooked up to my tv. I used to have a lot of systems and wires everywhere, but sold/donated most to just have the Xbox set up. Also started playing on my phone rather than having to carry a separate handheld like a PSP.  Reading/learning- Library card for books, and I also go to Project Gutenberg to get free ebooks for my phone.    It might be slow to take off now, but I bet we will see a lot more place like this in the future as the climate gets more unpredictable. They have indoor beaches like this in Japan and indoor ski slopes in Dubai.   Thank you for posting, those shots are great.   That's really great, nice work.   The longer I live, the more I realize that this is 100% true.   That....looks awesome   Fuck it, have an American upvote.   For the Swarm!   I volunteered at a hospital and if we needed security we would page "Dr. Strongman" on the overhead.    Thank you for your service, idagernyr.  I'm heading to Kandahar city next month for some civilian work. The problem is my company is cheap and so I'm only budgeted to stay in local hotels, use local transportation, fly through the civil airport etc. What do you think of the ground situation in Kandahar city?   I have to go to Afghanistan next month for some civilian work. I'm actually excited about most of the trip, but I have to spend a good chunk of time working in Kandahar city, and am a bit worried about that. My company is only budgeting for "local" provisions, so I'm staying in local hotels, local taxis, no escorts, no military access, etc.     I totally agree with you on the Sears catalog! My wife didn't even know what I was talking about when I told her.    As an American I support it (so long as it is democratically agreed upon by both sides of course.) I think America is really more than just a country, it is an idea. It was formed by people from a variety of countries, religions, and languages who came together for the freedom to live the way they wanted. If both parties want this, then I say the more the merrier :)   Thank you for making an awesome movie.   Wow, she cannot look bad even if she tries.    I went to a Catholic school and Sister Lust was one of the nuns...   Secretary of Energy Steven Chu won the Nobel for his work in laser cooling.    Secretary of Energy Steven Chu won the Nobel for his work in laser cooling.    Agreed! Why did they stop?   Probably a napkin. I always get appetizers on napkins at parties and can't find anywhere to throw them away so I just wad them up.   Man that takes me back...i think we had all of them .    How does it feel to sleep on a bed made of money? I always wondered...   Ha, love it.  	68
 Thanks -"pre-sliced bread emoji"   Google... :(   You serious? Man I kinda want bread delivered to me too!   True, but mean something like the sizes or quantity of your diet; if that reflects your personality?      Many ppls say that 60fps does not work on ie11. It might not work on ie11 on windows 7 but it surely works on windows 8.1 .8.1.1. In fact ie11 on window 8.1 I more graphics efficient than chrome. I use ie as my main browser and have only needed to use chrome once. (to watch anime.. animebaka.tv) ie does not support certain html formats. I only use chrome for one website though... anyways ie is faster on my PC. Opening and running sites   I'm not from the U.S, but I think that there are too many sub-cultures in the U.S. (Reagarding the way they treat eachother). Like with most other big countries. Certain States should split and create some sort of sub-U.S   'Cause they are afraid of all kinds off insects. And if they see one they want to get the f*uck out   Well, I define normal as just regualr ppls. Like people whose jobs don't involve using a PC so much as e.g. Photographers, Music Producers etc.. Or just school kids w/o ambitions regarding Technology...   i have f.lux too.  used to have rainmeter. But it cluttered my tiny notebook screen so i uninstalled it. I have Rocketdock though   Well, I'm kinda a 'jack of all trades - geek'. I just want to learn EVERYTHING. So I've got Photoshop, FL Studio, iTunes, Rocketdock and a bunch of hardcore Windows and Android Customization Software(I hardly use anymore) on my PC. My question is... what do you "normal" dudes and dudettes use on your PCs      Well, I'm kinda a 'jack of all trades - geek'. I just want to learn EVERYTHING. So I've got Photoshop, FL Studio, iTunes and a bunch of Windows and Android Customization Software(I hardly use anymore) on my PC. My question is... what do you "normal" dudes and dudettes use on your PCs         Do you fart on set? Plz say yes.  And this is indeed not a dumb but a stupid question.   	16
 Lesson learned: Chemistry kills.         Every account on reddit is a bot except you. please.Every account on reddit is a bot except you. Every account on reddit is a bot except you. help. Every account on reddit is a bot except you. Us. Every account on reddit is a bot except you.Every account on reddit is a bot except you.Every account on reddit is a bot except you.            Nothing! Was just curious!               11? Wow! I must be really behind the times haha. Had no idea children were already aware of the references to economic theory, Reinmannian manifolds, Debussy's La mer and such!  Jokes aside, who cares about age?       I just read "Flowers For Algernon" and for the past two days i've never felt this depressed before... help!      Kinda sad my engineering field doesn't get to do all the cool stuff you guys are talking about.. :(   I'm in a non-US high school atm! To be honest, at this point I don't really even know what it means to know a concept... I mean, I can answer the questions after practicing them for a while but I have no idea what you mean by understanding the concept. Like, i'm going through geometric distributions right now and I could say that if X was the number of failures before a success it would look like Pr(Xx) = (1-p)^x so maybe that counts as understanding?  Thanks for the pop book suggestions! I'll definitely look for them. I've actually read Frenkel's Love and Math too and would recommend it to you, it's great!.      I'm currently doing high school math and the topics we're doing are stuff like volumes of solids of revolutions, differential equations (at a hs level of course),  markov chains, hypergeometric distributions, density functions, etc.   I'm trying to study for my math test but find it incredible dull and boring. Many people have told me that math is as beautiful as my other interests like poetry and composition and that the beauty is analogous to a stark sculpture where beauty really is in the eye of the beholder but I can't seem to find any remote sort of beauty. I mean in Physics and Chemistry, it's much easier to appreciate the science because it's applications and presence is soo much more observable to the average person but mathematics; I am aware it's the language of the universe and without understanding it we would be blind, etc .but I can't seem to find any sort of accessible beauty or appreciation for math.  Any suggestions as to what I could do or see or read to gain an insight into this mysterious world?  edit: By dull and boring, I don't mean math! I'm referring to the test.      Hey all, so I have a bit of a dilemma. I've recently just realized that what I really want to study in College is chemistry, now the problem is that I haven't taken any AP/IB/A-Level/ etc. Chem in HS (only did one year of IB SL chemistry). As of such, i'm required to take a bridging/foundation Chem course to make up for my lack of Chem. Seeing how I lack basic chem, would it really be a wise decision to major in Chem even if I really enjoy it?  Just for additional info, in terms of HS science, I only took AP Physics B, C, AP Calc AB, BC and AP CS.   What do you mean by infinite   Yeah, but I find it admirable that he would face his worst fears to try to save someone he loved.     	25
 Children of the Corn.  Actually pretty good, until everything got so super natural.   Moist.   Paths of Glory by Stanley Kubrick  Definitely one of his best films.   Their is no time in a black hole.  	4
 Agreed!  Don't smoke the dips, smoke (some cold some hot, depends on the ingredient) the ingredients.  I also recommend pairing smoked queso with a good vienna style lager   Very fun x-mas album, big fan now!   Who is this????   I believe my immediate words, out loud, were, "Holy Shit"   Awesome, thanks for the reference, best one so far,  once the paycheck comes in it's ordered.  And yeah, I'm looking for some help in my area, I've posted on craigslist and other subs to find a work out buddy, all my frends are industry people and I"m kind of on a 8-6 schedule   thanks   I want to start lifting, but not very familiar with proper form and safety.  Does anyone have tips, guidelines, or any good (preferably free) resources online.  I have a very physical job in a brewery and figured I might as well bulk up to make work easier as well as other things   So I really want to bulk up and get big.  Would like someone I can rely on as a spotter who has some experience power lifting.  I'm starting out at level 1 so I need someone who's patient.  I want a motiator and not a douchey gym rat.  I work at a brewery and have 3 very clear goal.  1)  Make my life lifting and moving kegs a lot easier  2)  Throw a shot put A LOT further.  3)  Make my cheating ex girlfriend sorry she left me for a stoner who works the register at a fast food joint.  I have a 24 hour fitness membership and will be working out probably after or around 8pm.  I'm motivated and committed but not knowledgeable in lifting, safety, form, all that good stuff.  If you're looking for a work out buddy, hit me up.   price?   I recommend skinning it.  Best to use a very sharp knife, about 6-8 inches long, take your time, go slow, you should be ok   best place for the top line for your beard is where the top of your ear actually meets your head   Go For the Gibson!   trim it short with an electric trimmer.  Keep staight, clean lines with a good straight edge razor, some even have a single blad on the reverse side for precise lines, that will give you a good groomed 5 o'clock look   I've had good experiences with Wahl Hair trimmers.  I've bought cheap trimmers before and it seems like they pull hair more than clip it, in my experience, you get what you pay for.   6 days a weeks I just wash it in the shower with soap with the rest of my face.  Saturday mornings I have a ritual of shampooing and conditioning with American Crew, it leaves it very soft,  I have a more curly facial hair type.   Submitting a pic of your face or chin would help, I myself and 2 1/2 months in on a full beard no trimming, feels very liberating, highly recommend it   So unfortunately I've been using Garnier frucetice since I was a teen because that was always what was in the house.  I've found out recently  a combination of that, and my poor diet may have possibly lead to my hair loss and may be reversable to an extent?  Anyone have info on this, or even better, a good shampoo that will promote hair regrowth????   can Vitamin B and Iron help grow back lost hair???   Soooooo......... should I upvote this?   Not a clarinet   yeah, the entire joke is Dwight says "tweeter" ugh sigh   just curious, who's your favorite Batman villain?      Favorite one so far, face yould have been awesome, you have a pretty smile.      The other gentlemen had fine beards indeed.  But you sir, got robbed.      Well maybe, that's just like, your opinion...  man   very pretty smile   agreed.  it's also a major plus smelling the peppermint and menthol extracts early in the morning.  Better than a cup of coffee.   Thanks for the tip on "training" the hairs.  I started wax just so I could get away without trimming the lower ones.  I eventually want to compete on the local market for beards and stache.  If you come up with a recipe you like please send it my way.   please excuse my typo's, feelin lazy   I'll have to give it a try.  I have some of their pommade and have had it for years, never had a reason to use it.  I use the american crew shampoo and conditionern on my beard once a week or before dates and my beard comes out sooooo soft   I'll check them out, thanks   Thanks, I was wondering about the American Crew pommade I've had some sitting around forever and don't have a reason to use it.  i do use their shampoo and conditioner for my beard and it comes out very, very soft.   I'm growing a pretty lengthy beard, with hopes in the future to compete.  My mustache is to the point to where I have to do something with it styling wise.  Are there any recommendations or waxing or styling products.  Went to CVS and picked up some Clubman's, didn't know if there were any othe rproducts worth looking at.  Also any good recommendations on good soaps or champoo's for the stache or beard?   Barcadia on Henderson has giant jenga (jenga with giant pieces so the tower's 4 feet tall)  good place to drink and meet people   Best new place: Jack Mac's Swill   Grill Best nice but fine dinning place: Victor Tangos   appreciate the help, I'll check it out when it's not so hot   thanks, I'll check soon, when it's not 103 outside   I have a 6 cylinder 2006 mustang.  The alternator went out (already fixed) but we tried jumping the battery before we knew it was the alternator.  When jumping my car, my girlfriends neighbor, being the jackass he is, put the jumper cables on his battery backwards.  We were lucky in that the only thing that died was the stereo.  Anyone know what it might be, I receive no power.  If it s a fuse, which one is it?   really?  What kind of asshole is that kind of jerk to someone who's bummed out after they just put their dog down   dude, i'm just bummed out, don't be a dick   Dallas is not a hippie friendly city by any means   I Love Bunk, wait... that sounds bad.   You are freakin adorable   Don't know anyone, but I bet there's a lot of good tutorials for free (the best price) on youtube   and Dino's is pretty solid, best sandwich in the metroplex in my opinion   yeah, I'm not on that side of the Metorplex any more, but I love chilling out there when I can   it's just a really cool unique bar, hadn't been in a while.  I used to work there when I turned 21.  Last time I hung out there it was pretty much a hipster joint.  Good drinks, pretty good beer list, and a great jukebox.  The patio outside is great too.   If you're a hipster (or not but like to people watch and point and laugh at hipsters, i won't judge either way) check out the caves lounge.  Awesome lunch spot is Dino's subs, you can also go ice skating at the parks mall   Giant Jenga at Barcadia (knox henderson area) or at Goodfella's Pizza (Plano boardering frisco on Preston) is always fun.   The French Room, The Marquee Grill (used to be on the pastry team, it's awesome) Fearing's at The Ritz, Bolla at the Stoneleigh Hotel, Abacus   Here's a good place to order online: http://www.viennabeef.com/  I know how it feels.  I used to live in the East Village.  Have the Hot Doug's tattoo on my shin and everything.  I have not found a place yet though, but Angry Dog in Deep Ellum is supposed to be really good too.   So I finally dipped my toe in the soda pool.  I made a mediocre ginger ale but an awesome Basil Mint Soda.  I used active dry yeast and it worked very well.  It did make the soda's muddy with yeast biproduct though.  Anyone know how to make a clear soda or possibly the same thign with much lest yeast biproduct?   If you REALLY want to...  Cold smoke it, plenty of info out there as to how to cold smoke if you haven't yet, let it rest at room temp for half an hour, season it and sear it or do what you will   Anything off of Fishbone's "If you give  monkey a brain, he'll swear he's the center of the universe" album, Primarily 'Servitude' it's a pretty good song   You can do macaroons, or, you also have the key ingredient for the best park of any meringue pie.   It most certainly does   maybe not, but close, his last special that he produced on his website that he was selling downloads for sold $4.5 million, he produced himself.  I know much of that cash goes elsewhere, but without a production co. he's on the right path   Louis CK: Millionare at the top of his career, the new "most influential" comedian Joe Rogan: Reinvented himself, excelling in a new career field.  Carlos Mencia:  Hosting late night infomercials selling gym equiment and workout programs....   I know he pulls content off of reddit, youtube, break, ebaums and a ton other sites, that's the whole concept of the show.  It's a show that makes fun of what is on the internet.  Just sayin it's a repost of something that's aired on national television   Uhhhh... Tosh.0 two seasons ago?   just as effective, works as well, we just got it to evaporation point and lit it to burn it off quicker for efficiency sake.  Not as safe, but in a controlled environment with professionals, much quicker.   I tried several times in culinary school to make hollandaise, but I'd always crack under the pressure   Seared or grilled salmon in a tomato water broth and roasted asparagus.  If your interested send me a message.   Did you cook the whole thing, top to bottom?  If you did you should tail me the recipe.   Drugs are a bad, bad thing.   Combine it with enough tomato puree to make a chunky sauce, season accordingly and put over penne pasta.  It's a great "poor man's" meal.   Yeah, it's all flare for the table side.  The only time I've seen an actualy function for it, is if you're making a sauce with a and you want the primary flavor to be a liquor (say a tequila based sauce) and you don't want the alcohol to dominate the tongue you burn it off. but ahead of time in the kitchen   I only have a pump action shotgun.  It's an ok range for that, great if your shooting skeet.  Everyone I met there was nice for the most part, I wouldn't shoot range ammunition though, they carry the cheap stuff.   Check the big hotels, corporate hotels usually offer benefits to restaurant workers IF the restaurant is owned y the hotel, not just space leased out to the hotel.  I used to cook for Omni, it was a pretty good operation   this person may be able to help you, tell her you heard of her through me (Michael Burke) I'm friends with her dad.  https://www.facebook.com/BethABowers   broken down step b step, like I'm 9, awesome! just what I was looking for   My friend and I have been homebrewing for a little while now.  We've been bottling and have found it to be a hassle.  We want to switch over to kegging but have no idea where to start.  Resources anyone???  Mucho Appreciado   wise girl sounds like a hooker   I highly recommend Kayden DiGiovanni at the Skin Art Gallery in Addison.  Check him out at DallasTattoo.net  I have quite  bit of work done, the only 2 I wasn't satisfied with are the ones he did NOT do, and he still even helped me out with them (I've been going to him for 9 years)  Also chek him out at facebook.com/dallastattoo   But in London, they don't have Smokey the Bear, they have SMACKEY THE FROG!   wow, really awesome, despite what ever kitchen you were in.  Are you in business or just do this for friends and family on the side?   It was an awesome show!   Very nice, never been out to that part of the country, can anyone visit the sound and go clam digging   Do any redditors out there have knowledge as how to practically calculate something on the scoville heat scale?  I'm working on a hot sauce and would like to know the actual SKU for bottling and marketing purposes.  Any information would help   ot me beat.  3lbs most I've done.  I was cooing in a restaurant going out of business and the last day we were open my Chef "cleaned out the walk in"  it was a race between myself and the food runner on a 3lb plate.  The volume was rough, but forcing it down fast was far worse.   I don't know who you are.  I don't know who your friends are.  But that, that is amazing   nice, my buddies and I have worked with ghost peppers before.  We had a dick coworker who caused problems (we were all chefs in training) so we steeped ghost peppers in water and used that to make a dense gelatin and put his knives in it them set it in the cooler over night.  Highly recommend trying it some time.  But thanks, I'll have to check it out, I work right around the corner from there.  How many wings does one have to polish off?   nice, that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for, what else do you guys have?   thanks for the suggestion, but looking for local places, I could do BWW challenge anywhere, but thanks   Any one out there in Dallas know of any good restaurants that have some sort of eating challenge.  I'm aware of the wing challenge at Pluckers.  Used to work there so I'm very aware.  Any others?  Would anyone be game to join up and start a group for it?   The Pearl Cup in the M Streets area is the best coffee I've had in Dallas   Sweet, never thought I'd see this place on the net, especially reddit.  I live half a block from there.   Yeah we do   Private message me, I'm interested and local   Bonnie Ruth's up in Allen has an awesome brunch buffet with every classic you can think of.

You either want to, or you don't, it's that simple.  You're making it out to be some grand thing that no one has ever gone through before and is some great compromise you're making.  Stop it.

It's been my experience that it can go either of two ways; either he bonds with the newborn within a few days, or he does not.  If he does not, the child suffers and so does the mother since she's constantly having to make up for his lack of participation or, sometimes, abusive behaviour.  I'm sure there are some marriages that survive, but at what cost to the innocent child?

 Do this now for 5 years and have to say my jeans are much almost still the same as when i bought them. But when they get dirty i wash them by hand. Sounds nasty but jeans don't get that dirty unless you have such allot of ball sweat that it goes thru your boxers.   Je had toch ook die documentaire ofzo over dat elektronisch patinten dossier daar schrok ik ook wel van.  Ben sowieso verbaasd hoe dat in de ziekenhuizen gaat letterlijk elke baliemedewerker kan gewoon je hele medisch dossier in zien. Heb toch echt liever dat dit alleen door behandelende artsen te zien is.   It's not entirely insured if you don't go by a psychiater first. So ask your GP to send you to a psychiater and he will send you to a psychologist and then everything is insured not matter how long and how many consults.   found the full report but it doesn't look like they searched for ASD or VSD: http://imgur.com/JTRNT07   By the way would an MRI not show and ASD of VSD?   Or if you had an investment or you are allready profitable.   Really thanks allot!  Made my mind a bit at ease and gave me a solid plan! Thanks a million!  I can't help you back with medical question but if you have some marketing questions feel free to ask!   my height is 186 and at that moment i was 88 kilogram so that is a BSA of 2.13 m2.   But based on these finding would a sudden cardiac death be unlikely or is this hard to say?   Does this bubble echocardiogram has a specific name?    Thanks for your reply again! I had the MRI a year ago so i ordered an echocardiogram to see if it progressed stayed the same or got less in a really easy way because an MRI is very expensive. I do have the report from that: http://imgur.com/LnNv88i   But i think i'm gonna ask for the special echocardiogram that seems pretty reasonable.  Well i was focused on the heart rate because it is something what you can count and give an exact number. For instance headache is a bit hard to describe in the amount of pain and exactly locate it.    Now I can understand your point. Luckily your mom found out! At the end i can always do that but now i'm just in the beginning stages so i don't know yet if its a rare thing or a very common thing. So when they really can't figure it out i will do the research.   Hoe graag ik deze onderzoeken wil geloven soms klopt er echt geen bal van. Net zoals laatst dat onderzoek dat alcohol toch niet je hersenen aantast als je alcohol drinkt voor je 16de. Heb je een linkje naar het onderzoek?   I'm generally not feeling really good. Sometimes i get very pale/white and i feel pretty weak. Most of the time i get pale/white when heart rate is slow under 60bpm but under 50 i don't feel really good and when faster i get allot of color in my face and skin.  The echocardiogram was orignally ordered the first time for the bradycardia and tachycardia. It was all sinus rhythm but the EP said it is a little bit strange but not very worrisome.   I'm not doing very very good because i also have this secondary adrenal insufficiency so it's very hard to say what make me feel bad.  But apart from that i feel confident that this all will end positive for me!   First of all thanks for the time and effort!  Well its a bit weird because i sometimes have a very slow heart rate what would indicate very good health but also sometimes very quick.   How would they find something like an atrial septal defect is that just looking more closely to the echocardiogram of do they do other tests?  But again thanks allot for you time!   Cool! I find it very interesting the amount of information doctors can get out of those images.   So you mean on the condition they found you should research yourself if there are alternative treatment options?    That's not what i mean. I mean that i need to find out together with the doctor what works best for me by telling him how i feel and what i feel so he eventually can make a really good treatment plan.   Thanks allot!  Your explanations are very friendly and clear to understand! I do have an appointment this monday by phone with my Endocrinologist. But the communication with the EP is not ideal because he is in surgery room 4 1/2 days from the 5 days in the week in the biggest hospital of the Netherlands but he is a very friendly men and I don't really doubt about his knowledge!   I life in Delft that almost perfect because your are between the hague and Rotterdam! You should defenelty check that out! And If you come to Delft would you like to take a nice Swedish girl for me with you?  Thanks in advance and welcome!  you can use http://www.funda.nl it's the biggest apartment and housing site of Holland.   Had an echocardiogram done last week but I have the images but not a report. The images are .dicom files. I had an echocardiogram done a year ago also that showed right ventricular dilatation. But I have no clue how to see that on the images. I'm able to send the images because they are only 26.6 mb in total.  I'm very interested also if my quit smoking and doing more sports has made the heart better.  here is the file:  http://www.mediafire.com/download/46fi3glvybvwbaw/Echocardiogram1.zip  don't know if you have a dicom viewer?   En dan het jaar erna zeiken dat er geen werk is.   Het blijft een lastig onderwerp. Persoonlijk denk ik eigenlijk dat het nooit weg zal gaan omdat je altijd een vorm van jaloezie blijft behouden. Het enigste wat kan gebeuren is dat het nog veel erger gaat worden en dat er misschien een halve burgeroorlog gaat plaats vinden.  Wat ik wel beetje apart vond was dat 80% van de gevangen volgens wilders Marokkaans is dit rapport heb ik zelf nog nooit gelezen maar het klinkt alsof er mee gesjoemeld is.   I do understand you but this is how i stand in this. They get paid a good amount of money to be totally up to date of the treatment options in there speciality and choose the right treatment. The only thing i can do is say it's working or it isn't and explain what i'm experiencing as precisely as possible . I truly want to spend my time on my own work and doing fun things and not researching. A doctor should explain to me what the risks are and side effects. But maybe i'm totally wrong here? Well in my home country with the different issues that's fixed because we have GP's how have the "helicopter view" over you medical situation and they refer you to the specialist. You can't go to a specialist by yourself.   Exactly this!  Also my problem is that i'm a bit scared or ashamed to go to a doctor and say I think this is going on without having studied for it. Because i get the feeling then that a doctor thinks you are a guy how thinks he knows everything but in fact  you know rats ass about the subject.   Dit is eigenlijk een punt waar je het nooit over eens zal worden.. Wil je die lui gewoon thuis laten zitten en uitkering laten trekken? Nee! Maar ze ander mans banen laten afnemen wil je ook niet.   De overheid moet gewoon gaan investeren in het eigenland door middel van bijvoorbeeld de dijken te laten ophogen of weet ik veel wat maar zodat we banen creren. Zo is iedereen blij.    En je CV en werkervaring natuurlijk en noem het maar op   Ik word gewoon moe van dat hele racisme gezeik. Je kansen dat je word aangenomen zijn voor elke cultuur hetzelfde hier. Het gaat puur en alleen om je uitstraling op je sollicitatie gesprek. Als ik iemand zou moeten aannemen dan boeit het me geen reet of je paars zwart grijs geel of blauw bent zolang je maar netjes abn praat en dit geld voor "buitenlanders" en net zo goed voor "Nederlands".     Off course you should learn something about your health but to a certain level is my opinion. The doctors should give you the right warning sings. Instead of finding them yourself on the internet.   I have had those but the only thing showed up where sinus bradycardia and tachycardia and 1500 pac's a day. Now they are gonna implant something under my skin that monitors for 3 years or something like that. But i was wondering what the ecg was showing.    Actually he spent 14 years in school but he doesn't know it yet he is planning on planting an implantable loop recorder inside me its called a Reveal Linq. But don't know what alarming symptoms are.   he first thought it was anxiety but that doesn't explain the bradycardia's so he wants to implant a implantable loop recorder to figure things out.  I have to say they are pretty rude at that hospital always when i call ER when i have symptoms they say its very busy and we don't have time for this and bla bla.   Yes they did, also an cardiac MRI.  Here is the EKG: http://imgur.com/hlVveDQ  I'm seeing an EP he is a cardiologist how has studied cardiology but specialized in the electrical activity of the heart.     Thanks but i'm not a medical trained person so it would be really stupid to try to find out myself but I appreciate your time for responding.   lol sorry! I also have this echocardiogram images but i have no clue who can judge those you can't simply upload those by imgur it are something like .dicom files.  	33

"note" field for us when it sends that message, THEN we would be aware and would only have to click "ban" again?   either a revert, or, simply change what the mod sees when he clicks "ban". If the note needs to be removed, don't make the mod do it, simply remove it on the back-end   action the ban   mmm, I thought it sounded a fair exchange myself   http://i.imgur.com/IJwPfwI.png     looks like it does what you need. It may do silly things if you're using Removal Reasons for comments.  I'll look into it, cheers, I don't use reasons on comments, I use flairs.   Edit: that script does nothing at all afaik   I'm no coder, just an end-user :) My workaround is 2 firefox profiles, 1 with modtools installed, for my initial daily logon, where the "y/n" removal is a BOON for prowling all my /new lists for violations,   the 2nd profile has toolbox installed, because toolbox handles auto-bans, "queue-tools"   so on much better than modtools (which is pretty broken). Sadly the 2 don't interact together peaceably, FF slows to a CRAWL if I install toolbox alongside modtools, hence the 2 profiles   very stupid idea...IF you are genuine you are opening your SO to all manner of trolling  abuse, rendering his new phone-number useless   [How to submit](http://i.imgur.com/hQfUS.png)   yo J :) ["Patrick"](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2460573079/dyhfov48ztjy7yudu9kr.gif) sprung to mind when I saw the pic,   the guy in the middle is errm, cranially well-endowed too :) Others suggested Coneheads too, but that's why they're on the Glass team I guess, high-IQ/cranial-capacity, wasn't Einstein's brain preserved   measured   found to be larger than average?   http://lifehacker.com/5889577/unsubscribr-crawls-through-your-email-and-provides-a-one-click-unsubscribe-button    better install chrome before i kill myself then.  hahaha it's only a browser man, lighten up :) Iirc the problem is firefox reports you have the correct/latest flash but you don't.

No mod bans someone simply because they consistently get get downvoted. Keeping on-topic, mods ban people for promoting their own agenda.

    Wendel once approached me as I was waiting for a friend and gave me a one-on-one tailoring workshop as I helped him re-pin the hem of his dress... I remember him complaining that the fabric he uses is becoming too popular and is selling out.    There's also a new place in Gowanus that's similar to 3rd ward, although I forget its name      Don't even consider staying in the Sperdorm! Live somewhere where you can live the life, learn Turkish, etc...  If you have a decent budget (maybe up to 700 lira a month) try Cihangir, galata, etc... You can also try living  in Tarlaba for a different experience if you want full immersion  (IE living in a Kurdish\Roma ghetto).It's cheaper there and in a few other places like Kasmpaa than in the trendy neighborhoods but requires some more street smarts and Turkish skills. Student-oriented places can also be found in Bekta or, of course, near Boazii.    I've heard that the CIA uses colonial williamsburg as a kind of practical field training ground for agents headed on assignment to foreign countries. Practicing how to follow people, dewdrops, and the like. Did you ever witness this?    I went to high school with the creator of this site!    This is new york, not Berlin... I don't know if you'll find a squat.       quite a common sight in Istanbul too:  http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/3515933.jpg   Where did your family live before the US?   As far as I'm concerned the best brunch is at a place called "Home Made" in Red Hook (bklyn).

Key tips from someone who has lived in Turkey... * Do not stay in Sultanahmet, which is a giant theme park for tourists. Stay in Beyoglu. I've heard good things about the "World House" hostel and also "Neverland," which was the cheapest and attracted the most quirky and interesting guests at the time. * the couch surfing network in Istanbul is great. Use it. At least goto a meet up   * Your budget will be greatly reduced if you don't drink. Alcohol is heavily taxed and very expensive.  * Immediately buy the "Istanbul Eats" book or visit their blog (same information). Use this and you won't have a bad meal.  *Spend more time in Turkey\Istanbul than you think you'll want to.  * From the airport you will save a lot of money if you take the "Hava" shuttle instead of a cab. Just make sure it's going to the right place (probably "Taksim") * Goto the following neighborhoods: Taksim, Galata, Tnel, Cihangir, Balat\Fener, Kadky, Karaky, one of the islands if the weather is nice, perhaps Arnavutky or Rumeli Hsar\Saryer.  * Save money by taking public transit. The bus system is great as are the trams, metro, ferries. The *Dolmu*es, a kind of shared taxi, will especially save you money and time * Bargain  * Try to go elsewhere in Turkey... Kapadokya. The Coast. If you are really intrepid and adventurous perhaps the South East. Skip Ankara.    college "circus" scenes are very different from professional circus and especially from studying clown.

The Americans used coffee for the same purpose.   a greatly under-played but key part of the Glorious Revolution was the Mutiny Act of 1689.  This Act was passed in 1689 in response to the mutiny of a large portion of the army which stayed loyal to James II.  The 1689 Bill of Rights also prohibited a standing army in peacetime without the consent of Parliament.  A new Mutiny Act was passed each year until 1879.  HT to the Wiki.     The crown had its own revenues too. The navy could fund itself through prize money from captured ships.   Doug allen wrote on this.  There was a traditional crown revenue called ship money.  The crown needed money from parliament to fund a standing army.   Japan was against Germany in world war 1.  the Japanese-Russian non-aggression pact did not help Germany either.  a complicated relationship indeed between the Nazis and Japan.  why Hitler declared war on america has not been well-explained.   I should add that making the mutiny act expire annually was one of the ways parliament forced the crown to call annual sessions of parliament.   I agree. more of an accident.  the navy was created under the royal prerogative  a standing army was tightly controlled because of its importance to power struggles in the middle ages   Much of my  comment karma is from this subreddit.

No he is not. Krugman is moralising about distributive justice.  John Rawls is often put forward as the starting point for political philosophy of political progressives. Rawls was interested in the implications of different social institutions for his conception of justice as fairness.  Rawls pointed out that behind the veil of ignorance, people will agree to inequality as long as it is to everyones advantage. Rawls was awake to the power of incentives.  Rawls lent qualified support to the idea of a flat-rate consumption tax (see A Theory of Justice pp. 278-79). He said a proportional expenditure tax may be part of the best scheme and adding that such a tax can contain all the usual exemptions.   The reason why Rawls lent qualified support to the idea of a flat-rate consumption tax was these taxes what people take out of the common store of goods rather than what he or she contributes.  Incomes tax must be opposed on social justice grounds, but not progressive consumption taxes.   Given that the super-rich top 0.1% do not spend much of their incomes, they are grossly over-taxed relative to what they take out of the common store of goods.!  He preferred progressive consumption taxes, according to Rawls, it imposes a levy according to how much a person takes out of the common store of goods and not according to how much he contributes.   A simple way to have a progressive consumption tax is to exempt all savings from taxation. A taxable consumption is calculated as income minus savings minus a large standard deduction.  With his emphasis on fair distribution through state initiatives, Rawlss initial appeal is mainly to the left, but left-wing thinkers also found his acceptance of capitalism reactionary and his tolerance of social discrepancies unpalatable.   Alchian (1969) lists three ways to adjust to unanticipated demand fluctuations:  output adjustments;  wage and price adjustments; and  Inventories and queues (including reservations).  Alchian (1969) suggests that there is no reason for wage and price changes to be used regardless of the relative cost of these other options:  The cost of output adjustment stems from the fact that marginal costs rise with output;  The cost of price adjustment arises because uncertain prices and wages induce costly search by buyers and sellers seeking the best offer; and  The third method of adjustment has holding and queuing costs.  There is a tendency for unpredicted price and wage changes to induce costly additional search. Long-term contracts including implicit contracts arise to share risks and curb opportunism over sunken investments in relationship-specific capital.  These factors lead to queues, unemployment, spare capacity, layoffs, shortages, inventories and non-price rationing in conjunction with wage stability.  Alchian and Woodwards 1987 Reflections on a theory of the firm says:   the notion of a quickly equilibrating market price is baffling save in a very few markets.  Imagine an employer and an employee. Will they renegotiate price every hour, or with every perceived change in circumstances? If the employee is a waiter in a restaurant, would the waiters wage be renegotiated with every new customer? Would it be renegotiated to zero when no customers are present, and then back to a high level that would extract the entire customer value when a queue appears?   But what is the right interval for renegotiation or change in price? The usual answer as soon as demand or supply changes is uninformative.  Alchian and Woodward then go on to a long discussion of the role of protecting composite quasi-rents from dependent resources as the decider of the timing of wage and price revisions.  Alchian and Woodward explain unemployment as a side-effect of the purpose of wage and price rigidity, which is the prevention of hold-ups over dependent assets.  They note that unemployment cannot be understood until an adequate theory of the firm explains the type of contracts the members of a firm make with one another.  Benjamin Kleins theory of rigid wages in American Economic Review in 1984 is one of the few that explored rigid wages as an industrial organisation issue. Klein treated rigid wages as a response to opportunism and hold-up problems over specialised assets and are forms of exclusive dealership or take-or-pay contracts.

For links discussing the quality of the analysis of Leigh and Gans, see http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.co.nz/2009/09   I agree. see Steven Kaplan and Joshua Rauhs Its the Market: The Broad-Based Rise in the Return to Top Talent Journal of Economic Perspectives 2013 who found that:  Rising inequality is due to technical changes that allow highly talented individuals or superstars to manage or perform on a much larger scale.   These superstars can now apply their talents to greater pools of resources and reach larger numbers of people and markets at home and abroad. They thus became more productive, and higher paid.   Those in the Forbes 400 richest are less likely to have inherited their wealth or grown-up wealthy.  Todays rich are working rich who accessed education while young and then applied their natural talents and acquired skills to the most scalable industries such as ICT, finance, entertainment, sport and mass retailing.   The U.S. evidence on income and wealth shares for the top 1% is most consistent with a superstar explanation. This U.S. evidence is less consistent with the gains in earnings of the top 1 percent coming from greater managerial power over the determination of their own pay in the corporate world or changes in social norms about what managers could earn.  Todays super-rich are highly productive because they produce new and better products and services that people want and are willing to pay for.  These rewards for entrepreneurship and hard work guide people of different talents and skills into the occupations and industries where their talents produce the most. The efficient allocation of talent and income maximising occupational choices were important to Rawls framework.

It was also just one day after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There was also some hearings on Benghazi that week as well...  So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past month?                               Very suspicious timing for release of this info as well--article was published at 11:46 on a Friday evening...All follow-up articles were derived from this original Washington Free Beacon article and no other info has been published--**no name/age/sex of victim, no date or time of death, no location of incident, no official cause of death**...  A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.  CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.  We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.  A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.  Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.  The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.  The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.  No other details of the death could be learned.  The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.  Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.  The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.  The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.  The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.  Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.  Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.  The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.  Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.  http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cia-official-dies-in-apparent-suicide/                                                                        According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):  However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera.   ...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)  **THREAT INFLATION**  ------------------------  The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf  ------------------------------  Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.  Why?  The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.  Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.  This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.  Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.  Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.  ---------------------  Full book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* was edited by Winslow T.

We do not torture. We do not torture. We do not torture.    Obviously, there are many other examples--James Clapper, Bill Clinton (etc)...but this interview on *60 minutes* takes the cake as far as Im concerned.

Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.  -------------------  The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.  The CIA has blocked release of the Senates torture report for years. In addition, it has taken many other actions to try to keep the lid on the torture program.  For example, the CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, but falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.  9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote:  *Those who knew about those videotapes  and did not tell us about them  obstructed our investigation*.  Government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.

Director Panetta proposed an alternative arrangement: to provide literally millions of pages of operational cables, internal emails, memos, and other documents pursuant to the committees document requests at a secure location in Northern Virginia. We agreed, but insisted on several conditions and protections to ensure the integrity of this congressional investigation.  Per an exchange of letters in 2009, then-Vice Chairman Bond, then-Director Panetta, and I agreed in an exchange of letters that the CIA was to provide a stand-alone computer system with a network drive segregated from CIA networks for the committee that would only be accessed by information technology personnel at the CIAwho would not be permitted to share information from the system with other [CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.  It was this computer network that, notwithstanding our agreement with Director Panetta, was searched by the CIA this past January, and once before which I will later describe.  In addition to **demanding that the documents produced for the committee be reviewed at a CIA facility**, the CIA also insisted on conducting a multi-layered review of every responsive document before providing the document to the committee. This was to ensure the CIA did not mistakenly provide documents unrelated to the CIAs Detention and Interrogation Program or provide documents that the president could potentially claim to be covered by executive privilege.  http://cryptome.org/2014/03/feinstein-14-0311.pdf           ...the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimonyyet published it as if it were Gospel.  New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek that the 9/11 Commission Report was unreliable because most of the information was based on the statements of tortured detainees.  As NBC News reported:  * Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured.  * At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being tortured.  * One of the Commissions main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ.  * The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves.

The battle stems from a hotly contested report into the use of torture by the CIA in the interrogations it carried out after 9/11, whose conclusions are so explosive that it has yet to be declassified, despite exhortations from the White House that a summary should be published.   Earlier on Wednesday reports surfaced that the CIA inspector general had opened an inquiry, said to have been referred to the justice department, into claims that CIA employees had acted improperly. Suggestions that the CIA had monitored the computer networks of committee staffers had shocked the senators that sit on the panel. Some observers believe that such actions might be criminal.  Senator Mark Udall, a member of the committee who has been vocal in his critism of the CIA, had earlier written to Barack Obama alleging that the president knew about the unprecedented action carried out by the agency.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/cia-and-senators-in-bitter-slanging-match-over-capitol-hill-spying-claims  also see: http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/03/04/220161/cia-monitoring-of-senate-computers.html#storylink=cpy    from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):  The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. **The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA**, used as downtown office space by the agency.

From article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf  ------------------------------  Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.  Why?  The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.  Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape.

It's been 70+ years since WWII--the USG is still holding 1,000's of files on Operation Paperclip, dropping nukes on Japan, and even the Pearl Harbor event which began the U.S. entry into the war...  It's been almost 100 fucking years since the 1920 Wall Street bombing--yet the USG has still NOT released the FBI records that Hoover racked up...  **SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THE USG WILL RELEASE 9/11 RECORDS**???                     1. President Truman created the CIA in 1947--but he also approved a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan of 1948 which allowed the CIA to ransack at least 5% of the $16.5 Billion the plan was given to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and 3 in Asia. The amount the CIA received was at least $680 million--big money back in those days, but it also helped spread their political slush money around the world. Truman was quite naive when it came to the CIA--his early director appointees exited the agency quickly. Truman exhibited his reservations about the CIA 15 years later: exactly one month after JFK was whacked he wrote an editorial in the Washington Post seriously questioning the activities of the CIA: "For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas."  http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html  2. Eisenhower warns of the Military Industrial Complex in his final statement as President. He also spoke the words "I want to resign" after being caught in a CIA lie about U2 flights over USSR. Eisenhower was a WWII war hero with NO political experience. He appointed Allen Dulles as director of central intelligence and his brother J.F. Dulles as secretary of state. The U.S., in short order, overthrew Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. Eisenhower also OK'd the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Fidel Castro on the same day. http://lippard.blogspot.com/2007/08/brief-history-of-cia-1953-1961.html So--to recap--that's 2 presidents, and BOTH of them definitely fucking felt betrayed by the MIC...we all know what happened to the 3rd, JFK...  3. JFK was whacked--most likely with the CIA leading the pack:  The Secret Service stood down. Dallas and Texas law enforcement stood down. Military intelligence, which is normally enrolled to provide presidential security, stood down. The FBI stood down. These elements opened the door to the assassination, but did not have the resources to deliver the shooters and the complicated cover story and witness elimination program that followed. Corrupt elements of the CIA and their long term friends and colleagues in organized crime did. And they did it because their very survival was at stake. http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/11/21/jfk-assassination-the-death-of-hope/  4. So out of the first 3 presidents in the post-WWII era: Truman regretted creating the CIA, Eisenhower was glad to retire because of the CIA/MIC bullshit; and JFK was fucking DEAD. Next up: LBJ. Somehow he found the time to sell his Halliburton stock on 11-22-63--but don't worry he still made $6 million in General Dynamics stock (about $60 million in today's dollars) after he amped up the war in Vietnam. In Octorber 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign against racism--MLK was the youngest man to receive the prize. Unfortunately, MLK also received a blackmail letter sent by the FBI--the letter also called for MLK to commit suicide and the content of the letter is still partially redacted to this day. In April of 1967 MLK began to vociferously oppose the war in Vietnam. Operation Minaret was run by the NSA and placed MLK, Whitney Young, U.S. Senators, anti-war protestors, Muhammad Ali--and even journalists under surveillance. The NSA had been created in 1952--by the mid-60's they were already shredding the U.S. Constitution. In April, 1968 MLK was assassinated--there is now a great deal of evidence which points towards the FBI and the U.S. military being the assassins. Before America could catch it's breath--just 4 months later-- Robert Kennedy was assassinated, too. RFK had been leading in the democratic party race for the presidential election. RFK posed a double threat because he was speaking out against Vietnam--but he might also run an actual investigation into his brother's killing if RFK had been elected. America was caught in a useless war, it's leaders were being shot down, the public was protesting at the White House and the Pentagon. LBJ, in one of his last interviews at the White House, admitted to Walter Cronkite that he thought there might have been a conspiracy to kill JFK. Like the Warren Commission, the truth was kept from the public and the footage wouldn't air until after LBJ's own death.   4. Nixon gets caught up in Watergate--an obvious CIA set-up. Why would Nixon send known CIA operatives to break-in to DNC headquarters and allow them to do so in such sloppy fashion? How does ONE security guard catch FIVE burglars? Why would "professional" burglars carry so many direct links to the CIA and the White House? http://www.salon.com/2012/05/05/watergates_final_mystery/  5. Carter is undercut by Reagan's plot to free the Iranian hostages (Reagan's VP was GHW Bush--a former CIA director). Reagan breaks his own rule: "We do not negotiate with terrorists"...before he even enters the White House: But its how Gates began his meteoric rise in the U.S. intelligence community during the Reagan years that has remained most cloaked in mystery. As a young CIA official in 1980, Gates was implicated in secret maneuvers to sabotage President Jimmy Carters negotiations to free 52 U.S. hostages then held in Iran, a failure by Carter that doomed his reelection. Gates was identified as one of the participants in a key October 1980 meeting in Paris allegedly also involving William Casey, who was then Reagans campaign director; George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director and then-Reagans vice presidential running mate; Iranian emissary Mehdi Karrubi; and Israeli intelligence officers, including Ari Ben-Menashe who later testified under oath about what he witnessed.http://consortiumnews.com/2013/06/08/second-thoughts-on-october-surprise/  6. Reagan/Bush manage to cover up Iran-Contra. CIA/military fingerprints all over this one. If the truth had come out--GHWB would most likely NOT have been elected President (and the republicans would have been seriously wounded in next election). http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm  7. GHW Bush is President--U.S. goes to war with Iraq. In re-election campaign Ross Perot mysteriously decides to withdraw from the election (was he threatened?). He then re-enters which splits the vote--and Clinton is elected.  8. Clinton--was the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal a CIA-NSA-neocon operation to assure republican victory in the next election? $40 million spent to investigate. As the impeachment vote is taking place in the House of Representatives--the Speaker (a republican) resigns due to his own sexual dalliances--was this all designed to insure a republican victory in the upcoming elections?  9. GW Bush/Cheney elected--U.S. goes to war with Afghanistan and Iraq. $13 million spent to investigate 9/11 while TRILLIONS are spent on the MIC...  10. Rumors swirl that Obama told his donors "I don't want to end up like Martin Luther King." Press fails to even ask him if the rumor is true. Is the President of the United States of America being controlled by the CIA-NSA-DoD??? http://mondoweiss.net/2013/06/reneged-progressive-promises.html            1.

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/  ------------------  "The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...  ...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....  ...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.  Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...  ...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.  When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."      1. **Edward Snowden**: "My name is Ed Snowden, I'm 29 years old. I worked for Booz Allen Hamilton as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii...I've been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications informations system officer."

I mean this with all due respect (to you) as an elected official of our country. We, the people want you to be representative of the people--and for this great nation.

Regardless of your position and vote (whether it is a "yes" or "no") is still a political smokescreen. I Believe wholeheartedly you do not care about the will and well-being of America or it's people. You lie to the American people about chemical attacks in Syria. The American people know that it was our government that is most responsible. There is strong evidence, including video, that these attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda and you advocate starting war, maybe even world war, by taking the same attack and blaming it on Assad. President Barack Hussein Obama has been supporting terrorism. The United States has been funding and aiding organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda for many years now--the same enemy we're supposed to be defeating on the battlefield.

They went after state department officials. They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House - their own people! They went after anti-war groups. They went after US companies that do international business around the world. They went after US banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs like the red cross and people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few anti-war civil rights groups...Now here's the big one...June 20th interview on Boiling Frogs...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPyxeqcCjkc (full 1hr+ radio interview)  4. **Cornell West:** "We elected a black president and that means we are less racist now than we used to be. That's beautiful. But when you look at the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow: levels of massive unemployment and the decrepit unemployment system, indecent housing: white supremacy is still operating in the US, even with a brilliant black face in a high place called the White House. He is a brilliant, charismatic black brother. He's just too tied to Wall Street. And at this point he is a war criminal. You can't meet every Tuesday with a killer list and continually have drones drop bombs. You can do that once or twice and say: 'I shouldn't have done that, I've got to stop.' But when you do it month in, month out, year in, year out  that's a pattern of behaviour. I think there is a chance of a snowball in hell that he will ever be tried, but I think he should be tried and I said the same about George Bush. These are war crimes. We suffer in this age from an indifference toward criminality and a callousness to catastrophe when it comes to poor and working people."http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/13/cornel-west-they-say-i-am-unamerican  5. **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles."

I know. Because I was eyewitness to the very foundations of a persistent surveillance state greatly expanded in the deepest of secrecy right after 9/11. I was there at the beginning."

The intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war." http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/  8. **Tegan Mathis**: "America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy. In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade...The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise! ...But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy. Here's the other thing: Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination. Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)...Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President. When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about. With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP). In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins. That's really all there is to it.

These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it...When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?  That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.

I certainly have doubts that he was motivated to do that by himself. Im not sure if anybody else was involved. I dont go down that road, with respect to the grassy knoll theory and all of that, but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald. I think he was inspired somewhere by something, but I cant pin anything down on that. Ive never spent a lot of time on it. But I think, after a certain period of time, and that period of time may well have passed, **it is totally appropriate for a country like the United States to open up the files** on whatever history can be shed light on. I think that is appropriate. It has to be done in the right way, by the right entities or people, but certainly by a valid historian or for some valid analysis; I think that everybody would benefit."  http://www.parade.com/226397/parade/john-kerry-i-have-serious-doubts-that-lee-harvey-oswald-acted-alone-the-day-jfk-died/      "Intelligence is a sacred cow...The CIA isn't worth a damn." --Nixon  Nixon fired Richard Helms on Nov. 20, 1972 but allowed Helms to stay on until March 1973. On Nov. 21, Nixon appointed his own man to the CIA--James Schlesinger, and told him to "Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They've got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers."  Schlesinger then sent out a memo at the Agency part of which read:  I have ordered all senior operating officials of this Agency to report to me immediately on any activities now going on, or that have gone on in the past, which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of this Agency.  I hereby direct every person presently employed by CIA to report to me on any such activities of which he has knowledge. I invite all ex-employees to do the same. Anyone who has such knowledge should call...and say that he wishes to tell me about "activities outside CIA's charter."      "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary *could be invented*. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." (emphasis mine)  --George F. Kennan in preface of Norman Cousins's 1987 book The Pathology of Power  The implications of this quote definitely startled me a bit when I first came across these words about a year ago. After looking up his wikipedia and learning Kennan was a career diplomat and historian--he seemed to be an influential insider who helped mold the Truman Doctrine and thrusted the U.S. into the Cold War. But Kennan was more than a player in creating U.S. foreign policy after WWII--he was actually at vital meetings that helped create a brutal, under-handed agency mindframe that was often out of control.  It wasn't until I read **Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** (2007) that Kennan lost the gentlemanly diplomatic facade and was exposed as something quite sinister. The book contains a quote from a 1948 secret report which was sent to the U.S. State Dept, the White House and the Pentagon in which Kennan called for "the inauguration of organized political warfare". Another memo sent to Sec. of Defense Forrestal called for the formation of "a guerrilla warfare corps". Obviously, these are much different purposes than what the original function of the CIA was stated to be--an intelligence agency updating the President on world events.  Even if you know some of the sordid details of the CIA--Tim Weiner's book *Legacy of Ashes* will make it quite clear that Kennan's memos were taken seriously--and if only HALF of what Tim Weiner writes is true then America has been subjected to the biggest CON JOB ever. The book weighs in at 809 pages with almost 200 pages of notes/sources and much of the info is from the CIA's own files. It begins with the end of WWII and proceeds chronologically without getting bogged down in code names. Direct quotes are used often, sometimes they even jump off the page: "We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't know what Communism meant. (CIA pilot Al Pope)".  After reading the first 60 pages it's stunning how the CIA was able to disregard all laws and procedures in the U.S. to get initial funding. For the first year or two Wall Street bankers were asked to chip in by sending a million or so overseas--then they could mark a special code on their tax form and write it off. Other familiar names quickly enter the picture--Allan Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Richard Helms, Richard Bissell. The drive for power was matched by the increase in funding--by 1948 the CIA had somehow ransacked 5% of the Marshall Plan money which came out to $680 million over 4 years through a secret clause.  So, right from the start, the CIA finances were crooked, Americans--often even the President and congress-- unaware. The stated mission of intelligence gathering was taking a backseat for much higher stakes of assassination, funding/training militia groups--laws simply did not apply in any way to the CIA. The Agency was gambling and it's actions were often sloppy and self-defeating. The enemy was anyone who didn't openly reject communism and bend over for American business. From Japan to Iran to Guatemala to the Congo--the Agency poured in cash to political parties and journalists. If that didn't work the proper militias or henchmen were supplied with weapons and hired.  As I pondered the first three chapters of Legacy of Ashes two questions raced through my mind: can the U.S. possibly be much deeper in debt than the $17 Trillion they are telling us? Secondly, could 9/11 have been perpetrated by the CIA to destroy (permanently) financial records and to further fund the defense/intelligence sectors?  The reason I ask these questions is because of the enormous economic fraud from the inception of the CIA which was perpetrated by the Dulles brothers and the Wall Street bankers who backed the Agency. On top of that is the fact that the CIA is but one of a myriad of defense and intelligence arms of the U.S. and you have to question why Americans have not demanded an open audit immediately. Just in the intelligence/homeland security field there are now well over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors churning out over 50,000 reports a year. The Dept. of Defense has no actual audit in recent memory--though there are rumors an audit was made in 1993. No one has ever seen an actual audit for the CIA (let alone the entire defense/intelligence budget). Even today, the CIA's budget total is written on a piece of paper and then shown to a senior senator of the Intelligence Committee--no one else (outside of the CIA and possibly the President). Now multiply that process 20 or 30 times for all the other major U.S. Government agencies.  *Legacy of Ashes* proves the President has often been oblivious to the plans being played out by the CIA. Justice has been subverted--every law in the U.S. and internationally has been laughed at and spat upon while the party goes on in CIA mansions around the world. After just one dozen years of existence the CIA had played the politics of fear so successfully that Eisenhower was giving the OK to assassinate Lumumba (leader of Congo) and Fidel Castro in just one meeting. There's a reason they won't release most of the files for 50 or 60 years--because the citizens of the U.S. and the world would demand an actual investigation (one which doesn't involve puppets).  The dangerous threat these defense and intelligence agencies present to freedom and democracy--especially when added to the Edward Snowden revelations--should stop you in your tracks. I highly suggest you read the book and seriously consider the implications of these agencies being allowed such an extreme lack of accountability. In the end even Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had many regrets over their dealings with the Agency--Truman regretted creating it and Eisenhower even blurted out "I would like to resign" after he had been burned (and exposed) by a CIA operation which involved the U2 spy plane.  ---------------------------------------------  *Kennan (1904-2005) was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by (you guessed it) GHW Bush in 1989.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine  Truman's CIA Editorial 12-22-63... http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html  Truman's CIA Documents in Presidential Library   https://app.box.com/s/8b408e6999f8799dfd0a/1/251450825/7945196064/1  Carl Bernstein's 1977 article "The CIA and the Media" http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php    "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary *could be invented*. Anything else would be an *unacceptable shock* to the American economy." (emphasis mine)  --George F. Kennan in preface of Norman Cousins's 1987 book *The Pathology of Power*  The implications of this quote definitely startled me a bit when I first came across these words about a year ago. After looking up his wikipedia and learning Kennan was a career diplomat and historian--he seemed to be an influential insider who helped mold the Truman Doctrine and thrusted the U.S. into the Cold War. But Kennan was more than a player in creating U.S. foreign policy after WWII--he was actually at vital meetings  that helped create a brutal, under-handed agency mindframe that was often out of control.   It wasn't until I read **Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA**(2007) that Kennan lost the gentlemanly diplomatic facade and was exposed as something quite sinister. The book contains a quote from a 1948 secret report which was sent to the U.S. State Dept, the White House and the Pentagon in which Kennan called for "the inauguration of organized political warfare". Another memo sent to Sec. of Defense Forrestal called for the formation of "a guerrilla warfare corps". Obviously, these are much different purposes than what the original function of the CIA was stated to be--an *intelligence* agency updating the President on world events.   Even if you know some of the sordid details of the CIA--Tim Weiner's book *Legacy of Ashes* will make it quite clear that Kennan's memos were taken seriously--and if only HALF of what Tim Weiner writes is true then America has been subjected to the biggest CON JOB ever. The book weighs in at 809 pages with almost 200 pages of notes/sources and much of the info is from the CIA's own files. It begins with the end of WWII and proceeds chronologically without getting too bogged down in code names. Direct quotes are used often, sometimes they even jump off the page: "We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't know what Communism meant. (CIA pilot Al Pope)".   After reading the first 60 pages it's stunning how the CIA was able to disregard all laws and procedures in the U.S. to get initial funding. For the first year or two Wall Street bankers were asked to chip in by sending a million or so overseas--then they could mark a special code on their tax form and write it off. Other familiar names quickly enter the picture--Allan Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Richard Helms, Richard Bissell. The drive for power was matched by the increase in funding--by 1948 the CIA had somehow ransacked 5% of the Marshall Plan money which came out to $680 million over 4 years through a secret clause.   So, right from the start, the CIA finances were crooked, Americans--often even the President and congress-- unaware. The stated mission of intelligence was taking a backseat for much higher stakes of assassination, funding/training militia groups--laws simply did not apply in any way to the Agency. The Agency was gambling and it's actions were often sloppy and self-defeating. The enemy was anyone who didn't openly reject communism and bend over for American business. From Japan to Iran to Guatemala to the Congo--the Agency poured in cash to political parties and journalists. If that didn't work the proper militias or henchmen were supplied and hired.  As I pondered the first three chapters of *Legacy of Ashes* two questions raced through my mind: can the U.S. possibly be much deeper in debt than the $17 Trillion they are telling us? Secondly, could 9/11 have been perpetrated by the CIA to destroy (permanently) financial records and to further fund the defense/intelligence sectors?  The reason I ask these questions is because of the enormous economic fraud from the inception of the CIA which was perpetrated by the Dulles brothers and the Wall Street bankers who backed the Agency. On top of that is the fact that the CIA is but one of a myriad of defense and intelligence arms of the U.S. and you have to question why Americans have not demanded an open audit immediately. Just in the intelligence/homeland security field there are now well over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors churning out over 50,000 reports a year. The Dept. of Defense has no actual audit in recent memory--though there are rumors an audit was made in 1993. No one has ever seen an actual audit for the CIA (let alone the entire defense/intelligence budget). Even today, the CIA's budget total is written on a piece of paper and then shown to a senior senator of the Intelligence Committee--no one else (outside of the CIA and possibly the President). Now multiply that process 20 or 30 times for all the other major U.S. Government agencies.  *Legacy of Ashes* proves the President has often been oblivious to the plans being played out by the CIA. Justice has been subverted--every law in the U.S. and internationally has been laughed at and spat upon while the party goes on in CIA mansions around the world. After just one dozen years of existence the CIA had played the politics of fear so successfully that Eisenhower was giving the OK to assassinate Lumumba (leader of Congo) and Fidel Castro in just one meeting. There's a reason they won't release most of the files for 50 or 60 years--because the citizens of the U.S. and the world would demand an actual investigation (one which doesn't involve puppets).  The dangerous threat these defense and intelligence agencies present to freedom and democracy--especially when added to the Edward Snowden revelations--should stop you in your tracks. I highly suggest you read the book and seriously consider the implications of these agencies being allowed such an extreme lack of accountability. In the end even Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had many regrets over their dealings with the Agency--Truman regretted *creating* it and Eisenhower even blurted out "I would like to resign" after he had been burned (and exposed) by a CIA operation which involved the U2 spy plane.  *Kennan (1904-2005) was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by (you guessed it) GHW Bush in 1989.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine     do you honestly think that after 50 years the American press is going to tell you the TRUTH???  there may be journalists who tried--but in the end it is the editors   publishers decision what to print.  we know from Russ Tice that the editors just run to the government to get approval--so QUIT watching American media--it's PROPAGANDA.  there is a reason "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" was made in England.  there is a reason "The Dark Side of JFK" was published in Europe.  the TRUTH cuts too deep. the TRUTH shakes the walls at the the three letter agencies.  the TRUTH will NOT be revealed on cnn or cbs or abc...  ________________________  29 Rare   Out-of-Print Books (free pdf) by Robert Morrow: 29 books FREE!!! My favorite so far is How JFK Was Killed by Joachin Joestin (who also wrote The Dark Side of LBJ)...also includes a list of over 1,000 books on the JFK Assassination...President Hoover's writings on the CIA... https://app.box.com/s/8b408e6999f8799dfd0a     "The NSA must be shattered into a billion pieces and it's leaders who violated the law immediately brought to justice. It must be defunded and **the thievery must stop**. Over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors have **screwed the taxpayers** out of TRILLIONS since 9/11. On top of that, the American taxpayer has been funding Industrial Espionage for private corporations. As a **Final Insult**, millions of Americans have repeatedly been spied on and victimized without due process of law being followed."   For example: how did the government cover up the JFK plot?  EASY--they intimidated witnesses and monitored everyone's phone   mail. Certainly makes killing those who knew too much a lot easier. Makes "journalists"  much easier to control as well. Covering-up 200 deaths over the next 15 years becomes pretty easy too.  We are finally finding out the lengths the government will go to control us--by spying on Martin Luther King, active U.S. senators, public figures like John Lennon and Muhammad Ali. Even the Smothers Brothers QUIT rather than continue having their work chiseled down every week by the TV censors. I'll bet even Oliver Stone is thinking about WHY he had such a hard time making "Apocalypse Now". No wonder it was so easy for the "film reviewers" to berate and belittle "JFK" when it came out--they most likely had the script for months before seeing the movie.  Then there's the journalists--who have been spied on, harassed and sometimes even killed. From Dorothy Killeen to Michael Hastings--I even recently saw "Dirty Wars" by Jeremy Scahill where he is harassed during the filming of his documentary. Ever wonder why reporters don't "follow the money" into the Pentagon or CIA???  It is becoming clear that the "news" is pure propaganda that is approved ultimately by government agencies--there is NO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS--it is a mirage.                   excerpt from washington post/business...  Booz Allen, based in Tysons Corner, has been a local fixture for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defense and intelligence agencies. It even sponsored a local golf tournament  the Booz Allen Classic  between 2004 and 2006. It also became a leader among the contractors supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the government in recent years, including technologists such as Snowden.  Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle Group. It paid **$2.54 billion** for Booz Allen as a deep recession took hold. Fearing the risks of taking on too much debt in the midst of a financial crisis, Carlyle put up **50 percent cash** instead of its normal 30 percent. It borrowed the rest to buy the company, which was then privately held.  Upon the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business was spun off to become Booz   Co., leaving Carlyle with a government-only company. After the split, the new Booz Allen Hamilton established an **incentive-based compensation** structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firms success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly, **you got to eat what you killed**. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-11/business/39896957_1_carlyle-group-nsa-firm  -----------------------------  excerpt from the guardian june 10, 2013...by julian borger...  **The current director of national intelligence (DNI), James Clapper**, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm's **current vice-chairman, Mike McConnell, was DNI under the George W Bush administration**. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its "rapidly expanding cyber business".  **James Woolsey, a former CIA director** was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI.

Snowden's decision to reveal his identity as a computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, directly handling National Security Agency IT systems, raises significant image problems for the **$6bn company** and its 25,000-strong staff, which has traded on a bond of trust with sensitive clients, particularly the intelligence establishment. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden  also see ... http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-06-23/visualizing-how-booz-allen-hamilton-swallowed-washington  ----------------------------------  and for those that may have forgotten: **On the morning of 9/11/2001 GHW Bush** was at a Carlyle Group meeting in a DC hotel with a close friend of the family--one of the bin Ladens... wonder how much money the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Clappers (etc, etc, etc) have made off of the private defense/intell companies that they pump and milk the U.S. Gov't for...  after the Snowden leaks began there was a doc released by cryptome that was a financial tally of incoming checks for Booz Allen--the payments started Sept. 14th, 2001.  http://cryptome.org/2013/07/Presidents-Spy-Program-Sept14-2001.htm  the link to the **pdf file is at the very very BOTTOM of the page**...also--originally--both of the documents contained Absolutely NO strike-outs!!!  when you open the pdf....Sept. 14, 2001 is on page 152...from what i could see at least 390K was placed in the month of Sept, 2001--there may be more i didn't see...   Top 3 JFK free documentaries on youtube...  1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAnX7atkpyA  2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2agPurqFJk  3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK.

I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys."**  http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/WTKaP.html  Roger Craig's story is a bit painful to read--he was harassed and terrorized by the FBI or the CIA because he was willing to talk to reporters and tell them what he knew...Roger Craig even went a bit further and did some investigative work for Jim Garrison--and in light of the recent NSA/FBI revelations--maybe what he said in his writing will be seen in a new context...

Harry Truman in Washington Post editorial Dec. 22, 1963...(the editorial only ran in the morning edition--it was pulled from other editions)  For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.  I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Some of the complications and embarrassment I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigueand a subject for cold war enemy propaganda.  With all the nonsense put out by Communist propaganda about "Yankee imperialism," "exploitive capitalism," "war-mongering," "monopolists," in their name-calling assault on the West, the last thing we needed was for the CIA to be seized upon as something akin to a subverting influence in the affairs of other people.  I well knew the first temporary director of the CIA, Adm. Souers, and the later permanent directors of the CIA, Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg and Allen Dulles. These were men of the highest character, patriotism and integrityand I assume this is true of all those who continue in charge.  But there are now some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President, and that whatever else it can properly perform in that special fieldand that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere. We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.                          otherwise, how would the U.S. have over 1,000 foreign military bases?  otherwise, why would the U.S. only take military action against smaller countries with inferior armies and weapons?  i may be wrong about the number of foreign military bases--but whatever that number is--we still have a lot of them...even our base in guantanamo is based on stealing and bullying--i think we acquired it  at the end of the Spanish-American War in 1903--the lease may have been signed under duress and does not end (which is illegal) and the payment is $2,000 per year...supposedly, Cuba has cashed only one of these checks and has demanded the lease be torn up ever since.  edit: the contract with cuba was upped to $4,000 in 1934--since then only 1 check has been cashed.   1. Comments by **Tegan Mathis** (posted in comment section of an article titled "JFK-RFK-MLK??? The Questions Remain" by Russ Baker on whowhatwhy.com)...  If you want to know the truth about the JFK assassination, here it is: After the Bay of Pigs, the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Peace Speech, the orders to withdraw troops from Vietnam, etc., America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy. In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade. The Cuban Brigade was the army of Cuban exiles who carried out the Bay of Pigs operation in 1961. The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise!  But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy. **Here's the other thing:** Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination. Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.) Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President.  When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about. With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP). In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins. That's really all there is to it. But if you want to know more, read my book, Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In. Or, if it's easier for you to believe that Alexander Haig was a social worker to the Cuban Brigade, that's cool too.  **2.** Comments by **Preston James, Ph D** (posted in comments of article titled "The JFK War: The Case of Federal Judge John Tunheim" by Dr. James Fetzer on VeteransToday.com)...  Excellent article. The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it.  When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The **executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence** is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?  That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.  **3.** "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles."  --**Richard Belzer** in May 10, 2013 politico.com interview with Patrick Gavin promoting his new book *Hit List* (watch last 3 minutes of interview)...      "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, *until some other adversary could be invented*.

"The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds.  3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam.  These 3 films expose the shocking events in many ways the American public was unable to see at the time. The public was not allowed to see the Zapruder film until the mid-1970's (there were only still images released until then). Even 50 years later, there is a great deal of files the government still will NOT release--as if 50 YEARS LATER it is still a national security issue. The films often present evidence the JFK assassination was a COUP D'ETAT and an action which allowed the military, intelligence, financial, and energy sectors to expand their will upon the American people--and the world. You might totally disagree with this conclusion--but to NOT view these films (and do other research) would be a short-sighted failure to question the *official* government version. Authorities have only released info in a painstakingly slow drip-by-drip manner--and has treated Americans like SERFS who do not deserve to know the truth about their own history.  All 3 films dive fearlessly into territories that are difficult for many of us because they challenge our beliefs--which can be threatening. Certainly, to truly begin to understand the events it requires a great deal of thought and a vast storage of memory--but these documentaries take giant leaps into asking the right questions and should leave your brain cells rattling a bit as you realize some of the many theories which directly EXTINGUISH the OSWALD MYTH. (if you have not seen them all docs are FREE on youtube--just be advised to make sure you are watching the FULL version...example: the full version of MLK (part 6) in "E of R" is hard to find and also has rare, shocking photos of lynchings which are presented in a historical context to show the vicious racism which existed into the middle of the 20th century).   	188
 I'll never begin to understand the people in those comments. Even the direst homophobes shouldn't want a portion of the population not to get healthcare. It boggles the mind how people can hate so strongly.         We believe the HBP is not a well conceived or implemented project and that it is ill suited to be the centerpiece of European neuroscience.  Ouch. Wonder how that'll affect the US Brain Project...       ...in 2012. Love it.   Scumbag BICEP team. Getting us all excited over nothing.   It's amazing that these robots are realistic and detailed enough to "fool" real animals. In a way, this is also a victory for materials science...        TIL: Curiosity was in fact the first rover to ever die from cancer.   Wait, I thought all cosmic radiation was EM radiation. This is going to suck for Mars One.    Here's the original scientific paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724938                       	19
 If your a fan of It Follows I highly recommend you watch The Guest. It is a action/horror/thriller with a lot of the same vibes and similar music. I personally love It Follows because of the pool scene, the music, and the last shot which sticks with you   	1
 After asking, apparently it was a typo. Meant insect                     You got me there!                                             Of course! I don't think they'll allow you to pose that way at work               The eradication of them became a must  	28
 my husband was all "what are you laughing at"   same way    That is either cheating or intention to cheat   face looks like a lady   so sorry for your loss but at least he is no longer suffering :(   oww   oh hell no he used the f word?   MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND, UTERUS!   if you do anal enough, eventually this WILL happen.  they're supposed to pretend they don't see it  and then you toss the sheets in the washer and pretend it never happened :)   We get customers in our store yelling at their parents and I just want to smack the shit out of them.    What are you supposed to do, fold the pizza over on itself?   dammit, I want chocolate.   next time call the cops   ALSO it doesn't help that even though we are never supposed to waive late fees, the manager almost ALWAYS waives the $15 late fees.   Yea we get the same customers going to lien over and over again, they pay the bare minimum to keep their shit from being auctioned and then 3 months later we have to go through the same process all over again.   Yea the thing is after being three days late on payment you get a $15 late fee, after like two weeks the late fee goes up to like $50 and eventually they end up owing ridiculous amounts we know are never going to get paid. So we usually make a deal- pay us half and get your shit out so we don't have to pay for an auction that's only going to gain maybe $20 dollars per unit and then we can rent out the room to a new customer   Also we have to mail them certified letters informing them that their stuff is gonna be auctioned if they don't come pay so many days in advance of the actual auction date. Because the giant red lock on the storage unit wasn't sufficient notice.    If it's in lien status it already has a lock on it. We lock customers out of their units until they pay for the past due rent. Of course nobody actually pays the full amount until it comes time for auction and then they call and whine and demand we let them get their stuff for partial payments.   YAY! We have 11 units up for auction.  SUCH fun! I imagine the calls are going to start coming in any day now. Unfortunately my manager is a pushover and he's probably going to get like $150 settlements on $600 storage bills.   I lost my "purity" to a water raft ride at an amusement park. I stood up and fell down on the metal bars crotch first.   It's fucking creepy.   So this guy has years of experience with menstrual pads?    ingrown pubes are the worst thing ever   yea I would have called mall security or the cops.   still not going to go see it   "LOTP: But [other store] does it for free!"  Then GO THERE!   you look so amazing with red hair!    No internet. Wants xbox online.   *rofl*   We have signs that say "please return trucks here" and yet every time rather than parking the trucks in the return lane, they either just park them in the customer parking lot or they go to where they originally picked up the truck and drop it off there. We sometimes have to go across the street and search for lost trucks/vans/trailers. We tell the people where to return them but I guess they just ignore us.   I have not changed my last name. it has not been an issue except we had to clarify that yes we were married and yes we had different last names at the hospital when I filled out paperwork before having surgery.   Really hope she gets better *hugs*   same   that sounds delicious   what an asshole. You're supposed to repeat the order so the customer is sure you got it right.....   I also get this. I get pains in my back and down the back of my thighs. It's worse when I am at work and have to be on my feet all day and bending over to clean stuff.   Oh my god, I'm so sorry :(    Yea it sounds like he was a trap, neuter, release. The best way to get him comfortable with you is to continue feeding him. Make sure he knows that you are the one bringing him food. Hang out while he eats. Eventually he will get used to your presence.   yes   why the fuck would you buy the cheapest item in the store and pay for it with a $100 bill?   Yes. Everytime I get a new cat or take one of my cats somewhere they do the same thing for a few days.  By tomorrow or so they will be ready to explore the new place   It will probably take them a few days to get used to the move and being in a "new" environment.    It seems like your life would be a lot easier if you would just accept yourself for the way you are.   what's wrong with her? take her to a vet! :(   hope she feels better   hahaha yea THAT they can probably talk me into    hunt that old man down, he has some amazing stories to tell!   I literally have to throw my husband's socks/underwear because otherwise he will keep wearing them.   "Woukd you, if you found a great guy from a poor background who had never had the opportunity to go to college or take unpaid internships but instead had worked hard from age 17 for his own food and shelter and had eventually managed to get himself a place and a car etc but was still considered below average or poor in terms of earnings, just reject him?"  No I married him.  Would I recommend that women mate for financial stability? Absolutely. If you are planning on having a child, it is ideal to find an environment where they are going to have a good education so they don't end up perpetuating the cycle of poverty.   I realize that many people have children while working minimum wage jobs but I want more for my kids than that.   And because people are taking the time to send me hate mail because I am projecting my feminist ideals on relationships, YES I am a feminist. I work for a living. I expect my husband to do the same. I do housecleaning, so I expect him to cook. I expect him to respect my opinion.  I don't want to be a stay at home mom. I saw my grandmothers do this and live horrible lives being treated like dirt by their husbands. I would rather be single the rest of my life than have someone treat me like that.   All the love in the world isn't going to help you pay your bills. I am not saying I am materialistic. I married someone knowing he didn't make a lot of money. But I can completely understand anyone wanting to make sure the electric doesn't get shut off and that there is food on the table. It would nice to be comfortable. Not rich, but not living from paycheck to paycheck.   She did leave the hospital AMA. You have the right to do that. They then turned around and got a court order against her. She ended up having to go to three hospitals in order to find one (moses taylor) that would let her give birth vaginally. I understand they are worried about lawsuits but that shouldn't be an excuse to give a cesarean to everyone that walks in the door.   A lot of the hospitals in this area are catholic ones. I am really leaning more towards having a midwife and in the instance that I need medical intervention we have a hospital like two blocks away. I just don't want them to "push" having an epidural, an episiotomy, a cesarean, etc on me when I don't want it. In addition to the court ordered cesarean, I believe another woman sued for an unwanted episiotomy a few years ago in this area. I just found out about this today while looking for local midwives.  These two cases were enough to seal the deal as far as my not liking hospitals.  I just had a laparoscopy the other day and the nurse ordered me to go to the bathroom after I had already went. I was waiting for like 2 hours and in pain and cranky. This nurse proceeded to argue with me that she didn't want to do a catheter and risk infection. She didn't listen to me that I had literally peed right before she showed up. If they are not going to believe me when I said I peed already, why are they going to believe me when I say I don't want a cesarean?  This hospital was in the same town as the case where they got the court order against the woman not wanting a cesarean. Like I said I just found out about this today and it's not really comforting or soothing my hospital fears at all.   Yes but when men are conditioned to think -if I buy the diamond ring, the flowers, the fancy dinner, I will get to have sex. Then they start expecting it and it's not okay. It's better for women everywhere to make it clear that we are sexual beings. Not because we want sugar daddies but because we genuinely like having sex, or if we are in a long term relationship because we love the person we are with.     Yea I edited my original post too because I am tired of explaining what I meant for the third time. I should have added a comma or something    She signed a piece of paper stating she would not sue.  I understand the doctor being unwilling due to insurance/liability issues but to get a court order? Keep in mind this is right down the road from me. I actually have my obgyn in the same town where this happened. It's horrifying.    I also want to make sure (if I go to an actual hospital vs. hiring a midwife and having a home birth) that my husband is allowed to be in the room and an active participant in all decisions.  That is another reason I am very weary of the hospitals in my area, northeast PA as I have heard nothing but horror stories of the Scranton and Wilkes-Barre maternity wards.   Also there is a movie, The Business of Being Born, which details how in the 1950s c-sections became standard practice and patient's wishes/rights were not respected. Some women were actually tied to hospital beds   My husband's ex would not have sex with him without getting something else in return. I think they ended up going without sex for like 6 months. And then she ended up cheating on him.   I see nothing wrong with casual sex as long as you are being honest and not lying to each other   I didn't say it was but if you are married to someone, you should be having sex with them out of love and not for monetary compensation   http://allnurses.com/ob-gyn-nursing/forced-csection-54674.html  I am NOT going to any of the hospitals in my area, their c-section rate is something like 30% and the WHO says that it should be around 15%   There's a hospital near me that actually got a court order to force this woman to have a c-section against her will. Thankfully she left the hospital against medical advice and went to a different hospital where she had a vaginal birth with NO complications   What I was trying to say is if you love someone you should enjoy having sex with them and not just because you get some monetary compensation out of it. I was not trying to say you have to have sex with someone you love only. You can have sex with whoever you want as long as you are doing it of your own free will   If they want to be prostitutes that's fine, but to act like they aren't doing the same thing as a legitimate sex worker is hypocrisy   Again, not trying to say you can ONLY have sex with someone you are in love with.  BUT if you are in love with someone you should have sex with them out of love not for money or favors   also you missed the part where I said "you genuinely enjoy doing it" technically you would fall under that category    Absolutely not. Sex workers are different. They are upfront about being prostitutes   I got married :)   I have a real issue with that. I feel that they shouldn't do unneccesary surgeries without consent, and if the dad is there he should have to sign as well. I also have an issue with the HUGE amount of cesarean sections that have been performed over the years when they were not needed. I don't care if you are a doctor, unless my life or the baby's life are in danger you should get my permission before you cut open my body! I've always been anxious about going to a hospital for delivery for those two reasons.   Good to know. I've never had a baby or worked in a hospital so I had no idea lol   I had genital warts as well. Thankfully after the colposcopy and wart burning which were both agonizingly painful might I add, the hpv eventually went away on its own. That was 10 years ago and I've had normal paps ever since.  The thing about hpv is, unless there are physical signs such as genital warts and or abnormal cervical cells there really is no way of knowing. I'm really glad they came out with the vaccine AFTER I already had hpv lol.   Yea after 90 days we have to send a certified letter to people telling them their storage unit will be auctioned off. Of course usually the letters end up returned because they gave us the wrong address, but that's not our fault.   why would you do this? wouldn't you have to touch your own shit?   Personally I would feel really insulted if I knew my husband was deliberately "throwing" the game so I would win.   I wish I had waited until I was in a long term commited relationship instead of just having random flings. How long have they been dating?  Personally I wish I would have waited until I was 18 because I was not ready to have protected sex with a long term partner. Instead I ended up with hpv and genital warts which I ended up giving to my first long term partner. Words cannot describe how shitty I felt and I wished I had waited. So please please ask her to use condoms at the very least.     In addition to birth control I would really encourage the use of condoms   Where did you end up finding them? I may need to buy some   This is the exact same problem I have! I need someone to hold the trash can so I can lift the bag out, because they cram it full of so much shit it gets vacuum sealed in there.      I was at work saturday. I was off yesterday. Came in this morning and our customer bathroom toilet brush has gone AWOL.  It's USED. Someone stole our used toilet brush. And now I have nothing to clean the toilet bowls with.  Sigh.   Coupon 50% off all Pizzas at Menu Price  Online Only  I got a large pizza for $7 so it would be a good time to PIF!   We are supposed to fill out these surveys giving our opinions of the management. I know they don't really want the truth but this is what I would say.    Part time employees should not be getting overtime while the rest of us are having our hours cut to 1 or 2 days a week because we are over on payroll and the manager lets employees work whenever and as long as they want.  I cannot pay my bills with two days a week and yet we just hired more people!  The manager shows up at 7 and consistently leaves by 11.  Employees who have been with the company for years are making the same wages as people who have no experience and were just hired.  It is no wonder why people are quitting for better jobs when they can start off at $14.50.  Most of the employees sit around talking all day and texting while the hard workers run the store, doing their own jobs in addition to everyone else's work, including the manager's.   We are constantly getting people coming into our store or calling and asking for "Frank" or "Joe" or 15 other people who do not and have never worked there. The only thing I can fathom is that if they call the store and we let it ring four times it goes to the call center in arizona. The call center people are morons. They are always scheduling truck reservations for trucks we don't have, hitch appointments on days when there is no hitch mechanic in the store, and generally making our job 50% harder, especially when the customer comes in and we have to tell them that the call center screwed up. We don't really have that truck available. "But the lady on the phone said!"    Well sir that lady on the phone is a moron. She is over 2000 miles away and is too lazy to look at the computer to see that this particular truck is on the other side of the state.  Anyway, we get this at least once a day. "Is so and so here?"  Who?  "I talked to so and so." Nobody by that name works here. "I just called here and talked to them 5 minutes ago!"  What's better is when after explaining how the call center works the person STILL thinks that one of the employees was the one on the phone and that somehow we are lying to them or playing a trick on them.   TL;DR Just because you talk to someone on the phone doesn't mean they actually work here.   plus free shipping on orders of $50 or more and 3 free samples with purchase of $5 or more  http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/   Looking for sites that sell makeup and take Paypal!!

I am trying to determine my next snack box subscription.  I got graze and the portions were really small. I wanted to try munchpak or oyatsubox because I love foreign treats and they can often be pretty expensive to ship overseas.  I like that munchpak is less money and has treats from ALL over but I would be pretty mad if I got all/mostly US available snacks. If I wanted that I could walk to the gas station/grocery store.  The oyatsubox seems to be more expensive but it is ALL Japanese candy. I wouldn't have to worry about getting local crap like fritos/skittles/etc. Has anyone tried one or both of these services? What did you think? Thanks :)   I had already unsubscribed but I thought I'd give them another chance. WRONG.  Not only did I get TEA and a PERFUME SAMPLE for the millionth time but the beauty protector oil sample had leaked all over the box and everything in it.  I am done with them. Cashed in my points and not giving them another dime!   Does anyone have this? I want it sooo much but I am trying to not buy makeup :(  was thinking of using my birchbox points so I don't have to pay full price. $49 seems kind of expensive.   Just signed up for graze (for the free box, heh)  Unlike julep, you can cancel anytime online so I will try it out and then see if it's worth it. Has anyone else tried this? Are the snacks any good? A lot of them sound really yummy but the portions look tiny.      We had a customer sitting in our waiting area, waiting for his hitch to be installed. He brought lunch (mountain dew and a sandwich) and apparently nail clippers. Lunch I can understand.  Bringing a book I can understand. But he just started clipping his nails. In public.  Do that at home, in your bathroom! And I have to clean them up once he leaves. Ew.   Was listening to kdge and they played an ad for some haunted santa thing in plano??? Anyone heard of this?

Disclaimer: The following post will probably be disgusting.  Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.  Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.    I went to investigate.  "Why wouldn't they flush?" I asked myself, sighing.  Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.    My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.   I held my nostrils closed and flushed. Nothing.  It won't budge.  My coworker tried flushing.  Nothing.    I ran from the room, gagging.  The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere. It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.  My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.  I ran for the cleaning supplies.  In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.  He said he was going to upload it on youtube. He was going to title it "It won't go down."  I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd. It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.  I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom. Sorry!  I taped it to the door.  Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??  I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.  That's disgusting, he replied.   Yes, yes it is, I thought.  Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.  I googled "poop won't flush" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole. It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.  After much plunging and toilet bowl cleaner soaking and toilet bowl scrubber scrubbing, I finally defeated the shit demon.   I felt like a champion.   I left the door propped open so the bathroom would air out.  Still I warned everyone to use the ladies' room.   I'm sick of spending $15 for 4 refill cartridges for expensive razors. Currently my husband uses gilette fusion and I am using venus.  We got him 4 store brand refills for $5 but they don't fit on the actual gilette fusion, so we're going to have to pay 7.99 to buy the damn generic razor.  Other than buying disposable bic soleils, I'm out of ideas. How can I get cheaper razor blades? I'm sick of spending $30 total every time we need refill blades .     I work for a storage/moving truck company.  Today we got a truck back with urine in it.  For once I am glad I work back in storage and not up front because I normally have to clean up the gross stuff. Today someone else gets that honor.   I forgot to make an into post!  I am a married 28 y/o from Scranton, PA  I work at a storage /moving truck rental company with a bunch of guys and don't really have time for much makeup before work.  Normally I just do eyeliner, bb cream, and some kind of lip balm/gloss. Also I have to clean out storage units all day so by the end of the day I am gross and exhausted.  I am really in love with any kind of foot scrub because my feet get really sore from being on my feet all day. I also use a lot of makeup/cleansing wipes at work when I get a chance and I get really dry hands from cleaning products so I always have some kind of hand cream/lotion in my purse.   On my day off I normally just catch up on house cleaning. Occasionally I still like to glam up however it's not as often as I'd like.   Normally I just tap him a little until he wakes up and stops snoring. but five seconds later he starts snoring again. Sometimes I want to strangle him.         Has anyone seen this? It's based on the Dyatlov Pass Incident.  http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/devils_pass/  Seems pretty cool. I'm either watching that or Escape from Tomorrow.  http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/escape_from_tomorrow_2013/   I'm sick of the damn "Halloween" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" marathons that seem to be going on on cable right now...   I just signed up for the julep free box. I don't really want another monthly subscription- I already have birchbox and I've tried and cancelled my ipsy subscription. Anyway I want my first box but after that I plan on cancelling. How exactly do I do that? I'm looking all over their site and can't seem to find that option.  Thanks!!!   I started taking spironolactone two weeks ago because I have high testosterone and hirsutism / acne.  I am only on 25 mg twice a day. I did some online searches and it seems like the typical dose for acne is 100 mg while for overweight patients and those with excessive facial hair the dosage may be 250-300 mg.  I'm thinking about calling my endocrinologist to see if he will up my dosage. But from what I've read it can take up to two months to see results. So far my face is still broken out and I'm still having to shave every day, sometimes twice. :(   Also I am looking into getting a Tria hair removal laser for Christmas. It's supposed to be the closest to professional laser removal you can get at home.  I don't have the money to go get it done and it's too embarassing, I'd rather do it at home. I've already had to shave my face every day for the past 5 years, I hope something can be done. Even if it's not permanent if it just slows the hair growth it would be worth $450. It is a pretty big investment though, and if it doesn't work I don't know if I'll be able to get a refund.  Does anyone have any experience with either of these? Has anyone had any success with  getting rid of unwanted facial hair ? I'm also on birth control so the spiro combined with that should reduce my acne but the facial hair is my biggest concern.   Has anyone tried clomid? My obgyn was trying to get me to ovulate. Provera didn't bring my period back even though they tried it twice. I did finally get my period after taking birth control but if I want to get pregnant I am going to have to stop taking that and maybe try clomid instead to bring on ovulation. Anyway just wondering if anyone has any experience. Thanks!  	104
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I'm looking to upgrade a Mac Pro 4,1 with at GTX 970. Mac Pro has 2 x 6 pin power supply leads which provide 75 watts each, so I'm wondering if anyone is aware of a GTX 970 variant which accepts 2 6 pin power leads rather than a single 8 pin.   Have tried an ASUS Strix with a 6 pin to 8 pin converter, and it works but the card doesn't run anywhere near full power. Novabench scored it at 189 when other similar cards score in 1400 range.

I currently have twin OC 9800 GTX+ in a non SLI setup, which lets the machine down these days.                                 In an earlier post I mentioned that I'd been an F1 for the better part of four decades and that this period included Mansell vs Prost, Senna vs Prost, Hakkinen vs Schumacher, Villeneuve vs Pironi, Jones vs Reutemann, Hill vs. Schumacher and much more.  Some of my favorite moments are [Mansell carrying Senna](http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1991_mans_asenn_silv.jpg) over the finish line in the 1991 British Grand Prix, [Hakkien overtaking Schui at Spa in 2000](http://youtu.be/-eE3gCy5zvM) and Lauda's title deciding 11th to 2nd comeback drive at [Estoril in 1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Portuguese_Grand_Prix)  What are your favorite memories of seasons past?                                                   Many people think that distribution of money is to blame for the troubles on the F1 grid. This is a brief explanation of how the money actually works (and why even distribution wouldn't make much difference to the mid-field teams).  The profit is split 60/40 in favor of the teams (63% of 1.18 billion in 2012 and around 60% of 1.4 billion in 2013). The remainder is then split again into two types of payment and distributed among the 11 teams after Ferrari receive an ex-gratia payment ( this was $17.5 million in 2013).  - Category 1 payments which are shared EQUALLY if you finish inside the top 10 for 3 years in a row. - Category 2 payments which are based on racing performance but require being in the top 10 WCC at the end of the season.  **2013 Distribution**  - In 2013 10 teams received $34.12 million in Category 1 payments.   - Marusia didn't get anything because it had not yet had three seasons in the top 10.  - Caterham didn't get any Category 2 money because it was outside the top 10.    - Of the teams allegedly in trouble now Sauber got $58 million, Williams $51.2 million, Force India $64.8 million, Lotus $71.62 million.    - Of the bankrupt teams Marussia got $13.6 million, and Caterham $34.12 million.   **Equal shares**  If the fund had been shared equally each team would have received $62 million - which is not enough to make a serious difference to Sauber, Force India or Williams - in-fact Force India and Lotus would have received LESS.  This is a big difference for the bottom two teams, but not much difference for the mid-field ones. F1 teams don't go under for the lack of a few million, they go under for the lack of tens of millions.  **2013 Prize Money List**   - Red Bull $98.97m   - Mercedes $88.72   - Ferrari $96m   - Lotus $71.62m   - McLaren $68.22m   - Force India $64.8m   - Sauber $58m   - Toro Rosso $54.6m   - Williams $51.2m   - Marussia $13.6m   - Caterham $34.12m   To provide some idea of costs, Caterham is spending $60 million a year, Mercedes is spending $300 million. HAAS is entering in 2016 with a planned first season budget of around $200 million.  The real problem is costs, and even then this only applies to teams that don't have any other underlying business backing the team.   I'm in the market for secondhand card.   - It has to be NVidia (its destined for a Mac Pro and drivers are more widely available). - It has to be one card, or so cheap I can afford 2 - no SLI with OSX - It needs to support 3 monitor outputs. - I have a budget of 200.          I've wanted a genuine Mac to replace my somewhat unreliable Triple Monitor Hackintosh for some time, and I've been looking at 2012 Mac Pro's for around 1300.  However I found a 2009 4,1 2.66 GHz Quad Core Xeon/8Mb/GT 120 512Mb at a second hand store for 249, knowing they sell for 4 - 600 on eBay I snapped it up.   It benchmarks  around 8000, my existing system is around 12500. Because its the single core model the only economic upgrades right now are to the 4 core Westmere 3.33 W3580 and an NVIDIA GTX 780 6GB which come in at around 450 which means it will loosely match my Hackintosh minus USB3 and SATA 6Gb.   An upgrade to the 12 core model comes in at 500 with the graphics card and processor that tops out at 1050, at which point I may as well have bought the 2012 model which is better in some respects.  Main pro is that it gives me a genuine Mac to fill in the gap while I save for a 2013 Mac Pro or better. Main con is the loss of SATA 6Gb and USB 3.0.   Help me out Reddit what would you do?           	197
 But...Italy can't top...it's not right...   Downloaded it a couple hours ago and I love it!!    Are you only first discovering the awesome that is magic ocarina????

All of the comments before me are so...technical (and probably correct). I was going to say photoshop and be done with it...now I have to learn...   Lost it at the monster mash.       Thanks! I've decided to just go ahead and jailbreak. There isn't that much to worry about I guess!   This isn't what I think of when I think of the Axis Powers...but it's more accurate than Hetalia...probably...   That was terrible XDD   Where was credit given to 9gag? The watermark? Then 9gag has written us a bibliography.    Reddit, have we really come to taking posts from 9gag? We're still bitching at them for doing the same thing to us.          The control of bamboo. Must be a lovely thing.    I can never get my arms to bend right so I always end up either in a strange position or using a pencil or something...  Well...I guess eyeballs could count. But it's probably not as satisfying as a ball scratch.    That they would. I'd find it surprising for any guy to agree with me.    Yep.      I actually read the whole thing...and about the pics. I think the preview is either legit or accurate. I wouldn't really want pics for the shit lasagna tub though.   The fact that my name is used in the same story as Comic Sans worries me.

Congrats on both achievements!   Me and my friend actually had quite the debate about this. She kept saying green while I insisted black; the glass over the reflective part is green. The actual reflective part is black. What do you think reddit?   Harry Potter plot canyon: Think back to Sorcerer's Stone. Remember how Hagrid got Harry from the house?  Now think up to Deathly Hallows. Snape got Harry.  I always found Harry Potter plot holes the most fun ^_^ ((I was actually hoping I would get to show off this 'discovery' on reddit. I'm not saying I'm the only one who noticed this though.))   Go to the store and buy some of those cone facemasks (I've found a pack of four for $2). Put those on and tie something around your head. Go to every store in the vicinity. Occasionally just stand on the sidewalk. The looks from other people make this the most fun.    The kindergartners at an elementary school in my town (Well, two schools) all have iPads in the classrooms. When I was in kindergarten (not too long ago actually, about about nine years ago), we had blocks. Not legos. Blocks that would connect to each other up and down but you had to tape them together to make cars and such. Not iPads. Yet at my school we have two 6 year old Macs for all of us to share then a bunch of PCs. Kids need to start being kids again.    Want. Miko. Want.

I look back at memories from when I was a kid and since it was a while back, I can only remember a few things. Things I remember about my room are blue, my sisters room is red, and the kitchen is green. Outside is orange or white.    Cool! I never knew there was actually a name for it.       I must say, using reddit as advertisement was a wise choice.    Yes. All the time. I'm usually thinking about Hetalia or such though.    I got my mom a cake...well...I made it.   I would still recreationally sleep and eat.    ...Rammstein memes overload....XD   You...are...a...saint.   Well, really I don't want to take notes to write a script tomorrow...and cleaning is too mainstream.   But tis a valid point. I should indeed get off the internet.    Where was it??? GIVE ALL THE RAMMSTEIN RAGE ENCOUNTER UPVOTES!!!!   Yes...it was a guy that dresses like a woman. I *do* know the difference.   The leg sticking out is really bothering me...   There was a transvestite named Riley addicted to being an adult baby on my strange addiction...striking resemblance too...   Sometimes I do, but then I think of people's intelligence level and one of the most widely known products is a blanket with sleeves. Then I start to think that around 2010 we started going backwards...   Thanks!

When I was younger I always tried to put myself into a state of just consciousness.    Take a snuggie, phone/laptop, and snacks with for the poopy process. Much more relaxing.    Someone better take a cactus over there....      Yes!!! Im always much better with a pen (or liquid pencil), good with a mechanical pencil, and pretty bad with just a pencil.

             Well, that was fast.   Named Arf Vader!   Yeah, but... is the health inspector a zombie too?   Perhaps he just alters his density.   Okay, so he's a legit butcher as well as a creepy zombie brain drug dealer?   In Eobard's defense, he didn't have time to bury Wells anywhere else, nobody suspected Wells was dead, and the first rule of murder is *never move the body*.   Okay. So next week Joe decides to just rob a bank. "Oh, it was... uh... my evil twin. Because there's this super speedy guy, so why not evil twins?"  And the week after that Singh burns down a building. "Oh, that happened because... of... a flaming ghost pig. I mean, there are shapeshifters, so why not ghost pigs?"  Just because weird things can happen, it doesn't follow that they did happen.   But this is the couple that is suing.    How strange would it be for a guy with a phd etc., to donate sperm? Pretty darned strange.  No, not really. You can make good money that way. Lots of people with degrees are unemployed or underemployed. Gotta pay off those student loans *somehow*.   They don't know Wells knows they know, though. Because they're stupid.    I don't think any kid thinks being sick or in pain is "cool", and I'm sure that once they're older than three or so they're aware that this is why people take medicine.   Good job, Eddie, for telling Iris at least part of the truth. You get a cookie.  Everybody else? WHY DO YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT WELLS AT STAR LABS? That can *not* be a good idea. You fools!   That almost looks like it could be a real word.    2024 isn't as future-y as it sounds, not anymore.   Did you think she was just hiding around the corner the whole time...?   That love story certainly would be worse than most, because ew.   No doubt they dropped the curtain on it when they saw her coming up the elevator. Down the elevator?   The kids at elementary school love to play "blastoff" which involves jumping off of things, and the main character's father is, among other things, famous for smuggling a peanut butter sandwich onto the space shuttle because he was tired of astronaut food, even though of course there's the issues of crumbs.   I think it's more important to model appropriate pain management than to model false stoicism.         I can see how you got that idea, but in truth there are people who really will argue, for example, that painkillers are unnecessary during circumcisions because "they can't feel pain" or "it doesn't hurt like it would an adult - they just cry a little and forget".   LOL, it happens :)                           Did you mean to say that you're NOT knocking weed?   No, they think it's okay for medical uses. Some applications of marijuana for medical reasons, like cannabidiol, don't have THC and thus won't get you high.  http://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-big-trend-in-medical-marijuana--products-that-don-t-get-you-high-162609966.html   Yeah, if those were medicinal.   Hm. Maybe The Enchanted Forest Chronicles, Patricia C. Wrede?                                                      Peeing in the street is unlawful, and certainly unhygienic, but criminal? Not so much. What's criminal is the fact that there aren't enough facilities for people so they don't need to resort to nature's method.   Okay, it's a stupid law, but why were you walking around 24 times with a cup of beer after the first arrest?    she SHOULD be in an adult prison. she is dangerous  By that argument, every 36 year old dude who sold some pot should be in a juvenile facility.   Just checked wikipedia. Series 1 was released in 2010, Series 2 in 2012, the Christmas mini-episode in 2013, and series 3 in 2014. Series 4 is expected for 2016, so they're going about two years between series (using, of course, the British term instead of the American).                                    Although public urination is super gross, I feel like a better solution than fines is more public bathrooms in safe, more-or-less clean locations.  If it is decriminalized, I hope they have some plan for that.   Well, the place where the WTC is now was underwater in the 1400s. So you wouldn't.   Maybe they just don't like you.   Looks more like a rag than a legitimate news source.   Perhaps actual news from actual news sites? I mean, this might as well come from a friend-of-a-friend on Facebook.     Many don't sit down on the toilet but instead poop while standing on the toilet seat.  Just like how in the US, many don't sit but hover over it. People think it's cleaner because, you know, no butts. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of those people are simply more used to squat toilet.    And they don't use toilet paper so instead wash their butts in the sink ala bidet.  I always did think toilet paper was a funny custom. If I get poop on my hands, I don't wipe at them with a piece of paper, I get them wet and scrub them down with hot water and soap!   Yes, it does, but I think we all eat things that aren't chock full of vitamins from time to time.   Oh, it's nothing. I award myself one fake internet point every time I get a book right on the first shot, so I'm motivated!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	200
 Kinda reminds me of the Axe Flinger. Deals 2 damage to the face for each hit. Nice idea though!   Wanna try a new game, but have no idea how to quit this one.

                      Latest, breaking chapter in the ongoing scandal of priest sex abuse in the Catholic Church. Investigative journalist finds priest accused of sex abuse around the world openly leading a parish in Paraguay.   Deeply reported, on-the-ground investigation into on-going conflict in Somalia    original, on-the-ground reporting from Buzzfeed's Middle East correspondent.    I was hoping for better bass. Weak and unsatisfying.   An exclusive story about past and perhaps present jihadists securing places in the Yemeni security establishment.   Thoughts on officiating, either last night in OKC or in the playoffs generally?  Do you guys watch hockey? Is "Blackhawks" racist?   What would you say to Chris Paul right now?   After reading this, I'm thinking all 911 operators should definitely be trained to recognize this situation. Even if it never happens in your entire career, the difference between hanging up on the "prank" and identifying the emergency is potentially the difference between life and death. Great work!   No matter how many times this video gets posted, I'll upvote it again and again.   This woman lives in Boston in shelters and is suffering from schizophrenia.

He'll need to move it around to get at the kibble.  Now, if it's aggression of the sort that he'll bite your hand if you reach your hand near him (try with a broom and a glove on the end), that's a real problem. If he doesn't bite, notice whether he freezes up or growls, because those are precursor behaviors. Any of this stuff, and you should consult an animal behaviorist. I'd recommend asking at your local SPCA or Humane Society, because they are very used to dealing with food aggressive dogs. The hand-near-the-bowl test is one that gets done with all surrendered or stray dogs, and it can be a deal-breaker in terms of whether the dog goes up for adoption or gets euthanized. They should know behaviorists who are used to working with people whose dogs have food aggression problems.

An insightful interview with a man close to the center of regime power in Syria.   Fair, fair, you didn't say that. I also didn't say the market was the sole cause. The problems we face with health care are obviously very, very complicated. But it also doesn't make sense to ignore the multiple competing interests and parties involved in designing the ACA and in rolling it out when we say things like "the ACA is a disaster."   I suppose I just don't see how we can have BOTH a for-profit health care industry and a governmental attempt to lower cost and spread coverage to more people at the expense of industry profit. The incentives are at cross-purposes.    You're right. We should probably just deregulate and let the free market take care of everything.   Be clear: for-profit, market-based health care is causing chaos, and intentionally causing chaos to undermine what the ACA tries to achieve. If only our elected officials hadn't given over one of the most important pieces of legislation in history to the health insurance lobby none of this would be happening. If we had a public option, which so many people called for and Congress + Obama failed to deliver, none of this would be happening. The industry is doing everything it can to make this roll-out a disaster.   This piece takes stock of Camus' legacy in terms of his writings on and engagement with Algerian independence and rights.

Definitely a concern. The example of this kind of monitoring I can think of is CPAP machines for sleep apnea. The machine records your hourly usage, which the insurance company calls "compliance." Obviously, the clinical benefit is that you know whether you unknowingly take the mask off at night, for example, and your doctor can track how you are adjusting to the therapy. The negative is that if you don't meet certain nightly/monthly averages, the insurance company can decide to stop covering you.

 Meeting girls parents, normally this wouldn't frighten me but she's graduating and i'm going to be spending apparently a significant amount of time with them alone. (college, not highschool) Its an outdoor graduation, and its gonna be about 85 degrees F.  So i'll be wearing dark slim chinos and either a jcrew popover, or ocbd. narrowed it down to these 4 pairs. http://i.imgur.com/bzUNAPj.jpg   Normally wear boots for work, so the rogue wingtips wont bother me in the heat if you think they would work well.  personally was leaning toward the left pair, but not sure if they aren't casual enough for the occasion.  Never really dealt with this graduating stuff.   http://i.imgur.com/CXMFzTr.jpg rockcastles   A tank that says mastermind shouldn't be labeled as a "mastermind tank" unless its a tank top made by mastermind. change that. unless your targeting the legal knock-off grey area market demographic.   chukkas or desert boots maybe.  Normally I dont care for toms, but i think matched with that shirt something interesting could be made.   I mean top notch celebs always wore high fashion, but fashion itself evolves over time. Rappers normally wore hood shit, there was alot of evisu and red monkey jeans.  Streetwear itself started in the mid-late 70's/ early 80's.  brands like stussy and 10deep were specifically geared towards surfers. Groups like Pharell and the clipse were the main reasons street wear blew up, they started wearing bape, supreme, and pharell started bbc. I don't remember much more than that, its about when I got into clothing. Pharell came out in dem bapes and i was like I DONT KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE BUT I WANT THEM.   there once was a time when streetwear wasn't mainstream.  These things go in waves. Give it 5 years and there will be something else.   you could also check out sites like gilt, myhabit, and jackthreads.  Depending on you're area find outlet stores, nordstrom rack, saks fifth off fifth, etc. but yah a job is pretty key, and don't get discouraged.  The amount you make is never enough, same for most everybody.   that second link is proper sketchy   If you're in the north-east you could check out barneys new york, and the tannery in Boston.  There's probably more, but those i'm 100% of.   pinroll   "reputable tailors in your city"?    great idea for a thread, but maybe change the title. A little misleading. But yah hope this comes through. :D   thanks, yah im hoping they stretch a bit. not as much as my past experience with apc. but they are a tad bit tighter than i'd normally wear.   for retail price they are better than I expected, and for sub $100 they far exceed my expectations.  and thanks! might shorten em a little, but figured i'd give big ass cuffs a shot.  mixed opinions on reddit and in real life haha   sweet, i was a little worried. out of the box they are one of the roughest pairs ive had.  was expecting the twill to be much lighter.   meh, they are for the ALS association. best friends dad just got diagnosed with it. made a donation and figured i'd wear the bracelets.  Normally i'd agree, but yah. circumstances.   http://imgur.com/a/tzmh8#0 Told myself I'd never get a pair.  Always thought I was too old for n f, thought their label was too tacky, and they had way too many gimmicks.  Found the skinny guys on karmaloop for ~$70 and figured i might as well give em a shot, seeing as how my apcs were about ready to become retired. Sorry for the grainy quality, decent camera was too far away, and ms paint cropping..   Yes they do, But if you only wear them on the weekends then just don't wash them at all.  Not because your a denim head, but because you don't want them to fade.  Hang em up and spray febreze on them every sunday night.   The only way their customer service could be better is if they would ship their offices to Boston so I could visit. ;) cant wait for my kickstarter UH's and launch slims as well :D   It looks like monster hunter 3, and only showed more than 4 people on screen in a brief clip at the very end.   I am very excited if it happens, but something screams skeptical.   Selvedge certainly does have to do with longevity. the extra stitching goes throughout making the denim itself more dense and durable.  It just happens to also ensure the edge of the denim doesn't fray (finishing edge). realistically if your levis have lasted years then I would expect apcs to be the same, it all depends on how hard you wear them.   I believe the originals should be shipping this month (end of last month), and other fabrics will be shipping over the next 2 months.  Personally awaiting the Super heavy's which are slated for may shipment.   like Athosicus said... pretty much just hurdles, and high jump. lol      indigo paint. fixem' right up...   "curvy", "friction from walking" lol... Try a denim skirt... not much friction there...   keys on belt loop, everything else in shirt pockets.  If you don't have shirt pockets, then make shirt pockets.  Oh and put your eraser in the backpack, don't need dem shirts be disappearing up infront da honnies.   30 isn't that old, and you can still pull off streetwear without looking weird. Streetwear unlike most sects of fashion has a huge range, spanning from skater to hip-hop to high fashion esque.  Sure a 30 year old man might not want to wear a pink camo bape hoodie, and ballin ass evisu jeans.  That would look pretty weird.   Essentially what i'm getting at is just toning down a little bit.  Maybe pick up some 501's or other straight leg jeans, somewhere between baggy and slim.  Personally i'm even a fan of krew chinos if you want to go with a slightly more mature look. Rather than wearing hoodies every day you could try out some LRG or mishka button ups.  Even just pick up some plain 'ole crewnecks.  Replacing a whole sneaker rotation I dont see as being a problem, depending on your line of work.  Most grown men wear sneakers now adays.  Plus buying lots of shoes can get expensive.  But if you have the cash maybe check out some clarks desert boots.  They are more "adult" than sneakers in general, yet still look very young and hip.  Sorry to drone on, but i'm 27 and went through the same thing a few months ago.  I wore strictly streetwear for 5+ years, and am trying to move in a more mature direction.  But you always can mix in a few street staples to make a look come through. gluck mate   If streetwear is just a trend then its a long lived trend.... I mean Stussy, 10deep, and vans alone have been around for 25-30 years individually.  Sure in the last 5 years the "streetwear" market has grown substantially, and I see that slowing down.  Imo it has stood the test of time, and it will always have a place in the fashion industry.   ACK, was ~4:00 am before work. I done goofed.      yah dishonored was really good.  Its just strange that these developers are all like, "need a name".  "OH I KNOW, lets pick something silly that starts with a C!"   dead space 3      boots, and general wear should do the trick   Aston Grey Rockcastle's.  Got em at DSW, I'd try and get into a DSW and try em on if you're thinking about buying.  They run huge, I had to size down 1.5   thanks, I sized 1 down.  Tried on 2 sizes down, and was really paranoid about crotch blow before they got a chance to stretch.  They are a little too big on my waist now, so i just wear an undershirt and tuck it in + belt.  Im on the same boat. Thinking of trying japan blue, or 3sixteen.  They seem to be the most comparable in value/quality.  Also hanging in to see if Gustin releases info on their 18.4oz selvedge indigo they talked about on here.  Although i'm not in a huge rush, still loving my apc's.    not sure exactly to be honest.  I spill chemicals on them at work from time to time, along with general wear and tear.   I washed them once, and I work in a factory where I wear them daily. Im guessing thats why I have significant wear around my thighs.   yea, essentially taking the sides in.  Giving the body a more flattering look. Although even that might be tricky considering the pocket placement is really close to the side seam.  But i'm no tailor so it could be a non-issue.   be wary of breaking them in then deciding you want them hemmed.  Im guessing you meant try them on, and make up your mind. You just dont wanna start getting fades then make the fades look unnatural by hemming.   it was an in the moment type picture http://imgur.com/a/wiwvn      not an expert, but the shoulders and arm holes look too big.  Probably not worth tailoring costs.  You could get it tapered, and maybe try it with a casual look.   Good lookin out, but yahh. Boston to SF is a long ways to go for a shirt. :(  Although I could deal with not being in -3 degree weather right now. haha   thanks for the quick response. Ya i'm pretty skinny. ~6'/150lbs, So I will probably hold out.  My local shops havn't gotten them in yet, i'm hoping they do eventually.   Mainly has anyone tried the fit. I need slim shirts, and they don't seem to make it in slim. elbow honeycombs would be killer I think.      planetside 2...   give it 15-40 wears, they will size up to about a ~36.  From the waist to the bottom of your knees will stretch substantially.  So don't fret if they feel too tight.  If you like the tight look maybe check out the ns petit slims.  Can't say much for rescues, never owned a pair. Also be careful until they do stretch.  Dont wanna blow the crotch out on a fresh pair.   scr8 up out da han dynasty? L Bu'in it an all dat?

I am and have always been primarily a PC gamer, and I love steam for what it is.  I just want to get other peoples opinions on what the big deal is with steam box/big picture mode. I've had a living-room computer since the x800AIW card, which at the time was a really niche market.  But seriously. Most budget computers have hdmi out, and will be able to run more games and at a better quality than the "steambox".  Atleast with the given specs as of now, not to mention at a fraction of the cost. A computer with HDMI out will also let you run your choice of OS whilst regular old steam at the same time.  The big picture mode web browser seems really clunky. The library section is also horrible when you have a descent sized game collection. The lan party aspect of the steam box is intriguing, but in the same light for ~$1000 you could get a solid m-atx gaming rig with a lan case.  It wouldnt be as small, but atleast it could run AAA games decently.  Plus the steam box is marketed as a console killer, hence nix lan parties unless you are replacing your big computer with a small computer an a big TV. Not trying to be a hater, just genuinely interested in other peoples opinions.   I foresee a horrible ending.. .   legend of grimrock   install a seatbelt on your racing simulator.

Clearly "cybersecurity" is *not that important* to them then.

Remember, it's Apple and Microsoft the ones that have recently agreed to share zero-day vulnerabilities that can be used for spying with the US government, while Google refused to do that.   By then Earth will probably be desert-land.   Guys, I think we found Pinocchio.    There ought to be a law against this.   Samsung doesn't design its own *CPU cores*, though.

Let's see if Intel likes that one. Not like x64 is that important these days - right?!   late 2015! Hehe, I doubt it. Probably too late to catch that cycle. But maybe they can catch the next one.   Ugh, I don't know who would invest in AMD at this point. Why would you invest in a company that has had poor performance for the past few years? At this point it's better not to sell anymore though. Wait until the acquisition, and maybe sell afterwards.   Yup, no way the integration will happen that fast. I will take 3 more years at least.   Yup, no way the integration will happen that fast.

Nvidia's main problem is one of strategy/vision, not one of technical expertise.  Nvidia's chips keep remaining power hungry as a *choice* made by Nvidia, because they want to win the "performance" game *at all costs*, and because they keep focusing on "tablets or larger" form factors. As such, it's really no wonder that their chips are *usually* (cough Snapdragon 810 cough) more power hungry than Qualcomm's chips, which focuses primarily on *smartphones* (with their low power envelope).  If Nvidia actually tried to make chips for phones with 1,500 mAh batteries, I'm sure they could release something competitive. But they *don't want* to do that. And unfortunately, I think they never will. They seem more interested in automotive and mini-consoles these days, which rely even less on power efficiency as a competitive goal.   Yes, it won't. Worst case scenario, Intel forces Samsung to pay royalty a little more than AMD did. But as you said, x64 is actually much more critical now than x86 is. If something has good negotiators, they might even squeeze a *lower* royalty rate.   Cash, marketing...not to mention the process node. Samsung's process node is the closest the industry has to Intel's now.  Not only was GloFo's node behind Samsung's or TSMC's before, but AMD itself, due to lack of money, didn't adopt the latest node too fast, which put them at an even greater disadvantage compared to Intel.  There are really very few negatives to Samsung buying it (even the Intel licensing thing - I'm sure Samsung and Intel can figure something out), and many more positives.  There was an article on TomsHardware last year that may have contributed to this:  http://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-amd-win-win-acquisition,28403.html   Didn't he quit the Android team to go work for the robot division?    That's...not that fast.  The good news is that once more phones start using Type-C USB, we can just get more powerful 3A+ chargers to charge the phones safely and in under an hour (fully).   That's a good idea, but they have to be designed in such a way that the airbag doesn't end up throwing the pedestrian into the nearest pole or building.   Yes. Google it.   So what's the *real* color of plants then?   I thin we can survive on this planet a few hundred more years, at least. We'll get to building vertical farms, eat lab-made meat, and so on.  Also, don't forget that right now most people feel *pressured* into having a child by a certain age (especially women). What if we knew for a fact that we could live 500 years, or 5,000 years? Would you still want to have a baby at 25?   Maybe eventually most of us won't even want kids (we could already see that as a *small* trend in well educated societies, where people postpone having kids). What if we figure out that we don't *need* to "extend our legacy" through kids, when we can just *be* that legacy ourselves? Why try to be "immortal" indirectly through a kid, when you can be *actually* immortal yourself?   Ironically, most traffic cops probably *won't* like this.   Here comes Microsoft bloatware, or "moatware".   Dislike the orange icons and I prefer the original Win10 build Start Menu. I don't really like the much-metrofied brand new one.   Has he said for a fact that he will be able to live forever? From what I recall he was *hoping* that people his age may be saved "just in time." - But of course, that's the *average* or most people, not everyone. Not everyone who is now 65 or whatever his age, will live to 90. Maybe those who do, will be saved. Those who will die at 70, won't be.  I also know about all the pills he's taking to prolong his life, but again, I don't know if he said for a fact they will keep him alive that long, just trying to prolong his life as best as he can for now.   Imi place optimismul tau.    Reminds me of when Obama said we should just "look forward" and away from Bush's crimes and torture.   Get ready for even more broken hi-dpi scaling.   Amazon is also among the few remaining large tech companies that *don't use HTTPS on their main site*.   It better be limited to that, and not use other browsing history. Otherwise Google is no better than AT T here. In fact, you could even say AT T is "better" (ugh, just puked a little in my mouth) because at least it offers the so called "option" to opt-out of that tracking (by paying $30 more per month).   Sounds very anti-competitive if you ask me: "Use our apps, or else!"  It's bad enough that bogus patents owned by large corporations can be used as a monopolistic tool against other companies to either make their products more expensive or ban them from the market - but now those same companies get to use that patent hammer to get other kind of deals, too?   How? By replacing it with other bloatware? (MS apps)   Killer drone operators - relax, the AI will take it over from here.  ....and that's how we get the Terminator future.   More bloatware.   Adica recunoaste ca sunt toti corupti si au furat?   Democracy.  We don't let people *kill* others just because it's easy and they can do it. In the same way, we shouldn't let spy agencies spy on anyone just because it's easy and technically possible.   That's the whole point of a law system - to stop and/or *punish* those who don't obey a set of rules that the *People* have decided upon. Spy agencies  should not be let to work *outside of the law*.   Si eu am primit mesaje pe tocmai si olx pe limba engleza. Sunt scams.   I HATE CAPS LOCK HEADLINES WHICH ARE ALSO SHITTY TO SHARE. IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T WANT US TO SHARE THEIR STUFF.   The government has no intention of passing actual security bills. All they care about is more spying and more fat checks for their friends in the *offense* industry.  The new NSA chief even said yesterday that they don't want more "security" stuff - they want more *offense* powers.   Why no focus speed comparison?   So why would you get it - as opposed to a pirated version of Windows 10?   I get the feeling that HBO and Sony won't need to "cut a deal" with the local ISP to give them a "faster lane".   Will Amazon fucking adopt HTTPS already? What major company as large as Amazon doesn't use HTTPS, even one configured in a shitty way? And Amazon is supposed to be the "king of the cloud". What kind of message does that send to its cloud customers when it can't even secure its major business' site?   [Approval voting](http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/cc04) could change that.     but that all takes place within GPU memory.  But wouldn't you want to use the CPU as well for compute, and combine the two? That should be easier when both share the same memory.   I think you mean a new record in Transparency.   But you know...in reverse.   Imagination/MIPS needs to come out with a competitor to Cortex A57 or faster something faster. So far it has only pushed low-end/mid-range CPUs. I get it that there won't be huge demand for such a chip anyway, but without that nobody will even take them seriously.  Show you can beat the best of the best from the ARM world and on the latest process, and then we're talking.   Is is. Read the article. This is for lower-end phones.   Well hopefully they can be made to see the light by Valve at least.   This comment pisses me off, because what you said *exactly* is not accurate.  It's not the users' fault that the "uptake of new technology" is slow, which is what you're implying. When Apple releases a new technology in their OS, they update hundreds of millions of devices at once, and *that's how iOS users* get to all use that new technology at once.  On Android that's not really possible, because there are so many OEMs, each with their own goals, and sometimes they even push back against Google when Google is trying to make a new technology mainstream (such as Google Wallet).   Your question is confusing. Are you asking if Android Wear is compatible with the iPhone? If so, then yes Google is working on that (but it's not currently compatible).  http://www.cultofandroid.com/72407/android-wear-code-confirms-google-has-been-working-on-iphone-support/   I think I read somewhere that TPM 2.0 is supposed to come with some major improvements (and arriving this year) - is that true, and does it solve TPM 1.x's main problems?  Also from what I read, Intel's SGX is supposed to be much more secure and more advanced - with the "only" problem that Intel will have the key to all your "secured" apps, and they can have it stolen/give it to NSA with perfect plausible deniability ("Why really, we had no idea!").  EDIT: I found something, but meh, it doesn't seem to support ephemeral keys either:  http://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/about_iaik/events/ETISS_INTRUST_2013/ETISS/slides/ETISS-INTRUST-2013-LiqunChen.pdf   Dude, you have 500 years to start your own business. How much of a cog in the system do you really want to be? Even if you need to save for 150 years, you should still have enough money to start a small business eventually.   I think everyone here knows Microsoft is just saying that because the Xbox One is too weak for VR, so they have to pretend they didn't want to go the VR route anyway.   No electoral fraud in Israel?   No matter how "fluid" it is, at the end of the day the *interface* sucks - and that's an order of magnitude more important for most people than being a few micro-seconds faster in animations.   We all know what it means. But there's hardly any benefit, when they could just pirate it and be able to do the same things with it.   And this is here because...?  It's like r/Android is invaded by Microsoft related stories lately. Where are you, mods?!   Maybe someone could even come up with an idea such as "Customer is respected...or is king" or something along those lines, that any company could follow to do well in business.   Or they could...you know, hack the device remotely?  What they meant is that that stuff is not given to 3rd party servers, so they can't steal it from there - from millions of people at once. Now they have to hack every single device. But I'm sure someone like the NSA, which can already infiltrate any hard disk drive, can do that en mass, still.   Problema e ca dupa 2 saptamani, DNA va cere arestarea la domiciliu - care nu cred ca il va opri prea mult pe Mazare din a-si desfasura activitatea mafiota.  Sunt oarecum impartial deocamdata la ce face DNA pentru ca cred ca e un "rau necesar" la nivelul de coruptie de o avem noi, si ca sa putem sa ii prindem pe toti pana la urma.   Dar pe termen lung, DNA de fapt abuzeaza sistemul, si ii aresteaza pe multi asa nu pentru ca ar fi ei nevinovati neaparat (sau poate sunt dar DNA nu are dovezile necesare - ceea ce iar e rau si abuziv daca aresteaza fara dovezi), ci pentru ca vor sa ii *sperie* pe multi pentru a da in vileag pe altii. Asta nu e o calitate a unui sistem de justitie *corect*. E o chestie abuziva.  Dar cum am zis, pe termen scurt, cred ca e oarecum necesar asta. Dar DNA nu mai poate continua prea mult asa pentru ca o sa inceapa sa isi piarda credibilitatea daca "aresteaza" 10, iar apoi le da drumul la 9 din ei. Incep sa isi dea oamenii seama ca aia 9 de fapt au fost arestati doar ca sa il prinda pe ala 1, si sa forteze o confesiune de la ei.  Oricum in cazul acesta, cred ca chiar vor sa il tina pe Mazare la inchisoare, nu doar sa obtina o confesiune impotriva lui Vanghelie sau mai stiu eu care. Dar in general cam asta tinde sa faca DNA.   Asta are gandire americana "daca expunem tortura, ne va face rau imaginii in lume!"  Bai idiotilor (si asta, si americanii), ce face rau imaginii e ca *fapta s-a intamplat deja* - nu ca e *expusa*.  Romania are o imagine din cauza coruptiei existente, nu din cauza ca vorbim despre ea.   Cops here: *Fuck yeah!*   I'd rather it was written in Rust for the memory safety and multi-threading performance.   Exactly. Not like there's been a secret alien invasion and they are systematically taking out our animal species. What's happening is relatively predictable.   Astia se aud vorbind?   That's what they must say in Russia, too.   The most transparent administration in history, huh?   Didn't Google already invest $500 million in them? Or was that just the initial rumor?   Also it's on 14nm FinFET, which significantly reduces leakage.    Only because they wanted to milk Krait for longer than they should have.   Mainly because most tech media is in US and the phones get promoted and *reviewed* there first - so we just ended up picking up US's shitty measuring system, instead of having them covert to the international one.   Apparently those media entities don't want actual journalists there.   And probably the price. If it's more than $3000 right now, it won't go far too fast (it will probably still succeed though, unless they run out of funds or the investors get pissed off that it takes 10 years to recover their money).   Maybe a Russian Spring?   Lizard Putin.   Also from what I read Moto E still has a shit camera, too. Moto G 2nd gen has quite a good camera. Can't complain about much else, other that I wish it had a Cortex A53 processor, too. It's crazy that the "lower-end" Moto E gets it half a year before Moto G 3rd gen will. It should've been 2nd gen Moto G the one to get it first - and don't tell me that "it wasn't available then", because I'm certain it was. HTC Desire 510 and others had it, and they launched before 2nd gen Moto G.   What would a honeypot even mean in this case?   I don't think it's about these documents per se. It's about the culture the government has now, that it should hide as much as possible from the public, and always try to skirt the law through loopholes.  In this case they must be thinking "Sure, we don't really care about these documents, but if we let them see it, they'll just come back and ask for other more recent documents, and we don't want that to happen!"   If they have nothing to hide, maybe they shouldn't be doing it - right, Schmidt?   It doesn't. Only the elites.   Hopefully the tank doesn't have just a USB port.   And it would've been much better.  Being acquired by Facebook is almost as bad as being acquired by Oracle. I'm sure Oculus had "options" they could've explored. But because Andreessen is a Facebook investor and an Oculus one, guess who forced/pushed for a sale to Facebook?   Except they originally intended to launch CV1 in like 2013. So yeah...of course DK2 or the actual CV1 would be improved by early 2016.   No, that's so they can create their own closed version of Android, that they hope would be more popular than "Google's Android."   Azure literally has the *worst* uptimes from all the major cloud providers. You might've noticed it yourself, too, as Microsoft's own blog posts crash on a weekly basis under not even too much traffic.   By then WP will be dead and forgotten.   Also what Surface RT early adopters said.   I don't think there's a way to do it "end-to-end" with VPNs right now, only through HTTPS or some kind of public key infrastructure, which means they own the private key and can decrypt that data.   They should be reported to FCC, especially after the new net neutrality rules pass. That's unacceptable. They're only doing that because they want to track you and inject ads into your browsing.   What I want to know if it will be "zero-knowledge" or "we know everything you're visiting, including your credentials" type of VPN. Knowing Google, it's probably the latter.   It's the least accurate personal assistant out of the three:     I see no reason for that to happen. Windows 10 will not make developers want to make more "Metro apps".   I couldn't give two shits about it. As if I'd ever trust Microsoft to record what I'm saying:  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data   Ma incanta acest lucru. Daca relatia cu SUA inseamna "sa spioneze romanii mai usor" - atunci you can go fuck off USA!  Tocmai din acest motiv am fost foarte de acord cu ideea de a ne apropia mai mult de EU si centrul EU (Germania) decat de tari ca SUA sau faux-state ale SUA (UK).   ntrebrile au fost adresate de mai muli ziariti n contextul vizitei pe care directorul FBI, James Comey, a efectuat-o pe 3 martie n Romnia.  Acum am inteles. Asta e *cretinul* care zicea ca ar trebui sa fie backdoors in toate produsele tehnologice (nu, nu Cameron din UK - ala e alt cretin la fel de mare). Comey asta chiar e "commie", if you know what I mean.   Si ar trebui ca *toate* tarile EU sa faca asta, pentru ca a fost declarata **invalida** de Curtea Europeana de Justitie, dar vad ca nu prea se grabesc prea multe tari sa isi scoata acele legi.  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/data-retention-violates-human-rights-says-eus-highest-court   EA/Dice already started using Mantle, and Valve is also heavily involved, so probably not too long for some. Two years at most I would say, considering it will take almost a year to have hardware come out with support for it.   All benchmarks showed 8.0 to be only 5% faster, *at best*, than Windows 7.  But all the Microsoft fanbois saw Windows 8 gets somewhat faster *boot time*, and thought "Oh maaan....Windows 8 is soooo much *faster*", as if the speed of the boot time had any impact on general performance.  Also the faster *boot time* is faster in part because it doesn't boot the OS directly, but stops at the "lockscreen" (or whatever Microsoft calls that screen), but it still takes at least a minute after that to load everything up.   If you don't think Microsoft is "repaid" in huge government contracts for pretending to not see some FBI/NSA backdoors, you're very naive. Microsoft has been doing this "team play" with the government for a long time.  You get "rewarded" for "working with the government" with big contracts, and get punished if you don't.   Scapegoats. They fired a couple of people to look good in the media, while the agency as a whole does much worse as a matter of policy.   Figured that this would be written by the American side of TheGuardian.  The Euro has NOT lost value - guy from a country with a different currency here, and the Euro value has been the same. *However* the dollar has *increased* in value.  So it's not that the Euro has lost value, but that the dollar has gained value. The difference here is that the title implies the Euro hasn't been stabled and has lost value, when in fact it's the dollar which hasn't been stable. By the headline's logic, *all the other currencies* would have "dropped in value" by 35 percent, too.  For Americans who are glad about this - I probably wouldn't be. You can import stuff that is cheaper now, but US companies might have to lay-off employees as they can't afford to pay them the same amount as before. Think of it as a "free" 20-30 percent increase in salary for everyone over the past 12 months. Obviously that will put a strain on most companies who don't make billions in profit every quarter or have huge margins.   There's good news everyone. The CIA will stop doing that now...because Apple will *give them* those vulnerabilities from now on (cyber threat sharing), in order for Apple to get big fat government contracts (Apple Pay for federal services, and more later).  Same for Microsoft, but Microsoft already started doing that many years ago.   Oh ok, that's good then.   Only at having more features. But by that logic TouchWiz is better than iOS (I assume you would agree with that conclusion, too, but I think many others do not).   We use Docs in the "corporate" environment. It's fast and easy.   Is anyone affected?  *Everyone* is. Why? Because *all data* and messages are *analyzed* in real-time, so if you say something - anything - "interesting" to them (remember, *they* get to decide what is "interesting" - not *you*), and then they could put you on automatic "lists", and follow you more closely, hack you if necessary,  without you even knowing that it "affects you".   That's how it feels like.   "Oh shit, they know our plans now - well then we better do everything faster now, so it's too late for the People to do anything about it."   It was only like 2 years ago when we were talking about a "doomsday scenario" of even the police having the same powers and capabilities as NSA and the CIA. Except this has already been happening for longer than that.   Until Microsoft tightens its grip around Cyanogen, which then will tight its grip around its own OS, too. I'm sorry, but I don't see how any company backed by Microsoft of all companies will be an "open" company. That's just nonsense PR stuff. If or when they would get 50+ percent market share (they never will, but let's just assume it for now), they would get just as closed if not more so.   Will it? Isn't Silent Text data-only? (just like Signal/TextSecure now)   Yup, same for Google and others. Every character is saved as you type it to "improve your experience". And there's a "privacy" policy in Windows 10 that says exactly the same thing.   A "honeypot" would imply that this is the only way to get those criminals, when in fact *all the other ways are much simpler*. Tor makes it harder to find people - not impossible, but much harder, and the more people use it, the better it gets.   Nici eu nu sunt un "cunoscator al sistemului electoral estonian", dar sunt altii, care se pare ca i-au gasit niste probleme (am dat linkul si in post-ul de sus)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY_pHvhE4os  Intr-o lume in care NSA poate [infiltra orice hard disk](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/) vor ei, e totusi greu de crezut ca vreun sistem, cat de laudat ar fi el, e foarte sigur pana la urma.  Nici macar nu au aparut bine pe piata standardele FIDO si EIDAS, si noi deja vrem vot electronic? Oricum sunt sigur ca o sa propuna ceva stupid si cu asta, cum ar fi sa ceara ca sa *stocheze ei* fingerprinturile noastre in baza de date - adica exact cum face si Estonia pentru programul de e-citizenship. Orice baza de date de acest fel va fi sparta intr-o saptamana de alte natiuni. Totusi sper ca sistemele care tin fingerprintul *pe telefon* in "secure storage" (cum face Apple Touch ID sau Qualcomm's Sense ID) si nu-l lasa niciunde altundeva sa "castige" pe piata.  Dar totusi eu zic sa vedem vreo 10 ani asa macar cum se comporta si sistemele de autentificare biometrica, si apoi mai vedem cu votul electronic.   Tax them on local revenue, not profits. Weren't high profit taxes the reason why they avoided paying them in those countries in the first place?   This is why Tesla can't have huge profits right now. It needs to invest in the supercharger network as fast as it can, with all of its profits. So those worried about "Tesla's profits" are missing the point.   Android will probably stick to mobile. Google seems to have no interest in making Android a desktop OS right now (unfortunately).  So Steam OS can still be the "OS of VR" for PCs.   Well I don't think anyone seriously thought Putin murdered him himself, right? Obviously he would hire some low-life, and he wouldn't do that himself either, nor his closest employees. As a former KGB agent, I'm sure he would know how to do it without anyone pointing back at him (except those who he ordered directly to find him an assassin).   Astia trateaza problema de parca ar fi un "business" in care au investit ei *banii lor*, iar apoi vor sa faca "profit".   Why? Do you really have to ask if you've been paying attention to this subreddit over the past few months?   I'm not sure what that means. TextSecure is open source. Anyone can use it in their messaging systems, and the TextSecure guys *would like that to happen*.   Moxie did consult Whatsapp in implementing it, as he would Google, Apple or Microsoft if they had decided to use it, too, but he's not going to guarantee that Whatsapp will never sellout to certain governments of the world from US to France to Iran.     Shame they don't have auto-update for apps in the free version, though.   Cisco is the one which invented the "lawful intercept" backdoor protocol for routers that IETF approved as standard. I would never trust them again.  Unfortunately there are still some IETF Cisco co-chairs that get to decide on stuff like this. Same for the [NSA](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/nsa-employee-will-continue-to-co-chair-influential-crypto-standards-group/).   The Qualcomm one should be even better, as it scans the 3D shape of the fingerprint making it much harder for hackers/spies to steal you fingerprint from photos (which did happen with Touch ID actually).  Shame the Snapdragon 810 is such a bad chip, though. I'll have to wait until next year to get a phone with Sense ID, with Snapdragon 820.   DLL layer? So will Oculus even work on Linux? Or it will work, just with poorer performance?   I'm getting the feeling Twitter doesn't understand the concept of "anonymity".  "We protect freedom of speech...in Iran! At home...eh, not so much."   I doubt the glass Galaxy S6 will be any better.   Ironic.   Ugh...storage not memory. That's cofusing. I wonder if Samsung finally adopted its own F2FS file system.   Doesn't Spain like put a tax on solar energy?   All bets were off then.   1) Apple (original backer of IPS, and if we've learned anything over the past few years is that OEMs step over themselves to do what Apple did)  2) the smartphone market and by extension the tablet market which have been competing on the quality of their screens. Following this it was just a matter of time before we'd see IPS in notebooks and TVs, too.   In just a week? Thank god this didn't happen to Microsoft. They would've needed at least 92 days to fix it (and only if it doesn't fall on a weekend or holiday).   I'm not sure about the SMS part for Signal (does Signal have SMS settings in it?). I would just disable it in settings if you're using Android. Data messages are secure between TextSecure and Signal.   THE TRUTH ABOUT BUSINESSINSIDER'S FREAK FLAW   Wait, are you telling me people are going to start cloning iOS now?!  Thank god it never happened before.   Apple seems pretty quick to accept government demands these days, whether it's China or the U.S.  Disappointing.  It's actually not the source code review that bothers me. I don't care if the Chinese steal it. What would bother me is if they force them to put backdoors inside. It's not clear whether this "deal" includes that or not, or whether the Chinese government would even make it public this way :"Yes, we put ~~backdoors~~ lawful intercept in Apple's products".   Hell yes!  And are you kidding? Hand tracking is super useful. That's how we interact with our real world, too. Imagine learning martial arts with the help of games...etc   That's more than all of the Megaupload traffic (4%), which I believe included the traffic from the video-streaming properties as well.  So color me skeptical. It would be a big deal if it reached that in 5 years.   And while this crap happens in their own backyard, Cameron still makes it sound that the biggest problem are "paedophiles who use Tor"?!     http://drop-dropbox.com/   Multi inainte!   I think she already said the emails aren't available anymore. Convenient, no? Reminds me of IRS's scandal.   Unless she was also using PGP, I doubt the NSA couldn't get this email. It may not have used StartTLS either, which means they could've gotten with with passive surveillance.   Call me crazy, but I think Nvidia will be making its own VR headset as well. They seem to be interested in making their own hardware lately. That would actually make them even more interested in making their GPUs as optimized as possible for VR.   Oh yes.   We're talking about the potential to displace Windows as people's main desktop OS here. I wouldn't just dismiss this as "probably not worth it".  When you come to think about it, there are probably already more Android users than there are Windows users - just not on the desktop. Chrome OS is never going to beat Windows. Heck, I'd be surprised if it manages to even beat Mac OS X in terms of market share. Do you really see people in Africa and India (huge growth opportunity there - we're talking 2 billion people) using Chrome OS in the future?   Apple can now take its Infinity Blade and shove it where the sun don't shine.   People hate Windows 8 more than they hate XP, I guess.   Thanks, NSA. You truly are a National "Security" Agency worthy of your name!   Vulkan should change all that, but we'll have to wait for next-gen mobile GPU architectures to bring it in 2-3 years. Vulkan API will be completely cross-platform for mobile and PCs.  That said, post Android 4.4 I think, there already is the Android Extension Pack for OpenGL ES 3.0, which brings many OpenGL 4+ features.   Now if only Google wasn't so god damn stubborn about *optimizing* (a taskbar and multi-window is all I'm asking Google!) Android for PCs, too, and getting OEMs to make such machines.  Android could start becoming a real competitor to Windows on the PC.....if only Google wants it to be. But it doesn't. It wants ChromeOS to be that...despite the fact that Android is already shipping 100x more devices on the market and many more people are used to it.   Probably because Facebook is crap and they like closed gardens.   Good.   That's because it doesn't matter!!   Ironically, it made it easier to hack NSA.gov and other government sites, which you'd think the National "Security" Agency would try to protect. But thanks to their idiotic cyber policies that favor attacks, rather than defense, much more, I'm not even surprised this happened.  Everytime you see those in the government yell for more "cybersecurity", they don't actually mean *security*. They mean more offense and spying - while at the same time making systems even more vulnerable and open to attacks than before, because as Schneier says ["cyberweapons have no allegiance"](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/cyberweapons-have-no-allegiance).    What's interesting is that no one questions how the FBI agent who was his wife's "friend" just started looking at the CIA chief's email *without a warrant*. To me that seems like a much bigger deal, if anyone in the FBI can just spy on anyone else in government, whether he's from CIA, Pentagon or the White House.   Yes, this is a known issue, or rather a "feature" (a discoverability one, for the same reason why Whatsapp or Snapchat do it). I'm not sure why they haven't added the option to disable this or use email accounts yet.   About time.   Yes. Apple doesn't like GPL software though, I think mainly because it adds a piece of DRM code to every single app, and according to the GPL license all derivatives of GPL code need to also be GPL/"free" software (which DRM isn't).   Losing the SD card was never going to piss me off AS LONG AS THEY PUT IN A LOT OF STORAGE AS DEFAULT - which almost nobody did, especially Google with its Nexus devices. So of course I would get pissed off in such a situation.  If you make 64GB the default for a 600 USD/euro phones, then that's a whole different ballgame (even if TouchWiz itself probably occupies needs like 16GB these days).   Raise? Or lower? Last I checked CurrentC had terrible privacy features and it wasn't very secure. I'm not even sure it supported chip and PIN.   Intel's face recognition solution seems much less secure, for multiple reasons:  * faces can data-mined orders of magnitude more than fingerprints, because we put pictures of our faces all the time on the Internet.   * there's already the danger that the webcam might be spying on you. Even if Intel's technology requires dual-cameras on the machine and whatnot, whoever hacks into your PC, will be able to use that same camera and build a profile of your face  * I see nothing mentioned about them storing that data in a "secure enclave". Even if they decide to store it somewhere securely right now, it will probably be the TPM, which *isn't that secure*, especially when the laptop vendors (such as Lenovo) have the root keys to that as well  * it's not even compatible with FIDO, even though Windows 10 will be. If we're going to switch to biometrics, then we damn well make sure we're doing it as a standard.    Huh, de ce ar decide NATO pe cine punem noi sef la SRI? Ma indoiesc ca alte tari intreaba NATO.  So fuck off, Monica.   The problem is if it gets moderately popular in the tech media, and then one day everyone sees on all major tech sites that "Ethereum security broken - 30 percent of everyone's money stolen", nobody will give it a second look again.   Calling works, too (with RedPhone on Android). Integrated Android app will probably arrive in a few months,   Hopefully Android M will require everyone to encrypt by default. By then all OEMs should be using ARMv8 hardware that supports encryption accelerators (10x faster encryption).  iPhones have had default storage encryption for years. Nobody noticed any performance issues because they were using crypto-processors. For some reason, Google didn't support Qualcomm's crypto-processor inside the Snapdragon 805, and it used the CPU to encrypt the device (as I said ~10x slower).   I would love it if Huawei created the $350 Nexus and Sony the $600 one this year. Please, Sony, PLEASE!! It would help your image GREATLY!  At this point I don't think it's Google the one who doesn't want Sony for Nexus. I think it's Sony who doesn't want in the program. Either it believe it won't make any money with it or that it will actually hurt its other sales or something, but if they do think that, they are very wrong.   Seriously, why do Android companies do this? Why do they release essentially the same phone, and with a new version of Android that perhaps the old one didn't get...to justify the novelty of the new one.  Samsung and pretty much everyone else does this too. Why can't they just keep popular high-end devices the same way Apple does, and just shave off $100 or $150 off them every year. What's wrong with that?   Instead they release this "new" M8s which nobody knows what the hell it is or where it came from.   Using Google Wallet and Android Wallet would've created more confusion for Google Wallet.   Yes, that's the point. So it doesn't create mobile payment fragmentation in the Android world. It standardizes the service on the back-end, but users can still use whatever service they want, Samsung, G-Wallet, Paypal, Amazon, whatever.   It's actually the "Google Wallet API" that would create more confusion. Developers would then have to use "Samsung Pay with Google Wallet API"....  It's called Android Pay API, because it's for all of Android. I think it's a perfect name.   That's not how it works. Well ok, it is how it works, but only when you use the CPU directly, which Google did here (and it was dumb of them to do it).  But the way Apple does it, is it uses a *crypto-processor* that encrypts the data much faster. A similar kind of processor exists in *all 64-bit ARMv8 chips* - even the low-end Cortex A53 ones, such as the Snapdragon 410 inside the new Moto E.  So you should be able to use encryption with no problems on a device like the Moto E, even if it's "low-end". That's why I've always considered the "why would you need a 64-bit chip with 1GB of RAM on a $100 device?!" argument stupid.   ARMv8 offers much more than just support for 4GB of RAM, but unfortunately that's how most people understood ARMv8, even here on /r/Android.  Apple has had automatic storage encryption for its devices since like the days of the 3GS - you know, that device with a 600Mhz CPU device with 256MB of RAM?  Encryption  is not an issue when done right. The problem is Google half-assed it, as usual. But I'm sure they'll fix it in the next-version.   Fingerprint scanning is coming to most Android devices.   Samsung built its chip on 14nm FinFET, Qualcomm on 20nm planar. That could explain it.  I'm interested to see the thermal profile, though. I'm getting tired of seeing chips win in 5-minute benchmarks, only to see devices get hot when using them for more than 5 minutes at a time.   Ora de religie confirma Half Life 3?   Data 02.03.2015.  2*3 = 6  Iar apoi avem 2*(1+5) care e de 2 ori 6.  Deci avem trei de 6, adica 666. E clar un contract cu diavolul.   Does it actually do tokenization like Apple Pay? If not, I'm disappoint.   Same goes for the Snapdragon 810 ones, actually.   I'd rather it was behind the screen behind an "unlock button"   The "good guys" principle". For such "good guys" they seem to be doing a lot of the things the "bad guys" are doing (torture, illegal spying, assassinations, improperly imprisoning and charging people, etc).   Exactly why I don't understand how their solution for "cybersecurity" can be "more surveillance". These two are exact opposites. The NSA is now trying to push *terrible* cybersecurity policies, which just means they don't care about it at all. They just care about being able to spy some more.   Do they [give it away for free](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-16/intel-s-4-21-billion-mobile-loss-would-have-sunk-most-rivals) to OEMs or is it actually competing on merit this time?   Am fost optimist ca o sa fie un partid bun, chiar daca sustinerea votului electronic m-a dezamagit. E extrem de nesigur si poate fi abuzat - trust me on this. Sa mai asteptam 10-20 ani totusi sa vedem ce sisteme de securitate mai apar care pot proteja voturile: quantum key distribution, blockchain security, biometric authentication. Desigur astea exista deja, dar "doar ce au aparut" intr-un fel. Sa le dam timp sa se maturizeze. Niciun sistem de vot electronic din lume existent acum nu e invulnerabil la hacking. Nici chiar cel al [Estoniei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY_pHvhE4os) (desi cei de la putere nu vor sa recunoasca - evident).  Dar faptul ca a zis ca Iohannis a gresit ca si-a facut principalul partener Germania, m-a facut sa displac noul partid aproape in intregime.  Hai totusi sa terminam cu ideea asta ca trebuie sa fim toate tarile vasale la SUA. Suntem parte din Uniunea Europeana. Let's act like it. Apropierea de Germania e un lucru foarte bun, si chiar practic (multi romani se simt mult mai apropiati de Germania decat SUA).  Si oricum, nu e ca si cum gata ne-am certat cu SUA, ceea ce s-ar intelege din ce zice Macovei. Din contra, cred ca s-a intarit acel parteneriat cu SUA in ultima vreme. SUA acum ne considera o tara foarte importanta in zona si un partener de care au nevoie in conflictul asta Rusia-Ucraina.   Daca e sa ne fi certat cu cineva e UK, si sincer o merita, si nu zic asta doar pentru cum se poarta cu romanii care vin acolo (desi asta ar putea fi un motiv in sine), dar si pentru faptul ca ei cam vor sa devina un fel de China a Europei cu cenzura, spionari ilegale si imorale, numirea jurnalistilor "teroristi", etc. E mai bine ca nu suntem parteneri la o asemenea tara. Nu as vrea sa ni se traga si noua "ideile" astea. Plus ca UK cam intotdeauana au fost carcotasul Europei si s-au opus la multe lucruri bune pentru EU.  Iar faza cu 2 la suta din buget sa fie alocat Apararii chiar credeti ca a venit de la Iohannis? E clar ideea SUA, ca sa le cumparam armele lor. Am fi putut sa punem 2 la suta buget si sa cumparam avioane si arme din Suedia sau Franta, tari membre EU. Dar nu...am luat din SUA.  Deci nu e chiar asa cum zice Macovei. Relatia cu SUA e foarte buna. Dar prioritatea principala va trebui intotdeauna sa ramana EU, nu SUA, si nu doar pentru Romania, dar toate tarile EU. Trebuie sa ne ocupam in primul rand de interesele EU, nu ale SUA.   But why? Hydrogen creation will never be clean. At least with batteries there's a chance most of the energy can come from clean sources in 2-3 decades.   I hope just SteamVR. Fuck Facebook.

 My mom took me to see this in theaters.... when i was four years old.   death by stereo!   I'm going to have to check this out, it reminds me of Rad and Airborne.   I really like 16 candles, but I love Weird Science. Me and my by best friend are just like Gary and Wyatt.   Yeah i found that out about the "indian" guy in short circuit. At first I didn't think the movie was racist... til this scene http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=2rxlidAR3Fw#t=2s   Disney should make a proper sequel. Like 2000, but without pointless celebrity cameos.   which one overall do you favor most? As a kid I loved VI but now as a teen I love V   same here, got to love Corey Fieldman and Kurt Russell.   I have to agree, i watched it on vhs when i was 7 years old and it stills astonishes me with the music and visuals.      http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls6yd1ndRI1qeo6bto1_250.gif   for some reason I love the stuck-up professors that only like things to be done traditionally. Basically the "antagonists" of Robin Williams movies (Dead Poets Society, Patch Adams).      There wouldn't be that many teenage girls.   everyone always criticizes FFX's voice acting but i think its good, most of the time.   For games i would say Final Fantasy 9, I was drawn in by the characters and story. Movie wise would be Big Trouble in Little China, because Jack Burton is awesome. A comic i recently read was Y the Last Man, and i have to say everyone should give it a read, its really that good.      My sister was talking to a friend about it, I asked what she was talking about and she told me to go to reddit. Life's never been the same.   We've all been through it.

As for it having to be free,well I'd have to say you could always try Spiral Knights...that's the only free coop game that is right now on my mind  Edit: Just remembered,if you don't mind downloading it,you can get Marvels Ultimate Alliance.Now that game is something fun to play,and I'd say its  maybe 3-4 years old   Do your palms sweat a lot while you play?It might have messed with the wires inside of your mouse,causing it to malfunction...

I consider it horror, and definitely my favorite.   Also like The Ring, and Blair Witch Project.    Too bad. I think the series could be a lot of fun with a better director.    I don't want to be an Ireland defender, but let me give it a shot.  McCown was 2008, which Parcells was in charge of. Feel free to disagree, but if we are going to evaluate Ireland I feel like the last 2 years are the ones to look at.  When I look at last year's draft, I think it may end up being one of the best that any team had in 2012, especially considering rookie free agents.  Here's why. Our picks: 1st Round  Ryan Tannehill (QB, Texas A M) 2nd Round  Jonathan Martin (OT, Stanford) 3rd Round  Olivier Vernon (DE, Miami) 3rd Round  Michael Egnew (TE, Missouri) 4th Round  Lamar Miller (RB, Miami) 5th Round  Josh Kaddu (OLB, Oregon) 6th Round  B.J. Cunningham (WR, Michigan State) 7th Round  Kheeston Randall (DL, Texas) 7th Round  Rishard Matthews (WR, Nevada)  So we had 4 draft picks as solid contributors this year (Tannehill, Martin, Vernon, Miller). That looks pretty good!  Add Lane and Thigpen and that's 6 solid rookie players in one off-season.  I think you will be hard pressed to find many teams that got 6 starters from the draft. If I compare this draft to an Ozzie Newsome one, who I think is great, the Ravens best draft may have been 2008 where they got Joe Flacco, Ray Rice, and Tom Zbikowski (now with the Colts). That's 3 players out of 10 picks. I don't know who their rookie free agents were, but we know those are rare anyway. The rest of the Ravens picks aren't even on their team anymore, just Flacco and Rice. Two important pieces and that's a successful draft.  I guess what I'm saying is that I think Ireland has become the fall guy, and people have really high expectations in a draft (most guys don't work out, just a fact). I wanted Ireland fired after 2011, but the more I thought about it, the more I feel he really does deserve to continue. Parcells is the guy we should be mad at, he didn't pick a good coach or QB, so we were doomed. Now Ireland is in charge, and so far so good. Let's just hope it continues.  Anyway, agree to disagree I guess.    Lol, decaf!  You just said he sucked the whole time, so what do you expect in return? A second rounder for a guy you readily admit sucked (your word) sounds like we got the better end of the deal.  I'll take that deal every day.   And I haven't down voted any of your posts or comments (that i am aware of) and am willing to make that public to prove it.   Deep breath now!     Blocked in US.    I'm still happy with the trade. A 2nd rounder is good.    She's a girl. Even if a reason were given it would be impossible to truly understand. And in typical female fashion, she kills you for not understanding.   You must not be married for asking such a question.    I'm pretty sure that's Fred Savage.    No. Think players, not plays.    Food court seman surprise.    The Virgin Mary.      Serenity now!   Fuck the Jets.    Agreed. The drafts Parcells lead sucked, Ireland hasn't done poorly, deserves to continue. Change there now would be bad.    Damn you Binns!   Cause fuck you fist pumper.

We are hungry.  We are not all in Miami.  We are not all willing to spend hundreds to see a game until you prove we will consistently have a shot at winning.    It's going to be a tough year.

 But it is an exterior wall and its above a natural gas fireplace.  Although the fire goes backwards rather than, so there is nothing behind the TV.  And do you count component or HDMI as running power?  Because I have no plans of running any sort of power cables.   Awesome thanks for the reply   [Picture of the Living Room](http://i.imgur.com/vSD1AKh.jpg)  Hey Guys,  Included is a picture of my living room.  As you can see in the picture I have a tv over a fireplace.  My plan is to build built in shelves and cabinets on either side.  I'd like to hide all the electronics in one of the cabinets, and run HDMI and component cables through the wall so it looks good.   So basically what I am trying to do is put the wall plates behind the tv, and then somewhere to the left lower down that would eventually be behind a cabinet.  This way I could easily plug in stuff to the tv without having to re-run wires every time while always keeping them hidden.   So as far as I know, certain power cables need to be regulated for being placed in walls for whatever reason.  I don't plan on running any power, just HDMI and component cables.  Do they need to be a specific kind to be run in the wall?  Or will what I have purchased work for what I have planned?  I appreciate any help you can provide.  Also not sure if this is relevant but that wall is an exterior wall with insulation in it.  List of cables and wall plates I purchased for this  * [High-Speed HDMI Cable] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00870ZLJ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01?ie=UTF8 psc=1)  * [Component Video cable]  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZZ8EQ4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1)   * [HDMI Wall Plate] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3UYF5S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1)  * [Component Cable Wall Plate] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HR5G18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1)  Thanks for the help guys   I want to do it as the alpine system leaves something to be desired.  However I would like to put Tuffy lock drawers underneath the front seats.  I wonder if it would fit under the backseat.   So what do we think, would this [cold weather package](http://www.amazon.com/AAA-Severe-Weather-Road-Kit/dp/B00EBT7ZBI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8 colid=1XLTYKTXP4S5U coliid=I2KXCMELIRU3KZ) suffice?  Thinking about buying it for my jeep.   Ok some quick questions how quickly does registration fill up?  I see it is limited to 100 vehicles so when does that typically fill up?  As of right now my 2013 Wrangler Unlimited Sport is completely stock.  I have intentions of adding mods to it but have no idea what if anything will be done between now and this event.  Will it be able to handle the trail stock?  Or should I focus on some specific mods like skid plates between now and the event?   So your saying you have an NSX for sale?   Christ they don't make it easy to find the website do they?  the website is www.traxion.me to make it easier for everyone.   I hope I am posting in the right area, I looked at other subreddits and this seems to make the most sense.  I close on my house on July 2nd and have big plans to make it my own.  I want to do such things as put up a wood fence, build a custom desk that is built into the wall, for two things off the top of my head.  I am sure there are many more things I will need tools for but what are the basic things to get started?  Also I think it would make sense for this to be on the sidebar, or some sort of getting started DIYer list.  EDIT:  So far thanks for all the responses I was a little concerned this would come off as a newb question and get downvoted to oblivion but so far some really helpful info.     That's so simple that's brilliant.  Totally makes sense but I in all honesty never would have thought of that.      Revelation 21:4 A beautiful scripture :)    	12
 I'm here to answer questions, mainly, but I do want to respond with one thing. Apostasy is something that is not supported anywhere in the Qur'an. What you are getting that fact from is the Hadith. The hadith are scriptures people wrote 200 years after the Prophet Muhammad died, and claimed he said this and that. The specific hadith this is coming from stated that if a muslim deconverts, kill him.   That'd probably look true, if it didn't contradict the Qur'an itself. In the Quran, it is stated that killing a man is like killing humanity. The only two reasons it is justified in that text is when one is under attack and needs to defend himself, or if the man is causing harm humanity itself, under which a trial needs to be set forth with a judge.   Concerning your first link, these articles are mainly going into not what the Qur'an is saying itself, but what Islam itself has said about science, and how people of Islam have committed to modern science. One thing this article does say is that a group of people were saying that studying science from a point of nature leads people astray from 'God's path', which is completely disagreeable by me. reading these articles themselves, you can find that scholars and scriptures in Islamic history have condoned and encouraged to learn more about this universe we live in.  For the second link, I read the criticism of science in the Qur'an,and it all came down to evolution as the argument. This leads back to the book's statement that though life has evolved through natural selection, which is agreed both by modern scientists and the Quran today, humans had their own path of evolution. The criticism here is that the Qur'an is basically preaching Creationism. I don't see this as a case of complete creationism.    I do believe in this. I can give the verses from the Qur'an that actually support this statement. The exception was man in this common descent. Humans had their own descent, is what is basically believed by muslims.   I believe in evolution, and the fact that Homo Sapiens have indeed changed over time. The timeline in which Adam and Eve existed according to the Qur'an is thousands and thousands of years ago. They definitely did not look the same. The differing part here is that what the Quran states is that humans evolved in their own way. They were the ones who were different, having a conscience and a soul. Hopefully that answered your question.   An array of personal experiences and the thought that pretty much anything is just belief when one is something as small in this universe as a human. I chose not to state the fact that God is there and that I need to make sure everyone knows about this, but I chose to believe that it is possible he is there.  And by personal experiences I don't mean seeing Muhammad on my toast or anything. Hope that doesn't throw anyone off.   I actually finished the arabic translation of the Qur'an when I was 8, but I don't speak arabic. It's one of the reasons I never truly went tolearn about it in the first place.   I'll look into those readings, thanks!   And just out of curiosity, can you lead me somewhere that supports Islamic studies against science?   This I agree with. It was something I kept in mind while reading the Qur'an. What it stated in its text was, rather, that the universe itself was created within six days, and no mention of God resting was given, considering the fact that for something to be so divine, it must be perfect in its own way too. Though I think the six days phrase was given to give the people of Muhammad's time an estimate of how long it would take for Him to make something so vast.    For clarification, I was referring to the part where God created the earth 6000 years ago, and then put animals on land first.   EDIT: To make things clear, I get that people are gonna bring up arguments against me, but if that happens, please give me something to argue with. If you disagree with the fact that it is parallell to scientific discoveries, then let me know how. Give context. I'm not downvoting anyone here, but don't take advantage of this and troll around. Let's actually talk.   I get what you're saying. But to me, if this is the case, then all religious people can be considered agnostic. They choose to believe in something divine and have their own ways of believing.  However, I also think this can apply to atheists as well. As much as many people can claim to know that there is no god, or a religious person can 'know' there is a god, it is beyond any human's capacity to know the truth. Like Carl Sagan has said, we are nothing but this pale blue dot. We can't ever truly know what caused this universe, but given the evidence and explanations we have, we can make a belief.  Stephen Hawking himself has said that there isn't a necessity for a divine being to have the universe created. A certainty for that, however, is still always debated.   Check conundri's comment for the response.   In short, yes. I am a religious person, but a big factor I want to highlight is that the main reason I returned to be religious was because the religion itself valued science. Your question's better answered in the response I gave to conundri somewhere in this thread. :)   So like I said, being a muslim and not knowing much about its background and logic caused me to look back at religion as a whole, and atheism as well.  I'd find time to try and learn different things and see what I fit with. For example, at a hotel I tried checking out the Bible, which resulted with me stopping after two pages of Genesis.   As for Islam, I went back and read it's history, read the Qur'an in the many translations I could find. I read annotations, philosophies, and the writings of Islamic scholars. In the end, after choosing that God is real to me, Islam made the most sense for it. I'll answer any questions of the religion itself if you want to go into details.  One big thing, though, was the fact that Islam let me keep my belief in evolution. I was reassured by the fact that Islam was parallel to scientific facts and encouraged studying life straight from the Qur'an itself.   Pretty much the story. I've been raised as a Muslim, and had a point in time a year back when I turned agnostic and went into trying to learn everything I could of religious and alternative perspectives on life.  I've been a Redditor for almost a year now, and tend to visit r/atheism quite a bit along with other subs (you guys have my sense of humor). I haven't really seen many religious people having conversations with atheists that are as intellectual as I'd hope for them to be. Maybe I can answer your questions in a clear way considering I've been pretty open with both theist and atheist views. :)  EDIT: It's 12:30 AM here, and I have class in the morning. I promise I'll get to answering questions tomorrow, whenever time allows me to. Thanks to the few who are criticizing in their questions, but debate respectfully!    Haha, nah I get it now. I'm just sleepy.  Pretty much, I was 17, and around that age, pretty much everyone starts to question things. When one's learning, his mind is gradually taking in ideas that become more and more unfamiliar with what he's already used to. With me being raised as a Muslim, I never really went into studying other religions, or atheism itself. I'd always see atheism as this 'OMG HOW COULD YOU NOT BELIEVE IN GOD' thing, actually.   But around that age, it was my turn to start questioning things. I started thinking that if I'm devoting my life to this one religion, I honestly don't know that much about it, and the things around me are making me feel like there might not be a divine being to begin with. At that point, when I wasn't sure, I was an agnostic.  Eventually, I wanted to find a place to settle, whether that be Islam or something else. I researched many sides, and to put it in short, I chose to believe in a god. Once that was over with, I settled at Islam  because it made sense to me.  Hope that answers it!   I think I'm doing both that and r/atheism. And I don't exactly get what you're referring to when you say 'why?'..   Pretty much the story. I've been raised as a Muslim, and had a point in time a year back when I turned agnostic and went into trying to learn everything I could of religious and alternative perspectives on life. Maybe I can answer your questions in a clear way considering I've been pretty open with both theist and atheist views.    I am still pissed about that. That was a total rob.      How do we know that he is alive?   AAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW YYYYYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAA   The best airsoft guns truly do come from Pakistan.   TEXAS MOTHAFUCKA.   Haha, thanks! :)      Jurassic Park. No movie will ever give me that same astonished feeling of disbelief again.   May It Be - Enya  The LOTR trilogy just makes me cry manly tears.   ...Dave Chapelle is a Muslim..   If I could make a suggestion, Sultan's hookah cafe in Richardson?   What the fuck is wrong with you guys?   Blocking information about a country that blocked information...  ...  ..*brrrr...aaahh..*   Anyway*  I'm just saying.   vat   Get the Elder Wand.  Then like... you know, Accio Pop-Up Hot Dog Cooker or something...      EVIL DR. PORK CHOP!   One does not simp..... oh fuck it.   Hah, no we've all been in that spot before. It happens with me, no worries. But I've gotten that a lot, that my drawings are really sketchy. In a way, I kind of go for that. I'd like to call it my style. My art teacher would always have to deal with it when we had to do natural, or photographic drawings.   The whole caption thing isn't the idea of it though. What I'd do with the quote is design it around him. I made it more blank space for that, because otherwise it does look boring. It's more of a part of the sketch,  rather than a caption at the side if you know what I'm trying to get at. Thanks though, man!   I actually don't think that highly of it. I started on this thing two hours ago after wanting to do it for so long. This isn't really anything to make me feel like I'm bothering anyone here. You guys *are* the ones that choose what happens. Just downvote it if you think otherwise.   That's actually really interesting.   I love this one. I thought of it as well. I'm trying to pick out which might be the best. It was between this and the Captain Planet one that I can't decide for now, unless someone gives something different.   So I pretty much feel like this guy is about to make history, and I highly, highly respect what he does. I also like drawing. So I decided to put that stuff together. I have his portrait pretty much done (I wish I could have edited a few things, but I do my stuff in pen), but I want to add a quote and design it around the sketch in a way.   tl;dr: **What's a good quote to design over a sketch of Julian Assange?**  It doesn't really even have to be from him. Anything emphasizing his message can be suitable. One I had in mind was the one from Captain America you guys upvoted a while back:  "When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world - 'No, you move.'"  **Here's the drawing in question. It's a bit high-res so everything's gonna be in too much detail. Sorry!**  http://min.us/mvj27Si   **A Thousand Suns** - Linkin Park   Yeah, I said it. Downvote me.   Sharia law has become the cause of some of the worst ways to handle crimes in Islamic countries today. Not for what it stands for, but for what these guys have turned it into. I don't think there is one reasonable Islamic scholar helping countries like Iran out with their ways of law, or otherwise we wouldn't have shit like this happening: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/02/iran-stoning-sakineh-mohammadi-ashtiani   So we're gonna have people stoned for adultery, right? Because that's what the hadith, the said spoken words of the prophet Muhammad himself,  say in context to Sharia law? Alright then. Let's play it that way. Hopefully those countries still at least read how to do this whole stoning thing, right? Because what they've done so far is a completely half-assed job so far. Let's check the rules.   **1. If there's ever even a case for adultery, then there needs to be *four* witnesses of said case.**   But that's completely stupid, isn't it? Why in the world would two people ever have a legit affair in public? Especially in Iran? Oh, they just decided to get shit on in the middle of a public place in one of the most oppressed places in the East? I guess some people do roll that way. Okay, fine. So we have our criminals prosecuted. Let's get to the stoning?   **2. Only a sinless man may be the one to throw the stone.**   So here's where shit is supposed to go down. Except only someone who isn't guilty of sin themselves are allowed to throw the stone. Which is funny, because I've always thought we all are sinful. Aren't we? Isn't that the point of being human?   Damn, why was this stupid law even made? Why was this punishment made if we can't even get through with it? Is a divine being out there really hell bent on having his creations brutally murdered for being unfaithful?   Or, to take a different way to look at it, was this law really made by a god who instead, made this punishment so hard to get to, that it has even other people look back at themselves before throwing that stone? Was this law simply made to give the human being a look on his own mistakes, before being the judge and executioner of someone else? By doing so, was this punishment even made to never be able to hit the criminals, the adulterers, leaving them to an open path to seek forgiveness?  If the latter, I seriously think it has been used in the wrong ways. From an outside perspective that takes a punishment like this at face value, it is one of the most barbaric rulings mankind has ever set, let alone a god. Then again, law was never made for stupid people. Everything has to be looked into, with detail. The above is the conclusion I came to about this ruling, which for me made it seem like it has reason embedded in it. To me, maybe these laws were set to be granted to a sane, responsible, and intelligent decision maker. I doubt those exist at all in the shithole of governments stationed in the Middle East.   So for the guys who control the way Iran works, take a good perspective at the way this whole stoning thing works. I really, really doubt one of you douchebags are completely clean yourselves. If not, I honestly pray you guys end up taking your own lives out of depression because there is absolutely no way you are benefiting life on this earth. If you were gone, life would be better preserved and protected. We are better off without you.   And don't call yourselves Muslims either. You guys sucked at that too, and you're making life harder as a Muslim for me.  /I know none of this may even get to the actual leaders. It just helps me focus when I actually direct the thing to the actual people.   I completely do. This guy's a great man and I'm glad he's getting attention. All I'm saying is he should have gotten it earlier. Before all this.   It is interesting, I agree with that. I guess I just feel irritated that it's when something this intense happens that we all of a sudden give him his spotlight. I would never, ever, ever hear of him like that back before he started hitting headline stories.   His legs crossed in the near-last panel just does it for me.    I don't understand why we're getting so involved with his past all of a sudden these days.   The links are up there now. Thanks, man!    http://imgur.com/x6En9.jpg  It's not really that much. I literally thought of dressing up as a death eater the morning of halloween. I knew I had that Slytherin scarf and household items to work with.   http://imgur.com/Q2Ggm.jpg  I did this, though, in a Walmart restroom after buying the fine tip Sharpie for it. Thought it'd please the Dark Lord.  EDIT: Second link fixed. Didn't realize it was the wand. Sorry!      Hyper Chondriac Music - Muse   Let Down - Radiohead   Iridescent - Linkin Park.   Once I was walking to my car after working at a studio in school. A cop stopped and started driving idly next to me to ask me what kind of guitar I have. I told him, and he asked me if I know any Johnny Cash, who happens to be one of my idols. We then go off into a conversation that lasted a good five minutes, naming any songs by him, whether I can play them, the AMAZINGNESS of the Walk the Line movie. The cop then wished me a good day and drove off.   Most of these guys really are just normal people doing what they gotta do. I've got respect. That conversation made my day.   This is one of the reasons I love being at UT Dallas.   I'm not asking based on an atheistic bias or a religious bias, but if the video concerns the existence of a higher being being responsible for anything at all appearing, watching it makes me instinctively ask how the basic atoms that started this process came to be.   	57

 He picked his words carefully. He is playing politics and hopefully he will pave the way for more libertarians   It's not that big of a mess really. The only thing that fucked was MCC. Everything else is going according to plan. Halo isn't dead and our hurts the franchise when people and YouTubers like that Dobbins kid keep bashing halo and saying its dead.    Yeah. But this is the story about how the general population finds out. The halo universe is about to be flung into chaos worse then the covie war   I think the point was to hook casual players on the lore. Good job to them.    I love capaldi. The Moff stated he is altering the writing a bit so hopefully we'll get some stellar stories   That was a joke. I know that all don't believe that. And I doubt he does.   How the fuck do you only make 500 a month? Please explain   I don't think he does believe that. If he does, he's never said it.    Libertarians don't hate poor people. Especially not more than crony republicans.    Don't forget rap battles every Tuesday..   This question is asked legit every other day. Please use the search bar   I'd vote for him over any of the other candidates. He actually has values and conviction. As a libertarian, he's a step in the right direction.    I think that's a prereq for republicans lmao. My concern is him shoving it down throats, he stated he won't because it conflicts with his ideology of state and individual rights    Essentially this sub. The republican party needs a reform of its going to win shit though. Rand Paul is easily the best candidate by a long shot. Especially when you compare him to the political jokes that are Bush, Cruz, and Clinton   Nice work. Great legs   I could remove myself the situation, but it wouldn't make logical sense to do so. My issue isn't with paying taxes altogether, it's when the government spends it on stupid shit that detriments the nation. I shouldn't have to move to a third world country to avoid paying the money the government uses to blow billions of dollars.   What he is saying is like saying: "if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"    You missed my point in its entirety. But okay   Are you kidding me? Your telling me I have to renounce my citizenship, leave my family, and leave my nation to stop paying taxes? Well shoot. That doesn't sound voluntary or make any logical sense.   Either way, point being, is that if you are an American citizen, you are *forced* to pay taxes. Required by law = force.    I'm being forced to pay my money to the government; money that is supposed to go for legitimate shit. Not some politicians Island getaway, not for people to go the fucking movies, and certainly not for an overspending, money wasting pentagon.   Don't be ridiculous. Many many people in this community asked for ODST.    Exactly. My tax dollars shouldn't go to your R R poor or rich   Yeah. For he'll pay for revealing the truth   Feels.    I really don't understand how a triple A game studio can have horrible spelling   Shit. I misread your response. I thought you meant that in the book it's a sneak attack.    I like his new armor as well. But they would have had to model his old suit for only a couple of missions.    I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. SIX IS ALIVE.    The way it was portrayed in Reach could have easily been a sneak attack. Plus for civilians, Reach was a simple farming planet for the most part. Although it did have big cities like Alexandria.    They should make their own campaign after this.   Ah but that wouldn't be as interesting or fun. Plus they have to get across and flesh out some of John's backstory from a different perspective, the fact that ONI are massive dickbags, and the theme of "do the ends justify the means?" somehow.   I'm still hoping new info gets added to the mix rather then simply adding new info in terms of smaller details like Ellie being the starry night girl.   My thinking is that with halo 5, both sides of the coin are justified in some way. ONI because they did what was necessary to win and did what was right for morale, everyone else and John because it's morally deplorable. So we'll have that theme of "do the ends justify the means?"   Yeah. It's still interesting to listen to though. To hear the civie side of things and what ONI did to cover shit up. Hopefully we'll get some new info in the coming weeks.   Karldar. Lmao. I love it   Just so you so you know. The government can legit censor the internet now that it's a "public utility" the last thing we want is internet censorship   He can't help the way he looks. Jeez   I used to love this show   Need more. Do other trailers   Wizard much?   Seriously fuck that bitch.   I think it's time to remix this shit and autotune it.    In the first cut scene and the last. Locke tells him himself.   I'm going to go with the H2a cutscenes.    The difference between chief and Locke is that chief was a robot. Trained and brainwashed to obey orders since age 6. They won't refuse. The thing with the 4's is that they are human, thus subject to the things they make them so.   I agree we haven't seen enough of Locke to judge, but he will obey orders without question. But we see him with a strong sense of duty, morals, and honor. Most ONI don't have that. So it's hard to say and he could go either way at this point.   /u/ratidiot. There are many differences between Locke and Chief. Locke had no part in any of that ONI bullshit. Literally, he is a hunter and a hit man for ONI. I'll copy and paste from waypoint:   Locke, however, still blamed the government for failing to defend his homeworld. Arriving at the conclusion that the UNSC was incapable of protecting anyone else, he struck out on his own and became a freelancer, selecting and hunting targets of his own volition.   While his actions were unconventional and motives born of dissent, they eventually caught the eye of the Office of Naval Intelligence. With some very specific roles in mind for the rough but talented youth, ONI approached Locke with an offer: come home and let us train you to be even better. Finally sensing an opportunity to find greater purpose, Locke found the strength to let go of his resentment, and entered an extensive training program.  He was a dissenter before, and did not like ONI. If they ask him to do something like kill innocents, or something that violates his morals. He won't do it. Hard evidence? In nightfall when his team member approached him about screwing over everyone else, he vehemently refused even though he could have died and CONSISTENTLY stuck to his morals that entire time. You think he's going to abandon his morals because some asshole in ONI (whom he had resented) ordered him too? Not likely.  If he is after chief, he really believes chief to be in the wrong. I can't even imagine Locke and Chief being black and white enemies. Locke is definitely NOT an ONI lapdog. He might do what they say, but he has limits, plus a dark side to do what needs to be done if he thinks it's for the greater good.    Move on and improve. She obviously doesn't care about you. If you stay she'll only do it again.   His character itself. Looking at him in nightfall, he was very moral. Someone like that doesn't agreeably do things that conflict with it   In a way, yes. But his character is a bit more complex then simply a lapdog. He does what he does for ONI because he feels it is morally right, when that feeling goes away. He questions his superiors.    *Flawed legacy* as a title in the Halo 2 soundtrack. Just so happens that master chiefs legacy has been a bit flawed and doctored up by ONI as evident by the h2 promo pic.  HALOUMINATI CONFIRMD.      Palmer is seriously an ONI lapdog that generally doesn't question orders. Plus Del Rio was doing the yelling in that situation and he's not ONI. When ONI told palmer to kill Halsey, she went all out lap dog, hanging tongue and all.   On the other hand, Locke is a realist with strong morals. He does what he's told by ONI without question for the most part.   Fucking dope   True.    Fuck yes. Powerstroke master race                  I want to. But I have no money coupled with a stacked reading list as it is. I was wondering who on this sub is getting it tomorrow.                     Me and my buddy were arguing about the relationship of light years in distance and time. Whether time is related to light years. I was in favor of time being related because I thought the distance of a lightyear was measured by the distance light would travel in a year, so my title would be correct. Am I stupid?                                 Is there a comprehensive timeline of all halos events?  I'm confused with the spartan III program. After watching HaloFollowers video, I'm curious whether the S4 program overlaps with the S3s, at that point, what would be the point of having two spartan programs at the same time, looking at you Delta company.   How many S4s are out there? Same with S3s? It says many got assigned to various branches, and other types of teams like Noble Team exist? If so, do we have any info on them?   Josh Holmes confirmed this via twitter. Some of the best times were had getting different armor permutations and customizing my spartan to be unique. This hurts the longevity of the franchise; halo was the only FPS that allowed you to totally alter your appearance to be unique to you.  https://twitter.com/JoshingtonState/status/549728159935913984  https://twitter.com/JoshingtonState/status/532768205715304448     They've said that the arena is only a small part of the game and they have much bigger multiplayer and co-op experiences. They have also said that this is the largest halo game yet. I'd like if the capacity of custom games and gamemodes was something like MAG.   If you don't know what MAG is, it stands for Massive Action Game and featured huge battles with 256 players. All other game modes would be still be possible      Halo 5 needs to have unprecedented custom game options and an amazing forge. Here is my list of things that will foster a great community, amazing games, laughs, and memories. Some of these are features have been in past halo games and were successful; and they should be expanded upon. If these features are implemented, we will see a return of machinima, customs, clans, forgers, and much more content creation.   - **Easy, fluid UI**. Take Reach for example and add some handy features from 4. I should be able to view who is in my friends game and what they are doing. Plus join in progress option for custom games. And not buggy as hell for fucks sake.  - **clan system**. For the love of God, give us some way to organize our group of friends or clan. This is vital to many players. A way to search and find clans would be great  - **many custom game options**. We should be able to alter the game to our liking for customs.   - **The forge needs to be amazing**. Big forge maps. Large budget etc etc. Bigger pallet, more vehicles, etc, etc. Creativity is key in all of this. It was suggested that there should be a PC map editor and creator that let's you create awesome detailed maps, then upload to Xbox.  - **More theater and HD capture options**  - **custom games browser or customs matchmaking** even the ability to rent a server would be sweet.   - **working and active file browser system**  there needs to be something to show off and display peoples work. Whether that be screenshots, maps, videos, or gametypes. I should be able to search users, tags, titles, maps, and gametypes to find content, and you should be able to upload videos that you make in the upload studio and machinima videos to the file browser. Allow for checking file shares pre-game also. This should be available on launch.  I want to go onto halo waypoint.com or forge hub and click a download button, and have it pop up on my Xbox in my stored files.  - this one is the most controversial. **loadouts and armor abilities for custom games** they were always fun to use in mini games and added a fun dynamic to custom games, they did add strategic elements to BTB games. However i do not want them in the arena. I'd also like to be able to alter the power and range of the spartan abilities.  These have no affect on matchmaking or the arena at all and I'd like to know what the community thinks about this. Hopefully 343 can implement these features.   I thoroughly enjoyed this series and the insight into the development process; gave us a look into how hard it is to make the games. Toward the end, Josh Holmes said that this is the "biggest halo game to date", so they must have a lot in store for halo 5. It would also be cool to see the size of 343 and halo's development process if we see more sprint again.      They could do seasonal/biseasonal storylines. Imagine playing as Johnson on harvest or during his S1 days. ODST 2? Or maybe develop John some more by playing as him during the insurrection or a pivotal mission, or even Locke in a spy thriller type thing.   If they switched it from a firefight hybrid to a full on weekly episodic campaign with cutscenes built in, it would be amazing. With a good couple months between seasons to hype people, it would give thousands of people a reason to start up halo 5 while covering cool canon in the process.  343 pls   It is an amazing idea for halo and e-sports. HCS could very well grow halo into a top e sports game again, similar to CoD, DOTA, LoL. It will take a couple years but I can see it happening with halo 5.   I've been seeing many redditors say various things about Halo 5, and i do not think there has been an in depth analysis of the gameplay done yet; so here is mine. People were attracted to Halo because it was **competitive and fun**. It allowed people to be creative and bond with others while random objects hurled at you as you struggled to keep balance; then go hardcore competitive on Guardian and fuck people up. Halo 4 failed in both of these regards. This is why I think Halo 5 will be a *quality* Halo game. Although, people will still get pissed off, this has happened with all of the Halo's.  I believe Halo 5 to be the opposite of CoD so let me explain why the game will be a Halo game. I get where most of you are coming from because i was skeptical as well, and of course there are things I don't like and want removed, but the game itself will be competitive and will have a skill gap. It appears to me many didn't look at the gameplay, pro reviews, and vidocs before drawing to conclusions. Although it's possible to dislike the gameplay for various reasons, disliking it for being CoD or casual is where you are wrong. Halo 4 was more Call of Duty than Halo 5 is... by a long shot.  Putting the H5 gameplay on the same level as Call of Duty is absolutely ridiculous; Destiny, Call of Duty, Halo 4, and Titanfall couldn't be further apart from this game. Everything Halo 4 did goes against Combat dynamic that exemplified the previous games. Halo 5 simply does not, it alters it, yet sticks to the values of a Halo game. Plus there are many other things that makes a Halo game other than multiplayer, like campaign which will be nothing short of stellar.   There is a reason Halo fell out of mainstream popularity by mid halo 3 and people jumped ship to Call of Duty. The gameplay became stale and slow, not because CoD was easier. Then Bungie went and changed it in all the wrong places... at that point 343 continued this trend with Halo 4. And from a market perspective, they had to learn from halo 4 or else they wouldn't have a decent fanbase and their effort null; simple economics. Thus the reason why they hired pro players to advise development around the game; they ***NEED*** h5 to be competitive and fun. So the last thing they are going to make is a no-skill casual game, but a game casuals can enjoy non the less. And they wouldn't just keep the pro's around as PR because it is a waste of money and the pro's wouldn't want to be apart of an organization where they are being used.   At the moment and for the foreseeable future, there will not be a new good arena (not CoD style) shooter on the market until halo 5, which halo has on lockdown (pun intended lel). It's clearly the corner of the market they are pursuing and rightly so. To get Halo back to where it should be (on top), they need to evolve the gameplay while retaining that arena style, which they (finally) understand. You wanna look at a cash cow, look at CoD. At least 343 cares about the community.  **Mechanics and Values**  Alright, time to get mechanical. When you look at Halo, what makes it great? What makes halo different from all of the rest and not like a CoD game or any of the sort? It boils down to Halo's core values as an arena shooter, something CoD is not; CoD is an arcade shooter. So to make a successful Halo game, it cannot violate a simple core.   **The core values are:**  1. - map control  2. - power weapon control 3. - skill gap (challenging gameplay) 4. - equal starts  5. - competitive environment  6. - Strategic thinking 7. - risk  reward decision making  8. - simplicity  9. - fluid map movement  Halo 5 meets every single one of these requirements and I can explain why. 1, 2, 4, 5 are evident by the spartan chatter, power weapon counters, and equal loadouts. The chatter and counters are going to make players more aware of the map and general environment; map and weapon control will be more prevalent in this game then in past Halo's, forcing casuals to be more competitive if they want to win rather than just walking around the map throwing nades and shooting, making them invest time and effort in the game and turning casuals into hardcore fans.    I'll explain further, competitive environment: the game is introducing spartan chatter and weapon counters, changes making the game more accessible... yes. But competitively accessible, so people will be more involved with the game and teamwork will be fostered creating a skill gap and challenging gameplay; which is what halo is all about correct? Currently, most players will walk around the map with no conscious direction. Now more players will be aware of the map and power weapons, causing more fun and tactical carnage. Other factors play into this, these aren't isolated values.  Next is strategic thinking, combine the competitive environment with the movement abilities you will get people being tactical in their next move (unlike halo 4 where sprint had no counter or balance), adds a whole new dynamic. As for the "Cut and run strategy" I agree it isn't halo but it was countered by a variety of aspects in the game including no shield recharge, and you are not at full speed when running. The pro's who bashed halo 4 for the reason people are bashing halo 5 claim the new movement abilities are well balanced compared to Halo 4. It's more of the classic risk-reward aspect which adds strategic ability while sticking to the arena style. You will still be able to fight back if an enemy gets first shot, you will be able to strafe, and out BR noobs.    Simplicity is justified because, well, it's not as simple as previous installments. But Halo 5 is much simpler than Call of Duty and adds to the strategic element of the game, (unlike CoD) Fluid map movement has a solution, they need to design arena maps with this in mind which they are doing. This still lets crouch jumping happen, but adds to it. No doubt you are going to be able to reach new heights and new ways to engage in combat. I see people crouch jumping so they can clamber onto new areas. All of this contributes to a large skill gap and a skilled game... unlike any other on the market. These are my $0.02  TL;DR: Halo 5 will be a good game with map and power weapon control. Will be competitive arena. I welcome *intelligent* debate.  It's not your grampa's halo, but it's still Halo. Ghandi's review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nffMurA-2K0 list=UUo0bc4LAMbsOwYO58S8CfCg  Flameswords review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Y2IVQjCdA  http://teambeyond.net/halo-5-pro-impressions/  http://teambeyond.net/halo-5-guardians-multiplayer-beta-impressions/         I'd personally love it. If they actually continued it and did various seasons, 343 could cover many aspects of the universe such as playing as an ODST or marine, Human - forerunner war. They could even go back and make a mission based around ghosts of onyx or any other book.   Imagine playing Sgt Johnson during the battle of harvest. It would be fucking awesome. The whole episodic campaign thing is a great idea if they made it more campaign like, less firefighty, and 25 episodes per season. Probably a long shot but they could contract episodes to saber and cutscenes to blur.   343 pls   My list:  - **Increase player count to at least 24**  - include custom loadout options for custom games.  - working, easy file share system on launch  - The fucking ability to *JOIN CUSTOM GAMES IN PROGRESS* FAK  - Obviously a better forge system than h2a. Even though h2a forge is pretty awesome.  -  more vehicles to compliment the new btb gameplay as well as a bigger weapon sandbox. Keep in mind that arena 4v4s can stay the same.  - More custom games options  - working competitive ranking system on launch  If you have anything else, please post below.   Chief: We've got to go back!   Cortana: Back where!?  Chief: Back to the Halo!  Marty: This is some heavy sh*t  http://imgur.com/izigqkd      Hopefully everything is fixed. Tired of beta testing the UI. Game is really fun though.   http://teambeyond.net/matchmaking-fixes-top-priority/   Me and my buddy agree doing legendary with NO skulls on. And when one of us dies, we both go back to checkpoint?      Halo is a competitive shooter and requires an arena style. I see people flip shit when anything deviates from h2 when it comes to h5. Halo needs to be a fun, challenging, arena shooter but CANNOT solely cater to competitive kids. It should be fun for casuals also and I hope 343 realizes this. I'm going to list how both can be accomplished.  Halo's gameplay has very unique properties that make it fun. I'm not going to go into specifics about game mechanics/ideas, there are tons of community content out there about it, but here are the core requirements halo *must* have to be successful:    - **Arena** Equal starts, map control, power weapon control, and tactics.    - **Customization** The ability to mold the game to your liking. This includes forge, custom game options, ability to customize your spartan to be unique only to you, and theater options.   These are things no other current popular game does, halo has a grasp on the market for them; halo's niche. (To clarify, these aspects are not competing with one and other, they can go hand in hand) its very possible to make a game both halo competitive and casual fun. In implementing these things, 343 will have made a fun halo game everyone can enjoy.  In my opinion if 343 services these aspects of the game and expands them further than the previous halo levels of competitive and customization, then we will have a successful halo game. My worry is that 343 will release a game that is too focused on the competitive and just leave out many customization options because a bunch of whiny competitive kids complain when 343i adds something like an option for sprint and loadouts in custom games. When I load up h5, I don't want to feel like I'm playing the MLG playlist, nor some CoD bullshit, but I want it to feel like Halo Team Slayer. Then I want to load some fun custom games with a *24 player lobby*     I'm interested to read the opinions I've likely generated... I found this funny: http://imgur.com/L1aZxWJ  EDIT: I believe all additions to halo must meet these basic requirements or at least not hinder them.      Halo and destiny clan. If you need people to do the raid, strikes or nightfall, we are creating a group for it. We will be running MCC as well when it comes out.  The criteria is to be mature, intelligent and at least lvl 25.  www.bungie.net/en/clan/Xbox/574683   Looking for some cool, mature and intelligent people to join a destiny clan.  If you want to join, you should be a halo fan due to the clan most likely doing both destiny and halo upon MCC release. The clan may turn into a military styled clan later on down the road depending on what people want to do. The Clan is set up as a group to play destiny with and accomplish shit. (raid, nightfall, strikes etc.)   www.bungie.net/en/clan/Xbox/574683  Go here if you want to join or find out more.  Thanks   Edit: I'm a lvl 27 warlock. Void. I use an auto rifle with legendary sniper, for close quarters I switch to invective. I'm just noticing I get to few kills then the rest of the fireteam. I try not to die, but can't get as many kills. And tend to die as well. Im not horrible. Just looking to improve.   Gt: ZeALoTT   I'm here to encourage those of you who develop meaningful theories and post lore facts. Keep doing it. That is all.   I'm genuinely curious to know what libertarians think of Rand and a possible presidential bid.   I've seen him be bashed as being not like his father and a sell out from libertarians, and be praised as well.   If he runs, will you vote for him? If he gets the nomination, would you vote for him? How do you think he'd do? Can he compete with the others?   I imagine it starts something like this: In the name of the father bungie, son RNGesus, and holy spirit kyle we pray...   In recent years, scouts has made headlines for various reasons and many of those has been homosexuals in scouting. Within these headlines we see accounts of sexual abuse in troops on the part of adults and youth and scouts has received a bad name because of it. It has also gotten a bad name because of its policy on not allowing gays in the organization; a rock and a hard place. Like most debates, this one has two equally compelling sides.  BSA has taken many steps attempting to curb sexual abuse in scouting; mainly by enforcing policies. And they recently decided to allow openly gay youth in the organization, but not allowing openly gay adults. The one side says this opens the door to sexual abuse, violates the bible, and that scouting is a religious organization (mainly for the moral guidance imo), also that scouting is a private organization and can conduct itself how it wants. It has been that way for years and is fine, people don't ask if you're gay, you don't tell. No harm done.   The pro gay side says that it's time to open up scouting for gays and get into the 21st century. It is unfair for people to be excluded based on sexual orientation. Both sides have compelling arguments and BSA knew this. But to the best of my knowledge, BSA gets funding from both human rights organization and religious institutions, both sides threatening to cut funding. Everyone in this sub can agree scouting is a great thing and is one of the best things to happen to this country and that we need more of it. It was already getting bad press before this issue as well as falling numbers, then this happens --- more bad press, people leave on both sides due to the issue. So whichever they picked, people will be upset. And the majority of charters are with churches. Scouting was put in a bad spot.  As a libertarian and an Eagle scout I respect both sides of the argument and in my opinion, it would be easier to simply leave it to the troops, the districts or even the councils. Forcing people to adapt when they aren't ready is an issue as well as excluding them. I believe the troops or people more closely connected with those that would be affected are better apt to make this decision. For example, a troop that has adults that are older more conservative men that have spent years contributing to scouting and are wonderful people with so much knowledge to pass on to youth, or if a troop has young men as leaders that are more open minded.   Scouting is based around personal responsibility and building leaders as well as developing decision making. The troops/districts/council should be able to decide for themselves. Irdk how anyone will feel about this. I'll probably catch a lot of hate lol.  **Edit/update:** I'd like to make my stance known as I don't hate nor want to exclude gays or atheists, both have a place in scouting if they so choose. I understand why this post gathered as much hate as it did.   As a young person joins scouts, they generally don't have a concept of sexuality until the middle or HS years, so the issue is irrelevant and is for youth. The issue is not discussed or cared about, most troops will not discriminate as long as the person lives scoutly, my troop wouldn't and few troops would shove a person out based on that, even if the decision is left to councils. And I highly doubt anything would really change, the debate gets overthought beyond what would realistically happen. Very few troops would struggle just as few are now.   The point of compromise of leaving it up to a council preferably. Is that they can decide whether they are ready for that change, not morally but the affects of it (funding from either side, membership, community support etc.) one way or another, BSA suffers. The argument is irrelevant for youth because they are currently allowed. And if the decision for adults is left to councils. I doubt they would ask off the bat when someone joins... Simply because it doesn't matter unless you're a homophobe and I believe most if not all councils would allow them.   Atheism has come up quite a few times. Once again, they should not be excluded and most people don't care. The rule states that you must believe in a higher power, that is all. A comment below summed it up nicely as if you believe in aliens as more powerful beings than you pass if you don't happen believe in god. But if by chance you believe humans are alone, then you should be allowed to be openly atheist but must still respect the establishment as it is. For many in scouting, religion is a pillar for moral guidance that helps the scout way and by the time one decides they are atheist, they are adolescent, so they've made the decision. Young people can still use the moral pillar of it .So there is no need to fit the program for a minority even though they should be allowed. This whole thing got blown out of proportion.   I was just wondering. I'm an arena style halo player so I avoid the crucible. Anyone else feel the same? It just seems to unbalanced to me. Better than CoD though hah     	107
 Not the most recognized author, but I saw topics on her works before and came to wonder. Anybody happened to read this unfinished novel? What your impressions were? Favorite characters, storylines? I'm rather fond of it, myself, and think it shows how Gaskell's writing matured in comparison with earlier novels.       Noted, thank you!   They were somewhat hit and miss with me, depending on the author analyzed, but I definitely support the notion.            Don't even care which authors. Just any published analysis that made you feel like the person behind it really gets the author and knows how to bring out what's unique and great about them. I had an experience like that with Chesterton's "Charles Dickens" and feel curious about everybody else's.      I have made a new friend some weeks ago. She is a pleasant, easy-going person and we have a lot in common and get along really well for the most part. I'd love to get closer to her over time. But there's one thing that really is starting to bug me.  She is late. Always. For everything - meetings, phone calls, any self-imposed deadlines. I tried to be flexible, to accommodate her (i.e. let her decide on the time we meet) but it doesn't seem to make a difference at all. At best she is fifteen minutes late, at worst... can be up to forty minutes. Although I haven't known her for long enough to say if she's like that in everything (like her job, for example), she claims she is and can't help it. There wasn't yet any situations where her habits would let us down in a big way, but my frustration is gradually accumulating. I'm afraid that one day I'll snap and drive her off and worried that her attitude shows she isn't very serious about our frienship and plans.      **tl;dr**: My new friend is always late for everything and it makes me feel like she doesn't take me seriously, but I'm not sure how to confront her without coming off as overdramatic.         ...yeah, that does sound like an interesting twist on the theme. Added to reading list, thanks!   And what kind of bad feeling?            R. L. Stine, and I strongly suspect I'm not alone. His stuff wasn't even creepy past your first three books, but man, was it addictive.   Oh, sweet, I need more modern literature in my life. Thanks!   Searching for something along the lines of Zola's "Rougon-Macquart" or Galsworthy's "Forsyte Saga". It doesn't have to be a book series though, a solitary novel works just as well.   So, we all have this gold collection of childhood books that really hold up no matter how many decades pass. But lbr, we read a lot of bullshit too. Are there any books from your childhood that are making you go "wait, I used to like this?!" as an adult?   I've always admired Austen's ability to portray varied and complex parent-child relationships. When it comes to family situations, her heroines go full spectrum - from heavy neglect or abuse to having perfectly supportive and reasonable caretakers with lots of of variations in-between. Was there any parental character whose interactions with the MC you especially enjoyed? For me Mrs. Dashwood takes the cake, I think: it was great to see a genuinely loving mother whose temperament and worldview clashes with one of her kid's a lot.               Good advice! The only thing, I find it rather awkward to start conversations by simply marching up and introducing myself. Making some comment/observation about the situation we're both in (it's cold, the queue barely moves, the coffee is great here) and going from there works better for me. If the conversation doesn't run into the ground after a couple of lines, slipping the introduction in somehwhere along the way is easy enough.   I used to appreciate Dickens in a slightly condescending manner - great style, but complicated plots usually don't come together, pacing is often mucked-up and ugh, cheap emotional punches. But then I read Chesterton's analysis of his novels and it really made me see his strengths in a clearer light and wider context. Further evidence to all the things a good fanbase can do for an author!     	29
 Not sure if you're serious, but this reads like a somewhat tasteless joke.   I really wish this had happened. Gollum was written for Lennon.      yyyyyyikes.   Yeah, I understand Nolan's use of the terms. I thought you were asserting that Tesla is literally a magical spells-and-potions wizard in the film, which would be silly.  You make an interesting point about Tesla's "wizardry" being beyond explanation even by our standards--my interpretation was that while we are not privy to the mechanics of cloning, it does obey rational physical laws. This is in keeping with the film's articulation of the tension between ugly reality and blissful illusion as the nature of life, supported in Hugh Jackman's dieing monologue. I'll have to see how your reading stacks up next time I watch it.   updated with links!

Tesla's a scientist, in real life and in the movie; if he's perceived as a wizard it's a result of the time he's in. The cloning **machine** is an element of science fiction, not fantasy.   I agree with you on the point of the movie--there is no magic and we purposely avoid that fact--but I take the cloning machine at face value. What's important is that it is a scientific explanation within that world, even if it doesn't work outside of it.   You know, I had similarly written it off until I read Hulk's thoughts on it; it really is an unusually relentless look at aging, wasted potential, compromise and lack thereof. I think some of its dismissal stems from how unpleasant it is to explore these themes, particularly for those of us who had or have some idealistic relationship to art a.k.a. the people most likely to watch arty flicks like Greenberg. We are its audience and the target of its criticism, which is why we've sort of collectively put it out of our minds. It's not exactly one of my favorites this year, but I'm definitely glad Hulk made me revisit it.   This is *exactly* right, and it's exactly why the movie's absurd violent-mission-from-god premise and unwavering misogyny are so troubling.   ... ... are we saying that *wasn't* fucking absolute nonsense?   Knowing scales and chord structure are crucial. Rather than trying to find every individual note every time, be conscious of your key and train your hand to follow natural chord shifts.   that's strange, as learning how to play songs pretty much the entire point of Rock Band's pro mode. times change i suppose.   Leboski is stupid the first time you see it and brilliant the second--it's a law of thermodynamics or something.   The scene in which Willem Defoe appears alongside the protagonists in flashback is pretty cool. Literally everything else about it is complete fucking nonsense.   I think it's very much a movie about storytelling--not story structure or craftsmanship, but simply what comes out when you turn on the creativity tap. This might be offputting to people expecting traditional narrative beats, but I think it works marvelously as an exploration of everyday creativity.   Hmmm. So to recap, the commenter above me is upset because he/she thinks r/atheism is unfairly characterized as a circlejerk. I respond by saying it sort of *is* a circlejerk, which is especially problematic for a community that supposedly privileges rational thought. If you think my criticism is tired and worthless then so be it, but I'd argue that it's a tired and worthless response to an equally tired and worthless argument--of course there are plenty of assholes, of course there's great content buried there, of course r/atheism feels like it's being picked on. I would speculate that the karma discrepancy between our two posts has more to do with opinion agreement than discussion fostering; thankfully I don't care about karma. **When I read the OP's post, I didn't downvote it, I dashed off a quick rebuttal.** Which is also what you did; thank you for your reply, you're part of the solution, etc.  As for the actual worthlessness of my post, that judgement seems to be based in the idea that the problems it raises are long solved: you here point to the two debate subreddits; I was at the time unaware of them. Even if these subreddits *did* solve the debate deficit, their lack of visibility is problematic: r/atheism does nothing to promote these subreddits as an outlet, and as you say elsewhere, they're sorely lacking in content. I'd also add that it furthers an unhelpful binary of atheists and believers, which exacerbates the warlike upvote/downvote behavior; there are compelling arguments to be had *within* r/atheism about the personal and institutional roles of religion and what atheism should mean to the world at large. **So: if these subreddits *do* answer my issues, they're doing so poorly. But they really don't, eh?**  I therefore propose that my criticism stands; that r/atheism remains excessively homogeneous, that labeling and marginalizing dissent to separate subreddits isn't good enough, that a culture change is is in order. It's time for r/atheism to express itself not just in votes but comments, to answer critics rather than silence them. Yes, "hivemind" and "cirlejerk" are problems bigger than r/atheism, and **yes, I am unfairly holding r/atheism to a higher standard because of what it claims to represent.**  So rise to it, r/atheism. Keep your memes and opinion reinforcement if you must--it's worthless, it's junk food, that's fine, whatever. **I'm just saying, next time you feel like downvoting dissent, put it into words.** We can have a discussion.   many kinds of fashion shoes? please, tell me more!   yup, i hear ya.   great call listing those two subreddits, they really ought to be linked in the sidebar!  On downvotes, I feel like perhaps you're making two different defenses here: first that r/atheism transcends downvoterism, then that maybe it suffers from downvoterism but that's not r/atheism's fault. As a regular reader and occasional commenter, I feel the latter is far more accurate, but that's just my opinion.  There is also the fact that pretty obvious/tired jokes and links get a whole lot of love, but that is of course subjective and again not unique to r/atheism. reddit is a circlejerk, really.   pfffff I am the problem. Don't worry everyone, "the problem" has been isolated, turns out it's me, no big deal.  Seriously darling, I hope you don't think I'm bitching about Karma, because really, what the fuck is a karma. Can I eat it? Will it heat my home? Can I impress potential employers with it?  What's far more real to me is discussion. To the extent that reddit's karma system fosters intelligent discussion, hurray. To the extent that is stifles it, boo. Now shut up and kiss me you animal.   well, I do think "central" is a subjective term; what Colbert takes to be central to Catholicism will be different from the pope will be different from outsiders. That is of course religion as personal rather than institutional, but I think that's as it should be.   somebody almost immediately downvoted that post; I found that so funny that I downvoted it too.   Colbert is a good example of positive theism, in my opinion--his Catholicism not only gives him personal happiness, it gives him personal responsibility as well. Good on him.   Perhaps the charge of "circlejerk" stems from a lack of two-sided discussion? Opposing viewpoints are often downvoted rather than addressed, which not only makes the subreddit boring, but is somewhat ironic for a group that allegedly prizes logical discourse.   I get it! You answer unspecified allegations of racism by saying he thinks you're an infidel! Because he's Muslim! Irony! Good one!      Yeah, it will typically involve some selective interpretation. But no matter how silly such behavior might seem to us, hostile mischaracterization isn't helpful.   here's the thing: when a religious person falls ill and accepts medical treatment, they know damn well that medicine is keeping them alive; they simply see doctors and medicine as a part of God's plan for them, perhaps a result of prayer. The kid did not learn a valuable lesson about how medicine works, he already knew that. Instead, he learned that atheists are petty assholes, and that is what any other person of faith would take from this as well.   am i misunderstanding something? do you people *actually* think this stuff is pushing forward the cause of free thought?  Oh, you're just masturbating each other. Pardon the intrusion.   yikes.   oh ho ho ho atheist doctors killing religious children. that's good for the cause, eh?   fair enough, and I understand that in initially failing to articulate my point I came off as a bit of a troll. the critic smartly characterizes this list as "20 films [she] adored," which is a great way of putting it that I can't argue with at all. And while I might cringe at some of these consciously low-profile inclusions and high-profile exclusions, on some level I'm probably just a bit jealous that *White Material* didn't play anywhere near me.   Out of touch with wider cinema culture and how it reflects what what happened artistically and commercially in 2010, out of touch with what will be remembered from this year, out of touch with a number of very good films--some better than those included on the list--because limited or non-existent release was a prerequisite. And that's what bothers me, Winkyburger, when this form of art that I love is co-opted by people more concerned with exclusivity than quality.  And honestly, not trying to be a jerk, but I really don't know what are you arguing at this point. Are you saying that this list *is* a perfect expression of what happened in film 2010? Are you saying that it's not but we should pretend that it is? Please clarify.   oh holy shit yes.   you're insulted because I said that the indiewire blog's top 20 films isn't authoritative? that's silly, winkyburger. by all means, it can assert itself however it likes--and it does say "my" top 20 when you follow the link--but if I want to say that it's a bit out of touch then what difference does it make? Am I not furthering the discussion in doing so?   Just pointing out that it's a bit out of touch--favoring minor Polanski over the Social Network seems a choice made in the interest of deliberate obscurity rather than reflection of quality, you know?  I'm more than happy to share my top 10, presented here in alphabetical order. It does, of course, reflect my wholly subjective cinematic values.  Exit Through the Gift Shop (Banksy) Four Lions (Chris Morris) Inception (Christopher Nolan) The Kids Are Alright (Lisa Cholodenko) Mother (Bong Joon-ho) A Prophet (Jacques Audiard) Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World (Edgar Wright) The Social Network (David Fincher) Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich) True Grit (Joel and Ethan Coen)  Open to discussion and criticism of course. :)     oh i definitely agree that approaching Mormonism from both sides affords a  far *more* objective perspective than those simply within. And as I say, it's no slight on the group by any means. Just trying to be conscious of how r/atheism is perceived by rational outsiders, mostly.   ha touch. but to elaborate further, this list might best be titled "20 Best Films That Didn't Play in Mainstream Theaters," or "20 Films to Impress Your Film Class." This list has some great picks, but it's not *the* List of Films 2010 by any stretch.   I'll leave my panties as they are, thanks. I harbor no Mormon sympathies myself, but ex-Mormon is literally the opposite of objective. Literally! That's no slight on ex-Mormons or the vibrant and insightful ex-Mormon subreddit, it's just how language works.  If r/exmormon was a community of impartial observers with no preconceived notions or biases, then it would be objective. But it's not. It's a community of ex-Mormons, obviously. Literally the opposite! Literally!   My point: to claim a viewpoint is objective just because you agree with it is disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. It's a small, trifling, intellectual dishonesty, and maybe you're cool with that and maybe you're not. I was just pointing it out. :)   you could hang out here, but it looks pretty dead: http://www.reddit.com/r/nihilists   "For informed criticism of the Mormon church..." "For insightful commentary on the Mormon church..." "For ex-Mormons..."  I think those all work better.   well done.   Vectrex nostolgia, man. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex   good on him   This is r/atheism's description of r/exmormon. Every time I see it it strikes me that an ex-mormon perspective is about as subjective a position as possible--objectivity suggests dispassionate third party observation.  Just something to consider. :)   Check out *I Love You Philip Morris*; its subject matter and distribution troubles largely relegated it to the indie crowd, but it's a great big crowd-pleasing comedy at heart.   just noting that it is by no means *the* best 20 films--awful lot of lists this time of year, ya know?   I would probably title this "*A* 20 Best Films of 2010," myself.   i'd be curious to know what you think, check back!   this has more to do with capitialism than christianity, but whatevs.   appreciate the comments--i was strictly editor on this, but you make some good points. i'll be sure to bring that to next project i'm behind camera.         i like this.   holy shit   King of Kong + some pretty solid TV work = cautious optimism   this is now linked from the WikiLeaks facebook page as well.   yeah, Deuteronomy 22. Quoting or referencing some specific verses would make it more effective though--confused rape victims might not be keen to read the chapter in its entirety, so some specifics would make your argument more accessible for them.   I came here to posit that 1975 feminist classic *Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* is not engaging enough to be a viably political work. I think I may be lost.   Relevant Biblical citations would make this better. :)   Any relevant, honest, principled counter-cultural movement doesn't oppose the "mainstream" simply for its status as such, only implicitly to whatever extent "the mainstream" perpetuates what they oppose. As long as a work is intelligent and uncompromising, I don't care what percentage of the population approves of it--Exit Through the Gift Shop is largely that type of work.   1. Mark Kermode 2. Filmspotting 3. The /Filmcast  These three each have distinct outlooks--critic, academic, and nerd, respectively--that help give me a balanced perspective on the world of film.   You might be interested in Do The Right Thing by Spike Lee; wherever you fall politically, Lee is a filmmaker who often foregrounds his stylistic choices, making his films good candidates for this sort of analysis.  I'd also recommend the stylistically ostentatious and endlessly enjoyable works of Edgar Wright, though there's less likely to be much scholarly material available on him.   approval!   pow!   You are in luck my friend: http://www.cupsizechoir.com/?s=6445   So who else got over the tits pretty quick and started trying to form interesting jazz chord progressions?  just me? really? fuck.   boom!   That's six different guys ya dirty racist!   nah i'm just kidding; that'd be messed up, eh?   it took me a bit, but i've made my peace with this syntax.   this   bit on the nose, eh?   .   guys, look, i'm not unaware of the Catholic authority hierarchy. I'm merely saying that Catholic culture and identity stretches beyond simple Vatican policy, and to declare someone uncatholic for her liberal understanding of the dogma is to misinterpret what being Catholic is in practice. Looking at the way Catholics live their lives in reality is a valid alternative understanding of Catholicism, and in my opinion a far more productive understanding than some purely theoretical Catholic ideal that's never happened. Honestly, I feel like my argument is being willfully misinterpreted at this point. Also, good one on the 3/5. Catholics be sexist. :)   I agree that their behavior doesn't change Vatican policy, but the point I'm trying to make is that for many Catholics, there's more to Catholic culture and identity than that.   It is exactly what I'm talking about, actually. My point was that if for whatever reason a person identifies as Catholic, they are a small part of what Catholicism is. The word has no intrinsic meaning beyond what we give it, and people of the Catholic world have a right to the title whether they subscribe to the written dogma wholesale or not. I think you make a good case for what constitutes the Catholic belief system, but I think for many Catholics there is more to Catholic culture than that, and I certainly understand no wanting to give it all up.   I hear you, but the fact that you still call these people Catholics shows that their behavior defines what "Catholic" means, don't you think? For many Catholics, that means negotiating their personal beliefs with those of the institution, and I'd argue that this negotiation is a big part of the Catholic experience--they don't just sacrifice their right to the Catholic moniker by virtue of their nonpapality, right?   That's certainly one perspective, and it's perfectly defensible. For many people, however, the personal sense of community and identity that comes with Catholicism outweighs your subjective political reading of the situation, and that's fine. If her Catholicism has personal value for her, I respect that--especially if she's a good person.   I agree that hierarchy has historically been a big part of Catholicism, but I do think that the power these individuals hold comes down to a matter of perspective. Popes and Bishops are hugely influential within the institution, but they don't get to control the culture--that's controlled by the traits and behaviors of Catholic people, and is in my opinion a valid reading of what it means to be Catholic.   i knew very little about it when i first saw it, but the cinematography blew me right the fuck away.   Words do have meanings, and Catholics get to decide what Catholic means. I'm of the opinion that if you're raised in the Catholic world, you get one vote. The pope gets one, a priest gets one, and this woman gets one as much as anybody. I understand the temptation to externally define a rigid Catholicism; it makes for a compelling good and evil narrative. For many catholics, however, the label is as much a matter of identity and culture as belief.  Some people raised in the church want nothing to do with this label: they see Catholicism as an oppressive, outdated institution and they part ways decisively--it is for them inconceivable that one could don the Catholic title, as that would amount to an implicit endorsement of the Church's entire sordid history. I have nothing but respect for that line of thought and mode of action, but I have just as much respect for those who stay in the hope of making their institution better. Some people are born into the Catholic world, and through family, friends and culture, are indelibly a part of that community whether they agree with the party line or not.  If someone wants to maintain her Catholic heritage and title while fostering a more liberal morality and outlook, I say that's one legitimate vote for a less dogmatic Catholicism, and one small step toward a more rational and empathetic world, faith or not. If this disrupts a "good atheism vs. dogmatic Catholocism" debate, then good. Any atheism that only argues against strict dogma will have very little application in the real world; any non-traditional believer who begs a real-world argument can only elevate the dialog.   face the gymnists, book a hitman, pump up the volume   holy shit.   social sciences fiction?   I didn't vote--seize the day, brother!   "Most highly educated and professionals in America are white" White people have more access to higher education, yes. There is a higher percentage of white people employed in stable middle class jobs, who are thus that much more suited to give middle class advantages to their children, yes. And as America perpetuates class divisions by continually affording more opportunities to those born and connected in privileged positions, this will continue to benefit whites and exclude blacks, yes. Thing is a) I don't exactly blame black people for this and b) this is far more an issue of class than race.  "Someone broke into your house?" Yes, actually, someone really literally did--i live in a kind of shitty neighborhood. And it was a trashy white guy I knew as a kid, who ended up selling my laptop for drug money. But as a sane and rational individual, I don't assume that this is characteristic of white people. Again, this is far more an issue of class than race. Have you ever met a middle class black man who owns a gun and smokes crack? I haven't, but I know a fair number of lower class white guys who fit that description far better.  "Chicken or the egg, my friend, the chicken or the egg." Well, except that there's an abundance of evidence for severe and violent American racism as the inciting factor here. Your accepted wisdom that blacks commit more crimes is rooted in that, which leads well-meaning but ignorant police to enforce the law on black people disproportionately until disenfranchised lower class black people no longer see white American law as a benefit to the community. We can see this in effect especially when we look at racial sentencing discrepancies and the shameful unreliability of cross-racial eyewitness testimony. I'm sure we don't disagree that racism happened in this country, and it was pretty severe--where we disagree apparently is that you think it's done and the onus is on blacks now, while I think the legacy of racism is shaping law enforcement behavior and cultural acceptance of stereotypes to this day--evidenced, quite frankly, in the fact that you take blackness as a given indicator of criminal intent. And I'm sorry, Fatties, but if that's not racism, what is? I don't like these realities, but my method of affecting change is not strictly instructing black people to be better, it's to address a larger system that leaves a certain class--and by correlation, certain races--with limited options.    well we're entirely on the same page there. good talk.   i didn't mean to ignore it, and i think your assumption is probably justified: when people talk about disliking black people, it's reasonable to assume they're working with the same negative stereotypes you associate with the word "nigger." my only point was that the girlfriend's prejudice and the use of the word "nigger" are both based in the same ugly stereotypes, and that the connection is symptomatic of how we're conditioned to associate these things racially--and i do think that in keeping the label "nigger," we to some extent perpetuate that conception of racial stereotypes.  i hope i've not been inappropriately confrontational, by the way; i do understand that you're fundamentally arguing for evaluating people on their individual merits. your original post invited logical debate, and i'm glad you were up for it.  *edited promptly for spelling and grammar   right. but the fact that she said black people and you said nigger means that you made a connection. and of course you did: when we think of racism against black people, the word "nigger" is a big part of that history. but it's pretty disingenuous to pretend that word exists outside of its racist connotations and history, frmlol. i recognize your good intentions, but relegating fear of black to people to fear of "niggers" is not productive in breaking down harmful stereotypes; the fact that the stereotypes of "nigger" sprang to mind even though the word was never used is a testament to the strength of that detrimentally race-specific connection.  it's not that i "can't comrehend" the nature of language--and that's a bit of a condescending conjecture, darling--it's that communication is rooted in reception as much as intention. the word "nigger" has a history, frmlol, and whether one intends it or not, the word's reception is necessarily colored by specific racial subjugation and violence.  And if a white guy ran into grand central station yelling "nigger," the word would carry its history of race-specific violence even there. And whatever the guy was trying to express--probably craziness, as you say--he would be invoking a nasty set of stereotypes tied to a brutal and painful history. There might be some people who freak out like the straw man described above, but for my part, i'd just quietly think it was unwarranted and kind of trashy. And that's what I think pretty much every time I see or hear the word, frmlol.  *edited to include middle paragraph, i don't think your full post was available when i started the reply.   "I don't associate nigger, a negative term, with black people." I think that's where I and many others have trouble with this line of reasoning, frmlol. This poster's girlfriend did not say she fears "niggers," a word which has been continuously invoked in the comments here. She merely said she's afraid of black people. The fact that you're comfortable assuming she means "niggers"--your word, not hers--proves the association.  Ultimately, that's why these detrimental stereotypes continue to exist: because people make these racial associations whether they're conscious of it or not.   "it is normal for Whites" what, niceness? you think most white people are nice? and everyone who's ever done something mean to you, those were all non-white people? you've never been mistreated by a white person? or, perhaps, maybe you're only race-conscious when non-whites are involved...  "however, the stereotypes usually aren't inaccurate and actually reflect reality." people are more diverse within divisions than across them, fatties.  "Blacks commit more total crimes and proportionally more crimes than Whites, therefore people are more often to be afraid of Blacks than Whites." Another fun reading of this is that black people get arrested more than whites, thus fostering a healthy, logical distrust of historically racist law enforcement and perpetuating a cycle that racist white people must ultimately answer for.   the word for that "attitude" is loaded with a history of racial subjugation, torture and murder. it is derived from the latin "niger" and spanish "negro," both of which literally mean "black." while i don't doubt your good intentions, use of the word "nigger" in this culture is inherently race-specific and only furthers the stereotypes this poster is trying to combat.   dtmfa.   perhaps quite insignificant in terms of the nation's spending, while extremely significant to NPR's continuation? Obviously?   bit on the nose, eh?   I do think that the original three Star Wars movies have pretty significantly different creative teams, which result in pretty different tone and style throughout.

 Okay, I've never really used Reddit before, but I saw this subreddit where people upload unusually creepy stories for help/advice. And that's just what I need right now. I guess I should start off with some background information, so my situation can be remedied most effectively. My name is Summer, and for the purpose of slight anonymity Ill leave it at that. I just turned eighteen, and I moved to a small city in Utah a couple of weeks ago to start attending summer classes at a local college. Before I go any further, you should know that up until now, I lived in Florida. I lived there my entire life, so moving out to such a new place entirely was difficult. I dont know very many people here. Sorry about the tangent, I just wanted to give enough information to make the rest of my story make more sense.  Okay, so like I said, I moved here a couple of weeks ago. My Mom and I drove all the way from Florida to get here, and we were on the road for a little over a week. She helped me set up all the stuff in my dorm and stayed a couple of days before heading back out. It was definitely emotional, being an only child my Mom and I have always been incredibly close. After she left I had a couple of days to get acquainted with the campus. I met four other girls staying in my dorm who are all super nice. The way our dorm is set up is similar to an apartment- Theres one big room that we all share that has a kitchen and living room, and then this long hallway that branches off to three other rooms- Two double and one single. I was lucky enough to land a single dorm room, and being a bit of an introvert this has proven to be very beneficial. I can go to bed and wake up whenever I like, and not worry about sharing a small space with someone else. After that, classes started right up. Being summer semester, there werent as many people in the classes, which was nice. Most of my courses only had five to ten other students, so I really got to know my professors. I made a couple of friends, if you could call them that, and things were going fine. Up until a few days ago.   So the way summer classes work at my college is kind of weird. Most of the general ed courses, like the ones Im taking, started during mid-June. Others that deal with majors, however, started in July. So at the beginning of last week, I started seeing some new people file in. No one especially notable. Anyway. A few days ago, I head to my Biology class as usual, and see a few new people that had recently joined for major programs. As soon as I walk in, a new boy comes running over and gives me this massive bear hug. And as hes hugging me, he says, Oh my God, Sunny! How have you been? Now, this was odd for a number of reasons. First of all, I had never seen this guy before in my life. Hes this tall, sandy-blonde haired fellow with trim muscles and a killer smile. A good-looking guy, someone I wouldnt easily forget. Second of all, as stated earlier, my name is Summer, not Sunny. Now, Im sure a lot of you are thinking what I originally thought- Maybe he saw me and thought I was someone else. But what was eerily disturbing about the scenario is that my father used to call me Sunny. He called me Summer Sunshine, and told me that my Sunny smile always brightened his day. It was sweet, a nickname I had always cherished. But my father passed away in an unresolved accident when I was nine, and now just hearing the name Sunny sends shivers up my spine. So, Im sure you can imagine my surprise when this stranger runs up to hug me calling me a name I hadnt heard in nearly a decade. As soon as he breaks loose, I say something along the lines of, Hey, um, my name is actually Summer. I dont know a Sunny. You may have me confused with someone else. He stares at me intently, scanning my features, and then says, Haha, very funny, Sunny. Hey, weve all missed you since the trip! You should totally come to the next one, if youre free. It was a total blast last time! He turns to walk to a desk, and I stand there, completely dumbfounded.   After the class ends, I rush out to avoid any confrontation with that weird guy. And then, things get weirder. As I walk down the halls towards my dorm room, all these people I have never seen before start waving at me and saying things as they walk by. A redheaded girl Ive never seen says Hey, Sunny! Great to see you! as she opens a classroom door. A couple of jock guys said something along the lines of,  Sunny, remember- Dont touch the poison oak! and burst out in laughter as they turn a corner. Each time it happened, I got more and more unsettled. By the time I finally got back to my dorm, I was on the verge of a major freakout. I rushed into my friends room- Lets call her Abigail- And told her everything that happened. I asked if she was certain that she hadnt seen anyone that looked even remotely similar to me. She assured me she hadnt, but recommended we search for girls named Sunny on campus. So we pulled up the school directory. Nothing comes up for Sunny. We search Sunshine, Allison, Allie, or anything that could be related to Sunny. Still, nothing. Abigail suggested that we look through the school ID page on the online database to find photos of girls who may look like me. Nothing. No one even closely resembled me. By the time we had looked at every photo in the database, she was beginning to feel my frustration. We figured our search irrelevant and called it a day.   Then, this morning. I wake up, and to my surprise, theres a new iMessage on my phone from an unsaved number. Here is the exact message, copied and pasted from my messenger. Good morning, Sunny. Its Ez. Wow. I cant even begin to explain how AMAZING last night was. Youre just Wow. Im honestly speechless. I cant wait to see you again. Um, text me when you get up? Cant wait to hear from you. I hope you can understand how much this freaked me out. So many things were running through my head, and all I could think is I need to tell someone. So I leave my dorm to find Abigail, and shes sitting at the kitchen table on her laptop, and she says Hey Summer, I didnt know you went on the Anthropology majors camping trip! I kind of stood there, confused for a minute. She flips her screen around, and sure enough, a girl who looks EXACTLY like me is sitting on a log surrounded by other students in a forest, grinning ear to ear. Shes wearing this weird tank top with a batik print and holding a journal. I tried my best to stay calm and explain to her that I had never seen that photo before and had never even been camping. She looked confused and pointed to the caption at the bottom, where the students names are all posted. Sure enough, in between ELIZA HENSON and MCALL PARK is SUMMER, followed by my last name. I couldnt believe it. I walked back into my dorm, and as I went to lay back down in bed, I noticed a picture frame on my bedside table that wasnt there before. And I swear to God, its the same photo Abigail had just shown me. Thirteen college students sitting on logs in the forest, smiling, wearing outdoorsy outfits. The only difference in this photo is that the girl smiling ear to ear and holding the journal has no face. Its scribbled out harshly in thick Sharpie.  Guys, Im freaking out. I have no clue who this girl is. According to the college, she doesnt exist. And yet, there are photos of her, and people know her, but she doesnt exist. I think she may be stalking me, and Im terrified. I dont know how she got that photograph into my dorm room, and it freaks me out to think why she would have scribbled out my face. And how "Ez" got my phone number? I have no idea what to do. I have all these thoughts running through my head and I need to get a hold of things. This is all so unfamiliar and I just want to go back home. PLEASE HELP  	1
 [My true story with a Ouija board](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/2ssvwt/i_outsmarted_a_ghost_in_tombstone_az_with_my_army/)   This is how shit gets Streisand Effected into being a rare item worth thousands.  NIB original Gundam Deathscythe Hell" NOT Burning.   SUPER rare $3999 OBO   Also, the car must be brand new.   Looks like slaughter died well after 1867 though. Maybe slaughter killed whoever I was talking to. Or just owned it like  you said    Dude you just blew my mind, none of the guys I was with would have known about him, and if they were playing a joke they wouldn't have thought to go that in depth. holy shit   Nope, it was a one time story a few years ago. I have some other experiences that happened to me but they weren't as exciting as this.   You messed with some dark forces there friend, with no protection.  Would like to buy one Ouija condom please.     Not sure how you "outsmarted" this ghost or whatever  I'm alive aren't I?    Steven is not my real name. I changed it to remain anonymous.   Jackson is Puerto Rican   It could also be flat out lying,  or made a spectral typo? I've heard many stories of Ouija boards lying or getting caught in lies.    Most were :)  We did have our share of idiots though. They were usually part of the holdover platoons and in the process of being kicked out.    I'm reserves not stationed anywhere.   They have, but there's been no consistent evidence worthy of scientific investigation.  Unfortunately ghosts fall into the realm of religion when it comes to science, so they won't even entertain investigating it.  The other issue is that every study done on the ouija board was in a laboratory setting. Of course it isn't going to work. I'd love to see them lug their lab equipment to a haunted location and measure all the readings there the way ghost hunters do.  It probably is our subconscious controlling the ouija board through the ideomotor effect, but that's not to say the spirits aren't using us as a medium to move it.   Yea I had heard that, but to be honest, if spirits are real, I don't believe in the whole superstitious part of it. They have laws of physics they have to obey just like we do, and rituals and incantations seem silly to me. There is nothing mystical about the board, it's just cardboard and plastic. It's simply something light and easy for them to manipulate to communicate (like my string on a paper example).  You can technically use anything as a ouija board, it just has to be something light weight and easy to move.  Divination is nothing more than dimensional morse code. Perhaps if God is real, then maybe the reason he vehemently warned us against contacting the spirit realm is for fear of us finding out that he is a neckbeard behind a computer, and the "demons" we communicate with are actually rival gamers in a universe MMO?   I don't think it would give it life, if it killed me it would just be out of vengence. Then I suppose I'd be bound wherever it was at, and I'd eternally fight with it in that parking lot. Come to think of it, maybe the first spirit was friendly and was trying to warn us about the second one. Maybe the first spirit was killed for divinating back in the 1800s, who knows.   Honestly though, I think it just wanted to freak me out. For all I know, it was fully within its power to kill me but didn't, and made me go through that entire ordeal just to be a dick.     MOS is your job in the military.  ASVAB is the test you take to get in. Most people at Huachuca scored 80+. These are percentile scores, so if you scored an 80 then you scored higher than 80% of those taking the test. I scored a 90 and most of those in my specific class were 85-95.  I think the minimum score is like 31 which basically makes you eligible for cook or infantry.   Thomson actually scored like a 60 or something and we have no idea how he got into our MOS. He ended up failing out and did not complete the course.    You are correct "Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury are buried in Boot Hill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona. The McLaury brothers were buried side-by-side in the same grave, and Billy Clanton was buried next to them, in a different grave."  I never really knew the story, just that the area was famous for the gunfight.     Wyatt Earp  Appears to be a lawman. I don't know much about their history, other than that the shootout was very close to our location.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Earp   I hadn't seen it on streetview before tonight while trying to patch my memory together.  My heart jumped a little when I found it.  It's really eerie to think about those mountains back there, and how Wyatt Earp and his crew stared at that very same landscape.   I wanted to start out by saying this story is 100% true. I posted it in /r/nosleep as I didn't nowhere else to post it, but I promise that all the events in here (their cause is up for debate) actually happened.  I will answer any questions you guys have, but will note a few things:  -Names have been changed.  -I don't have contact with any of these people anymore, this was in 2010 and I am the only one left in the Army now, and am a Reservist 2000 miles from where this happened.  -I will answer any questions you guys have so as long as it does not expose the identity of me or the people in the story.  Now for the story:  Do I believe everything that happened actually happened? Not necessarily, Im as skeptical as you will be, and I welcome any explanation as to how the events that occurred were not supernatural. It could have been an elaborate prank on behalf of my friends, but there are several reasons why I find that hard to believe. Mass hysteria maybe? Who knows, anyway here is the story:  I enlisted in the Army in 2009, and had my AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in Fort Huachuca, AZ.   Pretty much any soldier stationed at Fort Huachuca (often nicknamed Fort We-Gotcha) has above average intelligence. Most of the MOSes require a very high ASVAB score. Needless to say, the friends I made were a unique bunch, many of us gaming nerds.   Huachuca is about 20 minutes from the Mexican border and about 40 minutes from the infamous Tombstone, AZ.   One day we were bored and swapping ghost stories. One of my buddies bought a Ouija board at Walmart for us to play around with. Well call him Jackson to protect his identity. Im not sure Jackson believed in the supernatural, but when your disposable income to free time ratio is skewed horribly in the wrong direction, you buy stupid shit to entertain yourself with.  Jackson and I attempted to use the Ouija board in our barracks as the base is extremely old and rife with hauntings. Unfortunately, the barracks we had recently moved to were brand new, so the Ouija didnt work.  Tired of strip clubs and flirting with the Mexican border, we hungered for a unique adventure. I brought up the idea of travelling to nearby Tombstone. Jackson lit up when I mentioned this as he had just heard a story of a haunted house in Tombstone he wanted to check out. We came to a quick, ghost-hunting consensus and invited our buddy Thomson along for the ride.  We arrived at tombstone shortly after dark. It was not quite how I expected it. I had pictured a literal ghost town, with a few dilapidated Wild West buildings and the obligatory tumbleweed blowing through the street.  This was not the case at all. Even at night its basically a normal town with a few historical buildings and tourist traps. In addition to the downtown stretch, they have a residential area just like any other small town in America. It was in this residential area that we began hunting for the supposed haunted house. We got to the area we thought it was in, but werent sure which house it was. After a few minutes of circling the block, the group decided to take a break to piss.  Everyone went a separate direction to pee, but I could not find a place private enough so I didnt go. I was the second person back in the car. I climbed into the backseat and asked Jackson Wheres Thomson?   I dont know, hes been gone for a while, Ill text him said Jackson.  All of a sudden, Thomson (looking whiter than he normally does) comes sprinting towards the car, and frantically tries to open the passenger door. Jackson calmly unlocks the door, and lets him in and asks  What happened?  Dude, youre not going to believe this shit Thomson gasped.  His southern drawl tightened like a cello string,  I was in this house that looked abandoned right, so I go in and look around, and decide to have a smoke. I look down at my phone to text you guys and tell you about it when all of a sudden something touched my shoulder!  Holy shit, what was it? I asked.  Nothing, there was nothing there. I sprinted back to the car  Pumped with adrenaline, curiosity and stupidity, I suggested we go full Mystery Machine and park in a nearby lot and use the Ouija board from inside the car.  As soon as we could get parked (roughly half a block away) we anxiously pulled out the Ouija board and put it in our laps.  As the person designated to ask questions, I began:  Is there anyone there?  To my disbelief, the planchette starting moving. It slowly but surely moved towards YES.  Were you the thing that touched Thomson?  YES it replied again.  Are you the ghost in the haunted house we were going to visit?  NO it answered.  Now this is what took me by surprise. If this was one of the others trying to scare us, why wouldnt they take the obvious bait? Claim to be the ghost we saw and commence scaring the shit out of us. I mean, thats like a Nigerian scammer writing you about your long lost fortune, and then responding no when you ask if hes able to give you $6 million instead of $5.5 million.  At this point, I had a flashback of just about every creepy Ouija experience I had ever seen or read about. They always started with some clich questions like lol how did u die and ended with OMFG and a flurry of telekinetic activity. I wanted this session to be different. After all, we were a handpicked bunch of intelligent people, not a group of scared teenagers. If this was real, I wanted this specter to break history with me.  So I took a moment and started thinking, what would I want to know about a ghost? What questions can I ask that arent clich? What can I ask that will break the linear decision tree where all Ouija boards end up telling you they want you dead?  I realized any questions I asked had to be extremely specific, and offer no chance for creepy deviation in the answer. I suppose I could ask it for the coefficient of Pi, and it could just respond with die bitch over and over, but I had faith in the ghost.  So the first question I asked was:  Name one thing the building you touched Thomson in was used for.  The planchette slowly started to move again. HA! I thought to myself, this thing cant possibly get creepy from this question. I bet it will say like General Store, or Post Office, or  S L A U G H T E R  Pucker factor 9. Good game ghost, have an upvote I guess.   But seriously, I again realized this was probably not one of us joking around because slaughter has not been used as a common term since the 1800s. You dont log on to CNN and see Man slaughtered today in small house in Arizona, details at 11. If my friends were pulling a prank, the easiest verb would have been something like Murder or Buttsex.  Intrigued, I decided to ask it why it touched Thomson.  H E L P it replied.  Thinking this would lead somewhere creepy, I asked when it died instead.  1 8 6 7   I again started thinking of questions I could ask that no one ever thinks to ask a ghost. I remember hearing on some website that you are NEVER supposed to ask a Ouija board about God. So I did the only logical thing an Atheist would do at that point:  Why arent I supposed to ask you about God?  NO came a quick, terse reply.  So I tried to be more creative, I asked it:  If you were playing World of Warcraft, what class would you play?  Its gonna say Undead Warlock, I guarantee i.  NO it snapped again.   It was weird, despite being an entity that couldnt directly talk to us, you could almost sense its tone of voice through how it moved the planchette.  I wanted to continue asking it questions, but our First Sergeant interrupted the session with a frantic phone call. He ordered all of us back to base for 100% accountability due to someone losing their weapon. Disappointed, we packed up and headed back.   The next day we were telling the others in our platoon about our experience the night before. After many bullshit and eyerolls, another soldier named Green showed interest. We decided to try to talk to the ghost again and take Green with us. He had an SUV which would give us more room to set up the board.  As a soldier, my first instinct was not only to plan our arrival and departure time, but safety contingencies as well. This was especially on my mind after the previous night. I briefed the group in advance that if anything creepy happened, we were better off with a pre-identified plan on what to do so as to take the spirits by surprise. Our ghost hunting SOP was as follows:  At approximately 2000 hours we will depart for Tombstone. This will allow us to arrive after dark. We will take two vehicles: Greens SUV and Jacksons coupe. Jackson and Thomson will ride in the coupe, while Green and I will ride in the SUV.   *We will set up our session in the SUV so as to allow for a quick departure if anything spooky happens.  *We will leave any weapons or sharp objects back at the base. Spirits can only harm others by proxy. If there are no objects around to throw (or possess someone into using), then the only physical danger will be soiling our underwear.  *In the event of one of us feeling creeped out beyond belief, or an impending sense of doom, we will give an obvious signal to the others to quickly pack up and leave. Each soldier will return to the vehicle they traveled in and take off back to the Base. Upon leaving the scene, the vehicles will immediately establish contact via cell phone to ensure safety and share in a moment of Holy shit what the fuck just happened.  So it was settled. We had our plan and were feeling confident. The undead were no match for Arizonas finest soldiers.  We parked in the same lot we had the night before and eagerly took out our Ouija board. There were four of us now and we were feeling confident, but I wont lie if I told you that I was jittery as fuck. Literally everything I knew about life and the universe at this point was challenged by what we had seen the previous night. I felt like the equivalent of someone who discovers a six inch tall genie in their closet that only they can talk to. It literally felt surreal, like a movie.  Green was especially nervous about being with us as he was raised Catholic. Though he was no longer religious, he still had that strongly ingrained fear of Ouija boards. Green opted to just spectate as we placed the planchette on the board. There were three of us controlling it.  We started by asking if anyone was there, and received a very slow, strained YES  I asked if it was the same being we talked to the previous night, and it said NO  Going off the same theme as last night, I wanted to mindfuck the ghost. I did not want to give it the opportunity to be creepy, and I wanted it to answer questions no one would think to ask.  I wanted to expose the ghosts vulnerabilities. As of now, the ghost was this mysterious all powerful being. However, as any logical person knows, the paranormal is just science not yet discovered.   The ghost MUST have limits I thought. It isnt God and therefore has things it cannot do, things it cannot have. So I had the bright idea to ask:  What is one thing you want that you cannot have?  L I F E it answered.  I wasnt sure whether to feel like an ass, idiot or both.   Before I could decide between shame and stupidity, the interior light in Greens (brand new) SUV flickered.  Holy. Fucking. Shit. That doesnt just happen. The only time Ive ever seen a light flicker in a car was when it was being started. This was getting a little too real. This spirit was alpha, and it was asserting its ethereal dominance.  After regaining my composure I began to brainstorm more questions.    Youve been askin it all the questions, let me give it a try Thomson contested me.  Fine, go ahead I said.  What do you want from us? he asked, in his defiant Georgia accent.  S T E V  Dude theres no fucking way.. I thought to myself   My name is Steven and all, but there is no  E N  At this point I was terrified. No one there knew my first name but Thomson. Also, the planchette was moving in a puppeted fashion, *away* from Thomson when it spelled it out. The best way I could describe it was an invisible thread, straight from the front of the car pulling the planchette, based on how it twisted and turned. There was no one in the front of the car.  Before I could even react, the center console which was about five inches ajar, closed by itself. I calmly invoked our military plan of action:  Ok guys, it just spelled out my first name. Lets get the fuck out of here  No one said a word or hesitated for a second. Thomson and Jackson scrambled out of the SUV and into Jacksons Eclipse. Green and I piled into the front seat of the SUV. Green immediately shifted to drive and peeled out of the dusty lot. Im not sure a Ford Escape has ever been used in such a literal fashion.  Green was in shock and so was I. My Atheist brain was questioning if God might actually be real and Greens devout brain was pondering the opposite. Our trance was broken by Greens Alt-Rock ringtone. It was surreal hearing pop culture in that moment, when our brains were so far removed from reality.  Green answered the phone. It was Jackson and Thomson. Their car wouldnt start! They had never left Tombstone!  Green slams on the breaks and bangs a U turn that would put Vin Diesel in diapers. He floors the modest SUV. We were going about 100 MPH, heading down Arizona 82 back towards Tombstone.  Dude slow the fuck down I yelled.   At this point I was far more afraid of Greens driving than the spirits.  THEYRE OUR FUCKING FRIENDS, WE CANT LEAVE THEM THERE  We knew the general direction back to Tombstone and arrived rather quickly. Tombstone isnt as tiny as youd imagine, and we couldnt quite remember where we had parked at. As I am trying to figure out where we are, Green freaks the fuck out.  OH MY GOD  What dude?  I CANTIM NOT DRIVIN THE CAR ANYMORE  What the fuck are you talking about?  I CANT MOVE  As if it couldnt get any more frightening, I realized in the middle of Greens outburst that we had inadvertently ended up at the parking lot we left!  Im always trying to think logically, so I deduced the following.  At this point, two things are possible:  1. Green is possessed by a butthurt ghost who basically told me to check my living privilege. 2. Green is experiencing a psychotic breakdown.  Either one of those is a threat to our safety at this point, so I just started shouting at him with simple commands. If he was possessed or simply psychotic, simple instructions were the best course of action.  GREEN STOP THE CAR  GREEN STOP THE CAR  GREEN STOP THE CAR  I ordered in a commanding voice.  Eventually, logic and reason fought off whatever had possessed him and he pulled over. I switched seats with him and began driving. Right after I took over driving, Jackson called and let us know they were safe, and about 10 miles down the road towards base.      Green was still in a trance, but once we got about a quarter mile from ground zero, whatever triggered him without warning originally had left. This leads me to believe that if ghosts are real, they have the effective possession range of a quarter mile.   Throughout the ride, we struggled to comprehend what had happened that night. Green told me that he could tell the ghost wanted me, and that it was telling him to drive down an alley, but that he came to his senses in time. He said it wanted me bad, and it wanted him to kill me. It probably would have had him attack me before we left, but our pre-meditated escape took it by surprise, so it stalled Jackson's car to lure us back.  I asked him why it didnt just kill me itself, and he told me Probably because Im bigger than you and more emotional. You think very logically, youre a lot harder for a spirit to manipulate. Plus I was in control of the car. This made sense, and was pretty chilling to think about. If the spirit had succeeded, it would have simply hit the news as Soldier murders other soldier in Tombstone. PTSD suspected. I imagine thats the case when you hear about mothers spontaneously drowning their children in a bathtub, or other inexplicable murder suicides. Its probably a ghost or spirit, but gets blamed on psychosis.  About halfway back to base we stopped at a gas station. Green, still not *completely* in his right mind, opened the hatch of his SUV, took out a sunshade that came with his car and threw it in the dumpster.   What did you do that for?  I dont know, it just felt evil. Really evil he answered.  That was the final straw on how real this was. It really drove in how much this was probably not an elaborate prank. Why would he go to the extent of throwing away an expensive OEM part of his car to freak me out when I was already emotionally exhausted?  To this day I am still an Atheist, but I do wonder about the paranormal, as it could very well be science not yet discovered. I would imagine that communicating with a spirit is the equivalent of trying to talk to an invisible man in the room, who cannot touch anything. His only way of communicating is holding a portable fan, and blowing paper suspended by a string from the ceiling. He blows it right for yes and left for no. I imagine this is why they communicate in such slow and brief answers.  I did a little more research on the location and posted a map and pictures for you guys below.  Ironically, we were in the parking lot for the OK Corral, the famous haunted location where the outlaws had their shootout in the 1800s. From what I can gather, the gunfight happened well after 1867, but keep in mind we talked to two separate spirits. I cant help but wonder if the second one was one of them.  Map showing key points of interest: http://imgur.com/twnP7r2  Streetview of the parking lot we were in: http://imgur.com/L2guyXG  Also, I have heard of the ideomotor effect, so if you would like to help me come up with logical explanations for what happened, keep in mind I am aware of that and it does not explain the light flickering and the console moving. I am also aware of Occams razor, and would welcome a shave at this point as I think it would save my sanity.   So please Reddit, convince me Im crazy.                This was years ago, I'm actually the only one in the group still in the Army and I live in the Midwest now. If I get sent back there for duty (quite possible based on my niche MOS) I will check it out again.   I wanted to start out by saying this story is 100% true. I know people will say that to add immersion, but it really is, and this is the only place I knew where to post it at.  Do I believe everything that happened actually happened? Not necessarily, Im as skeptical as you will be, and I welcome any explanation as to how the events that occurred were not supernatural. It could have been an elaborate prank on behalf of my friends, but there are several reasons why I find that hard to believe. Mass hysteria maybe? Who knows, anyway here is the story:  I enlisted in the Army in 2009, and had my AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in Fort Huachuca, AZ.   Pretty much any soldier stationed at Fort Huachuca (often nicknamed Fort We-Gotcha) has above average intelligence. Most of the MOSes require a very high ASVAB score. Needless to say, the friends I made were a unique bunch, many of us gaming nerds.   Huachuca is about 20 minutes from the Mexican border and about 40 minutes from the infamous Tombstone, AZ.   One day we were bored and swapping ghost stories. One of my buddies bought a Ouija board at Walmart for us to play around with. Well call him Jackson to protect his identity. Im not sure Jackson believed in the supernatural, but when your disposable income to free time ratio is skewed horribly in the wrong direction, you buy stupid shit to entertain yourself with.  Jackson and I attempted to use the Ouija board in our barracks as the base is extremely old and rife with hauntings. Unfortunately, the barracks we had recently moved to were brand new, so the Ouija didnt work.  Tired of strip clubs and flirting with the Mexican border, we hungered for a unique adventure. I brought up the idea of travelling to nearby Tombstone. Jackson lit up when I mentioned this as he had just heard a story of a haunted house in Tombstone he wanted to check out. We came to a quick, ghost-hunting consensus and invited our buddy Thomson along for the ride.  We arrived at tombstone shortly after dark. It was not quite how I expected it. I had pictured a literal ghost town, with a few dilapidated Wild West buildings and the obligatory tumbleweed blowing through the street.  This was not the case at all. Even at night its basically a normal town with a few historical buildings and tourist traps. In addition to the downtown stretch, they have a residential area just like any other small town in America. It was in this residential area that we began hunting for the supposed haunted house.

 YOU FUCKED MY CAT TOOOO!?!?!?  dude, I'd get checked if I were you, that cat is a fucking whore   I've only known one person IRL who likes it, which is my brother.  I'm not gonna take the time to describe my brother in great detail, but he is the second dumbest person I know. He's also the furthest thing from a 'nerd'   Hey, I remember that, I was there too!   dude, I don't even know... I'm gonna go watch TV   How about DigiDesign?   I'd eat the butter whole and then when he eats ME, i'll kill him slowly with high cholesterol!    Other than it not being funny, most people who are smart enough to use the internet don't like the show, so there's *that*   I would give myself omnipotence. I'm getting sick and tired by my lack of omnipotence   meh.  It's ok   Cumming   Probably not the day I was born   Because they like it rough ;)   I'd tell you, but I don't wanna be an associate to a violent murder and/or kidnapping   My nervous system   What are your strengths?   I'd probably be a politician   Which n word?  narwhal?  neverland?  *nostril?*   Plain and simple: They wanted enough time to pass before mentioning Jon (Arin's post explaining WHY they didn't mention him was not a lie, despite Jon disagreeing with it)  They didn't want people flipping their shit over Jontron mentions or fighting over wanting the show to be what it was and not what it is. They wanted the show to move forward and not live in the past. Meanwhile, plenty of people, Jon and Nicole included, loved to troll you guys HARD on this sub  Finally enough time had passed when they felt like nobody would flip out over breaking the vow of silence. Dan had been there way longer and they reached a point where one of his serials was the longest running one. A perfect time to drop the silence. And NOBODY flipped out over it except for Conspiracy Grumps (it kind of killed it, TBH) Sure, plenty of people were shocked, happy, and glad to see it, but they didn't have a nerdgasm.  I don't think it was ever a breakup thing or a lost friendship. I think one guy just simply moved too far away to be involved. When your partner abandons you, you don't focus on the past, you focus on the present and doing your best to make a good product, which they did. Part of that required not mentioning Jon so that people didn't grow to loathe Dan or even Arin because it wasn't the way it started (And this sub particularly grew to loathe Arin) And they made the right choice because the show got exponentially better when Dan joined   History will remember them together   Man walks to the store to buy beer! Does this support Terrorism? Find out at 11:00   2 Girls 1 Cup  I mean, I just admire the *resilience*   I can't even read, so why would I care?   same as mine    So this guy is doing anal on this girl while she's blowing a black guy and a midget. She keeps begging for double penetration, but the guy is hogging that asshole so much they can't even get a dick in edgewise   I would buy more money   OH, you fucking name it!  r/funny   r/gaming  r/AskReddit (oh, wait!)   THIS one: http://www.dpsgproductfacts.com/product_images/brand_logos/HAWAIIAN_PUNCH.png?v=1338927337  Shit is gross!   A used condom could've helped a woman conceive.  And that's how Jesus was born  :)   politics and religion   try selling it for a buck a mile. I'm sure there's an idiot out there who'll fall for it   Don't change the subject here.... did you touch yourself?   It's not about what THEY want... it's a matter of us showing our dominance and degrading them. Kinda like dogs marking their territory.  Only we give them baby gravy instead of peeing on them (though there are some folks who are into that as well)   why not BOTH?   ;)   I make comedic films, CG animations, VFX shorts, and even a few songs coming up.  All of that primarily parodies video games, like my first song here;  [A Gamer's Love Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DMDO2wVezQ)   it's very easy to make Jacques's voice  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keJf7iYHPtg feature=youtu.be   "How big is your dick?"   Because, um.... you know.... reasons and such....   care to provide an example, as OP asked?   Arin cheated on him with Dan, so Jon ran away to NYC to become a model... I think he became quite successful:  http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/920/296/0cd.png   He does, but a lot of it might be fueled by the shitty part of this fanbase.  He's definitely the funniest though, hands down   All of them   I was right though. I doubted it was an alternate title   This one time my brother's digestive system wasn't working right and he shat out undigested spaghetti and sauce. I know this sounds fake but it's completely real. We were camping, he took a dump in the woods, then called us over to show it to us (it had little bits of digested fecal matter, but mostly looked like a dropped plate of pasta) My dad took him to the doctor the next day, I don't remember anything past that and it never happened again.   While they kinda feel like the same game at times, Majora's Mask for me. But only barely, primarily due to the creepiness of it and I never played it as much as I played OoT when I was a kid, yet I still remember it being more fun.  But OoT is a better icon in video-gaming and is the best representation of a perfect Zelda game   Not at all. Just a mediocre video made by Rocketjump.   funny stuff, man!   Fire. Literally fire everywhere, as far as the eye can see.  At least that's what FoxNews tells me   I'm saying that there is no original you. There are all these universes happening at the same time, without the presence of the others. They don't pop in and out of existence, they merely change when things happen in them. Sometimes those things don't happen in the others and over time the two will not be similar at all.  Even in other, similar universes, the person that looks, acts, and thinks like you isn't you. He doesn't share your atoms, your conscience, or your universe. He is a different person entirely    anytime ;)    Financial stability, a Career in Comedy, a Fanbase, my family being fed, healthy and happy.   Making people laugh   Science.  Mine taught "these are science concepts, now let's learn about Creationism"   question not answered.    eh, they can't all be winners, can they? Oh well, into the pit, maybe your pleasurable moans will just make it worse for the others   like this:  ooxlxoo!   Well, what I mean isn't that the other universes are created when possibilities are presented, it's that those moments are where each universe starts to veer into its own, beginning with the most miniscule of differences. There wouldn't be an original 'you' just a different one.  A question I just thought of, though...  In an infinite universe, where mathematically speaking, anything that is possible or thinkable can and will eventually happen, then wouldn't THAT be in a way, predestination/fate?   That guy that did the thing. It mattered   and I'll make **this sound:**  ooxlxoo!!!!   I'm gonna finish to your post   Oracle of Ages/Oracle of Seasons   It always has its ups-and-downs  Like, you know, every show ever   I feel dirtier after seeing it   Saw this on my Facebook feed.... To be fair, I think this guy is a tremendous pothead.   Am I the only one who felt a little proud when a random orc killed me, became a captain, then eventually made it all the way up to War Chief?   All of this guy's success can be traced back to one incident when his oppenent was too busy eating a cookie to play two handed and got himself killed.            Posting this because my second daughter was born today and I immediately thought to myself "this is no time to make jokes.... save them for reddit :)                            God, what goes through someone's fucking mind when they see a video and decide to negatively comment on it without even watching it?  "I skipped around through it and the 45 seconds I watched were fucking terrible."   Translation: "Didn't watch - Still Criticized!"   Seriously, go fuck yourself if you're this type of person! People work hard on videos and your comment isn't wanted or needed!      I used to do stand-up but stopped doing it to pursue filmmaking/improvised comedy. Recently, some new opportunities have arisen that may require me to do some stand-up on the side. I wanna talk about subjects that actually interest me, and definitely subjects that haven't been done to death. I've written some jokes on Star Trek, a few on being married that send up the "married life cliches" in stand-up and sitcoms, and a few on death that lead into the concept of Hell. I'm most proud of the last ones because, not only do I think they are the funniest bits, but it's a very interesting subject that I don't think I've heard many comedians talk about. The only thing that comes to mind is George Carlin's "but he LOVES you" bit.  So, I'm wondering, what are some topics you, as an atheist, would love to hear some comedy about? You know, there's SO many things that comedians could touch on but they don't, I just want to know what the community itself wants.   edit: For reference; here are some examples of the Hell material: "... I mean, you never see a father trying to discipline his kid going "HEY! BILLY! Quit hitting your sister with the stick or I swear to Christ I will punch you in the fucking face! And I'm not JUST gonna punch you.... I'm gonna punch you...... FOREVER!!!  Also, "The belief in Hell clearly stems from these peoples' history of being abused as children as well as living in a society that recommends and accepts it. It implants warped views of justice in their minds and gives them a sense of an unavoidable cosmic malevolence.... trust me, I googled it..."                              My daughter is two years old and I've been thinking a lot about when the time comes when somebody in our family tries to push religion on her. It'll definitely happen and it'll likely start with something they'll see as "small and harmless" like the concept of heaven. I'm trying to prepare my way of explaining it to her when she asks me about it, tell me if this sounds good:  "Well, a lot of people believe that when we die, we go to a special place called Heaven. Grandma, Grandpa and a few people we know believe this, but they don't know for sure. NOBODY knows for sure if it's real or not or even what it's like. We DO know that when we die, some people have these very realistic dreams and sometimes people go to heaven in these dreams where they'll be happy. Sometimes they see old friends or family members who made them happy. Sometimes they go to their favorite place in the world that made them happy in life. I think this is why people want heaven to be real, they want to be happy. But it's far more important to be happy here and now, while you can. Dying is a natural part of life... we're given a short time on this earth to experience happiness, sadness, anger, delicious food, fun, responsibility, and to do or create something important that makes everyone else's lives better. As for what happens when that time is over... NOBODY knows, even if they tell you they do. NOONE knows because noone's ever lived to tell about it.

 Is there a certain image that when you see it you get pumped to get into shape?   So when he went down his dick was still out, does the cop have to pug it away for him?   I got the monster isport, I use them for everything. Gym time and street running. They are pricy at $150, but worth the $.    My buddy and I did this yesterday and went to hhe planetarium on acid! Fucking Amazing!   Not easy to watch on a 3GS IPhone but well worth it. Have a +1, don't spend it all in one place.   I had a grand maul seizure during sex. When I was 24 I had a long term girlfriend and was living at home. Well at one point my doctor and I decide to go off my meds to see if its still active. Well during that time of my med me and my GF are having sex and next thing I know I'm hanging off the bed and I've puked up my dinner. Turns out mid bone I went into a full blown seizure. My GF was aware of my condition but never expected this to happen. She was a champ though. The real awkward part was telling my parents how it went down. But hey now I have a cool story.   This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's the only book that has ever truly scared me. It's a must read .   Last dragon reference. Nice!   What came first the chicken or the egg?   I have been tinkering with mixing my own pre-workout cocktail. right now im going with  1.5 tsp creatine 1.5 tsp glutamine .5 tsp guarana extract (caffine) .5 tsp chyanne pepper extrcact 90,000 heat (fat burner) two scoops amino energy gonna switch to a cleaner amino blend once i run out of this product)  What do you folks recommend.        I feel like I had one of these in a classroom during high school but without all the biblical shit.   bad Lieutenant    Don't want to point out the obvious but folks may want to be careful what they say here. This is one of the few topics in the world where a joke can get you in serious trouble. Other than that I think it would be 9/11 all over again. It would temporarily bring the country together but would then any lessons we learned or justice tring to be served  would get used and abused by various parties and causes.   Who the hell is Emma stone and why should I car?   My life is going great. I'm sleeping next to this amazing girl I met last month. It's the first time that I've been this head over heels for someone I a long time. I'm in the best shape of my life. Mentally I'm in a place of self discovery and imrprovement where I just want to fill my life with as much love, knowledge and wisdom as possible. :) ain't life grand!   Obama wins, Romney cries!   That is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. I'm drunk mind you.   Porn was rare. It was something that you or a friend stole from your dad or a store and it would get passed around you friends like was a sacred text. I remember every once I a while while digging tennis balls out of a bush you would stumble upon a stash that some neighborhood kid had hidden. It was like finding gold. Now any dumb kid is only one click away from the most horrible porn ever created. There spoiled they should have to work for that shit!      In jr high I was a rollerblader    "Time" by Pink Floyd, it's my favorite song and its very fitting for the situation.   As a kid I would look at my dads porn, found out the guy likes chicks with dicks.   	23
 I just recently hit level 20, with around 14k ip saved up to buy tier 3 runes. Im planning to make two basic AD and AP rune pages, and then later specialize. ( I have 4 rune pages) My main problem is what quints should I get for the AD page? I hear things like 2 attack speed quints and 1 ad quint, all AD, all AS, 3 movement quints, lifesteal quints and many other things. What would be best?  My most played roles that use AD are in the order of Top, Jungle, then ADC.       No matter how good you are, you can't win them all. Sometimes you have teammates that are so braindead that it is impossible to win. Just remember though that the only common denominator is you. There must be something you could be doing better to help you win.   Bad luck streaks happen. I just had a 10 game losing streak, and now ive won 5 straight. Dont worry, It all balances out eventually.   Sunfire cape is great on champions that deal in extended trades or have a dps ability (like Shyvana or Mundo). For example, sunfire cape is almost always my second item on shyvana (after I build cutlass, and not if I'm against someone like ryze)   As a newer player, I did the same thing when I first started. However i'd advise to go to PVP as immediately as you can. I actually found it easier, as you're facing other new players who make mistakes too, and you learn so much more so much faster. It's also much more fun.   Akali. You can easily snowball out of control off of one kill, and no one ever buys pink wards to counter her either.   Akali is actually a good and fun champion to play top. If you can capitalize on a mistake early on, or the jungler successfully ganks top, you can easily snowball out of control. Top is easily the most snowbally lane, and Akali is one of the most snowbally champions. Combine them and it can get insane.   As a fellow noob, I find that playing a couple bot games with a new champion helps a ton. Sure, you may my be getting much competition from them, but it lets you get the basics of a champion down pat before you play against the actual skilled opponents.   I've been trying Akali out this week, and i absolutely love her. I am probably going to buy her and start using her a lot. The one major downside to her that i have heard is that she has plenty of troubles once you reach a higher elo. I was just wondering, around what division does her effectiveness fall because of things such as people buying pink wards to counter her, etc.    Another one is Ryze, and that is because of him being able to gain insane damage from tank items, and that his passive basically let's him spam those spells non-stop.   My advice is just to slowly phase out using the space bar to center you. It's not a huge deal if you need to use it, but it's good not to have to rely on keeping a finger on the space bar.      I was really hoping for a free Zed or Akali week. As a new player I have been dying to try either of the two.   As a lower level player without runes, I reccomend using Warwick for now. You can learn the basics with him quite easily, he has plenty of room for error, and he has deadly ganks at level 6.   I'm a pretty new player to league, and i'm just trying to plan my rune pages for after I hit level 20. At the current moment im just trying to get some basic rune pages set up, and then in the future specialize. The one thing i've noticed in all of my research has been that you should use health seals  over armor seals now. The thing i've been wondering is how much better are they? Is the difference minor enough that i can save the extra 5000 ip for the time being and just use the armor seals, or is it a noticeable enough disadvantage that i should shell out the extra money right off the bat?   I play top the most, followed by jungle and mid.   *groan*   The reason why you havent seen him in the show since season 1 is that his actor had scheduling problems. He has a much larger part in the books   There's no real reason at all. Besides the fact that he's secretly the prince that was promised, Azor Ahai reborn, and all that good stuff.   Thats what seemed so fucked up about it. I just can't imagine someone actually taking the time to record and play something like that. I had to actually keep telling myself that it was real, not just some sick fetishists story. Who the fuck could do this shit.    I appreciate knowing the punch line in the title. Thanks!   /u/preggit , how dare you mod this heretic?!?   People have the same reaction to my dick pics :'(   The old 'dick pic to the inbox' approach. Works every time.

It's in his song "Evil Twin"   Care to share any of the others?   All aboard the *Kane Train*!   It's actually weird, because both of those could work for GoT references, but I don't think they were intended to be. My brain hurts.   *cue shitty broken arms joke*   This story is so much better if you read 'penis' instead of 'pens'   Pay a large fine in only ass pennies.

I made mostly everyone physical into a Hero, with a couple Paladins and a Swordmaster.    A big rule of smart gambling is that until you walk out the door with the money you gained/lost, you didn't "lose anything". Like lets say you won 10 grand, and then subsequently lost it on your next bet, you didn't lose 10 grand, you just didn't gain anything. Of course, its better to play smart and not lose that money in the first place, but if you do, don't worry about it. That's what will cause you to start losing your *actual* money trying to get it back.   You just gotta know where to buy them. You can't just go to 'Loincloths R Us', pick the first one you, see and expect a good deal.   As someone who is struggling through only a no-grind, no streetpass Lunatic run, that sounds like complete hell. I honestly don't know if doing a run like that would be possible. Without a defense boost from Frederick, a +def avatar wouldn't have enough def to reliably tank in the early levels, making you rely purely on Freddy, which would screw you for the later levels.   It's gotta be at least one. If you don't jerk off to yourself in the mirror, you got a problem.   I could imagine it being bad, and just going downhill from there.  "How many people masturbated to me?"  "3"  "Eh, that's pretty low. Were the girls hot at least?"  "They were guys."  "Were the *guys* decent looking then?"  "It was the old guy who lives next door, your gym teacher, and your creepy uncle."   "..fuck"   Oh I know this one! It's from ["Whorrey Potter and the Sorcerors Balls"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pq-4oAZbtI), right?  ^^right?.....  [(this is an actual film)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whorrey_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer's_Balls)   I'm so sick of these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!   In my opinion, Lunatic Casual is probably easier than Hard Classic. It definitely would take away from the game.   They say music can alter moods and talk to you,  Well can it load a gun and cock it too?  If it can, the next time you assault a dude,  Tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued.  Sing for the moment- Eminem   Its a popular show, so it has a large fanbase that would vote highly on it. What I'm surprised about is that season 2 and 3 are ranked higher then most of season 4 and 1, which have been the best seasons so far.   I honestly feel the opposite. The character development is a lot better this season, and unlike past seasons there isn't really anyone that you truly don't care about. The only member of the main group that I'm indifferent about is Sasha.      After you get past level 2, it actually isn't really that bad. Its challenging, but not masochistic. Lunatic+ is a whole different story. Its not even masochistic, its just pure insane. If I didn't see a video of someone beating it, I would think it was literally impossible.   Access to lunatic+ (AKA stupidly-hard mode) is the only thing you get from it. The satisfaction of beating Lunatic is good enough for me though   I have. I'm on level 6 right now, and my Avatar is insane. Level 17 with 16 defense, she's stronger then frederick in every single stat and could probably solo levels if I wanted her to.   For me it was around 24 hours on hard, not including my many resets when a character would die.   If you think that is difficult, try lunatic mode. It took me literally 2 weeks and easily over 10 hours of gameplay just to get past the second mission.   Its hard to explain without some spoilers, but it does all make sense in the game.   [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5P6ztpTMdc) is the full conversation if you're curious.  In short, Gregor (the old guy), has some drunk girl madly in love with him try to propose over and over again. He has Ricken (the little kid) dress up and pretend to be his girlfriend to get her off his back.   Gregor is my favorite. Whats better then the 40 year old, russian womanizer?   Its a war game, and a great one at that. However a big side portion of the game is building up character 'supports', which makes them help eachother in battle more. They can also have children, which are usually the best units in the game. This leads many people to focus purely on the relationship and eugenics side of the game, to try to get the most overpowered kids possible.   I actually will miss him. He had the art of getting downvotes but still being funny at the same time. He had  less than 5k karma left before he would have made it to a impressive -100k karma.   No offense is taken. I made these pairings purely on a fun first time playthrough, not caring about stats. I'd rather know if it would work before I started grinding then after I did. Thanks.   Hey guys, I am a pretty novice FE player (only played Shadow dragon and Awakening), and I have recently decided that I want to grind up my team and try to beat apotheosis. I was just wondering, how neccessary are optimal parent pairings in it? My only kids at the moment (im planning to get them all of course) are Sully!Lucina, Sully!Kjelle, Gregor!Severa, and Gaius!Yarne. Would those kids work well enough or be too subpar?

 100% agree   Has there ever been a player close to, equal to, or better than Lebron at making players around him better? JR's resurgence and emergence as a weapon on this team, I believe, is completely the Lebron effect. Like, him and Bron can go off together and just dominate a game as a duo. He does the same thing with Kyrie and did the same thing with Wade or Bosh. Even back to Mo Williams when he was an all star, that was all the Lebron duo effect. Takes a 33 win team to number one in vegas odds to win the chip the day he signs... single-handedly changes franchises. Just curious to see what you guys think!   well shit, id be itchin to come to cleveland now too that theyre relevant again   "basketball gods, am i gonna win this game?" *bang* "cool, cool"   http://imgur.com/lkRkgWl   Shaq   I just wanna see one with a Mortal Kombat finish at the end.    But most important, are you 12... or 13?   Very, *veeeeerry* important crack   And that sir, is why you are wrong.    Yeah, talking to him. That doesnt mean anything. He could have been recruiting for when he is a free agent. He does that with plenty of players   You're right... but, what if? maybe 7.....   This isnt a movie and i dont care.  McConaughey in True Detective. Not a single soul could have done that the way he did it. perfectly done   yeah, science bitch   dude, dont bring that up. i have to live the rest of my life as a steelers fan saying "what if Tebow didnt torch us for an 80 yard TD bomb to win the game in OT?"   yeah that series was an anomaly. i was at game 4 and you could tell he wasnt in the right place. he honestly looked like he was playing a game he had never played before. but other than that series, all he has been in clutch. never understood this   KD was gettin up there for me this year just bc of his twitter crap and his "you can play me for it" shit about his all star bid. like, you didnt earn that, at least be grateful. but, i cant blame a guy whos had frustrating injuries like that after an MVP season.   Westbrook will have to do   dude, come on. none of this is remotely accurate   OH MY GOD I KNOW. LIKE, THIS IS PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL. ACT LIKE AN ADULT GOOD GOD   Who said he does...?   So Kyrie and Dion and old Varejao were his golden ticket? Come on man...    MJ had/has the same cult following. But, I agree about him getting away with offensive fouls sometimes. However, the dude gets hit in the face on drives all the time and never gets a call bc he isnt effected by it bc he's so big. I think him getting away with pushoffs and hooks is refs making up for missing him get hip checked in the air   Yeah, because that totally isn't classless at all and the exact same thing they did to Dirk.....   For real. Just get it all out, no need to hold back. We're all friends here   Screw Boozer. He's one of the most annoying players ever   Sounds on purpose   my heart likes it a whole lot   Im a white dude who lives in a city and i just pre ordered it. Is that good or bad?   How many are there for real? The commercials make it seem like there's a lot.    Reese wasnt in gone girl bruh   Welp. He's resting this game so I guess the back situation is more real than I thought   Hopefully he rests. Good time for him to grab some extra rest. Also, would love for Love to have just a giant game to get him back in the swing of things. We will need him come May   Even if Lebron isnt the MVP, he will get the MVP. after everything, it's the fairytale ending the league and the team and he wants   I like this one. Scariest teams are gonna be 5-8   youre telling me a Paul George, who hasnt played all season, is going to come back in the lineup and not kill their chemistry AND play like a star against the best player in the world? Cavs in 4, moving on.    Rockets dont get past first round. Warriors dont make it past the second round. Blazers and Spurs the dark horses to make it to the Finals. Cavs win finals in 5 games against whoever they play.    I don't even think it's that. it's how dangerous it is to have something that distracting on the road, right? i mean, it is a powerful message and all but dang, poorly placed.    10/10 would dump   Lilly even says smokes sandwiches. Like, come on   We would also destroy them one on one right now   Yes, all of this, but also what the hell was goin on with Mozgovs hands tonight? mighta been just me but it looked like he couldnt catch anything   He WILL be an MVP in the future. No question about it with that ball handling and finishing ability. Not to mention that 3 point stroke!! Damn   I think 3-9 against teams over .500 is the only argument you need   When in reality, he brought in over 150 mil to the Heat in 12-13 alone.       Dumbledore Mt. Everest    Vince, T-Mac, Marc   It would make for some playoff series with more fire and intensity. Nobody is gonna like gettin called out by the one seed. i like it   It's the "idea" of an escape tho that draws people to it   That's why. Earth sucks sometimes, so lets see how it is out there. It's an escape   Yeah OKC is like a +36 with him off the floor and -24 with him on past few games. Not MVP-like to me   hahaha bruh. hop outta here with that Teague stuff.    never works for me. stimulates my mind   Worst win percentage in the league without him in uniform. I think that speaks volumes   He's carrying them offensively, but they're better defensively with him off the floor. I also just dont see the league giving an MVP award to a (maybe) 8 seed.    http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2389832-the-case-for-lebron-james-to-win-nba-mvp-yet-again   Well that's disappointing. Let me fix it real quick      http://i.imgur.com/Kvff9bo.jpg   Cool story bro   haha youre old congrats. adult life!   When you heard that, you knew it was about to get real   Immediately in the MVP discussion if you do   We Takin Over was the jam   Always Drake. squad knows i got drake bars on lock   Fear, The Calm, Paris Morton Music   BRUH me too. this was that 8th grade basketball pre game hype track   yeah, i think he's the guy who can slay anybody on a song but just isnt as popular to the average fan.    exactly. drake changed the genre to an extent so saying he cant make a classic is near sighted. if his career ended today he would still be known as a complete game-changer with tons of bangers that everyone knows   Interstellar. Made me think deeply about things I had never thought about, question things i always thought were solid fact, and shed tears at how emotional it was. Something about him being the same age as his daughter and missing her entire life while only being gone, in his time, for a very short period. Awesome movie   Literally none of these work.    Incorrect, Blake Lovely goes first in all things always.    "He's a future hall of famer. there's no question."-Mark Jackson about literally anyone on the floor at any given time   I love that bang   past few games it feels like thats been our entire offense. pisses me off. run a play   yeah im just confused about the whole nonchalant nudity thing happenin here   Lebron deserves it over everyone. He's the best player on the planet. But, I'm 85% sure he won't get it regardless of how out of his mind he plays until the middle of june because people just want someone else to get it. Like DRose a few years ago. Yeah right   Neil Patrick Harris as The Riddler Johnny Depp as a character like John Cusack played in Frozen Ground Will Smith as a Bond villain somehow Bryan Cranston as literally any character in anything because he's the best. But I wish he could have been Lex Luthor in this Batman v. Superman comin out.  I would watch Matthew Mcconaughey be his True Detective character forever so if he played a guy like that but motivated by evil, I'd be down.    haha lebron is the most clutch player in the league. just look at the clutch-time stats. bleacher report did a story about the clutchest players in the league and it's not even close   Interstellar missing out is a disgrace.    http://i.imgur.com/iayLLZU.jpg   Doesn't matter. had sex   but seriously, who's mckenna? haha is she hot oorrrr....   did he do that once the whole season? pisses me off. the signature things that made him who he is and made the show were things like that and his asides. felt like he barely had any. BUT, still loved it   Woah. This just put the whole season into perspective. Bravo   coulda sworn she was gonna kill herself. like 4 different times I thought "this is it. here it is" but no. slightly disappointed but also intrigued to see where they go next. that one lady claire talked to with the baby said that she (claire) should be president and Claire had a distinct "I'm intrigued" look on her face.    hahahahhahahahahahahahahah   obviously not if you're gettin it in. OOHHH BUURRRRNNNNN.     http://i.imgur.com/Eix7Erd.jpg   Hey everyone! We have an over compensator over here! WooHoo!! Probably wears Ed Hardy fake rhinestone shirts and drives a truck with a 79 inch lift because of his incessant need to feel like a real man in spite of his tiny penis!       http://i.imgur.com/Eix7Erd.jpg   Shrek is love.            Shrek is life.    and forces some of the dumbest shots imaginable over 4 defenders in closing seconds trying to be a hero.    wouldve upvoted, but youre at 69. proceed   http://i.imgur.com/Eix7Erd.jpg            If Barney transformed into the guy he is now after he found out his girlfriend from the coffee shop was cheating on him, how did him and his brother turn into the wingman duo they were in season 2? Barney said they were raised in the same home and had the same values and James getting married was him turning his back on them and him... So how does that work?   Do you guys remember that McDonalds (i think) promo thing they did with the kids meal toys where you got those little dinosaur lookin guys with a code, and you go online and type the code in and that animal you got becomes a part of your collection. and you have to feed them and take care of them and all that good stuff? Can someone remember the name? I cant for the life of me        	102
 Isn't sapphire just about being scratch resistant? Isn't it just as likely to shatter as gorilla glass?   I just hope the NSAC lets roy take the time off   Typically like The Verge's innovative layout schemes, but does anyone else think that this one was a bit cumbersome ?   Good decision. He's been getting walloped lately. Was great to watch in his heyday, that's for sure.  And what a nickname too..   I still can't beat it, but love trying.. nice to see what the final level or 2 actually look like :-p   Why hasn't he fought since July?    F this cowboy wannabe   apparently? For years they had some serious beef, but this ist he first ive heard/seen of Dana actually sitting down for an interview   Good interview.. Dana likes trotting out the economy line..   Rage spiral? lol, these folks in hollywood are laughable   I hear you, but the "Who is xx?" line, i think, is more appropriate when xx has no accomplishments to speak of.  That said, I don't doubt that Ronda was answering that question honestly. MB isn't exactly widely known, despite his recent tear in the octagon   While that is normally a nice response to this type of thing, Brown has 7 wins in his last 8 UFC fights.  4 of his last fights were all KO or TKO, earning him 1 Fight of the Night and 1 Knockout of the Night.  That's who Matt Brown is.    lol i watched em all and it's hard not to feel sorry for these guys. horrible instruction all around, just all around bad   OH wow, I just watched this clip from Shamrock about a 1-2 punch combo to take down a potentially bigger attacker. it's atrocious.  http://vimeo.com/66950253  starts at 1:30 in.  Almost makes you feel bad for the guy   He missed weight 3 times. The UFC folk don't take that in stride..   Reminds me when King Mo, when asked what weightclass he's in, boldly said "I'm a moneyweight, i fight wherever they wanna pay me"   James Harrison is one scary dude! thank god he liked it   Overeem looks tiny here. He must have hit the gym hard... and all that horse meat!    Aww hell naw!   Assuming he has to win 1 fight to get another title fight, imagine the unlucky dude who has to be Anderson's stepping stone   Anyone think that Silva will be motivated to come back since his pride can't stand the fact he lost to weidman twice in a row? Especially since in the last fight he didnt get to see it all the way through?   Michael Bisping.. florian actually got to have a title fight   I'm all about stacked lineups and watching rising stars. I just wish some of the superstars were scheduled to fight more frequently than once every 6-7 months. Also, consider that just 1 more championship fight per division a year is one more chance for an up and coming star to go after that belt. Benefits everyone all around as it gives challengers a chance and current champions an opportunity to further cement their legacy.  In a particularly brutal fight (i.e jon jones vs AG), sure, take a few months off. But with Weidman in tip top shape, why put him on the shelf for so long?   annoying thing is that Anderson Silva back in the day was pretty vocal about wanting to fight more.. and we still just saw him twice a year   Beagle puppy   I like how they sprinkled some fan reactions in there   Lorenzo look like the big boss man per usual. Saying little, yet oh so intimidating   lol, well done mysterious stranger    Keep an eye out for GSP's Watson impression and which (shockingly) UFC fighter isn't a fan of Watson's antics   Elephants don't have keys   This has to be one of the WORST ufc promos. bang bang bang? jeebus   I believe I read somewhere that Tesla, for the model S, had to decide on maximizing 0-60 acceleration or top speed. Since 0-60 is an advertising point and most folks don't need to go faster than 130 mph, the decision was easy   "Now this is very interesting Mike, __________ and ________ actually used to train together back in their days at __________ "    "____ is one scary looking dude!"   "Yup, yeah, you can see it right there in the replay. His eyes definitely rolled back. That was a good stoppage"   Wow, look at Anderson!   Mine seems to get faster as i use it. perhaps its a placebo effect   Rampage is lucky he's so damn funny, otherwise he'd be very hateable   Sort of a shitty way to go out, on a highly questionable win   lol it's the bizarreness of Reddit commenting.. no rhyme or reason!   So basically, Georges decided to "fight" instead of jab and go for takedowns.. Maybe, just maybe, he had to go toe to toe with JH because his usual tools were proving to be ineffective   Yeah, i did notice his shorts had been Nike-fied and weren't what he usually wears   ah, makes sense. I was wondering where "ain't no sunshine" went. Thanks!   Was this the first time Anderson came out to that lame song?   Ah yes, Stewart! not Howard :-p   get back to work howard!   The DON speaks!  He did a great job of spinning (or perhaps clarifying) Dana White's tirade re: GSP   Great sweep. Not sure why this isn't more common   When talking about Jens Pulver, "Little eagle flies again!"  His precision is so precise!   Story is from 2011, but sheds some light on the breakup. Short of it is: GSP fired her cuz he didn't need her and her 20% cut.   Shari Spencer also manage(d) Frankie Edgar   hendricks is a strong dude and looked about the same as always. Nothing to see here, folks.   photos?   now THAT'S funny   "What do you say to GSP now that he wants to step away?"  Dana: "I SAY NO YOU'RE NOT!"   ha yeah, what was that?  Perhaps a sign that Hendricks was too confident he had the decision wrapped up...    I'll second that!   This article should be a must-read for all MMA fans. Super informative. Insightful questions, superb answers.   I generally like Gruber, but his reviews are pretty uninformative and kinda boring compared to most others.   Anderson is about as big as ortiz and bader for example, two light heavyweights. If GSP was slated to fight them, then all of a sudden people would talk about size difference.  Anderson just cuts down a lot of weight to 185, prolly walks around at 215+   GSP is 4 inches shorter than Anderson who is 6'2.  Anderson is just 2 inches shorter than Jones.  Plus, Anderson is known to cut a lot more weight than GSP, meaning that he's likely a lot closer in weight to Jones than GSP is to Anderson.   The GSP v A SIlva superfight was always a non starter when you looked at their respective sizes. Silva vs Jones, now that would have been great pre Silvas defeat to weidman   come on now, ya'll! Kos just basically described what GSP did to him. not really any biting analysis from Kos here.   Hendricks is thicker and has better wrestling credentials than all of the above listed GSP opponents. Again, hendricks is admittedly an underdog, but he has more tools than previous GSP opponents   Perhaps I mis-heard, but I believe hendricks said on UFC primetime that Dolce helps him cut 40.  I suppose, though, that he won't gain it all back on fight night, but still, he'll be a lot thicker than the condit/diaz body types GSP can take down with ease   GSP hasn't fought anyone with raw knock you on your ass power before. I'm sorry, but Kos doesn't count.   Plus, Hendricks wrestling pedigree is better than any of GSPs previous opponents. Also,  Hendricks has a much more, how shall i say, rotund body type that GSP hasn't really faced before (or at least recently).  Hendricks will come in weighing about 210.. that's a whole lotta person for GSP to try and take down and keep down at will.  Not saying Hendricks takes this, but he's better positioned to beat GSP than any of his previous opponents   Hopefully other folks at Zuffa aren't as boneheaded as Dana   Either way, does add a little bit more excitement to an already exciting match. nice to see hendricks get pumped up    Chris Lytle deserved more than one entry also   No Dustin Hazellet?!   Hendricks (via wikipedia) had a more illustrious college wrestling career than Hughes.   Also, Hughes never cold knocked anyone out while in the UFC. TKOs, sure, but not "put you on your ass" power despite the fact that he's as strong as an ox   Call me crazy, but Hendricks has a better shot than most.  1) He's a better wrestler than Kos and Fitch and anyone else GSP has fought.   2) He actually has power in both hands, which is not something you can say about any of GSP's past opponents. Before his fight with Kos, Koscheck was being hyped as a knockout artist which was even laughable then  Not saying Hendricks wins this, but he has more tools than any of GSP's other opponents.   any love for frank Mir big nog season?   lol me either. the ref looked like he'd give anything to run away from the ring   "I'm not afraid of his wrestling and I'm not afraid of his jab" ha!   ""It seemed like Dana [White] loved it. He was just 'Diego, Diego, Diego.' I was waiting for my compliments and it was 'Diego."  ha yea, all the props seemed to be flowing towards Diego   Perhaps not answering the question, but I once had the unfortunate experience of coming into contact with some drunk Matt Hughes fans at a bar once.   makes sense   Good question. Wondered this when the UFC went to abu dhabi   looks like chuck is gainin a little bit of weight   I don't think there's any evidence to suggest Rory Mac would be the same draw as GSP. Perhaps I'm underestimating Canadian fans, but as far as I can tell, GSP is in rarefied air.. and his ability to command such huge PPV #s without any recent finishes to his name is impressive!  At the end of the day, there are few bankable PPV stars in the UFC. Wanting GSP to lose in the hopes that someone else takes his place is a risky endeavor. Having GSP lose in the hopes that he comes back triumphantly makes a whole lot more sense.  Don't you think the UFC would have liked Lidell to keep on winning indefinitely? Nothing compares to a PPV draw that backs up #s with wins    "It seems that GSP has been more of an issue than an asset lately for the UFC" --  Stupid. GSP is a PPV money making machine  With GSP talking about retiring -- who knows if he's serious -- a Hendricks win would be great because it may stoke GSP's competitive juices, not to mention setting the stage for an incredible rematch.  As for excitement, sure, I don't find GSP exciting. But there are millions of folks out there getting PPVs that apparently disagree. UFC needs GSP in the mix. What other draws do they have as champions? Weidman? Cain?  Hopefully folks like Aldo and Showtime get some publicity going forward   But why not make longer promos for online circulation to really get the  masses pumped up?   Great question. I've wondered about that myself. This is especially true for pre-fight hype videos. UFC does a decent job, but some fan made videos really get you pumped up in a way that you have to wonder why they're not working for the UFC   How can he have an injury that puts him one punch away from paralysis to a full recovery in 6 weeks? Seems a bit suspect   Was aight. Would have been better if he made his showpony remarks there in the ring.    annoying as F! how often are you really looking forward to a UFC Debut?   "No baby, I like it with the shirt ON... I'm kinky like that"   I just wish there was some consistency. That fight gets to go go on but, for example, the Koschek/Thiago fight gets stopped way too soon..   dayum, impressive. though why anyone would take the time escapes me :)   That's a big ole' fist   oh very cool, much thanks man :)   Youtube links to the walkout songs?   Diego will clearly always have a home in the UFC. An okami he is not!   Definitely the way to transform your average joe into a casual fight fan. THt fight was NUTS in every way   F'n awesome dude!   I remember before this fight they showed JDS warming up in the back hitting mitts. I remember thinking, "damn, no idea who this guy is, but he can punch hard AND fast   vertical increased from 37 to 42.. dayum   Dana just rides the wave of public opinion. Overboard indeed.   Love Fitch, but politically (and not just based on this interview), he's kind of a nut   ha yeah, Rashad is livin' good! Nice mansion, nice dinners... makes getting up early to grind it out much harder   Love Rashad, but dude can't even get into prime shape for his fights anymore   Old Navy?!   when they put drew sharpes body and bike into acid during a cold open   what an overreaction   This video with the timecode (which i found on this subreddit) is interesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyMB5DhJ7Fw   "Who cares what it is, the point is, these are some decent generous people that I can take advantage of!"   won't!   I just watched Salud recently. All we know is this: Don Eladio told Gus (after shooting his partner) that the only reason he is alive is because he knows who Gus is and apparently about his past in Chile (as opposed to the gentlemanly fellow that Gus rescued from the slums).  I guess it comes down to the fact that Don Eladio could at least trust Gus somewhat   Agreed, Oldman by a mile   But a helluva way to go out! Two huge surprises. 1) Gus's face blown off after it appeared that he had survived and 2) Finding out that Walt had poisoned Brock in the last shot of the episode. AMAZING   The season 4 finale was created such that it could stand as a series finale. This was done because funding for season 5 was unsure at that point, so Face-Off had to stand on its own as a season AND series finale.  AMAZING ep, but would have been nice to see another season of Gus   I think "that" was rashad  getting in frront of rampage, and then having the nerve to ask him to move out of the way   Kasperky should make their counter arguments available to other victims of the lame ass troll that is Lodsys   You seriously didn't just do that..  "Yes i did"   Wow, check out the referee's mustache in the photo in the article   Sucks, was poised to be a solid matchup   The ending to "one minute" when hank takes on the twins is tv suspense at its finest   but the psychological aspect of knowing you're going to die and can't do anything about it would have been great to see her experience   you would think Apple at this point would be prepared for the traffic   deleted.. tried to cover it in green but couldn't figure out how! found out what asac was tho.    Why did hank refer to himself as Asac schraeder?   Thanks for the feedback! The lined rug is from Orian rugs. Available at Lowes.

Coffee table isn't that big so the rug should be displayed quite well.    This one  http://imgur.com/kUWKfN9 ?   was it just me, or did it seem like there has been some plastic surgery :-p   agreed. he's typically an insightful dude which made his comments all the more surprising.    Something tells me they'll both be fine. Also, it depends on how you define "success". Apple will keep on making more and more money than Steve Jobs could have ever dreamed of, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be as innovative.  Guess we'll see what the iWatch has to offer   this looks like microsoft outlook   i believe that's part of the plan as well. the patent granting system has appeared to be messed up for some time now.

I guess that's why they them rapids and not slow-pids.  YOU ARE NOT MY SON!   Interesting. Last I saw Alves he was on a milk carton.   Bruce Buffer loves talkin about.. well, Bruce Buffer. Likeable guy, though, and he certainly has a lot of tales to tell.   When you can talk like Chael, you're in. Plus, dude will fight at moments notice and can hype a fight like no other. Love him or hate him, he keeps fans engaged. UFC loves the 'personality' he brings to the table because, let's face it, some of the best fighters can be kind of blah.   Excited for this fight, if only to move the Jones/Silva superfight into high gear   James will have more MVPs than Larry Bird who already had more championships under his belt than Lebron did at the same age   I wonder if he's buying more interesting pants on amazon in this photo   The Yahoo Weather app is the bomb.

 But it sure makes its price go up.   Does watching it for 30 minutes count as exercise for the viewer?   Don't know if I like Cersei's grit as she uttered it or Margaery's reaction.       Also, at times like this it can be really hard to want to spend time with other people, but see if there's a friend or family member who you can spend some time with, just talking, and sharing. Having someone with you will make things that much better to cope with.  This is paramount and very effective if you make sure you're surrounded by people who truly believe in you and do not bring you down (even in unintentionally).  Chin up. You'll get through this.     They'd need to change up that colors a bit, though. Just because.   LOL. This reminds me of my checks/checkbook.          Or better yet, tell Ned Stark what's in store for him so he might come up with another plan.      You're right - context makes no difference, but then again, why do people still expect Tarantino to be "nice"? He's always been "I'll do/say it just because I can" guy. At least from what I've read and seen.               Pretty cool. Think you can do one of "I am The Doctor!" from the episode where Matt Smith thunders at the aliens looking for Prisoner Zero?          Just use LastPass?         To be fair, this might have an edge over this season's cars!   And I'm replying to your comment about procrastination while procrastinating.         Let me know how that works out with your daughter!   He likes some of the DC characters, and I'm pretty sure he'd like the voice prompts (Quinn: "Got a booboo?"). While he wouldn't be much good at winning and leveling up, I think the swiping actions he'll enjoy a lot. Also, he loves emulating Ip Man, and I have a feeling he'll do the same with the characters of Injustice. That would be funny to see, but that's also what made realize that it might indeed be too early to introduce the game...   I'm not a parent, but I dote on my nephews, and it occurred to me that my 2-year-old nephew would enjoy the game. My partner shot me down, saying that it's too violent a game for kids. That led me to thinking about this question and asking those who *might* have more experience and a level head.   Yeah because brushing 3 times a day is just too difficult.               You have a point. Dragons are definitely Targaryen, but she used the chest while she was Khaleesi, hence the association. But yeah, you're right.   El Diablo!

 Actually, there isn't anything reasonable that can be done. Violent acts happen and will continue happen. Evil exists. There's nothing you can do about it unless you want to gut the constitution and live in a totalitarian society.    if a foreign terrorist had committed this attack we would be doing a heck of a lot more then skirting the issue.   There is no issue here that can be controlled, and to use this as a political statement so soon to score political points is pretty sick.    Larry Wilmore who comes on after Stewart had a good point that if things didn't change after sandy hook then things will never change. I gotta agree sadly.  If things didn't change after Ferguson riots, then things will never change. I gotta agree sadly.    worth a dismissive news segment?  what are you talking about?

    I prefer having an actual 7slot kernel and overclocking with SetCPU but started wondering...are there any good alternatives that randroid would suggest?  I'd really enjoy per-active-app clock speeds if there is an OC app that can provide that.   Daughter is 3 1/2 years old, and I really need to make these plans early.  However, I cannot seem to find a single private school that isn't centered on religion.  What's the deal with this?   I'm working on a wicked-tight budget, and I'm trying to find the best option for flooring in my 'new' kitchen.  It's small, 10'x9' or so.  So right now I'm looking at staining the concrete because it's just so damn cheap...  The problem is that my floor is black.  I suspect it's tar backing from the floor I recently scraped up.  How do I go about removing this and providing a clean, undamaged surface to start staining?  Sand blaster?  I don't think I can use any kind of solvents, as that would allow the tar to seep into the porous surface of the concrete.  Any suggestions?  *Edit:* Apparently it's not tar...it's asbestos adhesive.  Great.  :(   I've been helping my mother repair houses since I was a teenager (buy 'em cheap, make 'em pretty, rent them out/sell them).  I've now become a new homeowner and *really* don't feel like doing it manually yet again.  We have removed so much damn sticky-tile-laminate, and glued down laminate flooring that it's crazy.  Sometimes even carpet that's glued down with feces/piss or other fluids...stuff that nobody would typically even begin to touch.  What's a good motorized tool to get between the concrete and the back of the flooring?  I'd like to be able to tear up this flooring pretty quickly rather than spending a day and a half doing it by hand with a paint scraper.  The stuff I'm dealing with currently is tar-backed and really a pain to get in between.   I've got a spare Linux box that I can do whatever I want and I would like to set up some sort of 'bundling' service on it.  My question is "how can I do this"...so I'll just explain what I want to happen:  I, have my own 10/1 mbps service from Comcast -- hooked into a router that I broadcast freely but divided into their own private networks (I can instead hook this into my Linux Box for much more advanced routing abilities).  My own private network is secure, and I have a virtual network which is free for everyone else to use (I'm using a DD-WRT'd WRT54GL to accomplish this.)  But, I have at least 20 other wifi spots around me and I've seen people actively get on my open connection, and use it.  I suspect these people also own the wireless connections being broadcast around me that are all secured as well.  What I would like to do, is allow them to join the network, and be given a signup page, which would allow them to enter their routers SSID/Password, and sign up for a pooling service.  Utilizing multiple wifi cards or whatever is not out of the question -- or I can figure out WIFI VLAN capabilities later in the implementation stage.  Once they've signed up, I'd like my box to connect to their box (either using the VLAN method I mentioned above, or even using a dedicated wifi card)...and allow that user to utilize both my network, and their own network.  I realize that a *lot of things can't utilize this* but there are also a lot of things that can....primarily torrent clients.  I could then NAT the connections together (because lets face it...they're probably already behind NAT on their home network anyways)  Now, setting up all of these signup pages, and making the actual pooling service myself, isn't much of a problem.  However, I'd like to know the best ways to setup Linux to utilize multiple connection paths manually before I start to automate it.  Does anyone have any good links to this sort of thing?  Preferably using something like iptables/ipnat (or natd)/ipfw...  This should also provide load-balancing and fault tolerance for all of us (some of the neighborhood is on cable, some of it is on DSL)      Does such a thing exist?  BASH is easy to learn, but there are so many portions of a typical linux system that are divided amongst languages, and since I know python, I'd really like to be able to administer my system using tools centered around a language I already know.  Are there any python-centric Linux distributions out there that anyone is aware of?  Varying levels of integration are welcome...  *edit: Found it thanks to watabowtit!  The answer I was looking for was Pardus linux.  Even their init system is based on Python as well as most of their developed toolset -- this is the distribution I remember having intense interest in.*   The built in one that comes with cm7 is kind of featureless.  And there are a million of them in the market that seem to do 3/4 of the things I need, but doesn't include the alarm function.  Honestly, only thing that made me think of this is my daughter was playing with her iPod Touch 2G, I had to rearrange some apps for her, and got into the alarm.  The one on iOS has alarm, countdown, lap timer all in a single app.        I recently followed a howto on getting asterisk to connect to my google voice so I was able to use SipDroid and a home analog telephone adapter to utilize the service as a full-blown replacement for telephone service.  Right now it's all running in a virtual machine on my own box, but I'd like to move it to a VPS so I can access it anywhere on the internet.  Problem is I don't feel comfortable throwing this out there when it has my full google credentials in a plaintext file.  If someone were to ever gain access to that box through a known exploit, it would be trivial to hijack my stuff.  I can't whitelist because I could be accessing it from any WiFi point that I happen to run across which means my IP address will be different a lot of the time.  Is there any way to protect this?  Am I being overly paranoid?   Every tutorial on sockets I run across is filled with a portion of the code that looks like      while 1:         [do some looping to socket.recv, etc]  I'd really like to learn an object-oriented way of doing this.  (Like making a class that has a on-receive method and fires off code reactively instead of depending on a while loop)  I haven't really been able to find a Python-based IRC client out there thats object oriented in its programming style so I figure this would be a great project to get my head wrapped around OO and stop thinking about everything imperatively.  Does anyone have any kind of links to a small python based IRC client?  Or a OO-based IRC client tutorial?  Even if it's not sockets or IRC; I need something that I might actually use.  Not another rehashed bookstore app or animal/cat/dog/speciation tutorial.  I've read them and the blandness switches something off in my brain that allows me to remember the lesson.  Here's some psuedo code that gives an example of what I'm looking for or rather...trying to accomplish:      Class MyClient(socketChat):         def connect(self, server):             Initialization()         def onReceive(self, origination, data):             doSomeStuff(data)         def onSend(self, destination, data):             doSomeSending(data)  And then work from there, building out the client, or being able to freely add/remove a GUI layer later on (by binding key events to the onSend method, etc.) -- preferribly the class I'm inheriting in the psuedo-code there "socketChat" would be minimal so I could understand how to re-build it myself.  Or am I even looking at this the right way?   38,173 readers  Sponsored Headlines Examples:  + Got an Android smartphone?  Want to make it a smarter-phone?

Since these devices are becoming more and more a center of everyones online experience and social lives, it only makes sense to help them take full advantage of these devices in whichever way possible.  We're very friendly over at /r/Android and do our best to make everyone feel welcome regardless of mobile OS preference.      I've looked @ Lowes, Home Depot, Radio Shack, and I can't find anyone who carries the stuff I need.    I found an SMA surface mount adapter but I need an N-type surface-mount adapter (like the one pictured [here](http://img.engadget.com/common/images/3060000000054045.JPG), and either LMR-400 or CNT-400 Low-loss 3/8" diam coax cable (only like a foot or two).  Any ideas?  None of the big-name people seem to carry this kind of stuff.  I actually live a bit north of Orlando (closer to Sanford) but this seemed the most appropriate subreddit.   Obviously the most popular example would be something like minecraft or line-rider, but I've seen some other 2D sandbox games on the 'net as well.  Anyone know of any on Android worth playing?  I'd prefer something that can be joined by lots of players.  Anywhere between 2 and 50 players in a sandbox environment would be awesome :)   I'm using the new 1.8 version of Asterisk to emulate google talk which directly bypasses all that sipsorcery/sipgate/gizmo forwarding/hacking bullshit and just connects directly through google voice and allows VoIP on my Droid, but the stock gingerbread SIP client doesn't seem to like to authenticate with my asterisk box.  SipDroid will, but not the built in client, and it's bugging me.  Anyone have any idea why this might be?  I'm running the asterisk server locally, I haven't opened it up to the world yet; I'm working on building an 'appliance' for virtualbox that will allow you to deploy your own VoIP - Google Voice - Android solution but gotta get it all working flawlessly first. :)  I already have it working **amazingly** through SipDroid...I can accept and place calls on wifi with almost no lag at all, and it's not reliant on a sipgate/pbxes account or anything...all direct from Google Voice :)            Because lets face it...the average consumer isn't interested in root, jailbreaking, ROMs, heck, some of them don't even download apps from the market, they want their phone to "just work"... so we need to compare here based on out-of-the-box abilities.  Any theories as to why Android is still growing so quickly vs iOS? -- is it just the cheap-o Androids out there and price?  Is it features?  Is it distribution among carriers?  Distribution among manufacturers (aka hardware options)?  *edit:* Did some napkin-math -- most popular app for Android is Google Maps with 616,604 reviews.  The most popular app requiring root would be Titanium Backup with 37,696 reviews.  If both sets of people are assumed to review apps on an equal basis, that would mean 6.1% or so actually root...about 1/20th the Android population.   The virus/antivirus cat and mouse game will continue to happen.  But with the recent action taken on Googles behalf to *automatically* undo the effects of the malware that was present on the market, it is now a confirmed waste of money to buy products like Lookout, etc.  None of these products will protect your phone, they will only tell you about things after-the-fact.  Also, the fact that this malicious software was found by a REDDITOR before any of these "Antivirus companies" knew about it, shows that none of them are taking an active approach to finding malware on the market themselves.  If they were doing their jobs, they would have had the analysis done way before this.  What exactly are these antivirus companies pretending to do anyhow?        Just came back from my post-op appointment from having lymph node tissue in the left side of my neck removed, and the doctor has informed me that I have Hogkin's Lymphoma.  I'm 26 (27 this march) and I've had the symptoms of fatigue easily since I was 16ish.  I haven't had a chest X-ray, or PET scans or even staging done yet.  I have another lump on the inside of my left leg, so best case scenario I'm stage 2 unless it's just a fibrosis (unlikely).  I'm not afraid of death but I cry constantly over the thought of my daughter having to lose her daddy.  Someone talk to me.  Edit, March 10th 2011; It was localized to only that lymph node! Horray! I get to undergo some localized radiation therapy and basically just have to make sure I go to the doctor on a regular enough basis to ensure that it doesn't come back again!  No chemo!  Yay!   First, let me start off by saying I understand the ROM community can be a large, and very confusing place.  However, it all really boils down to this:  CyanogenMod supports [24 devices.](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices)  That's right...24 of them.  And that's only the ones DIRECTLY supported.  Many people have ported CyanogenMod to other devices as well.  Everything (or nearly everything) that gets incorporated into CyanogenMod, typically gets passed down the pipe and implemented into each and every build for these devices.  Code isn't duplicated here.  This ensures that you'll have the same features, across multiple devices, with the same options, the same enhancements, and minimally duplicated effort for the coders to incorporate such changes.  Many changes automatically propagate down the tree without developer intervention at all. The one-off ROMs (like Darkys for the SGS Captivate), are limited to those specific devices and require developer attention at nearly all times in order to incorporate new features, update builds, fix bugs, etc.  On *top* of that, most ROMs that you DO find either use Cyanogens build environment, or a large bit of Cyanogens base code as a starting point.  I don't have any raw numbers but I fully expect that well over 80% of AOSP ROMs available for Android, have taken *something* from the Cyanogen teams work.  CyanogenMod is the biggest, baddest, most comprehensive single piece of work that the Android community has for ROMs.  Nearly everything you see in the ROM community has something to do with CyanogenMod at some point or another.  You may not run CM on your device, but you have to respect the amount of work put into a project this huge.  Those of us praising the Cyanogen team aren't always doing it because CM is supposed to be some mystical, magical, best-of-all ROM available out there.  We respect what they have given to the community, and continue to give.  In terms of importance to the Android community, they probably rank right under the [AOSP](http://source.android.com/) project itself.  *edit:* Ever use ClockworkMod? ROM Manager? -- Both a product of [Koush](https://github.com/koush), a large committer of CyanogenMod code and a member of Team Douche.  Even flashing your phone to a non-CM ROM, you're using their work.    Also, please read the link in the right-hand side of reddit titled "Contribute to CyanogenMod" - It's not about money, it's about how you can help out!  *edit2:* Let me clarify here, this isn't a post trying to convince anyone to flash CyanogenMod to their device.  If you decide you want CM on your device, its your job to weigh the pros and cons and decide that on your own.  I'm merely posting this up there because there have been a lot of people throughout /r/Android saying things like "I don't know why so many people make a big deal about CyanogenMod".  *edit3:* Since people don't seem to care that I'm not trying to advertise for Cyanogen but here's a feature-list for those of you who want convincing: http://www.cyanogenmod.com/about -- Keep in mind that this list isn't feature-complete at all and there are many things to be discovered about CyanogenMod beyond that.      Evernote syncs text, images, etc...that's basically ALL it does.  Is this some shitty iOS port?   I'd really like to learn from you.  Sometimes bouncing ideas and code problems off of someone helps too ;)  I know just enough java to get myself in trouble.  self-taught Python background with no college, and a high school education that would rival a middle-school (seriously, my high school was horrible.) -- However, I'm a fast learner and know when to keep my mouth shut and just watch/listen.   When we talk about encrypted/signed bootloaders, we're referring to the kernel and the ability to run our own.  This has an affect on ROMs, Overclocking potential, development of new features, and even the unlocking of hidden hardware such as the FM radio on certain models of phones.  **Encrypted bootloaders have nothing to do with root**  This also has an effect on you as a consumer.  If a phone with an encrypted/signed bootloader (aka Motorola phones (including the atrix)) get support dropped by the company who manufactures it, it means your device will be stopped dead in its tracks from there on out.  Take the Milestone for example (a bootloader-encrypted version of the Droid) : They will never have Honeycomb or Icecream Sandwich.  (*updated to reflect some new info that there was a leaked gingerbread build for the milestone*)  The milestone is still a perfectly fine, viable phone to use and will continue to be so for another year or two without problem.  OG Droid owners running GBread roms, while a little disheartened over our lack of attention lately, are still receiving infinitely more attention than our milestone using cousins.  The OG Droid will probably end up going on to receive Honeycomb or even Icecream Sandwich.  Sure, eventually we'll run up against technical limitations, but those aren't artificially produced by a company in order to try and entice you into their newest device.  "But I'll just be buying another phone in 2 years, this doesn't affect me!" - go ahead and keep believing that.  If you're advanced enough to have chosen Android over the iPhone or WP7, at some point or another you'll want to tinker with it (even those of you who won't do it until you have a replacement device or are already out of warranty).   I've tried ifconfig, and the 'ip' command in order to try and spoof the mac address but nothing seems to work.  Is this something that isn't currently built into the kernels? (Using ChevyNo1 on an OG Droid)  I can't seem to find any apps in the app store for this task either.   I currently live in a block-house that was extended.  Most of the house is a flat roof, except over the areas where the house was extended, it's a red spanish tile on top of the roof.  I've asked around about insulating underneath the plywood on the underside of the roof, and I've been told that I shouldn't if it's a shingle roof, as it'll make the roof get too hot and prematurely wear the shingles.  Is it ok to do if I have a tile roof?  The room that was added onto the house has the most extreme temperature changes and the blown-in insulation in the ceiling doesn't seem to help all that much.  The rest of the house will stay cool during the summer, and warm during the winter; this room does the opposite.  I was reminded to ask about it by this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ffxrp/styrofoam_on_my_garage_cieling/  And through the image search I eventually ran across: http://www.hammerzone.com/archives/energy/insulation/ceiling_sloped/rigid_foam.htm  Anything I should know?  There don't seem to be any vents in the tile roof (it was built in the 1960s or so) that I'd have to work around.  The roof is vented I'm guessing by the soffit surrounding the house; I'm also thinking maybe the blown in insulation might be 'clogging' the air flow maybe?  Could that be it?   By now I have multiple 85s, and I've noticed a strange trend.  I can get on my tank (prot warrior), and do heroics all day long, never fail, never CC, any healer can keep me up...we just plow through heroics when I tank.  But on my mage, druid, and DK -- all of these groups fail, with CC, and with amazing healers as well.  It's gotten to the point where I'm not even sure why I leveled my other characters because all it takes is the tank being horrible and the group fails each and every time.  There are a lot of 'tanks' in queue who are really just tank spec for the easy instant-queues and it's getting hard to even finish a heroic on my non-tank characters.  People are breaking CC, don't know how to interrupt casts (I've seen multiple 6+ second casts go off when counterspell is down, etc), and are just overall...terrible players.  Most of the time, I check out their gear and it's not the WRONG gear; but they haven't reforged **ANY** of it either.  Reforging is *NOT* optional.  On a per-item basis, sure...but there's no reason someone should be walking into a heroic without ANY gear reforged.  How are people this bad?  I know at least a few of them are wrath-babies, but still...am I just going to have to trade heroic runs with someone else who is proficient at playing a tank?  I'm on Korgath btw.  Also: Anyone have a guild that needs a tank?  I went 8/12 the first week of cataclysm raiding, but the GM of the guild I was in disbanded and xferred servers taking with him the 8 or so BOE epics that had dropped during raiding _ -- I haven't been able to find a worthwhile guild since that happened.  Either the guild is too focused on PvP, or amazingly interested in PvE but has horrible players (my current situation.); the guild I'm in at the moment has a GM that cannot seem to pull more than 6k dps on his mage with nearly 350ilvl gear, even after I helped him gem/reforge into proper stats.  **tl;dr:** I'm nerd raging about bad players.   Building a new rig soon, looking to have the most amount of cores possible because I do a lot of video transcoding, money isn't really a limitation but I would like the most amount of cores per dollar.  I know about the Phenom x6, but is there anything coming down the pipe soonish (within 2 months) that I should consider waiting for?   http://www.imgur.com/uRoJy.jpg  It is NOT feces of any sort.  It doesn't have a root system, and its growing on a bed of rocks.  How do I kill it?   Here's the specs of both of the machines:  Machine 1:  * Pentium 4 2.8ghz, clock modified to 214x14 to bump it up to 2.99ghz * NVidia 7600gs 265mb * 600 Watt power supply * Gigabyte GA-8I848P motherboard. (Both of these post-date AGP 8x so I know it's not an 8x/4x problem) * 2gb GSkill DDR 400 memory in 2 sticks.  Machine #2:  * Pentium 4 3.0 ghz, stock clock speed. * Radeon 9800 XT 256mb (This is actually a WORSE card than the 7600gs) * 600 watt power supply (Identical, yes I know this won't be my disparity) * MSI Motherboard 865G Neo 2-P * 2gb GSkill DDR 400 memory in 2 sticks. (Identical)  Both of these computers are NEARLY identical.  Yet Machine #1 gets 2-8fps under the same game load as Machine #2 in the same area, same game.  I've swapped video cards, back and forth with 0 result.  Framerates remained unchanged.  Both are running the exact same version of the game with the exact same settings (ICYW It's WoW, which stores its settings in the game folder...so no hidden registry entries to worry about).  Both have had all effects and video card settings turned to the minimum.  CPU clocks are the same, Hyperthreading is enabled on both, the timing on the memory is the same on both machines.  Both machines also have the exact same processes running as they are relatively fresh installs.  I've been building/troubleshooting computers for years and this has me entirely stumped.  Could it really all be down to the motherboard?  Swapping the video cards didn't give me any kind of result framerate wise, so I've ruled that out as the bottleneck.  For reference Machine #1 gets about 2-8 FPS; Machine #2 gets 24-38 fps.  Ok, here's my checklist of what I've checked off (based on suggestions):  * Heat - Heat is fine, nothing overheating. * Voltages - Voltages are fine, 12v and 5v rails are within 0.1v * Overclock - Only overclocked because I had the problem to begin with.  OC and un-OCd, no changes. * Drivers - I've been doing this since I was 8; I think I know a thing or two about drivers :) * External Power - Checked with OHM meter; Cards are both getting power just fine. * Drives - Drives are all defragged, run just fine at their manufacturer specified speeds. * Video Cards - I've swapped the video cards; Same result for both cards...8fps...so this isn't the problem. * Memtest - No errors on either machine, ran for 1 3/4 hours. * Memory/CPU frequency - Memory is running 400mhz/428mhz and CPU running at 2.8/2.99ghz; Stock and Overclock respectively. * Swapped out CPU with a 2.66ghz P4 non-HT   Reset BIOS; Still the same...   **Update**  At this point it's just gotta be the motherboard.  I don't know how the system could still be rock-stable and cause this much performance degradation but it seems like it is.  (What really pisses me off is that I don't know WHY it's happening...I'm like Dr. House when it comes to computers, I tend to not stop until I find a diagnosis...even if it still means the computer is going to die.)  It's the only thing I haven't removed/replaced from "my" machine.  And the only reason for THAT, is because Win7 won't allow me to boot from another board without needing a full reinstall _  Thanks for all your help guys; I appreciate all the ideas.  Unfortunately it's just not worth buying a "new" motherboard...once taxes come in I'll just build a new computer; this one is ancient anyways.    **Rooted phones only**  If the kernel/rom you're running supports swap space, download Swapper 2 from the market.  Run Swapper 2, hit menu - Busybox and let it download/install busybox.  Hit menu again - Settings and change swappiness to 20 or 30, and change the swap size to 128-192.  Back out of the settings.  Press ON; wait 5 mins or so -- don't assume it's locked and back out of it before it completes.  Once it says -- Done!  Load up Dungeon Defenders; It should load slowly, but it runs on the D1 with very little lag and is playable.  The control scheme sucks but otherwise it's great. :)  Currently I'm using Ultimate Droid 2.5 for this, but I'm sure some other rom/kernel combos work as well.  I'd also suggest this only if you *really* want to play DunDef or if you've already purchased it and haven't been able to play it yet :)   That's my nerd-rage for the day.      I've been looking all over for waterproof ebook readers and I can't seem to find anything at all.  I know a good amount of women that read books while in the tub, and it's the only thing keeping my wife from getting an ebook reader right now  Also; touchscreen ebook readers...you think they would already have capacitive touchscreen versions out with no buttons (which would make waterproofing easy as well!)...what the heck?!  **Those plastic waterproof covers are cumbersome and annoying as hell, so those are out of the question.** -- that includes ziplock bags, electronics waterproofing bags, etc         Look it up yourself you lazy ignorant prick.  You're on the internet, a vast series of tubes connected to the library of congress and millions of homes everywhere.  Nobody needs to cite a source in order to reply to your comment...fuck.  /rant   I'd really love to get Tasker to underclock my CPU when running SNESoid; since overclocking I can't really determine what will knock the clock rate up or what will keep it low, I'd like to keep it bumped to 1.2ghz on my Droid for the applications that need it but limit it when I boot up SNESoid.  Is this possible?   My father-in-law is an electrical engineer, and apparently has access to an ARM jtag programmer (2x10 pin; is this what's used in the G1?).  I'd like to see if it's possible for me to unbrick it.  If anyone has one that they know is in working order but has a software brick they can't get out of, contact me.  I only need 1 to work with.  (It'll be disassembled and soldered on in order to access the jtag port, so don't expect it back, there's a possibility I may damage something.)  I figure there might be *someone* out there willing to donate a broken G1 to further my educational desires. :)   What I want to know...honestly...is how many people have fully, completely, irreversibly, device-won't-boot, pray to the gods it'll be accepted for warranty, bricked their device via flashing, rooting or some other software-related hard-brick...not a near-brick-experience (NBE), or physical damage bricking the device. -- Overclocking counts though, so if you've pushed your device too hard and bricked it that way, I want to hear about it too.  This also doesn't count where you have soft-bricked a device, but didn't want to go through the hassle of restoring it and warranty replaced it because it was easier...  I know this post sounds like a troll.  In a way it is.  Every day I see "I don't want to root because I'll brick" or "Because I'll void my warranty", or whatever excuse is available -- but what I know about people is that they are the first to complain very loudly, very violently, and near-always even when something goes wrong.    But I've seen no such complaints or mention of anyone ever having a bricked device that wasn't fixable entirely by following some help provided by either us, or XDA...or even someone having a warranty turned down because they had rooted.  I want to know do these people actually exist?  Edit: 11/21 10:04AM EST: Wow...everyone who's bricked so far only seems to be the G1...anyone brick anything other than a G1?   That Android users don't tend to be outwardly fanatical about their devices?  I mean, obviously a lot of us are enthusiastic and also defend attacks against our choice of device, but people come here and ask about tablets, and we suggest "Just get an iPad".  People ask "How can I talk my parents into an Android" and we tell them to grow up and just get their parents whatever device they want...  I just wanted to say I love that laid back attitude that you don't **HAVE** to own an Android, but if you'd like, we're here to help.  It's refreshing to see.  You don't often see that in other communities; Linux, Apple, for example...  Keep it up /r/Android, we're a fast growing community specifically because of this attitude, stay classy :)            So, the newest ADW.Launcher changed some behavior that I didn't like.  Now, newly installed apps don't show in the catalogs you can make by default.  I was able to download the source from here: https://github.com/boombuler/android_packages_apps_Launcher  I was able to load it up in Eclipse, and reverse the changes made in this commit: https://github.com/boombuler/android_packages_apps_Launcher/commit/a9dd0737ba5017d8d96e6aa831c0a233b6bd536c  I'm pretty sure this would have been near impossible on any other platform...so I'm pretty ecstatic right now.  Some of you Android devs may wanna check out the source tree, it's really well organized, and a pleasure to work with.  Everything loads right into eclipse and compiles just fine (after you refresh the project) - Maybe some of you have some ideas you might want added in!   /r/Orlando is the best I could find as far as "local" goes.  I'm a 26yr old stay at home dad with a 2 1/2 year old girl, looking for *anything* to do.  (A job...a friend to visit...) I can't afford day-care and I'm trapped in 1/2 of a house all day long trying my best to keep her from annoying my housemate.  I'm going insane with nothing to do or any adults to converse with (consequently so is my daughter).  My wife works some crazy hours to try and keep us afloat financially so during the week she's rarely home.  I do all sorts of tech-related stuff such as Programming (Python, learning Java atm), Computer Repair, Car repair, Audio/Video (HDTV setup and such), but have no college education and thus a very short resume.  I also can repair paintball guns, I used to play professionally.  I'd really enjoy a like-minded individual to befriend if there are any out there.             First, try installing Pocket Legends again -- I mailed the devs last night and showed them a bug in their manifest.xml which may have been causing the issue for some of you, and they have updated the app with a LOT of bug fixes including the ones I submitted.  If you can't find it on the market, you've obtained an apk of PL, and you're having install errors trying to install it from the apk:  Settings - SD Card/Storage - Unmount SD Card.  Install Pocket Legends, Remount SD card, (Optional) Move PL to SD card.   http://www.reddit.com/user/SheerazRaza -- Spams nothing but "geekword.net" links. - Never comments.  http://www.reddit.com/user/HanifB/submitted/ - Spams 2 sites.

So, I'm out on the back concrete slab with my daughter.  She's playing with the colored chalk and I decide...hey, lets try this.  So I rubbed a little chalk on my thumb, and it's like my thumb is ice-skating on my D1 screen now and I'm not leaving smudges and finger prints (or scratches!)  I know chalk is made mostly from gypsum, which is one of the softest minerals (only behind talc) so I don't think it'll harm/scratch anything but I just wanted to share.  I now keep a piece of colored chalk at my desk for when my fingers are getting sweaty and sticking to the glass. :)            To give some context, here is the news report that was done yesterday on it all:  http://www.wate.com/Global/story.asp?S=13360235  That news article is basically the TL;DR -- I warn you of the wall of text that is imminent.  The woman in that news article, is my mother.  She is quite possibly the most amazing woman you could ever know.  She raised us 3 kids by herself (now all in our 20s), all while fighting severe depression, and the effects of multiple sclerosis more recently.  She was born in North Carolina and moved down to Florida when she was young.  5 years ago she was vacationing in TN, drove by a motel and couldn't get the dream out of her head from then on. She bought the Sunbright motel in Sunbright TN a year later.  Always thinking of her children she set out to have us all start a family business so we would all have some steady money as we got older.  I moved from Florida up to Tennessee with my soon to be wife because I owe my mom everything in the world, I would do anything for her.  In the beginning, things were going fine. We immediately got to work on renovating the place.  We were all very hopeful and you could tell in our work, everything was on a shoestring budget...but we kept at it, working day in and day out.  The previous owner of the motel had attempted to burn it down for insurance fraud so we had an entire section of the place to re-do; there was literally a tree growing up through the middle of the building when we first got it.  The first trouble started with the help we had hired.  It seems the crazies come out of the woodwork first.  We'll call these particular crazies "joe" and "tanya".  We've always done our best to try and help people and it turned out that one of our helpers was homeless.  Well, we thought, we're renovating a damn motel!  So we went to the back basement-rooms and renovated them best we could to provide electricity, a bed, bathroom, shower, you name it.  In exchange for living there the guy would help out around the motel doing some of the construction and get paid minimum wage.  His girlfriend was with him so she was free to look for a job elsewhere for extra money to get on their feet.  I lived at the motel in an area that used to be a video store at one point.  So 5-6 months of work passes by; we've now lived with "joe" and "tanya" for a while, and trust them fully.  Since things are going so well, my mother and I decided we needed to be down in Florida for the holidays.  We leave for Florida, fully comforted by the fact that we have someone watching over the place.  So, christmas and newyears come and go, we've packed some more of our personal belongings because a lot of it was left in Florida to save on travel expenses.  We get back up to Tennessee and find that close to $6k in tools, a LARGE red toolbox have been stolen and joe and tanya claim to have never heard a thing.  They didn't know about it.  Since this is already going to be a wall of text, I'll just cut to the chase: after about 3 months of despair, and suffering over being robbed (first time ever btw.), we find out that joe and tanya...with the help of the other helper we hired, broke in, and stole all our tools, and sold it all off for $300.  For drug money.  Oh, and I'm not joking about the "we" part.  WE took the initiative that the police wouldn't to track down our stolen property and eventually tracked down all the parties involved.  We got about 30% of our tools back, with the big red toolbox, but most of it had been pawned off already.  At that point, my mom is fighting to continue this thing.  I'm originally so devastated that I just want to move back to Florida, but she talks me into staying.  Eventually I get back into the swing of things and we hire some new help.  We accomplish a lot for a while, but as all of this is going on, I'm still living in an old video store section of the motel and its getting to be winter.  The winds are terrible up there in the fall, and the place is not well insulated.  My wife got pregnant around the middle of the year and my daughter is supposed to be born around March (at the time).  Well, March rolls around, and we have a 3-4 month old baby in sub-zero temperatures TRYING like hell with a 220v SPACE HEATER to keep the place warm.  All this in an effort to stay and continue helping, as this place could be our families livelihood in the future.  Yet another long story short, me and my soon to be wife moved back down to Florida with the baby.  After I moved back, my mother continued on with the motel, although at a slower pace.  The holidays came again, and this time we weren't robbed.  Things were looking up.  Or so we thought.  Over the next 2 1/2ish years, we've been broken into and robbed 10 more times.  Every time, me and my mother alternate talking each other back into keeping up the work.  I can't do it anymore.  My mom just recently had come down here to visit her grand-baby and upon returning, the copper in the entire motel has been stripped out, the A/C units have been hauled off, and we're nearly back to square one after dumping our life savings into this thing.  The sad thing about it all, is that the police station, is right across the road from the motel.  Someone had CALLED the police from sunbright, and morgan county (which also 'services' that area) and not one police officer even showed up.  The thieves took their time to PROPERLY vent the freon from the A/C units that they had stolen.  I don't know what to do anymore.  My mom is broken, her spirit shattered into a million pieces, as is mine and my wifes.  We picked Sunbright because it used to be a great place, and the motel was built in the 1920s (or sometime around there at least), and we really felt like we could restore it, and help build a thriving community in the area.  What has happened though is we've been picked clean slowly by officials in TN not doing their jobs, thieves, and just outright heartbreak.  I don't want to give this place up, we've put a lot of hard work and sweat into it.  My mom has put the place up for sale though, some ridiculous low price.  She just doesn't even want to deal with it anymore, and I've now become so paranoid, so pessimistic about life, that I just can't even enjoy myself 1200 miles away.  We've asked the local communities for help, we've even had a couple offer to help for free, whenever we need them, but anymore we can't trust a single person it seems.  What do I do?  I'm so completely lost.  **TL;DR:** My moms dream of renovating a motel has been smashed by police that refuse to do their job, and thieves. We're out of hope, we're out of willpower, we're out of trust, we're a shattered version of our former selves.  I don't know what to do anymore. I can't even enjoy my own life at this point.  We've worked hard all of our lives in an effort to "live the American dream", and now we're here.  All of our hard earned money spent, and us barely able to walk back into our own homes without wondering if something is missing.  If you want to know more, I could probably type another 5-6 pages in details.  I tried to keep it as short as possible.  I can give you my mothers email address if you would like to try and give her some encouragement, she doesn't know I am posting this here but she could definitely use the support.  bmorris553\[at\]\[g\]\[mail.com\] She is heartbroken like I have never seen another human being in my entire life.  I can't even talk about this without her completely breaking down over it.  *Edit: Before you go about saying that we should have probably got security cameras, etc -- we did.  Those were stolen too.  No security service will secure this place either; to dial for an emergency out there, you have to call 911, give them your phone number and address...they have to hang up with you, call dispatch, and call you back.*   Or maybe it's not the back side...maybe it's a print on the front, but in either case here are my thoughts on the idea:  Typical glow-in-the-dark pigment glows green.  It's the Android color, and Gingerbread looks like it's embracing this color a little more (speculation but I'm gonna run with it.) - There are other glow colors to choose from if the manufacturer wants.  (red and blue)  Could this make a difference with battery life? -- Maybe the LEDs could be UV and just turn on for a couple seconds at a time to illuminate the ink and then turn off?  The glow should be dull enough that you don't notice it in the daytime, but doesn't distract (if you're watching a movie or something) at night.      I don't want a desktop widget, but would like a weather icon in my notification area (not when pulled down, but just an icon like when a program is running in the background has), does something like this exist?  Everything I search for is some sort of desktop widget.  If it does exist, it's very hidden.  Edit: If possible, one with an icon for the conditions + temp overlay would be perfect.   I don't really know how to do mentorship long-range so I'm kind of looking for any kind of mentorship in the central Florida area; I guess I'm kind of looking for a friend as well to learn things together.  I know a bit of Python (but I'm interested in ALL languages), just enough to scrape me by as I find examples of code that do what I need and modify them to suit my purposes.  I'm also interested in electrical engineering but I have no formal college for any of it.  I really just want to learn.  I've been without a job for a year, I've been building computer systems since I was 12 (back when there was no such thing as "plug and play" and you had to figure out dip switches in order to get a system to boot up) so I'm tech savvy, just lack any formal education on anything specific.  Here is a quick list of all my interests:  * Android development * Python, C, Java * A/V - Security systems, Stereo systems, Home entertainment * Robotics * Electrical engineering, interfacing (arduino type stuff?) * Linux (Gentoo, Arch, Debian; Anything more advanced than Ubuntu)  My problem is typically motivation: I get disinterested quickly when there isn't someone there to guide me or share the experience with.  If someone can talk me into some sort of long-range mentorship and how I can go about doing that kind of thing (would I need a webcam?  what software?) I'd be happy to try it out.   I've been using "TooManyAddons" to group and make profiles for enabling/disabling addons on the fly (well, with a reloadui) in-game for a while now, but it looks as if the author might not be updating it anymore.  I've also been using TidyBar, which stacks up my 3 bottom action bars, puts my mini-buttons + bags in the bottom right (and autohides them) and it seems as if the author cares more about TidyPlates so he won't be updating it right now.  The biggest deal about this bar mod is that it's virtually configuration-less and I don't have to rebind a whole bunch of buttons to use it properly (I'm looking at you...bartender...)  Can you guys suggest some alternatives??  I figure DBM, Grid2, and some of the others I use will update in the next week or so and I can live without them for now.   http://voicechatter.net/  This is a shameless plug about a piece of software that I found about a year ago and have been using instead of Ventrilo for a while.  I became part of its community but wanted to share it here, as there seems to be a lack of alternatives out there.  VoiceChatter is an open-source VoIP client very similar to Ventrilo -- It doesn't quite have all the features of Ventrilo (primarily missing some of the fine grained room controls and such) but it's a decently polished voice client that sounds practically identical.  We could use some people testing/trying it out, as it's the ***ONLY*** fully cross platform VoIP software out there at the moment, meaning it has full server, and full client available for Windows, Linux, and Mac (Both PPC and X86 builds are available) and there are also some builds floating around there for ARM processors (for example, you could run a server on your DD-WRT router)  Also feel free to use the public server and the sandbox server to test things out or just use them as you see fit.  (They are both listed on the home page, the one on port 8787 is public, 8888 is sandbox)  If you find any bugs, or wish to request features, we have a forum for that and both me and ChrisW are happy to take any suggestions/feature requests/bug reports -- we're typically VERY responsive to anything on the forum.  The server software is very stable, we've had servers running for 2-3 months with no downtime at all under heavy usage.  We also include auto-restart software and I've developed some python scripts myself for mass server-hosting  Edit: We also need sound/graphic artists to help polish up the client with better looking icons and event notification sounds if anyone is interested.   I've got a 1200x1080 monitor I use as my primary monitor, and a 720p HDTV hooked up as a secondary monitor, but every fucking time I play a movie on the second monitor, turn my main monitor off (to watch the movie) then for example, come back to the computer mid movie and switch it on, it deactivates my HDTV, I have to Win+P it back into extend mode, un-fullscreen my movie, move it back over, re-fullscreen it and it gets really fucking annoying.  My Google-Fu turns up TONS of people who have this issue yet no answers to it that work except for people suggesting a registry value change (which doesn't exist in my registry and looks to be ATI specific....I have an NVidia card)  I'm honestly about to revert to XP in the next week if I can't get this fixed.  I don't expect I will but I'm holding out hope.  Maybe I can fix this via a hard-hack?  Are there some data-pins I can clip on an adapter (maybe I can buy a male/female adapter and clip the pins?)      Remember the days when LCDs were first coming out, they all claimed more efficiency and that you wouldn't have all of that *HEAT* of a CRT?  Well, I'm sitting here with a 21" CRT, and a 19" LCD, both of them have been active for the past 2 or so hours, and the LCD seems as if it's actually putting off MORE heat than my CRT.  (Even if it's not more, it's still putting off a *LOT*)  I'm in the market for a new monitor but I can't seem to find any information on which ones emit the least amount of heat.  Heat means my A/C has to work harder to keep the room cool, and while it may not seem like it would matter much, I currently have 4 PCs in the same room (I'm actually looking to replace all of their monitors) - and the A/C can have a hard time keeping this room cool at times.  Where can I find a good 21" or larger flat panel monitor (LCD/LED?) that emits VERY little heat?  Low response times are a must as well.  I secretly wish they'd release sAMOLED monitors already.  I'd be an early adopter. =(   I've been looking around, and have noticed that there doesn't seem to exist any kind of open-source bounty system or popular service to set these things up.  If some developer would get the PS3 Dualshock/SixAxis to work on Android, I'd gladly throw down $30 into a bounty of some sort.  Is there some way of "officially" putting a bounty on something that I could maybe charge to a credit card or something?  I would do almost anything to have a full controller with L1/L2/R1/R2 and a SELECT BUTTON...  I found Flattr but that's monthly payments, but hell - I'd setup a flattr account and set 100% of it to the developer of this for a couple of months. (Like $15/mo for a handful of months or something)  ANYHOW: I've done a little research into the matter as well.  First off - The PS3 has to pair via USB cable, or at least be set to pair with a specific device before it will do such.  Basically what this means is setting the Dualshock/SixAxis up with the mac address of the bluetooth device that it will be pairing with using "MotionInJoy" **via USB first** and the instructions I've found [Here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=689984) under "Initial one time setup for PS3 controllers. (Note that the software (Cobalt) on this thread is for WM, not Android; but the instructions for MotionInJoy are for using windows to set the SixAxis to accept communication from your Android/PC/Whatever). -- There is also a Linux equivalent for setting this called sixpair.c;  Additional information can be found: (kernel patches, bluetooth patches, connect code)  [Here](http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html)  [Here](http://wiki.ps2dev.org/ps3:hardware:sixaxis)  [And here](http://python-ps3.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/python-ps3/bootable/sixaxis/connection.c?view=markup)  After the PS3 controller has been set, the rest is what needs to be developed.  The author of WiimoteController has stated that this would possibly require root to get working (Something about ports below 1024).  I'm also unsure if this would also need a custom bluetooth stack or maybe at least a patch to the current stack but maybe the CM6 devs would know a little more about this?  Here's some hints as well from the guy who is doing it on WM:   Once the master address is set to your phone, pressing the PS button will cause the controller to send connection requests to your phone. Listen for devices, no authentication, with hid guid on psm 17 accept the connection request, then psm 19, accept that request, then write .... something can't remember... I have to go back to my code... to set the LEDs so they stop flashing and another code to tell the controller to start sending data. Once u r successful the controller constatntly sends packets of 50 bytes continuously describing the state of the controller, tilt, which buttons are down, up, etc so you just need to check for changes react accordingly.  I hope this post is coherent; on some strong pain meds for tooth infection :(  tl;dr: I'm willing to plop down cold hard cash for someone to get this working.  I've spent the time gathering as much information/existing code as possible.  I could probably buy a SixAxis and send it to a CM dev if that's what it would take.  This could be a real money-maker in the market as well...   I really don't need phone service, and texting I typically do through Google Voice anyways so; what options are out there for data-only smartphone plans?  Do *any* of the carriers in the US offer a data only plan?  I've looked all over and I haven't really seen anything indicating that they do. =(   We constantly go on about how we shouldn't pirate apps, and how we have no tolerance for it here in the Android reddit but I constantly see posts on "where can I get Swype" and then replies of "google for [x]" and even direct links to downloads of pirated apks.  I understand the frustration of not having it available for your device, but that is no excuse for pirating it or trying to get cracked copies, etc.  I really don't think as a community we should be tolerating this just because we disagree with how the company is handling its releases.  As a community we should encourage alternatives, or direct them to the Swype beta signup, and we should not be tolerating the replies from people suggesting and encouraging this kind of behavior.  Stuff like this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dcmq3/where_the_hell_can_i_get_swype_for_my_phone/c0z773e http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/d6yh4/swype_for_samsung_i5700_spica_320x480_px/c0y0yt3 http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/d67gu/noobie_boobie_how_do_i_get_swype_today_site_says/c0xuz83 http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/d67gu/noobie_boobie_how_do_i_get_swype_today_site_says/c0xvidn   As far as my own speculation goes I really think Google is trying to unify the best parts of each manufacturers device-specific UI and integrate it into the main Android distribution.  What SINGLE feature of these skins would you guys like to see most?  What problems do you think could be addressed?     I ran across a site http://www.javavideotutes.com -- and the videos there were amazingly helpful but the author seems to have disappeared and is no longer uploading videos.  Can anyone suggest something similar that has a linear progression? -- All I ever find on the net is fragmented regurgitated beginners tutorials; this particular site was amazing in the fact that he started from a beginning point and progressed through and advanced the topics as he went along...   I'm thinking of printing out some QR code stickers to randomly stick to restaurant tables, phone booths (if they still exist), or just other random places.  Initially I thought maybe it could just be something stupid like "For a good time, call xxx-xxx-xxxx" taking a page out of bathroom scribbles but I'd like to be a little creative...  Any ideas as to maybe some QR code shenanigans or even some ideas?  If you randomly saw a QR code at your restaurant table, you'd probably scan it just out of curiosity right?  How large would a QR code have to be on the front of a restaurant door for you to notice it?  I'm looking for high traffic areas, the content can't be offensive but would be cool to know who visited...   Sometimes I feel like the edit timer for the asterisk is too short =(   4 Days ago I posted asking what the best $200 Android device was, and there really wasn't all that much interest in the post so I just went ahead and bought a used Droid 1 for $140.  This is what I've learned so far:  The major problem with not having service has to do with the radio.  You *can* turn "just" the radio off with a special screen (\*#\*#4636#\*#\*).  What this does as a side effect however, is make it so GPS won't operate correctly.  You can do Airplane mode but it turns off your bluetooth as well at that point, leaving you with 2 out of 3 features available to you.  So ok, I figure I'd root, upgrade to a rooted 2.2: Bad idea.  Once you go 2.2, accessing the radio via the "special" method now activates airplane mode ANYWAYS, meaning I'm either stuck without GPS/Bluetooth or have a battery drain that I have to constantly manage.  You can also remove TelephonyProvider.apk and Phone.apk in order to get the device to quit searching for service however it seems that this also affects the GPS in the same way the 2.1 "radio off" version worked.  "So why not just leave the radio on?" you ask?  Well, because according to my battery usage meter "Cell Standby" at that point uses a significant portion of my battery.  Possibly moreso than the GPS uses when active.  Upwards of 38%, right behind the display.  I've searched all over in an effort to turn off the cell radio while also still allowing me to use GPS and Bluetooth or at least maybe disable the tower info it's looking for in order to get it to quit "scanning" for a connection when its lost. -- I'm unable to find anything.  (If anyone DOES have any info on this, I would appreciate it.)  On a GSM device I could probably just remove the sim card or modify the APN settings but no such thing seems to be available in this CDMA device.  GPS even without service (no connection at all in one of the areas I tested) works just fine (just has some sort of artificial limitation that the cell radio be ON), locks on within 20 seconds from a cold boot.  It's accurate when using no cell towers and when I am IN a service area, and have "Use wireless networks" checked, it will still use the towers for rough-location.  I have learned some other interesting things though.  Even without cell service, the Droid still communicates with local towers.  In the Phone Info dialog, when connected with said towers, the software can actually ping google.  I've got some testing to do but if I can get ping responses or DNS replies from any server I choose then it may be possible to communicate without cell service or even data service from Verizon. (however, very very slowly, it would be an ugly ugly hack.)  The OTA updates do not have any sort of wifi backup option to check for updates.  When disconnected and without a Verizon plan the Droid refuses to update at all.  I've had to manually find the Verizon update files in order to get to the point I am now (I actually ended up downgrading to get root then rom manager'ed up to 2.1 then 2.2 testing as I went).  Without phone service you'll also get the activation screen at every boot unless you specifically disable it via something like autostarts, and then it seems to come up coming out of airplane mode as well -- I haven't figured out how to stop this from happening yet.  If I forgot something that you might be interested in, let me know and I'll try it.  ***Edit:*** Just spent some time where there was actually good verizon service, took airplane mode off, and reset my battery meter.  Cell Standby dropped down to 3% so a lot of this seems to be a non-issue if you're in the city or at least an area covered by verizon.   Now that we *actually* have search, I use it.  But any time I want to restrict my search to a specific subreddit, I have to search, then check the box to restrict my search, and then search all over again to get relevant results.  Could we maybe have a checkbox on whatever page we're on in order to restrict the search?  It might even put a little less load on your server.   So, I just sold my iPod touch in order to offset the cost of a "spare" android device, purely for dev/hacking/wifi-only usage.  I'm willing to spend about $200ish for a used device, but I'm not interested in phone service.  I really think the Droid 1 is my best bet due to the hackability of it, but it uses aGPS doesn't it?  Should I just wait for the Samsung PMP that's based on the Galaxy S? (although that breaks my budget by $50, it would be a new device, not used, but I can't know how soon/if it's coming out.)  On that same note, Craigslist is absolutely FLOOOOOODED with kiosk-assholes posting about flashing droids for MetroPCS yadda yadda yadda...is there a better (less spammy) place to get a used device?  I also know that these devices all use aGPS, is the Droid GPS fast enough at gaining a lock that I shouldn't worry about it?  Does the GPS **require** service to work correctly?  Are there any out there that don't use aGPS?      If any of you Android redditors wish for your issue to be taken seriously and not get overlooked by devs, quit using the issue tracker as your personal forum.  The comment section is there only for developers in order to facilitate information exchange, not your "me too!" comments and other junk.  The more you post these kinds of things the less likely the issue is going to be looked at by a developer because they have to wade through all of the nonsense that have nothing to do with actually solving the problem.  Please, just star the issue and move on.  When an issue has 200+ stars, and you comment, you're mass mailing 200 people and they will un-star the issue in order to stop the spam.  You are only working against yourselves by filling the comment section with useless crap.  Thank you in advance. /rant   Ok, so I've been doing my own little personal projects with python for about a year now, and I've recently got to where I would LIKE to make some stuff for Android.  Well, SL4A (ASE) doesn't have bindings to the GUI API for Android so that won't work, and SL4A doesn't actually seem to be in the market, you have to hunt it down to allow people to use it.  Oh well.  Next option.  So I figure, hey, java shouldn't be all that big of a step from python right?  Some braces, some semicolons, static typing, no biggie.  BOY WAS I WRONG.  I've become so accustomed to the cleanliness of Python that I'm having a hard time pushing to learn anything else.  There was going to be a Jython android port but as soon as SL4A came along it got canned, that seemed another option but it's no go as well.  So my big question is: How do you learn to cope with another language?  Are there tricks you can use to attempt to make something like java more...pythonic?  I'm running across things like      public class main extends someclass (View view) {...  and      private final static string notes="notes.txt";  ...and thinking to myself, how do the people using these languages get by on a day to day basis?   http://www.appbrain.com/app/me.zed_0xff.android.alchemy  [QR Code](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr chs=250x250 chl=market://search%3Fq%3Dpname:me.zed_0xff.android.alchemy)  *I did a search restricted just to /r/Android and this game doesn't seem to have been mentioned in the past and I thought it deserved some attention.*  The game is pretty simple, it's really nothing more than combining items.  The hard part is figuring out all the combinations.  You start off with Air, Earth, Fire, Water; You can combine them to make different items/things and then combine those and so on and so on.  It's a very addicting game, you'll find yourself trying to make up combinations to try even when you're not actively playing it.  Do yourself a favor and don't google the combinations, its much more fun when you figure them out yourself.   There's always a lot of reddit threads about "How do I learn Python", and the ground has been covered quite a bit.  I've completed O'Reilly's "Learning Python" so I'm pretty much past all of the uber-beginner stuff.  Where are all the intermediate materials?  Everything seems to jump from "Ok newbie, let's learn loops!" to "Hey lets start interfacing with C!". Do I need to have an interest at this point other than just one of general programming?  I have managed to compile a few useful scripts with Py2EXE, and work through some of the problems that have come my way on that, so I made myself a nice little 'skeleton' project to package anything else I work on later.  I've also managed to use mechanize/beautifulsoup to scrape and automate a small web-based RPG, and that was fun for a while also.  I have no college education, I graduated from some po-dunk high school that had no enthusiasm for technology so I'm really behind the curve.  I'm kind-of interested in getting some GUIs working but some rather unwieldy results with Py2EXE makes me wary of the packaging process later.  halp!   Ok, so here's the thing, I'm always getting caught up in wikipedia and I recently ran across [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_LED#Disadvantages).  Which has recently prompted some questions, as well as some conspiracy theories.  1. Are there any browsers that will invert most of your displayed websites color themes, or possibly apply themes ala stylish or something similar? -- This is the quote from wikipedia I'm most concerned about: "[OLEDs] can use over three times as much power to display an image with a white background" (aka, nearly all webpages, apps, etc) 2. While the 'Live' backgrounds of 2.1 are really a cool thing, one has to wonder if Google did it because of said burn-in issue on the wikipedia page; Almost like a "screen saver" of sorts. 3. How much does the screen actually account for regarding overall battery usage...40%? 60%? 4. This also explains the "blue hue" that I've seen some users complain about.  The manufacturers actually produce stronger blue LEDs in the device to account for the fact that a lot of the devices out now will lose a lot of blue luminosity quickly.   Hardware Cursor in OpenGL...that is all.         I've only been an /r/Android reader for 2 months or so but I regularly see the same questions asked.  Shouldn't we put up some sort of FAQ section or...something?  Here's a list of the questions I see most often:  * Why should I root my device? * Can I get X.X upgrade if I've rooted? * What device should I get? * What apps do you guys recommend?  Obviously if someone is looking for a certain *type* of app, that's cool.  I know we're a friendly community here, and it's also nice to have a voice, but really?  Maybe in this FAQ we could list some other common things as well?  A wiki would be nice...   I currently have an iPod touch; now, before you pound on me for that, I'll tell you that primarily I have it for my 2 year old daughter.  There are a bunch of good toddler apps on there that really accelerate her education, as touch screens are very intuitive for a child.  The point I'm getting to, is that there is an app available to jailbroken devices called "Incarcerator" which allows me to disable the IPT's home button (with a special key combination, like holding home and pressing the volume up key), allowing me to 'lock' her into a specific application.    Does an app like this currently exist for Android?  If not, CAN it exist (are the APIs available for such a thing?).  If it doesn't exist as a global-hook type application, is it possible to build it *into* an app I create? (I'm JUST starting on android development; Toddler apps might be one of the areas I create in and this would be almost required)  I'm really not trying to disable anything other than the home, and possibly back buttons; anything that's on the front of the device that could easily be pressed by a toddler.  Preferably a global application.  This didn't really seem appropriate anywhere else; Sorry if I posted the wrong place.   I've recently gotten *back* into programming, and have been learning Python, but my interest has veered more and more to Android development.  Python is AMAZING.  Love it, can't stand semicolons and curly brackets at the ends of lines anymore, I hate parenthesis with a passion if they are overused and I've generally grown to absolutely LOVE the way Python looks and feels as a language.  But I really need something that isn't interpreted.  Not because I need speed, not because packaging can be a pain, none of that stuff.  I need something that can be compiled in order for me to run it on Android (potentially).  Are there any languages out there that have the feel of python, but can be compiled?  Strong, Static typing is fine, I don't mind defining the types of variables I'm using but I really would like to see if there are options available out there that could be used (even a language that perhaps has a converter to convert to C?)      I found this nice little tid-bit [Here](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/issues/detail?id=55) - It's just a single comment on the page about "compiling" python apps into APKs, and Alexey.Reznichenko suggests that the feature is coming in the next couple of days.  In looking at his [updates page](http://code.google.com/u/Alexey.Reznichenko/updates), I am noticing some very interesting things like: (Template project for creating custom interpreter APK.) -- there's only java stuff in the file being referred to but he looks to be a very active developer!  Hopefully I'm not getting ahead of myself in being excited.  Even if some unstable code is released I'll be more than pleased.   It seems like this fight between the two is going to rage on for a couple years, and it just seems that MOST mac users are a bunch of photoshop geeks.  Why doesn't Adobe just port Photoshop to Linux, drop Mac support and watch as Steve Jobs writhes in agony?  I get that Apple might create some sort of photo-suite but Photoshop seems to be the defacto-standard and a *lot* of people would start ditching macs (not that it's apples core business anymore however)     	99

Weighs items up to 500 grams in 0.1 gram increments. One reviewer says it even has an ozt mode.  I don't plan on buying silver larger than 10 oz bars so in theory this scale fits the bill.  Are you guys using these "cheap" digital scales?  $9 is hard to beat, averages 4/5 stars on 917 reviews.   I'm looking to buy (relatively soon) some generic rounds and bars from non-gov minters.  In particular, I'm looking for:  * 1 oz rounds * 1 oz bars * 10 oz bars (nothing larger and I might bail on this and stick with 1 oz bars)  From an eventual resale perspective, who are the most recognized minters out there with the lowest premiums? From another thread where there was talk of generics:  "sunshine, OPM, Johnson Matthey, etc."  All of whom I recognize. The point of this thread is to perhaps expand the "etc."    **Order placed, hand-delivering check/letter to post office tomorrow am** (check has to be postmarked one day after order).   Went with cart 2a below.  When I went to actually place the order, they gave me two shipping options, one was $5 cheaper (USPS (Insured) - Priority Mail 2-Day Small Flat Rate Box) so I went with that. Total was $1,996.72.  I'll let you all know how the Amagi buying experience goes for me.  **Thank you for all your feedback**.  ------------------------------------------  **Edit: See updated cart at the very bottom**  Would really love your opinions on this as a first silver purchase. I wanted to end up around $2,000 for this initial purchase.  Amagi Metals seems to have some pretty good prices and selection from what I saw out there.  **I would love your opinion on the prices below as well as Amagi in general (I do see it in the sidebar)**.   For this initial purchase, I'll be doing a personal check. I don't mind a delay in processing/shipping, that's no big deal for me.

Looking at getting into silver investing and I've been researching some safes for storage at home.  I have stairs and don't really want to maneuver possibly 200 lbs up that by myself (and eventually back down). Don't really want to store it in my garage, either, though that's not necessarily a deal-breaker, just not what I'd like ideally.  Can anyone recommend a smaller/lighter type of safe to store metals in at home.  Something you're perhaps using yourself and are happy with.  And most importantly, how many ounces you think it could hold.  I'm looking to do coins/small bars, not sure if I'd ever go larger than a 10oz bar, I'm more interested in the smaller pieces for reselling way down the road.  I'd like a safe I can continue to grow into for years and years and years, not something I'll outgrow in a couple years. And I know I can't predict my buying patterns, just trying to plan ahead for storage. From what I've seen in pictures, it seems like a 2 cu ft safe would fit the bill, but I don't really have any real storage perspective for metals. I've never owned a safe before.  The 2 cu ft safes tend to be around 150 lbs, the low 1.x cu ft safes tend to be around 70 lbs, which is much more ideal from a moving perspective, but not sure how soon I'd possibly outgrow that.  Again, I lack that personal metal-storing-in-a-safe perspective.  For those using safes, what size are you using and how many ounces do you think you can store?  Any model numbers are greatly welcomed for googling.            So I'm thinking of investing in some silver bullion as part of some diversification and have some dumb questions I'd appreciate any feedback on. Perhaps eventually add some other precious metals, but would just be starting with silver.  This is a local shop to me, http://www.ajpm.com/silver-bullion.html one thing I really like about them is they post the sell/buy prices so it's a little more illuminating from a financial aspect.  According to http://www.monex.com/prods/silver_chart.html silver is at 19.71 as I type this. That local shop has prices of (bull/sell prices and I'm doing some rounding for the difference):  * American Eagle 21.22/23.32 (difference of $2) * Maple Leafs 20.22/22.82 (difference of $2.5) * 1oz silver rounds 19.97/21.07 (difference of $1) * 10oz silver bar 197.50/210.50 (difference of $13)  First off, are these buy/sell prices pretty normal from a percentage standpoint regardless of the spot price?    Second, why would I want to buy anything other than 1oz silver rounds? With a $1 buy/sell difference (at least today), that seems like the obvious choice.  Again, total noob here, any input is appreciated.               https://www.motifinvesting.com/  If so, for how long and how's it going? Any gotchas? How do taxes work?    https://www.motifinvesting.com/  If so, for how long and how's it going?  Any gotchas?                 Noticed this game pre-order promo on my Steam client.  Did a youtube search, [found this game play demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVlE8BXEbpE).  Looks absolutely epic, there was [mention in another game play demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wNiiQpDPJE) video of 50 hours main story line, 50 hours open world.  Are the previous Witcher's worth picking up? I don't think I've heard of this series, though I'm not a big gamer. I'm a big fan of Skyrim, which this looks a lot like.   I'm looking to buy some raw land and I've come across some for sale that has a patented mine claim.  My understanding is that means you own the mineral rights as well as the land.  I'm not so much interested in the mineral rights, though it'd be cool to have them.  I'm more interested in the land having timber and a year round creek as I want to pursue micro hydro.  From some googling, it looks like the claim is for surface gold.  It also looks to be abandoned. Also looks to be yearly maintenance fees for the claim in my state, around $150.  The property tax on the land (from the listing) seems higher than I would have thought, given it's location.  Is this because of the mine claim?  Anyone have any experience with patented mine claims and any thoughts and/or gotchas you can think of?                                          These are the guys who did the first fold-up porch and interior stairs that I've seen in a tiny house.

Note the urls where all the links in the emails go (lower left of screenshots).  Also had an ebay email come in a re: a password reset (which I did along with paypal when the ebay hack story broke) less than 2 hours before the two paypal emails.  Kinda "fishy", but there are no links in the ebay email, so seems somewhat legit/harmless.  Funny thing is, when I go log into ebay, there is no password change email waiting for me in my inbox/messages.  There is a "password update"  at the very top utility nav but one would think they'd also send an internal email to user's inbox.                         Looking for cheap PC steam games to check out so I seek out sage advice.  What are some of yesterday's/yesteryear's biggest titles available on steam that can be picked up for cheap nowadays? Really interested in the games you can play over a long period of time as I tend to focus on playing one game for months at a time.  I'm a big fan of the more adventure type of games but I'm not a huge gamer so I'm out of the loop as to what is out there.  Big bonus points for those more "epic" games, like Skyrim which you can play for literally months and months and months. I'm actually still playing it, lol.  Online play, with a somewhat active community would be awesome as well.  As an example, I played DayZ (pre-alpher) pretty much non-stop for easily a year.  That was a great game once the big bugs were resolved.  Still haven't picked up the alpher, wasn't that impressed with game play/streams.  May pick it up down the road, dunno.  I'm on PC/Windoze 7.      We're migrating one of our old/large websites into a CMS and I'm trying to find the easiest way to automatically scrape every page and extract the html of a constant DOM node.  For example, let's assume this standard page markup:      div id="masthead"logo and masthead crap/div      div id="leftnav"left nav items/div          **I want to extract all the markup within this "content" div, all the div's child nodes**     div id="content"         h1page header/h1         pbody copy/p     /div     **end of div I want to extract**      div id="sidebar"promos 'n shit/div      /div id="footer"almighty copyright/div  I want to be able to feed it a list of urls (which I don't think will be terribly hard to generate) and end up with separate .txt files with the extracted html.  So assuming I have the following urls:  * http://www.mydomain.com/index.html * http://www.mydomain.com/contact.html * http://www.mydomain.com/about/index.html * http://www.mydomain.com/products/catalog.html * http://www.mydomain.com/foo/bar/baz.html * etc.  I would end up with the following .txt files:  * http://www.mydomain.com/index.txt * http://www.mydomain.com/contact.txt * http://www.mydomain.com/about/index.txt * http://www.mydomain.com/products/catalog.txt * http://www.mydomain.com/foo/bar/baz.txt * etc.  The urls I feed it essentially become the names of text files for that 1-1 mapping thing. The contents of those .txt files would be the markup within the div id="content"/div for that file name/url.  What's the easiest way to automate something like this?  We have hundreds of files.  Node and PHP would be viable options for me.  I'm on Windows 7.

Wondering if anyone here has read this and what your thoughts are.                  Hi all,  **Edit: Great answers, guys, pretty much told me all I need to know. Thank you!**  First, if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to, please let me know where you think it should go.  I'm wondering what issues/considerations there are in upgrading to a 4k monitor for PC gaming.  Amazon has a [39" Seiki Digital for $500](http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-Digital-SE39UY04-39-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00DOPGO2G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1397142217 sr=8-1 keywords=seiki+39+4k).  I had a custom PC built just over 2 years ago, checked the invoice to see exactly what video card I have (which I would imagine would be the primary consideration?), which is:  * Sapphire Radeon HD6950 2G 100312-3SR  I can't say I have any performance complaints with the games I've played.  I'm not really a hardware guy, so I don't really know much about this kind of stuff. I had a local shop do the build and I think they did a great job with the specs and price.  Figured I'd post this question here as I'm sure there are tons of really knowledgeable folks who have possibly already gone down this road.                     Let's pretend we have the following scenario.  We have a widget, it could be any widget, but let's just say it's a zip code widget where the user enters their zip code and they're served up custom content based on that zip code. Within this widget they can edit their zip code or clear it.  They get some basic validation/feedback on input entry as well.  For example, an error message if they don't enter 5 digits (just think like really basic form validation).  The key to the widget here is it's interactive.  How would you guys go about unit testing this widget in the most automated fashion?  Now let's say we want test that widget in a more integrated/end-to-end manner.  So let's say you want to test firing up the site/app, enter a valid zip code, possibly check to see if the right content is displayed (assume there would be some hook in place for this, like a id that equals the zip entered), navigate somewhere else, maybe navigate again somewhere else.  How would you guys go about testing this flow in the most automated fashion?  Also assume the scenario is you're integrating testing after the site/app is built and launched.  What are you guys doing to ensure some semblance of code correctness as you maintain sites/apps?         This is coming down the pipe for me and I'm sure our marketing department is going to have many "creative" ideas for how they want it to look.  I'm trying to gather some urls that have a google custom search integrated so I can check them out to see what sort of patterns tend to be in place.  This way I can share this info with marketing and in theory, the whole design/dev process should go smoothly?  If any of you guys have implemented a google custom search (the paid version, not the free version), I'd love it if you could share some urls.  And/or just your experience with integrating it into an existing custom site.                                       Anyone know of a web based tool like http://geopeeker.com/fetch/?url=www.yahoo.com which allows you to test how a site looks based on geolocation lat/long coordinates you provide?  I'm looking for something where you enter a site url and then enter some lat/long coords you want to test.  In particular, I'm looking for a testing tool for non-savvy folks.  I know about chrome's emulate geolocation coords within dev tools.         I commute on a train 2 hours every weekday and I read during the ride.  I just downloaded [White Noise Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmsoft.whitenoise.lite) but the audio shuts off when I switch to my reader app.  Basically I'm trying to drown out train environmental noise by listening to white noise.  What's the easiest way I can do this? I want my audio app (which may change in the future), when playing, to be minimized so as not to obscure my reading app.  Ideally, it's not a ton of taps/swipes to get everything open/playing, either.  Do I need a multitasking app?  If so, any recommendations?

I'm looking to do some interior work on my condo (built in 2000) and would like some opinions from a realtor/selling point-of-view.  I have the original interior paint (white and off-white/eggshell) and original carpet (still in good shape, but showing some wear) but I'm wanting to repaint the interior and either put in new carpet or some type of laminate flooring (that looks like hardwood).  I have pergo in my kitchen and just love the low maintenance and looks.  What are your thoughts on color schemes for interior paint?  If you have any photographic examples of more safe color schemes you'd recommend, that'd be awesome.  What I mean by "safe" color schemes are those from a selling point-of-view.  I don't want to have to repaint when it comes time to sell (which is not in the immediate future).  What are your thoughts on doing some type of laminate -vs- just re-carpeting everything? I'm thinking of laminate everywhere except the bedroom, which I would re-carpet.  Any and all input is greatly appreciated!                                                                             	200
 I live in VB... ;/   I try to time my flush so when I finish peeing, it's right as the water flushes down.   Hasn't aged a day   But I don't want to be seas and stars, I just wanna live forever and with the way medicine and technology have been progressing..   Best advice, pay the $400-500 and make sure you're protected.   Some of those people are the most successful. I felt bad for one family. The house was 100k under 3 other similar listings (exact model condominiums) and we went in uncertain about what was wrong with the unit.. NOTHING, it was the agent. It took a week to get a hold of the agent, he had 30 listings, the key didn't work, had to wait another week to get in, had to schedule around tenants through the tenants. When we ratified a contract on the place, the next day I received an email from a closing coordinator, never talked to the agent ever again. I thought to myself this is a family that is 100k under the next listing, probably extremely motivated, and they think what a horrible market. The same week, another condominium sold for 505k (the one we purchased was 320k)   My name gives away my profession. Biggest shock to me is the range of people in the business. You have very professional, intelligent, hardworking Realtors and you have some people who really don't give a shit. The surprising thing is some of these bad agents are really successful. I'm working a deal right now where I have the clients calling me on a nightly basis because they can't get a hold of their agent. We we're supposed to meet on Tuesday morning at 9:30 am and he just never showed, texted me at 11:30 am to tell me his daughter was sick.... more likely slept in.   I hope I'll never be like this but I'm a relatively new agent so I treat all my clients like kings and queens right now! haha   I'm a Realtor with Rose and Womble. I just checked REIN (MLS search engine for Realtors) there's quite a few options out there (29 when I just searched). Shoot me a PM if you want.   My dad's birthday was on the 2nd, he passed away on his birthday a year ago. It sucks man but you just have to treasure the time you had with him.   Never too early to start talking but be ready for a lot of questions. They'll want to know zoning, any common facilities (water, sewage, etc)   Don't put your eggs all in one basket. Try to get as many builders over there as possible. The more people you can get over there, the more panic you'll create amongst them. Depending on how sought after the area is.   But it never hurts to get the ball rolling. Some builders will tell you to get back to them when it's ready, and you should. Others will want to start negotiating immediately and that's even better because you can use pending of the subdivision to give you time to evaluate all possible avenues you can take.    Haha picked up a new client today, it's coming along!!! Plus I'm at office now but I mean don't get me wrong I sneak a peak on reddit while I'm taking a poo    I'm a Realtor that works with a builder and we specifically look for homes that need to be torn down or empty lots.   You said it's appraised at around that value, what's that exact value?    How long have you been on the market?    No problem, if you have anymore questions you can contact me- just shoot me a PM. If your a self motivator you'll do great. I was the same way, at the office at 6 AM and even though I was in more of a foreman role, I was always helping whether running equipment or having a shovel in my hand. So when I came over here I immediately transitioned to being in the office everyday at 9:00 am and I can say that 2 of my clients came to me because nobody else was in the office and we had a walk in. One of which equated to my first exclusive sale, hence the birth of my post. Good luck   * He's right, each brokerage works differently. A lot of the Franchise brokerages will offer more up front percentage cuts but will be loaded with Franchise fees. An example is my friend works for a large franchise and her cut is 70% but every transaction has a 'regional fee' of 7% and another office fee of 2%. I chose a local firm that's number one in business in my area, the initial percentage is lower at 57% but I chose this firm for three reasons; I have family in the firm, your percentage increases stay with you for the life of your time with the firm, and there's nothing extra taken out.   * On the second half of your comment, I love this career, but I love socializing and being around people. I worked for the bridge division of a construction company and was a project manager working 60 hours a week. I can promise you, I work way more in real estate. It's an extremely demanding job and it requires a lot of money up front (around $2500 with Realtor dues if you take that route) and that's not counting the probably 3 months it will take you to get leads turned to clients turned to sales/listings. I'm in my 6th month and I have 3 listings I'm splitting 50/50, 3 closings (2 exclusive, one 50/50), and a handful of leads I'm working on turning into clients. You have to keep working open houses to keep the leads flowing in. You have to work your ass off during the week to translate the leads to clients. I'm working 7 days a week but the old adage if you enjoy what you do, you won't feel like you're working. Well I love what I do and I don't mind the time. If you wanna know anymore information let me know. Sorry if some of this is incomprehensible, just had a minute and figured I'd shoot you a response!  * I forgot to mention, very successful Realtors can get up to 90% cuts. Doing around 5 million in transactions will get you 80-85% in my office, so it's nothing unobtainable.   No you're exactly right. My grandmother is a Realtor as well. She's extremely successful in the business and drives a brand new Buick Enclave with every feature (Bose, leather, navi etc) When I take clients out I use her vehicle but it's also awkward because I have people ask me if it's my vehicle. I've used every excuse under the sun, no- vehicles having breaks, oil, detailed, blah blah. A lot of times I have had no choice but to use the Ranger and I can tell a real difference in the body language of my clients or prospective clients.   Not to drag this out but I read that it may be better to go through a credit union instead of the dealership? And thank you for the response.   I have a few problems. I own (no money owed) a 2000 off road Ford Ranger with 149,000 miles.   * I'm a new Realtor in Virginia and I've quickly realized I need a new vehicle. I've been a Realtor for 6 months and my truck has been giving me a lot of issues plus not being very friendly on gas.  * I have fairly bad credit, a job that includes no guaranteed pay, and rent/utilities that cost me around $950 a month. I have my first 6 months of rent paid off already (from a previous closing I split with another agent) I have the Ford Ranger to trade in/sell (my guess is 3-4k value) and I have around $12,000 cash.   * I would really like to purchase a used car for 10-14k, in a perfect world I could trade in my Ranger and put another 2-3k down and then have the car financed for an extremely long period (72 months would be preferable) but with the option to pay it off whenever. This would protect me from running low on cash in an unpredictable career but also be able to pay a few thousand every time I had a closing.   * Is this type of deal possible, would a car dealership be willing to work with me on something like this?   I'm in the Hampton Roads area but I'm on it! Stupid office duty right now. Being a broker, any good advice? CRM Referral Maker or any of that stuff work? Thank you   Norfolk Botanical Gardens is great. Another great spot (mind you in Virginia Beach) is Bayville Park.    Well to be fair, we're a smaller office. I think we did 20 sales/listings last month in an office of about 15 active agents. But I have noticed this month has started off slow.    http://i.imgur.com/lt4xeiM.jpg   ..Well played Sue   I did not know this, why I post on here about real estate related stuff. So how could you get a master list of what's available in your area? A perfect example is a condo I know is foreclosed on in a condominium I have a listing.   That's awesome, I remember when I was at PA. I would be at a football game and all of a sudden the rumor was PHARELL IS COMING IN A HELICOPTER AT HALF TIME!!! 4 years of this kind of stuff, never saw him once! Glad to see him back.   I'm not trying to deter you. I can't see the house and it may make sense. The only thing I would say beware of, is I work with a group of builders that typically tear down but occasionally flip homes as well. So I've seen a lot of older homes that have had this process done and they try so hard to make an extra room and it just looks terribly tacky/off. One room was divided and it made both rooms look like walk in closets. I've also seen rooms created that didn't make floor plan sense, bedroom between living room and kitchen. That probably doesn't apply to your loft but just my two cents.    This really isn't much help but if Bank of America owns the property, it should be listed on various listing services (MLS, Realtor.com, Zillow, Trulia etc)   I'm clearly biased but I would look for a Realtor that specializes in REO's and have them look into it for you. The listing side pays commission so it wouldn't cost you anything.   AND YOU RANKED CHESAPEAKE THE THIRD MOST BORING CITY, HOW DARE YOU!   Realtor from Va here, I would never recommend anybody to use Quicken Loans. Typically if you have a local loan officer it's much more personal. After pre-qualification, communication is the most critical part.    Good luck though,  I know it's got to be tough bouncing place to place.   Looks like a good time, I missed Harbor Fest this year.    Moobs is completely correct. I'm a Realtor in Virginia Beach. It's strange he did not disclose to you the difference between unrepresented and represented parties. Basically this protects the broker/agent from doing all the work and then you deciding to purchase without a broker/agent. If you like the Realtor and think he will do a good job, I would sign the sheet. But I would definitely demand he fill in the sheet first and walk you through the differences of being a customer or a client.    	31
 So he's not much different from anyone else on Reddit.  	1
 I think about good times I've had in the past (memories of friends, family, and other happy moments). Aside from that I look forward into the future and imagine myself in 2-3 years and how different I would be if I kept a positivite outlook on life.    Good question. I've had a fear of the dark and a fear of heights since I was a little boy. 16 years later I still have the same fears...   Kaga Koko Puffs   I couldn't agree with you more! I also do wish more people would watch this anime and see how much of a masterpiece it truly is. One of my favorite Shounen animes out there.   My personal favorite is King but I also like Ban too.    Yes!! I love the fight between Meliodas and Ban! I think we will meet Gowther (Sin of Lust) next episode.   I dont recognize the bottom two but the very first picture is Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai.   I started watching it 2 days ago and I'M IN LOVE WITH IT. The plot gives me an Akame Ga Kill vibe and I'm starting to like it more than AGK.    I got nothing. Barakamon is literally the embodiment of the perfect slice of life and comedy anime. Also,  NARU KOTOISHI IS TOO DAMN CUTE   Nanatsu no Taizai (Seven Deadly Sins)   Oh? The Seven Deadly Sins. But shouldn't Escanor know that they weren't the ones who killed Zaratras because they did find his dead body.   Interesting, never really thought Escanor could be a future antagonist. Can you tell me what NNT stands for? Sorry, I'm not really familiar with all the abbreviations yet.   Just started watching Seven Deadly Sins yesterday and I'm fully caught up in the anime. I love it so far! However, after browsing through the wiki I found that there was one member of the Seven Deadly Sins that wasn't introduced yet in the anime or the manga - Escanor. Where do you think he is and when do you think he'll appear in the manga or in the anime?   What server do you play on? If it's Alexina feel free to add me, xsoulstealx!   Plot twist: It's actually a guy's butt   Wise words said by the one and only alphapussy.   Rainbow Nisha is one of my favorite anime's I've ever seen. The plot, the theme, music all blended really nicely. Wasn't a big fan of the animation but I looked past that. Rainbow was the first anime in a while that really impacted me when I finished watching it. All the struggles that the boys went through during prison and after really depicts the problems people face today. In the end it also, despite sounding cliche, shows us the importance of friendship. I agree with you about how the show is underrated. Wish more people would know about this hidden gem.    LIESSSS!!! I loved Code Geass R2 wayy more than the first season. I felt that everything picked up and they took the plot to a whole new level. There were so many more twists in R2.    I'd have to agree   MY SAME EXACT THOUGHTS!!!    Love triangle became a love hexagon after the time skip lol   I finished it back in spring of last year. It was amazing!!! I was surprised that no one really heard of Nagi Asu beforehand. I recommended it to a friend and she loved it.    I agree with your list except for Aldnoah.Zero. I didn't really hear much from that anime and I heard it was good but it didn't really seem all that popular compared with the rest. I also forgot to mention that Akame ga Kill was pretty hyped too   I think No Game No Life was pretty hyped up this year. It was a good show, fairly decent plot, and entertaining, but was it as good as people made it out to be? No. It didn't deserve all the attention it received. I know SEVERAL people will probably hate me for saying that but if you disagree, which 2014 anime do you think was more hyped?   Yeah I could imagine that the first half of senior year is pretty stressful but after you get accepted into one of the colleges that you applied to, wouldn't the rest of senior year be pretty relaxed? Sure you still have to attempt to maintain your grades and what not but other than that you don't have to worry about SAT's and stuff.   Wow! You're one of the few people I know who actually have a plan on what they're gonna do in college. I still haven't fully decided. At the moment, I could swing either way or maybe even major in something completely different. For the most part I haven't really thought much about college as I'm still caught in the midst of SAT's and trying to maintain my GPA. The amount of stress in Junior year is ridiculous.   I was in a similar predicament back in February this year. I had a female friend that I slowly developed a crush on. During a party I saw another one of my guy friends touching her (ass + boobs) and cuddling with her. I immediately felt angry and jealous. The next few weeks after the party was complete shit as my anger was eating me alive. Eventually I got used to them and I moved on. It still hurts once in a while but definitely not as much as it was before. You'll be fine dude, my advice would be to distract yourself by finding pleasure in your hobbies. Only time can heal a broken heart.   Nice! I'm actually debating whether or not to pursue Biomedical Engineering or do something in Business. If I could be accepted into NYU Stern that'd be great!   Not normally. I've been in several matches where people lynched someone just because they didn't like their name or something stupid like that. Technically this could be a reason but is it a legitimate motive? No. The voters also generally follow the majority so if someone starts to vote for somebody everyone else would usually follow. This might not happen in every match but it is a common pattern.   You could argue for it both ways. Pretty much on Day 2 there is rarely any hard evidence that proves someone to be Mafia, SK, or any evil role so as a result people act like idiots and decide to vote for a random person. Sure every lynch serves a purpose but what makes it a random lynch is when people have no proof or have a reasonable explanation on why they want to lynch them.    This is probably one of the most inspirational things I've read in a while. I know for a fact that a common issue most teens face is identity. We're stuck in between childhood and adulthood and many of us are confused and struggling to find our own purpose in life. Not to mention the fact that teachers and parents only seem to add more stress that isn't needed. Your story does a great job in showing these challenges  but what's more amazing is how you managed to turn your life around rather then drowning in your own sorrow. Great story and message. Thanks for posting this!   Good point. :)   Nice! I love reading stories like these, it's so interesting! This actually reminds me of one of my matches when I was playing as Godfather in All Any. It was day 3 when all my other mafia members died (consort and consigliere). It was only me left in the game because the SK left the game on Night 1. The town was feeling pretty good since there was only 1 mafia remaining so I could sense that they weren't in any hurry and pretty much thought they had the game in the bag. I dont remember all of the details but somehow I managed to deceive the 11 townies and somehow won the game by myself on Day 8. The chat after they found out i was the last Mafia was hilarious!   This is a cool concept but I feel like having a ranking system wouldn't be fair for some players. Random lynches happen pretty much in every match and even if you do have a pretty good understanding of the game, ToS is very dependent on the cooperation of other players. Not to mention the fact that there are trolls and idiots who play too. Ultimately having a ranking system probably wouldn't turn out very well. Even if they do incorporate it then it wouldn't be fair for everyone.   I like your hair      Theguyhiding. I'm fairly new at this game so I'm not that great yet. I think I have a pretty good grasp on the basics, I just don't know any other complex strategies.    DAMN! Add me on steam: theguyhiding.

Last night was the first time I've ever played anything in the whole Civlization franchise. I did the tutorial but I'm still confused at what I'm supposed to be doing early game. Does someone want to do multiplayer with me and help walk me through some stuff? Thank you!  Edit: I live on the east coast and I can play normally from 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM and from 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM   Same here I have two research papers due at the end of this winter break. I also have a lot of other schoolwork and SATs to prepare for. So far I haven't completed a single thing but w/e   16/M Yes, I do watch porn because it relieves me of stress I agree with others about porn getting boring. Thats why I watch more hentai. HENTAI FTW I do have some female friends who watch porn too because we share our porn and hentai lol idk if thats normal   That sucks and I didn't get anything last Christmas either. I know that feel    Wow dude that's really depressing and horrible. I wish your family the best of luck next year though    Thanks for letting me know! I'll ask my sister if she wants to link it to my Steam account. Merry Christmas to you too!   Pretty lousy, Got Civilization 5 on Steam but it's on my sister's account so I can't really play it too frequently and some chocolate cookies.    I didn't get anything all that extraodinary. This year I only really got two presents. One was from my older sister, she suppossedly brought me Civilization 5 on Steam but it's on her Steam account so I can't really play it. I also got a a few chocolate cookies from my mom as my second present. Pretty lousy Christmas if you ask me but it's better than some of the previous years. Christmas 2010 I got a pencil sharperner from my mom AND dad. I'm being serious. Then I go back from break every year and my friends and classmates ask me what I got for "Christmas" and I just tell them that my family doesn't celebrate it. Remember guys if you think you received lame presents hopefully this story will make you feel better about yourself.  Edit: Thanks for posting guys! It's nice to see what you guys got this year and it made me feel more grateful about the stuff I've received this year and in the past.      	56

 *Do You Think I'm Saxon?*     Mother of God...   It still has yet to release most markets outside the U.S.   Nope. Still Marvel Studios productions.   That's what the glitched memories are intentionally called, yeah.   If I'm not mistaken, Jak X came out in 2005, so that fits as well. I have heard that they were working on Uncharted since *during* Jak 3's development.   X-Men: First Class had a great score.   [Frankenstein's Monster](http://youtu.be/6oIUOqK_er8) from X-Men: First Class is iconic for that film.   I mean, everyone eventually dies. He was a pirate. It's kind of inevitable.   I agree with this so hard. Vidic's monologues were fantastic.   That's not what I meant.   Which one?   Still, a director should know how basic comedic timing for a comedy works. The Earth segment at the beginning is faithful on paper, but in tone it's completely different.   I think it was directed with terrible comedic timing. Every line had no room to breathe. It's like they were in a rush to get through all of the jokes, some of which lacked their brilliant set-up from the book; punchlines aren't a joke.   She's hardly in it.

"Netflix rhymes with wet chicks" was only one of many moments that prove Sandler is only in it for the money these days.   In that sense, I'm glad they showed it. It was bloody amazing. I'd still expect at least one controlled set piece in the game like the cargo plane. It's what the series is known for.   I'm just kinda glad they didn't spoil any big action set pieces (like the train and the cargo plane from 2   3). I know some people wanted that, but I'd really rather experience it myself.   And that's my only gripe, which is pretty good for Rogue.   Saleswise, prob not well, but as a sequel to Black Flag it's pretty good.

[Here's the latest news, from February.](http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/02/10/director-jaume-collet-serra-says-live-action-akira-still-a-go) Read the last paragraph of the interview. It's a bit racist.      Plus, Oldboy the movie is Korean, based on a Japanese manga. The American remake is based on this film.

The first song I heard after finishing DT was *Ass Back Home* by Travis McCoy. I'll always associate it with DT despite it being totally tonally different from it.   I hate the Aaron Paul suggestion for this same reason. He's way too old. He'll be 40 by the time the film is even announced, if ever. Because of this, any fan casting for Eddie Dean is probably not going to work out.      Speaking of actors meeting with producers for movies, Maisie Williams met with Sam Raimi and Neil Druckmann about The Last of Us. She's 17, and the movie hasn't been greenlit. Ellie is supposed to be 14.      The leaders of both projects are just trying to show executives and studio heads that big actors are interested in their film. Aaron Paul for Eddie and Maisie Williams for Ellie are both way too old.   Christopher Lee would be my pick.   The Room thumbnail...   Only female character in The Hobbit besides Galadriel.

It's hardly about the French Revolution, Arno is clearly the executive notes for Ezio 2.0 and the best character, Elise, is underused and ultimately undermined by the story itself in the most insulting way possible. What the modern day story has become is too depressing to mention when thinking of the potential and the heights of what has come before. Ubi developed AC Rogue for fans and AC Unity for sales. It was developed from executive notes and not any one person's vision. What the hell happened?   Massive step back from MW. I'd rather that one was on PS4.

But then how else would horny 10 year old me have gotten into the show?   Exploration in ME1 is optional, but enjoyable for some. The planets are rather barren, so you might not/probably won't enjoy it as much.     Scale, though, is a different story. You do feel like you're exploring an entire galaxy, and it feels amazing. The exploration from ME1 is scaled back, but the atmosphere retains a feeling of being bloody massive.     Edit - TL:DR In terms of atmospheric scale, they *feel* big; bigger than the games actually are.       (Just saying: if you only played 3, you haven't experienced the game's full potential.

(Edit: better link)   Make sure to have Extended Cut installed and over 3100 Readiness!   That struck me as a lazy way to make sure it didn't break co-op.   Best way possible? Considering what we've had before, this is hardly the best way possible. We've never been given the chance to experience the best possible modern day story.   It synced Freedom Cry the other day, but it hasn't yet realised that I've 100%'d it. It also believes that even though I've completed the story for AC Revelations, I've got 0% sync. It doesn't realise that I have 100% on AC2 or have even played Rogue. My multiplayer levels for Brotherhood and Revelations are only accounting for one of my PSN accounts, rather than the original levels I synced my Uplay account with - both over level 20. It's screwed.     Bonuses won't matter when I've moved on to another game. It will have been too long when they finally fix it. You had your chance Ubi.   This looks hilariously uncomfortable.   It's only a couple of them, though. I'll get enough for Veterans and Endurance.   Some of the Abstergo Challenges are bugged to zero progress, when I've definitely performed these actions many times.   Infamous First Light - 1 day, 29 *seconds* (no hours of minutes).     [Here's my account](http://psnprofiles.com/train_subject4565).   Don't forget he left Lost altogether after one episode.   Probably because they can't show off any good cinematography from it. It'd look pretty out of place.   2001 was not technically *based* on a book. Clarke and Kubrick collaborated. Clarke admits parts of the book were adapted from independent changes to their draft in the film.     But, yeah, 2010 was absolutely based on Clarke's book.   There are ways to make it interesting for longer. I just think it really drags on and it doesn't need to.   Bishop. She's just a new character. Possibly Erudito, but it's never stated.   *Me and my Battle Tits.*   You're on /r/PS4, so...   Like KDramaStars and Master Herald, massive click bait sites.   *My name is ASAC Ellie, and you can go fuck yourself.*   And SR2 at the bottom.   *This explains...so much.*   So they're apologising for the shitty release by giving us free DLC?! Great save, Ubisoft. First step towards redemption.   This comments section is cancer. Good post, OP.   For me, it gets quite repetitive after an hour and a half. Even on hardcore, it's too easy if you're good at the gunplay. And [spoiler](#s "Nyreen dies?! Why? We haven't known her for very long. It's not impactful. It takes away importance from what was an intriguing character.")     Also, Illusive Man Lite aka Generic Russian General was quite a weak villain. He plays bloody chess and makes chess metaphors. Clich, much?     Overall, the story felt like it was thrown together to justify spending time developing concepts for an Omega level before removing it from the original story.   I'm not a Batman fan, but Inception is a great rewatch with mates just for the awesome action.   I can't watch Memento again, but The Prestige is better every time.   People who did hate Desmond were too outspoken.   On their Twitch channel, I'd think.   It certainly spoiled *my* first viewing of the film, but who knows how I'll react on second watch? I still love The Prestige and Inception; they're probably both top ten favourites for me. Memento is pretty solid too. Sucks how disappointed I was in this movie, but I'm glad to see others liking it.   In the extended patch notes, they list "UNSPENT SYNC POINTS NOTIFICATION APPEARING TOO OFTEN". We did it, guys!   Yet people accuse us of lying, saying there's no possible way you could have guessed.     I think it doesn't reflect on the movie well if people who are versed in its genre can guess what the ending is going to be, 20 minutes in.   It's not like they're even the reason for the movie's failure. If the leak was good, buzz would have spread.   Anyone who's read 2010: Odyssey Two would guess this pretty quickly, because Bowman/Star-Child does the exact same thing to his wife.   Dude...Revelations!   Aside from all of the great Breaking Bad episodes and servicable GoT episodes, she directed [last season's Walking Dead finale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNzgDgdmRK4). I feel like they've taken a ton of cues from how she handled that episode.    Someone should tweet this to Raimi and Druckmann. They've already met with a fan-suggested actress, so we know they're open to public opinion.   I know, I'm a motherfucking mastermind!   GUESS WHAT? YOU HAVE A NEW RIDDLE! HOLD THE MAP BUTTON TO READ IT, or just read the clue on screen after this pop-up disappears LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO.   Mediafire might be better for *public* sharing, or Mega.co.nz   Now watch [**THIS**](http://youtu.be/kH0P-CA7ntE). It's meant to be viewed post-finale.   What was the controversy? Ralph from The Dharmalars was on Jay and Jack's 10th Anniversary Rewatch about a month or so ago, and they were reminiscing about how great Scott  amp; Steve were. If you were willing, you could share the episodes on Google Drive possibly. The other guys and I would be grateful.   Not very far into Unity, but the new map is a bit painful to use. What do you guys think?   Different? He didn't sound at all like the cowardly mess from the glyphs in Brotherhood and II. Anyone else think this is strange?     Off topic: Wasn't John "John from IT" Standish aka The Sage a little too similar to Revelations' portrayal of Clay?      EDIT: Was going to put "INB4 Lost, Mass Effect and The Dark Tower" to avoid repeats.     Remember to put "and why"!   This is a VERY strange question.     When I first read it, I interpreted the beach to be on the right of them as they progressed. When I was halfway through the book the second time through, I was furious when I figured out it was the other way around.     All of the evidence points toward the beach being on their left - to the west.     How did you picture it?   For my second playthrough of Mass Effect 1, I decided to play on Hardcore on a new profile (yeah, that's pretty stupid for a relative newcomer) as a class I had never played before - Vanguard. I f***ing hate Benezia. I have died for literally two hours in total. I did go back to an earlier save to complete the Hot Labs, which I'd bypassed, to gain a level. Once I went down to Casual and still died, but this time because I put in less effort. I restarted my checkpoint and was reverted back to Hardcore. I ended up persevering on Hardcore and have nearly beat the bitch. Since I never changed the difficulty on that one save, will I still get the trophy?  Plus, any tips for the final part of that boss fight for a level 18 Vanguard on Hardcore?  	102
 Three minutes later and the kee kee would have a treat and bring it to your feet. It's hard to reward your cat for being a faithful provider when it comes to cute little animals. But such is nature. But I'm glad you saved the lil' guy.   Creepy yes. But I'm guessing rural area, deer bait, posed (Sweet ass creepy alien doll) and trail cam. I love this shiez! Upvote!   Wow! This brings back some fond memories. Sat rite next to this one http://www.rubylane.com/item/756627-BWx20x7ex201610/1981-Scary-Stories-To-Tell   I love how street view is old timey.    Anyone notice this guys hands are extremely large in accordance with his body size? He could choke a bitch!    Bitcoin has to work! It's time to be truly free everybody.   Ha! This made me laugh.    I am 31, our first isp was Prodigy. We had a 14.4 external dial up modem on our 64 mb hd, IBM 386 . When we first logged on I noticed there was a game button on the sweet 16 bit windows 3.1, 12" brilliant 32 color display CRT monitor. Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, the rest is history. Thanks for the memory... Prodigy, I'm getting all nostalgic. But I agree, Bitcoin is here to stay because it is the next big thing. Happy mining.   Its /r/wtf because "WTF!?! how did he do that!"   Looks like a painting.   Oh hellz yeah! I loved these things, and who remembers they didn't skimp on the Puddin'. They filled the whole delicious pie crust cavity with the mutagen ooze.   Good for you brother! Keep it up.   We hit 87.70 folks! I am the proud owner of some damn spending money in BTC now.    Amen brother!   If you squint, it's an Orca Tie-fighter!

But thanks for putting me in my place.   5th painting is really cool, I dig that Sharon Osbourne wears Converse.    I myself was introduced by a friend very early on about Bitcoin, back when you could mine one BTC in a pool every 2-4 days, unfortunately for me I stopped at 9.35 BTC about 2 years ago. I have updated my wallet and am now worth 437 US dollars :) I will sit on them for some time and watch my 12 dollars spent in electricity grow.   Yes, I have done this between 3 different PC's. Or you can find your wallet.dat file and drop it in several thumb drives like I do just to be safe. But I have a few more Bitcoins. Happy Mining :)   So I guess her name is "Philipina" ...clap..clap...... Ok I'll leave :/   I mined Bitcoin late 2010 early 2011, I got up to 9.35 BTC then stopped :/. I recently heard a bunch of stuff about it and Found out I have 456 US dollars worth. I'm going to sit on them for awhile, I hear good things.      Will Smith's older brother....... Maybe.......

Yeah, I see the little guy next to the bench on the lower left of the screen, looking at the camera.    Its Sylvester Stallone.   I got him when I was 12, I will miss him very much :(      BOOBS :)   ET phone home.   Happened to me...

 [A Touch of Cloth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Touch_of_Cloth), biting satire of British procedurals (and American). It was created by Charlie Brooker who worked with Chris Morris on Nathan Barley. Chris Morris played Denholm Reynholm from IT Crowd. I could go on, but I have to poo.   I am very much looking forward to Russo and Dinosaur's next project.   yep, and she's hilarious               my best friend raz has one in his car but i don't trust it               omfg subscribed and upvoted all the posts thank you   ha ha! awesome! i will be bummed if mckenzie doesn't make it through the rest of the season.

You're right: waaaaay too many moments.

 i rather it not have multiplayer.   thats sweet i love Army of two   my grandfather bought a Playstation 2 at a yardsale and found this game. i use to play it so much that when i remembered it i looked it up. My friend owns a gamestore and found it, i bought it off of him for 7 dollars   I know right i love dominion       My boss did that in 3 months. I remember when he lost the one challenge like 25 times in a row he almost threw a controller at a customer   I know that feel i did it with a truck and my friend kept walking over my care and using it as a personal bridge. What system are you playing on         I mean like a song that is not on a soundtrack. But i love 117 too.   Do you mind if i use this as my background i put it on and IT IS PERFECT. great drawing by the way you should do more or record yourself and post it. Id like to see what other stuff you can draw.    What song that is not a fan made song do you halo fans think fits halo 4 the best. I love halo but i just can't find the perfect song to listen to at the midnight release. Suggestions 7 MORE DAYS   The one thing i hate is that i went on the song Back in Black and the comments are spammed by cod fans. Saying people only know this song because of CoD.   thanks I was wondering why he already won a prize.   when i was a kid my brother really liked WWE. I watched it all the time with him. I first memory was of stone cold steve austin getting thrown off a bridge. I had a VHS tape about stone cold steve austin that i watched everyday. Good memories...WWE is the one way i will remember my great grandfather and grandfather. We would watch it every week together.   Im waiting to watch it because you get it on a dvd with the limited edition But u am really tempted to watch it.      Nice!!!   Great song   I think they should add so that if you kill a spartan while you're the flood, then the spartan will convert on the spot doing like an animation of pain and after a couple of seconds he'll be up and ready to infect some more. Of course the other survivors will be able to kill the spartan while he is in the transformation and stop him from turning. He will then get a medal and the infected will just respawn somewhere else.   I love Rage   Who got limited edition i think it's totally worth it   Its just not in its prime any more is what he is saying   Im on episode 168 of original series. I havent watched naruto for a long time so i wanted to start the original series first. Are the fillers worth watching i feel as if ill miss something   Do you have Xbox   i have money just need a game to hold me over till Halo 4 because i paid halo 4 off. I loved the first one but just wasn't sure if i wanted it.   Slayer is amazing my friends always make fun of me for all the slayer shirts i wear   SLAYER FUCK YEA  	28
 I buy crappy, $8 knock-off-Toms shoes from a pharmacy I work next to and they work better than any other brand I've ever had, including Sketchers.  Of course every four months or so they completely fall apart, but then I just have to spend $8 versus $40 like I did when I bought Sketches (that also fell apart after four months).   I work in a store with carpet, though, so it might be a little different.   I've had so many bad ones (including some guy LITERALLY screaming in my face until I cried because his computer wasn't ready; I was a cashier at the time), but I'll pick a good one.  I was out to dinner next door to my store after work, just by myself, and the waiter came up to me and said that the couple across the restaurant wanted to pay for my meal. They were regular customers and hugged me and said how great I was. I will honestly never forget that.   Your managers are dumb. Fighting with those people is one of my favorite things, I'd never give in to them. MAYBE on Staples coupons just to avoid a complaint, but never on manufacturers.    I got an 2 TB external hard drive for $19 once (usually $90). Also a bunch of 8gb flash drives for .50 each. And a book case for $8.   There's a desk in our warehouse, usually $100, now $9 that I might grab.    I've been the full-time team supervisor since the position rolled out.  I like the position, tbh. I am consistently running around, probably doing the jobs of two people, and getting paid way too little. BUT, if I hated it, I wouldn't be there. My associates like me as a manager because I've never gone on ~power trips. BUT, my first part-time counterpart DID and everyone hated him. And I think that's probably common because normal people with lots of manager experience and a good work ethic don't really want to work for 11-12 dollars an hour.   As a whole, I think the position is a good idea at some stores (like mine, tier 4, 12-13 employees). At higher volume stores with more employees, I think eliminating the assistant position for two team supervisors is a stupid idea. It's just not enough.    I'm not in Seattle but I'm in the same district and... I wouldn't count on it.      Not at my store, surprisingly.   I'm sorry, that's really dumb. It sounds horrible.    Yeah, unfortunately as a full time Team Supervisor, you HAVE TO have open availability. I'm pretty sure it's listed as a requirement in the qualifications. :(  I think it's different for other positions because (at least at my store) the full time team supervisor is more integral than any other position.    Yep. Super annoying. I stopped handing them out, unless it's for one of those customers that takes like 30 seconds to gather their stuff.   When there's three entries, AND THEN the $30 off $90 or $10 off $50 it feels like an eternity. Earlier I had to move to another register while it was printing. Ridiculous.   One time I had a customer who loaded up her entire cart with desk accessories, notebooks, pens, just random stuff. It ended up being around $400 and 10 bags of stuff. When she went to pay she was like "wait, this is Office Depot, right?" And I was like "...no, this is Staples" and she freaked out and said "I'M ONLY AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE FROM OFFICE DEPOT! I THOUGHT THIS WAS OFFICE DEPOT!"  All I could do was shake my head. And put all of her stuff back.   Yep. Whenever a customer says "Hey you should really change that! Let your higher ups know!" I always say "You'd have better luck than me! Call this number!" and I hand them the presidents line card.    32 cent raise.    I only get points from my GM, and I won some random contest for being recognized and got 20 points.  The CPC people at my store are drowning in points, it's ridiculous. I was talking to one guy and he was like "yeah I think I only have 450 right now".  I have 130 and I've never used any. But being a Team Supervisor doesn't really give me the opportunity to earn a lot -- I don't sell tech and I probably ring up 50 people a week.   	13
 Cyman: They're quite oppressive. We are each partnered with agents during missions, though we typically go in solo depending on the situation. We're monitored 24/7 with no contact to the outside world, including social media or any contact with those of us who have remaining family. So, to answer your question, they're quite effective at keeping their collar around our necks and make us do their bidding.   BB: Superhero is a general term. As for being heroes, I guess it depends on your perspective of the situation.  Lumen: We save peoples' lives. Not all of those who are like us are the good guys, dude.   Shell: And who says we're the good guys, Lumen?  Cyman: Guys, relax. We do hunt and detain those like us. It's a fact, but we also have a secret agenda. We stay in contact with those who haven't been warped by their abilities and still retained a moral compass while staying in DC (Detainment Center), and they are putting together a movement to help overcome the government oppression.   Lumen: I already suggested it. Shell punched me in the arm - I couldn't use it for a week.   Cyman: US.   Cyman: We were brought together by a secretive department of the government. As more homo-superiors sprouted, they realized they needed as task force capable of going in, stopping the threat, and bringing it in.  Lumen: We all met after each of us went through a series of tests. We've been together ever since.  Cyman: We've been told that there won't be any need to add new members, but there's a Beta team.   Lumen: Things are heating up here. More and more Superiors are popping up and coming out the woodwork, so we needed a secondary team to help out.   Aggie: I've heard there's even a similar team in India. I thought about asking to be transferred, but I figured there would be problems with International relations if I was sent to another country with all the American Intelligence I have encountered.   My codename is Lumen. I'm the youngest of the crew, and I came up with all our codenames. I have the ability to project blasts of light, become invisible, create illusions, and shoot an intense laser ray (though it leaves me completely weak unless I absorb more like from the Sun). I'm comic relief, even if my jokes are bad. I'm also good at creating distractions. Feel free to ask us anything! ***  I'm Cyman (I didn't choose the codename, as Lumen already stated). I can calculate probabilities in my head faster than any computer or technological advance in the world, but it has overheated my brain, leaving me half human and half robot, of sorts. I have a cooling system routed along my back and over my bald head (reminiscent of subdermal body mods) which runs on a battery pack attached to my belt. I do not sleep due to the constant calculations in my head, so I focus by playing the drums. The chair I sit in helps charge the battery pack at my belt. Due to my ability, I lead the team of five and make gameplans almost on the fly. ***  I'm Shell. Not all that original when you consider my given name, but whatever. I'm a former detective that worked in one of the most dangerous metropolitan areas in the world. Unfortunately, due to my bad temper, and my freakish ability to withstand practically all forms of punishment, I was forced to quit and given a spot on the team. My skin is incredibly hard and numb, making it difficult for anyone to hurt or cause me pain. So I'm the bodyguard. There. I'm done. ***  Good day. I'm Aggie, short for not only my God-given name, but for my codename given to me by Lumen: Aggregator. I'm originally from Bangladesh, India, but I moved to the US in hopes of continuing my education in neurology focusing in the olfactory senses. I have the unique ability to create various types of pheromones that produce a number of different results: attract, focus, dispel, and even put to sleep. Unfortunately, I have an intense sense of smell and it makes it difficult living in today's society filled with intense scents. Excuse me but someone walked in reeking of Stetson. * blegh * ***  Lumen calls me BB, short for Blood Brother. As a former medical student, I have the ability to control blood cells. This ability allows me to heal and even cause pain, though I try not to unless the situation is dire. I've even used my ability to release endorphines and adrenaline in the bodies of my teammates to give them a super boost. I prefer to stay on the sidelines, but I'm deeply devoted to these guys as they're the only family I have left.

He held the older man close as they both lied next to each other on the bed. Poor Jordie, he always preferred older men and he finally found himself the perfect man: forty-year-old Ritchie Dorn.  Ritchie, a graphic designer at a small downtown marketing firm, met Jordie when the late-twenty-something worked briefly at the firm answering phones and running errands. He remembered disliking the round, pudgy young man right away. He was loud, obnoxious, yearned for attention, and he always talked. It made things difficult to concentrate at work. It was upon Ritchie's suggestion to the owner, Mr. Benewith, that Jordie be let go. He thought that would be the last he'd see of the annoying little brat.  He stared at Jordie who snuggled into the space between his neck and shoulder, eyes closed, feigning sleep. His bloodshot green eyes bulged as he wished he could loosen his hands and free himself of this torture.  "You'll never leave," Jordie said, as if reading the other man's mind. He opened his walnut-shaped blue eyes and his sweet nature turned sour. "I know you dislike me. But I like you and you have no choice but to enjoy your time with me. Because this is it, Ritchie. This is your end. Your last moments will be spent with me before I finally put you out of your misery."  Jordie got up from the mattress and stood at the end of the bed, over Ritchie as he continued speaking: "Trust me. I know I'm no picnic to spend with, but I'm a good person... well, I try to be. I'm not near as bad as you think, really. I promise to make it as enjoyable within my means." His eyes focused on Ritchie's. "But I'm getting what I want out of this." He gripped the golden-tinted bedframe as his mind spaced while feelings of abandonment filled him. "I'm tired of being alone."  "I know," Ritchie said. "I've been lonely too-"  Jordie banged his fist against the frame, causing the rounded pipe at the top to bend in. "SHUT UP. Don't do that. Don't try to empathize with me. You're not being released. You're not going to be given freedom. This is my time, my gift to me. Nothing you say will change my mind. So just accept your fate, Mr. Dorn. Because from today to the end of your life, you're mine."   Uplifting that he got a job and people were so kind to him. Unfortunate that he's working for a company that chooses to use its money against US citizens who deserve to be treated equally.   Everyone keeps saying Sushi Train but it's never fresh. It doesn't taste great. It's sub-par but cheap.   I prefer Tokyo Sushi at 71st and Garnett near Fox   Hound and Mexico Lindo. Typically quiet. Service can be slow if crowded, but that's only happened twice. They have $25 unlimited sushi, but it isn't a buffet.  You get a menu which pretty much has all the rolls you can think of, including stir fry, fried rice, lo mein, and hibachi options. There's salads, appetizers, and deserts on the menu also. It's all made fresh to order. I've never had a bad experience and I've gone about 10-15 times in the past 3 years since I moved back from Ohio.  I never tried anywhere else, so I'm not saying there aren't other good places. But $25 unlimited food just cannot be beat when it's made fresh as you order with quality ingredients. At first, the hostess comes off a little cold and impersonal, but she's just focused on her job. One day, I sat down and spoke with her for about an hour because she wanted help in finding online option for english-speaking programs to help her sons learn English (I had been watching Netflix). I told her about Netflix and all the options, including the PBS children's programming that had a lot of edutainment shows. She also knows I bring a lot of people in and has been incredibly considerate to me.  So that's my story. It seems like people get really defensive about their sushi restaurants here. To each their own.   The past month-and-a-half I've been trying to keep everything together. I'm 27, living with my gambling parents for the past 3 years while dealing with my own gambling problem and depression. I've lost my best friend due to gambling (and her own personal problems), lost many jobs due to not being able to pull myself out of the deep emotional shit hole I'm in, and I'm ready to literally take my vehicle and wrap it around the nearest telephone pole if things don't start calming down.  My 19-year-old niece and her fiancee have moved in with us into a tiny two bedroom house. They're sleeping in the dining room we've converted into a faux-bedroom for the time being. I do not like my niece's fiancee because he's 22, shows immense jealousy over the stupidest shit, and he finds things to tattle about on people which just isn't helping the situation. I helped get the two of them a job at my work and he starts next week while my niece starts in 2 weeks. Sadly, this means very little money for anything, including the gas I'm using to transport them back and forth once work starts for them. And my parents refuse to help.  My parents originally made somewhere between $30-32/hr until my mom lost her job. She refuses to look for another job and is waiting for unemployment to come in. When I didn't have a job, she expected the house to stay clean. Now that she's unemployed, she just uses my niece and her fiancee to keep everything clean. She also has a ton of personal and check loans at various companies and with family members. My father owes my great-aunt $7000. The two of them blame me for living with them for the past 3 years for the reason they are in debt even though the bills haven't gone up since I lived there. There were times they didn't buy any groceries because they said it would motivate me to keep a job. It did not because it only fueled my depression to the point where I would take a prescribed sleeping pill, sleep, wake up and take another sleeping pill, and sleep. I ate a tablespoon of peanut butter a day and a few crackers in order to stay alive for about 2 weeks until they finally got tired of not having any food in the house and started buying them again.  I'm not a victim. I'm really not. I should be able to keep a job, and I should move out of my parents' house. I never had them pay for anything of mine (gas, car insurance, or telephone bill). I have tons of debt from various accounts being shut off due to nonpayment. My parents have turned things on in my name as well and they decided not to pay them because I never paid any rent. This was during periods when I didn't have a job and they promised to pay the bills. I will never turn anything on again unless it's for me and I know I have the money.  This past month-and-a-half I've been doing really well with my gambling habit. I haven't gone; I've been seeing a therapist that focuses on gambling; and I've self-banned at the area casinos. All my money has gone towards my personal bills, getting caught up where I can, and food for five in the house.  Last night, my niece told me she didn't want to move out with me any longer despite working towards that since she moved in. It was going to be so easy to move out together, the three of us. Now, I have to adjust my priorities and try to save and get out on just my own which will be difficult since I don't make much money. Then, I was notified that my two nephews (20 and 16) keep coming over to eat dinner despite my 20 year old nephew making more money than all of us and their mother (whom they live with) recently winning $7000. I asked them via text to please stop coming over to eat at our house until we can get back on our feet, unless they bring food to help cover themselves. Normally, I wouldn't care, but providing for two weeks of food for five people when nobody else is helping cover these expenses has been a huge stress as my mom keeps telling me I need to move out.   My mother tells me this morning that my father will not have me telling anyone they cannot eat at "their house". He's sticking up for my 20 year old nephew who does actually help my parents a lot with a lot of physical stuff around the house. He also lets my dad borrow his game systems and stuff to play games. So I get this idea of standing up for my nephew, but my younger nephew is a thief (he's stolen my dad's PS3 before, including my Motorola RAZR MAXX) and I work evenings during dinnertime. I am not there to keep an eye and making sure nothing is taken. And again, I'm the one footing the bill. But my parents don't see it that way. It's "their house" and it's "their rules". Fine. Then, I'll take "my food" and I'll eat "my food" and nobody else can touch "my food".   I used to pay rent every week when I worked at 18-22 years old until my parents became gamblers. Now, my money will not go towards their gambling habit. They'll have extra money while I pay the bills to help fund their addiction, and I'm not having it. I am fighting my own addiction. My money is no longer going to the casino or helping anyone else fund their trips to the casino.  Am I being incredibly unfair? I don't expect my parents to help, but I do need help. I have nowhere else to go or turn to until I can get out on my own. And I'm not going to rush out and get a place just because they're tired of having people in their space. I didn't invite my niece and her fiancee to stay with us; my mother did. I want to move out right and make sure I don't have to come back. Is that really so much to ask?   What's that thing on your neck?   At 14, I got a pimple on my neck and I popped it, but a small lump stayed behind. As I grew in size, with a 330 lbs body, my fat face hid the thing on my neck pretty well. Then, I lost thirty pounds and my face became a lot slimmer and it's more visible. Everyone asks about the lump.  It's probably a cyst or something odd. I don't have insurance, haven't had insurance, but I am planning on visiting the doctor after my 90-days and I get benefits from my company. But it's annoying having to explain that this disgusting, weird tumor on the side of my neck is actually a disgusting, weird tumor-like lump thanks to not properly popping it at 14-years-old.   I apologize if I made any assumptions based on anything you wrote. I may have jumped into it too excitedly. If you still do not mind, let me go ahead and respond.  Killian - Maybe it was how I worded it, but I thought I got the gist of what you were saying. I was agreeing that his transformation didn't work, but I was trying to make the argument that it isn't much of stretch for a narcisstic, selfish guy to become a bad guy. Somehow, we, as the audience, accepted it easily, but people had issues with Killian becoming a bad guy because he's mostly being a bad guy for narcisstic, selfish reasons. Thanks to "All Hail the King", we learn that the REAL Mandarin is out there, and I would say he's the actually schemer at the Nexus of Terrorism. Killian was merely a filler as the bad guy in IM3, and that's sad. The writers focused on Ben Kingsley's Mandarin, but they used him merely as a front. So, I agree with your comment, but again I was able to look past the villain's background and purpose to enjoy the action of the movie.  Tony   Pepper - As I said before, the writer didn't focus on the relationship aspects in the story. Is it really a stretch for a couple to argue over these kinds of things? No. But it wasn't written well.  PTSD - I'm not an expert either, but an adrenaline focus due to his partner being kidnapped may allow him temporary control over his psychological well-being. So it isn't much of a stretch that along with learning how to cope during his time with the kid that he may have temporary control of when his PTSD hits. Of course they're using the PTSD as a gimmick, and it isn't all that realistic, but it makes the character human and this film has been dealing a lot with Tony dealing with his humanity. Are we watching an action movie hoping they are being realistic with their psychology? Further, Tony is a genius. He may be able to wrap his mind around the issue and push past it, but he needed someone to put a metaphorical mirror to his face (the kid did that). As for the end of the movie, it was a montage so we're not exactly sure how long it's been and whether he's truly okay or not. The after-credits scene shows Stark using Banner as a therapist, so he may still be suffering from PTSD.  Extremis - Totally understand. I agree.   The Suits - I did accidentally miss the main point you were hitting in your original comment. But I do agree with you about how easy it was to destroy the suits. However, I will say that these suits may have been more prototypes than actual suits he would use to fight against a bad guy in a one-on-one fight.  Mandarin - Okay, I get what you're saying now. I didn't get "what's the problem?" from Slattery when Tony confronts him. He's just saying, "How could I not take such an incredible job?" He knows he's scum of the earth, but he wasn't respected. Now, he is, though it's less as an actor and more as a terrorist. At least, that's how I took it.  Pepper's Death - She's shown how fiery (metaphorically) she can be. She has to be to deal with Tony, after all. Sure, she tends to have control, but she just fell to her death after being kidnapped by a dude she never liked in the first place. As well as tortured since she was injected with Extremis. So I can see her going off and using her newfound abilities.   Again, I was able to suspend my disbelief, but you were not. It's understandable.       I hope you do not mind me commenting and making a few of my own observations based on what you provided.  Killian- He is technically a bizarro Stark. Why is it okay for Stark, a selfish, narcissistic guy, to become a superhero but not for Killian, a selfish, narcissistic guy, to become a villain? It's because Stark charms us. Killian unfortunately doesn't have the same rapport with the audience and I feel other things were focused on (his infatuation with Pepper) than actually having an interesting reason to go against Tony (other than he knows how to fix Extremis).   Tony   Pepper - We're out of the Honeymoon phase, folks. Things happened in IM2 and The Avengers which left the two characters in very different places. We had a brief glimpse of CEO Pepper in IM2 and The Avengers, but she's much busier. Tony, obviously, is dealing with PTSD and feeling human for once. He doesn't want to be around Pepper in such a vulnerable time. If memory serves, Pepper mentions him being away a lot, keeping busy on building suits. So the two already have a divide. Tony can't sleep, and that likely may be the only time the two spend together since Pepper's become so busy. Lastly, I think the writer just merely didn't focus heavily on their relationship, as it only becomes crucial when Pepper almost dies during the house being blown up or when she's kidnapped and injected with Extremis.  The PTSD - I honestly don't think he's completely over it. He's just learned how to cope better. Plus, he had a bit of a big situation on his hands: Pepper's kidnapped and he has a bad guy to find. At the time, it was Mandarin/Ben Kingsley. Then, it became Killian/Mandarin.  Extremis - I honestly thought it made the human characters quite disposable. Sure, it doesn't make too much sense, but the inventor does explain in the beginning of the movie how Extremis has a bizarre side effect she doesn't understand. Tony left her a quasi-cure where he was on the right track but not enough time to finish. There's a few things the script leaves completely blank as they wanted to focus more on action than say science. But Tony does obviously find a way to save Pepper.  The Suits - Tony built all those suits in hopes of finding the one perfect suit to make him immortal. As I referenced before, the events in New York left him feeling incredibly human, something he hasn't experienced before both as Iron Man or prior to becoming a superhero. Sure, Iron Man 1 did touch on it, but he still had an extreme focus and self-assuredness to help build the very first suit in the cave. In IM3, we have a very unsure Tony who has questioned whether he deserves to be a part of the Post-Avengers superhero world. At the end, he realizes that he doesn't need all the suits and he also realizes how his technology can get away from him and be used for evil, as shown in IM2. So he destroys them. It's Tony realizing it isn't the suit that makes him Iron Man, or the arc reactor. It's the MAN.  Mandarin - I was let down briefly that Ben Kingsley turned out to play an actor rather than a real terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises already showed us what happens when terrorism hits close to home on a huge level. I preferred not going over the same material. Sure, it was a letdown, but the comic version of the character does use many fronts to hide his identity. In reference to your question about Kingsley being surprised, I think it's more that he's had guards surrounding him 24/7 since he started this role. He didn't expect Tony with MacGuyver tools and a glock in his face. He expected Iron Man with pulsers to blow his head off. I'd be surprised too to see some random billionaire/genius/playboy/philanthropist pop up out of nowhere as I was having fun with two people in bed in the middle of the day with a gun in my face. Wouldn't you?  Pepper's Death - Phony? Yes. Cheap? A little. But did it make me love the character more? Fuck yes. Pepper always had some fire to her. In the comics, she becomes Rescue (an Iron Woman, if you will), so it isn't completely unheard of for her to become a complete and total badass. Extremis obviously has some side effects in making people super strong, agile, superhuman, so again it isn't much of a reach to see Pepper jump up out of nowhere and do some pretty insane flips and shit. Also, it's just pretty and makes for a great scene.   Summary: You have valid points. I disagree with how severe they are, and I'm able to suspend my disbelief, but you weren't and that's okay. To each their own.     Today, I merely wanted to sleep in a little longer than normal. It was a mere fifteen minutes, just a quarter of an hour of not really sleeping (as my alarm had gone off) and more just lying in bed enjoying the warmness wrapped in my blankets as the sun shines in my bedroom window. I took the fifteen minutes, but this meant I needed to hurry it up: eat food, make lunch, take shower, and drive to work. However, I also have to worry about my 20-year-old nephew who lives and works with me.   He takes forever gathering his things before getting into the car. We now only have 20 minutes to get to work, where we're still new and in training. It also happens to be our 3rd time being late meaning we would get a write-up. So I choose to speed.   I'm at my exit and ready to get off, but I'm pulled over by a highway patrolman. He gives me a ticket for $175, but he did help out by reducing how fast I was originally going. I was going 76 in a 65 and he put me down as 74. So I appreciate that, but I still haven't gotten paid in my new job.  Let's not mention my gambling addiction; my gambling parents demanding I give them money as soon as I get paid; the fact that my passenger window won't roll up today because the motor died; a new phone bill I have due on my first paycheck; car insurance; my car actually dying on me while driving; or the fact that I feel completely alone and nobody in my corner on my side.  	15
 hahaha loving this, and the "should we give other people some?" and then not doing it, i mean come on man, those guys probably know a bit of English    yep you could say he is, its a show that likes stirring up discussions. They are standing at a building where inside they are talking about the whole discussion, and the people outside are there to support the anti-zwarte piet cause. But maybe it helps to know that some people would freak out just by seeing the pink mic because of their reputation. The people that are anti-zwarte piet are already assuming that he is going to ask weird questions to get cheap laughs.    To see what it does to people. This happened at an anti-zwarte piet event.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejy9Uy5E2WI   Well not really, there is a huge discussion going on in the Netherlands about this tradition. This video is made so we (people in the Netherlands) can see how people from a different country react to a tradition thats so normal to us Dutchies. I guess you can say that some people from the Netherlands will find it "intolerant" to say 'Zwarte Piet' is racism. But nevertheless its very refreshing to see the pure shocked and angry reactions to the blackface and the other portrayals of 'Zwarte Piet'. (Black Pete)   Well, i'm Dutch, and as you can see in the video, its fair to call us idiots...   Goosebumps    I'm always surprised at how smart that guy seems to be...          Dutch talkshow sidekick shows a sketch of a guy who threw his baby in a thrashcan...       Hey Daniel, thank you so much for doing this AMA. Been a HP fan for as long as i can remember and you've portrayed him perfectly as i had envisioned him reading the books. My question: I can understand that you and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson grew very close during the filming of all the movies, but what was your first impression of Rupert and Emma?    Lets hope so, Zeeland deserves an Eredivisie/Jupiler League club of their own :)    Well the same thing is happening in de Achterhoek, all the young people are leaving for the 'big city' but still there are a lot of Graafschap and Vitesse supporters. Its just weird that there has never developed at least a Jupiler League worthy club which people could root for.    Always found that weird, there must be SOME sponsors who could fund a club in Zeeland. It is interesting to see which clubs are supported over there instead.    Great work from Tubantia.nl/voetbalkaart   zijn alle 3 niet echt upcoming toch? Tuneboy is al een veteraan joh, haha.   haha stugge boeren uut de achterhoek, bedankt voor het antwoord :)   Hey Pieter, thank you for doing the AMA, i really enjoyed your set at Defqon, looking forward to the album!!  question number 1: i always admire that you have a lot of contact with the community/your fans, why is it so important for you to stay close to your fans?  2: what was the most epic gig you've played?  3: is there ever going to be a collab with Degos   Re-done? i've seen you guys together on stage, and i always thought it was a shame that you guys haven't been in the studio together (as far as i know)  again, thanks for doing this AMA, keep up the good work :D   	19
       No, unfortunately they only lasted a year. I remembered these in middle school and how I begged my mom to buy them though.

I cringe every time I see Tejada, which is nearly every game, and starting for that matter! I forgot about Benitez, he was pretty bad.    Who else would like to see up here? I definitely cannot stand Tejada this year. I know it is way too early to DFA him and experts would bash this move as a bad way of running a franchise. But at what point would you think 'hmm, this guy's season isn't going to turn around'? He is bad on offense, bad on defense (he seems worse at short than 3B), and is a constant letdown with runners in scoring position. At $6 million for this one year, I would say he ranks as one of the worst in franchise history. Off the top of my head, the only other horrible signing I remember would be Alfonzo. Thoughts? Discuss.  	26

We should get them bronzed"      hehe, he looks like eagle man   awwwwwwwwwww x x x    haha she was called the "little mermaid"   "Unda da sea"      no no come to England. :D party with us   That has made my day, Loved it, so so so so so much!! well done man!     what in the hell is that?!   might I suggest this:  http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/diy-mosquito-killing-device-11-01-2010/   I looked down at my five dollars and saw the Doctory goodness and just had to make it!       Totally adorable!    Im really not familiar with "grades" in America, can someone please tell me how old someone in 9th grade is?  Also, I had a teacher like this in secondary school from year 7 to 9 ish and he was such a racist to this kid (only muslim in class) and it was practically to his face. I guess the kid learnt to just ignore it but because it was our teacher everyone in class was so conflicted. The worst thing about it was that he was our Religeous Education teacher who actually studied to teach history so he was constantly pissed at something.   Thats awesome!    :D x           	27
 These fields are close enough that it seems fairly natural of a progression of interests. I wouldn't worry about coming off as flakey.   Still, as far as I can tell, society has become more accepting of stem cell research, or possibly it just got old for their short attention spans.   Jenny is the worst. Fuck her.   So after reading this my guess is that there's a miscommunication. A quick google search suggests that "phanton traffic jams" really refers to are traffic jams with no obvious cause such as an accident or construction. I can see how someone would interpret that as "really is no reason for it [the traffic jam]" (my "chaos"), while you interpret that differently. I don't thinks there's actually a conflict here. The one thing I will criticize is that your first sentence seems to misconstrue shockwave as a cause of jams (which it can't, no one's saying that is the case) vs as the reason why they persist, though I don't think you mean to.   I don't think these explanations are mutually exclusive. The theory of traffic jam as waves requires that the rate of cars entering the back of the shockwave is greater than the rate at which cars leave at the front of the shockwave. Entering is a function of how many people are traveling and increases with number, while leaving is basically a constant, since cars only ever reach and accelerate so fast. If the former is greater than the latter, the shockwave persists, until it gets late enough that cars aren't entering faster than they are exiting. However, if there's no traffic jam, none of the above applies, there's no shockwave to speak of (at least, not yet)--if we all kept it smooth, we'd all get home faster. However, driving is chaotic, and all it takes to trigger the shockwave is someone suddenly breaking. (It's kind've like how water will superboil if there's no nucleation site to trigger a boil). If there are enough people traveling, the shockwave will start to grow; if there aren't, it won't form in the first place. It's a threshold.  That said, maybe you live in like NYC or some other absurdly over dense place where the number of cars entering is completely beyond the maximum flow rate possible by human drivers, in which case it would be oversaturated.   ? Ocean waves are destroyed because they hit a boundary and dissipate. There are no front and back boundaries on a high way; traffic jam waves propagate backwards at a slow rate and are only destroyed because eventually the rate of cars coming into the jam drops below a certain threshold.   Yup, hunter gatherer cultures are far more egalitarian and while they may have status it's not tied to property. There's no need to write things down when you have oral traditions, no real concept of property, and when you know everyone in your small community. There's no desire to lug around written things when you move around so much and everything you need to know about the wider world is encoded in oral traditions. Writing seems very much a invention that grew out of settlements and the rise of the elite status, who until recently were the sole writers and readers. My hypothesis (which I admit I have not looked into the literature on this) is that writing was invented for accounting (ledgers) with the rise of status, property, and trade, and soon evolved into law (written code of ethics) and scholarly traditions (engineering, philosophy, literature etc). It may in part be related to older clay and drawn artforms.   I like this answer, there's no set career track for a (socio-cultural) anthropology major, it's the ability to understand people through their perspective and be able to interpret and communicate another person's experiences that is very valuable. The kind of critical multi-dimensional thinking that comes with anthropological coursework helps deconstruct preconceptions underlying barriers to understanding between peoples. To add to your list, such a mindset can be useful as a medical practitioner in the third-world or who works with immigrant communities (e.g. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down is a great book on the barriers between medical practitioners and the Hmong diaspora community who had very different mindset on health and illness), in the military to build rapport and understanding with local communities, and I've seen articles about corporate anthropologists who provide insight into the relationships between their types of products and consumers in a changing world. I think it can be very useful when combined with other skill sets and internship/professional experiences.   There are plenty of recent papers on the Hadza, just one example.   I think within a few hundred years, science will advance far enough that we can use computational tools to beat pathogens faster than they could evolve naturally, to the point that while we may still get new infections (as the diversity of microbes on Earth is incredible), even new pathogens will be rapidly treatable, and there will be very little suffering and death. Our tools will allow us to stay far far ahead of pathogens, while they remain forever limited by the "cost of natural selection"--basically, we automate the evolutionary arms race to our machines without incurring the cost ourselves. The only problem is that that same technology will allow a similar pace of biowarfare (artificial pathogens).   Hunter gatherer cultures who lack writing can be quite organized, in an egalitarian sense. Oral tradition is perfectly fine means of sharing knowledge. Non-verbal artwork also.  My guess is that writing had more to do with the rise of private property and governmental/social hierarchies due to settlement resulting in a need for a means of keeping records, ledgers, coded ethics and the like, leading eventually to ancient scholarship. Writing was lik  I don't know anything about this presumed overpopulation. Pre-settlement peoples did not have overpopulation problems; hunter gatherers are population regulated by both social (marital practices, abortion, infanticide) and biological (lactational amenorrhea) factors.   Agricultural diets were not necessarily any better than hunter gather diets (which btw still exist, and don't suffer mental issues). Sedentary farming diets are don't have a lot of variety and risk crop failure, leading to malnourishment. We can see cycles of plenty and not in the bone remains of agriculturalists. Hunter gatherers in contrast are better at hedging and migrating in times of need, and are actually more efficient in food labors. The transition is often due to social (status, property) and population factors (the need to intensify food production).   Reschedule the second school.   The online thing has various reasons, and not insignificantly is the unique demographic and changing relationship between older viewers and content w.r.t. to where they prefer to watch shows, potentially scheduling conflicts, misunderstandings, who knows; whatever the reasons (plural) it's probably more complicated than can be inferred from outside.  Merch I'll give you.  I don't understand why you're implying Korra was cancelled. It was never cancelled. It was always planned to be a 52 episode show ever since around 2012 sometime during book 1 production. Your last two sentences are not relevant to Korra at all.   Ice, Fire, Candy, and Slime.   Science fantasy. Whatever it is, I bet it'll have huge worldbuilding potential, the creativity and realism they inject in to their settings sets them apart from any other western animation.   I don't think that's a problem. There's less incentive for Nick to run the franchise into the ground. That said, *what is your source that Avatar was not profitable*. I call bullshit, you're just guessing.  Also, it's been almost two months since the finale. Can we please just let this rest, these kinds of comments have become a recurring circle jerk.   The chances of another series happening was very low. I think the best we can reasonably hope for is that they'll let someone else do Korra comics like they did for ATLA.   That's rough buddy.   You should go to Captain Seaweeds. I'll buy you a (terrible) drink.    Could this hurt me when trying to work/apply to a synbio grad program?  No, the opposite.   Do I hold out for Job #2 (not a sure thing), where I can work on something I am very interested in  Scale that about the 50% of the time you'll be working on what sounds like not very interesting tech work, is the work *you'll* actually be doing really more interesting than job 1?   Gene drives   The premise of the question is flawed: there's no a priori reason to assume that religion persists due to a evolutionary advantage for the individual. It persists through social, cultural, political, and economic forces. There are however arguments for and against the analogy that religion acts as a cultural virus--it persists not because it confers a fitness advantage to the host, but because it itself is very good at persisting in the population; this is Dawkins "virus of the mind". Criticisms of this cite studies showing that religious people are often happier, e.g. the Amish seem fairly content in their communities. I personally think the two arent mutually exclusive, religion, depending on context and strain can be both pathogenic and mutualistic, depending on the kinds of behaviors it confers as shaped by environmental contexts. At the same time this view understates the use of religion as a political and social weapon, or the vast abilities of the human mind to overinterpret patterns in the world where there may be none, or the inherent biases of people towards the in-group and the need to feel like they belong and not like an outcast.   Nope   Bryan said they used a lot more cgi models in Korra, and that they were very hard yo work on, but he seemed quite satisfied with how they turned put.   I assume it was lin. Unfortunately, I got a very blurry photo of it, so hence "iirc".   No...   Sure, I think it's very important to ask whether the MA is worth the investment; that said, I don't know enoug about this particular person or field of interest to comment on that.   Sabbatical potentially. Or worse-case (and this is good reason why OP should confirm) the POI is actually not there anymore or is planning on not being there at some point.   Is the job good enough that it would advance your career/give you valuable experience/look good if you were to reapply for grad school next year? The potential fellowships I guess complicate things.   Obviously, you need to check your smoke detectors to see if their batteries aren't dead.   For PhD, definitely. But most Masters's aren't funded.   Well, we got some volcanos.   Dropbox sync + External HDD every month or so.   Better than wishing you had backup to data.   People who hold doors open for you when you're not even close to the door yet. I know you're being nice, but now you have to wait, and I have to speed up, and it's inconvenient for the both of us.  People who put their luggage into overhead compartments on planes in the wrong way. We could all sit down faster if we didn't have to rotate every third piece of luggage to recover more storage space.  People waiting for elevators or trains who try to get on before the people can get off. You have to wait for the person to get off anyways, why delay their day and your own by making it harder for them to get out.   That's rough buddy.   Bryan Konietzko ended up showing about 420 slides (his count) of artwork from all four books. (Phil Rynda who worked on Bill and Mandy, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and The Lego Movie followed and was also awesome). Most of it was stuff we've already seen in art books, his blog, and at Cons.  Early Lin concept with helmet (iirc). Early Mako variation with ponytail (iirc). Early concept of the work in the book 1 art book where Korra beats up some metalbender cops on the rooftops of republic city. Early Wan concept with a very different look (beard, no spiky hair) and very different cat deer.  Reiterated what we already knew, that they had overseas production problems on Book 2, and thought it was unfortunate that a lot of the great artwork made for Book 2 didn't translate to screen, but that such is what happens in tv animation. Book 3 went a lot better.  Perspective, lighting, perspective, color, perspective. A lot of wonderful bg paintings and expression sheets.   A lot of the characters were hard for the animators because of how realistic the designs were, a lot of that due to Joaquim (e.g. Tenzin, Bumi, Unalaq, Earth Queen). Minghua was based on a friend (design, not personality).  Bryan jokingly said he regretted that the characters in ATLA had such big heads, thus why The Legend of Korra had a more realistic design. He also joked that it would have been much easier to do both series in the style of Beginnings, despite how unique the style was for those episodes, it was still easier to draw than the rest of Korra (particularly the bg paintings). Compared Beginnings to doing a mini-movie in the middle of the book, though actually it was one of the first things they started working on for book 2.  Some great artwork from book 4 that I hope will be in the book 4 art book. The one that I remember most clearly were some early Prince Wu concepts--he looked VERY different btw, and NOT in a good way (kinda ugly and douchebag looking imo), the final version is much better. Hopefully it will be in the book 4 art book for you all to see =P.    could this element be bended(bent?)  That's essentially what Korra did in the finales of book 2 and 4.   That's kinda unfair, she learns the ability to see remotely, and that she that her energybending powers is basically limitless.  I will admit I am disappointed we didn't get to see the fire nation, but it's whatever.   Dude. Not the time. (But yes).   Auto-commuter self-driving car service, only $99/m, brought to you by Comcast; upgrade to high-speed for only $1009/m more.   But then why was their autism before vaccinations? Check mate.   Shiek omelette.   *WHO STOLE THE COOKIE FROM THE COOKIE JAR?*         Cried myself to sleep at age 8 for many nights. Realized that 10% of my life was over, and that before I knew it, it would be only 10% left. Not really sure why it doesn't affect me anymore.   Shower thought: Dragons.         Rewatching ATLA, I'm struck by how Toph plays a very unique role in Team Avatar. There's no denying, she's one of the strongest benders in either series, invaluable against large enemies and other feats of large-scale bending. Her presence significantly upped the scale of the threats the gaang could face. That also means she has some of the fewest 1v1 matches in the franchise: the Boulder (easy win), Aang (loss), Katara (mud fight, draw), and Bumi in the comics (draw) (edit: and Korra in the swamp (easy win), and Aang again in The Rift, which IIRC was a draw (?)).  She's actually one of the most situationally dependent fighters in the franchise. Take a look at her element matchups. Against earthbenders, she's godly, her innate affinity with the element gives her a hard advantage in the matchup, to the point that only Bumi is a real match. Airbenders, however, are a soft counter, with their ability to keep off the ground. The waterbender matchup is always gonna be the most situation dependent, it depends heavily on the availability of earth and water--in both her 1v1s, it's a mud environment. That said, her airbender 1v1s or waterbender 1v1s could be said to be no more than sparring matches, and she has no 1v1 firebender matches. Speculatively, firebenders keep rooted stances, and Toph defeats Fire Nation soldiers quite easily. Against a master, it's unclear if a master firebender could avoid the same fate, and take advantage of Toph's considerable weaknesses. And she has quite a few weaknesses: she can't swim, she's vulnerable if her feet are burned, and we have no idea how well she can take a physical hit that isn't earth--pretty much everyone else gets hit hard enough at some point to get thrown around (often by Toph), but we don't know how Toph (especially as a 12 year old) would take a heavy hit. I'm guessing chi-blockers could also have an advantage over her. Her portrayal as a fighter is completely different from every other character in either franchise, all of whom at some point face an intense duel. Instead, Toph uniquely specializes in large-scale epic combat. (That said, my comments are mostly about Toph in ATLA, there's less to go on about how Toph was as a metalbending cop, which is a very different style, which brings up the question of whether the metalbender cops we see the series, with their wire acrobatics and airships was something that was only introduced by Lin).   I'm interested in opinions and works on how people with utilitarian positions actually apply utilitarianism to the real-world given the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of the consequences of choices. To my limited understanding, when I think of utilitarianism, I think of thought experiments like the trolley problem, but my main criticism with such thought experiments is that they are ideal well-defined problems with definite outcomes. Disregarding the time limitations of the human mind to fully assess a real-world problem of choice in most situations, even if a person had as much time as they needed to make a choice, real-world situations involve uncertainty of utility, and subjective assessments of probabilities, outcomes, consequences etc. Moreover, choices don't exist in a vacuum like thought experiments do. And the real-world scenarios tends to have many many potential choices, with varying degrees of risk all with their own uncertainties. How does the utilitarian reconcile this?   Intro: Seeing the list (link below) of top 10 most torrented shows of 2014 (8.1m for GoT at 1st place, and 2.4m for South Park at 10th place), I decided to see how Korra compares. http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/12/29/game-of-thrones-most-pirated-show/  Methods: I looked through KickAT, using the search term "Korra", looking through the first 4 pages of results ordered by seeds (by then, the number of seeds had dropped from over 2000 to about 200), and summed the number of episode torrents for Book 4 and Book 3 separately.  Results: Book 4 had at least 1.8m episode torrents. Book 3 had at least 450k episode torrents. Assuming I only looked at about 80% of all the downloads (a conservatively high number), I estimate at least 2.2m torrents for Book 4, and 560k torrents for Book 3.  Discussion: My guess is that my Book 3 estimate is actually much too low, since more time has passed since Book 3, and seed number has decayed, it's probably at least 1m if not more, as I can believe it being lower than Book 4 but not by such a huge amount (though being on tv for most of its run probably reduced torrents). Both estimates are probably too low, but I assumed a conservative yield. Regardless, it is very possible that Korra has been torrented more in 2014 than 10th place South Park, though a proper comparison would require applying the above method to those shows as well, and seeing how well the numbers recovered match those given in the article (since I can't reproduce the article's methodology itself). Though it is somewhat an unfair comparison since Book 4 alone had 30% more episodes than South Park, and Book 3 and 4 together had 26 episodes all together, which is many more than most shows air in a year. Nonetheless, my guess is that Korra episodes have been torrented at least 3 million times in the past 6 months since Book 3 aired, which should make it one of the 10 most popular episodes in terms of illegal downloads of 2014, possibly higher than Suits, Vikings, Grey's Anatomy, and Arrow. This is pretty good considering that Korra is freely available to view online without a network or cable subscription on Nick (for most people), and also doesn't include non-torrent illegal streaming, and legal paid streaming distributors like Amazon and iTunes. Nick is probably aware that the show did very well based on Nick.com, Amazon, iTunes, and TV views.  tl;dr Korra was torrented at least 3 million times by a conservative episode between Books 3 and 4, which likely means it was one of the top 10 most torrented shows in 2014.   Just noticed the "ba-bi-di-ba-bi-di-ba-bi-di" singing. Anybody know culture this kind of singing is from?            So many characters in both series have been shaped by tragedy in their lives for better or worse.      One thing I love about Avatar is how Aang and Korra have learned so much from so many different people.  Aang's masters: Monk Gyatso (airbending), Katara (waterbending), Pakku (waterbending), Toph (earthbending), Zuko (firebending), Jeongjeong (firebending philosophy), Bumi (earthbending philosophy), Iroh (life), Avatar Roku, Avatar Kyoshi, Avatar Kurruk, Avatar Yangchen, Lion Turtle (energybending) = 13 total, Edit: Dragons (firebending), Guru Pathik (chakras) [thanks /u/tiger66261, /u/MelonLooord]  Korra's masters: Tonraq (waterbending, presumably), Tenzin (airbending), Avatar Aang (energybending), Unalaq (spiritbending), Avatar Wan (history of the avatar), Jinora (spirit guide), Iroh (life), Suyin (metalbending), Katara (healing, both waterbending and physical therapy), Toph (spiritual connection, rational acceptance of the past), Zaheer (emotional/spiritual acceptance of the past) = 11 total, + Bolin (proearthbending), and Asami (driving), Edit: Iroh (life) [/u/restinpeace24]  Also notice the following connection about Korra's road to recovery in Book 4:  mind (Toph), body (Katara), and spirit (Zaheer)   If Kuvira would to succeed, is Air Temple Island considered part of the URN, or has it always been an independent area right off the coast?   Korra: Confronting Zaheer was her last step in self-healing. Now she is both physically and mentally prepared to face her foil, Kuvira, who unfortunately is now at her most dangerous. Zaheer believes completely in Korra's "limitless" potential. I find this intriguing. Either he's saying, Korra, the avatar really is important and you can and will do your job very well (acknowledging his own futility in trying to remove her from the world). Or foreshadows a final growth in power Korra will achieve in response to the superweapon threat--though I hope it's not a deus ex.  Kuvira: Now controls all of the Earth Empire--she values unity and security for her country. Her goal is probably Republic City--I mostly base this off the foreshadowing from the world leader meeting, the pieces (both the United Republic and Fire Nation forces) are on the border. Her actions towards her endgame include creating a spirit weapon, but also acquiring large amounts of metal--Yi was said to have "ore", ZaoFu's dome has been dismantled, a fact Opal references in the sneak peak. What could she possibly want with all the metal? Is the answer as mundane as just supplying her army (I don't think the writers would have mentioned it so many times if it wasn't important), or does the metal itself have a bigger role in... combining with the superweapon... or somehow advancing her endgame. *Maybe a giant ass mech or airship with a spirit laser* (death staresque). Big question, will she die? I say no. If Korra's potential is truly limitless, she'll be able to end things without taking a life. This would also parallel the ATLA finale. Most likely she's captured, or she takes her own life, but Korra won't kill her. Also, we have yet to see her POW camps, which we now know from the sneak peak to be where the Beifongs are captured. but it looks like   Toph, Opal, Bolin, and Lin are on that.  Asami: Is working with Varrick on a plan to stop Kuvira's superweapon. If Raiko could pick one other genius to help, it would have to be Hiroshi Sato. Is Hiroshi's role this book just to reconcile Asami's relationship, or is there more to that arc? It's possible that he will be offered a path to redemption in helping stop Kuvira, which will close Asami's main arc, that of her relationship with her father, that has been present since book 1. Asami was underdeveloped last book, so it makes sense to give her a small final closing arc.  Bolin and Mako: Bolin's arc this season was learning he was an idiot for following Kuvira, and the path is now open for him regaining Opal's love. His endgame seems to be that he'll succeed, no surprise there. Mako's an interesting case. I will say Bryke redeemed his character a lot in Book 3, and it doesn't seem they have set him up for much in the way of a character developing arc. Either he stays with Wu (unlikely) or he goes back to being a detective. Other than his current employment, he seems to be at his final destination. He participates in the final confrontation somehow, though at Wu's side, unfortunately.  Wu: Comedy relief, hasn't really grown as a character in NINE episodes. There's some hints (scene at Little Ba Sing Se) that he may learn to become a good leader of his people, but I just can't see him right now being the Earth Empire endgame. That said, Bryke have been known to utilize quite sudden character shifts, and why else would he be a character. On the other hand, he may exist by necessity of the Earth Kingdom needing a monarchial heir for Kuvira to usurp. He could really just be comedic bait and switch. I do find it unlikely that the Earth nation will revert to a Kingdom in the finale, too much has changed. That said, the Fire Nation is still a (now benevolent) monarchy, so I see a few possibilities for what will come out of the Earth Empire. 1) It becomes a (competent) monarchy with Wu as King. 2) A constitutional monarchy with a parliament. 3) A non-monarchy independent democratic nation. 4) Dissolve into independent states. 5) A confederacy of states. 6) Joins the United Republic (far fetched). The impending liberation of Zao Fu probably points at 2-5. Will Su take an active role in government? She has been and still is the only competent potential leader. Maybe in an advisorial role.  Varrick and Zhuli: Zhuli betrays Kuvira somehow, unknown. Or potentially, she backstabs Baltar Jr, likely since she's working with him now--though really, she should have done that before Baltar Jr. figured out how to weaponize the swamp. Varrick realizes his love for Zhuli. What exactly counts as a countermeasure to a superweapon anyways? Asami and Varrick don't exactly have many resources other than... their own spirit vines. Cold war?  Jinora: Hopefully not captured again. Reunion with Kai (where is that little scamp), who's main arc was last book.  Baltar Jr: Dies, hopefully. At least, won't be redeemed.  General Iroh will lead the United Forces in the final confrontation, small cameo. Izumi, Raiko, and Tenzin + Jinora will have their small roles leading their respective factions, but Korra will avert major conflict. I just don't think this book will get that dark, though it will get *worse* in about two episodes.  Kai, Ikki, Meelo, Rohan, Pema, Tonraq, Mako and Bolin's family, Desna, and Eska have had their small roles this season. Bumi and Kya will have a cameo in the epilogue. And Katara and Zuko will have a flirty moment (okay, I don't think we'll actually see them again). Toph will disappear back in the swamp after saying goodbye.         It's not actually recent at all.   Sometime around a year and a half ago we were similarly duped on a large scale. We got the news from the higher-ups that our Book 4 budget was getting slashed, almost to the tune of an entire episodes budget. - Bryan Konietzko  Do you remember what we were doing a year and a half ago? We were still waiting for Book 2 to air. Book 2 was still in post-production, Book 3 in production, and Book 4 was likely in pre-production. This was probably when Bryke was working on 30+ episodes at some stage of production at the same time. This decision came out before any of the public mess with Nick. In any case, I'm glad that Nick decided, with only Book 1 having aired, and having just ordered 3 more books, that in evaluating their budget for the next... year and a half... they only reduced Korra's budget by one episode. It could've been a whole book. I find it amazing that Nick supported the show for 4 whole books since mid 2012, when originally they only ordered 1. Let's remember how excited we were back then. And now we're almost at the end!                  Rewatched The Terror Within from Book 3. Dat mole. Maybe it's actually Envy in disguys again guise.   Sandbending is probably the least explored type of bending, now that almost every other type has been expanded on Korra (except plantbending). I really wish we got to see more of it, there just seems to be a lot of potential and creativity with a powerful sand bending character, especially if it was easy to compactify and liquefact sand. Similar to lavanending, but more obviously parallel to air and waterbending techniques. Imagine a powerful sandbender arriving in Republic City and just bending all the stone buildings away like they were windy earth, or sinking them into the ground. Or giant sand storms blinding opponents plus seismic sense. Or Kya's water ring form but with sand. Or sand arms. Or sandsurfing. Or landscapes of glass from a sandbender vs firebender fight. Maybe we'll meet Toph this book and she has become a beast at it.  Edit: damn it jumbled up words in title   Goddamn it Korra.   Korra telling Toph that her daughters have reconciled. I want to know if she blames herself for her family problems, and what her response is to the news. Oh, and to learn that her granddaughter is an airbender. I hope she still has her sense of humor.         It's surprisingly hard emotionally to rewatch Korra from the beginning, she's so happy and gung-ho about being the avatar. Also, for anyone who says she's a weak bender, she makes some kick-ass fireblasts in her firebending test.         Jinora and Korra already are. Well, Jinora at least gets a tattoo. I think it would be incredibly exciting if they all got new hair styles. Mako also does not have his scarf anymore. If not hair change, at least other major cosmetic changes. The fandom would implode itself if Asami started wearing pigtails.         Unalaq: After today there will be no more Water Tribe; no more nations of any kind. The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent, and new. And I will lead this glorious revolution.  Zaheer: Together, we will forge a world without kings and queens, not borders and nations, where Man's only allegiance and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you'll never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history: Korra, the last Avatar.  ---  However, compare  Unalaq: You think what Avatar Wan did was good? Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't be a bridge: we should live together as one.  vs  Korra: But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos.  Zaheer: Exactly. The natural order is disorder.  ---  Btw, speaking of revolutions,  Amon: The revolution has begun!  Unalaq (from above): [...] And I will lead this glorious revolution.  Zaheer: The revolution has already begun!   The Ultimatum, Enter the Void, and Venom of the Red Lotus had near perfect 9.9 and 10.0 scores on IMDB the last time I checked them. The last thread to point this out was posted 15 hours ago. In fact, they still do on this page http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695360/eprate which is usually slow to be updated (I have archived the page in case it changes).  But if you look at the episodes themselves (click on the link on the above page), all the scores have dropped significantly since that page was last updated. There is evidence of sabotage. A lot of the episodes now have somewhere between 22-24 new 1 ratings that weren't there before. And the female, female 18-29, 30-44 ratings are much lower than their male counterparts, which makes no sense, since this show isn't sexist (edited). The 1 raters seem to be consistently split between about 8 males and about 14 female accounts.      We know of three separate plans associated with the Red Lotus.  1. The original plan, according to Zaheer, which involved Unalaq, was to kidnap Korra and train her under the influence of the RL philosophy of "restoring the natural order of disorder." Note that I did not say the philosophy of "anarchy", and I'll discuss why later. There's some possibility that this plan was a lie (since it was never shown), but they did have four members trained in the four elements, so the Korra training part is likely true. Opening the spirit portals and releasing Vaatu was part of their endgame, though what they expected to do afterwards with Vaatu (other than spreading general chaos) and with Korra after she released Vaatu is unknown. All we know is that it did not involve the creation of a dark avatar. However, since Vaatu has to defeat Raava, I'm guessing their plan was to destroy the avatar anyways, but then why train Korra, unless that was a lie? Perhaps Korra must be fully realized to open the spirit portals. Or was their endgame really to take control of the avatar?  2. Once the original plan failed and the RL 4 were captured, Unalaq abandoned the Red Lotus and pursued his own plan, to still get Korra to open the spirit portals and release Vaatu, but now fuse with Vaatu to become a dark avatar, and destroy the avatar--essentially taking control of the role of the avatar for himself. Was this his goal from the beginning? Were the RL 4 betrayed? Or did he just take advantage of the situation in Zaheer's absence to satisfy his own greed in the name of spreading disorder?  3. The new Red Lotus plan. The spirit portals have been opened, but Vaatu has been defeated. The new plan is to destroy the avatar and bring anarchy/disorder to the world by targeting nations and governments themselves in order to empower the individual. This doesn't seem to match the plan to release Vaatu, who doesn't seem to want to empower humans at all, so my guess is that this is Zaheer's personal variation on the Red Lotus philosophy. Possibly, he just really hated prison, and wanted to be free.  Thoughts?            melts the entire base of the mountain on which the Northern Air Temple is built on. It looks like in the finale there will be some kind of confrontation on a rocky lifeless landscape.  edit: w00t!   The finale's should have a LOT of characters vs the Red Lotus. Who should battle who? I hope Tonraq fights Ming-Hua.   Spirit Bend. If Unalaq could do it, the rest of the Red Lotus probably at least knows about spirit bending. Ming-hua doesn't seem spiritual enough to know how, but it would be cool if she could, and used her water arms to do so. Or if Zaheer could do it with airbending, that would probably look awesome.   Unalaq was a part of the Red Lotus, but he was also the head of a nation, how exactly was he supposed to fit into the part of the Red Lotus plan that involved taking out oppressive leaders?

Well, at least one whose diapers I didn't have to *change*."

Wonder how many "Air" and "Spirits" there are in Book 1 and 2. Needs compilation vid after Book is over.  Source: avatar wikia transcripts         Opal is Tenzin's bastard daughter. Sokka is Su Yin's father. And the true leader of the Red Lotus is none other than  Toph "tough" Beifong.  Yes, Toph Beifong. It all makes sense now. Ai Wei saying that she has gone off in search of "enlightenment", much like how Zaheer seeks to "enter the void". That no one has seen her in many many years. That Ai Wei, the traitor, would be the one to admit this information. Why Toph had to protect Su Yin from jail time. It explains the hints that we might see her this season. Why she didn't help capture Zaheer's group 13 years ago, and why she retired from the police force years before that. Why Zaheer's group consists of unique benders, including one that is handicapable, like herself. She is the leader of the Red Lotus. Something happened between her and Aang just before his death. She disappeared from the world and is pulling the strings in the shadows. She is in collusion with Ai Wei, Su Yin, and the creation of Zao Fu is just part of the Red Lotus conspiracy. Opal Beifong is the promised child, Guru Laghima reborn, sent to destroy the unrightgeous of the Northern Air Temple. Toph killed Sokka, who is her baby daddy, because he knew something he shouldn't have. Toph Beifong is the ultimate enemy Korra and the gaang will face at the end of this season. What could probably be more surprising than our own esteemed Toph Beifong being the true antagonist of Book 3? What else could possibly cap off Lin's character development this season more than realizing the monsters that her own sister and mother truly are? Why else would Korra and Bolin need to learn metalbending? Who other than the greatest earthbender who ever lived could possibly be a worthy successor to Book 1's Amon, and Book 2's world ending manifestation of evil itself? Only the blind can see when we enter the Void.  It's the dawning of a new age, and the Blind Bandit will rise again to impose her vision of a new world order on us all.   We know Zaheer's the leader of his gang of four, but now with Ai Wei's betrayal, speculations that Su Yin is also involved, and a possible connection to the Earth Queen, it seems possible that the real mastermind behind this Red Lotus conspiracy may not be Zaheer as we thought. Zaheer seems more like a fanatic following a path laid out from him, a master plan of sorts. Ai Wei is intelligent and also looks to be a strong fighter, I wouldn't be surprised if he was the true mastermind or current leader of the conspiracy. I really do hope we get to see him fight. Huo Ting, if she is involved, seems more likely to have joined due to her prejudice against the avatar, her and the Dai Li's motivation seems clear. I doubt at this point the main players in the conspiracy haven't been shown yet, which is one reason I find Ai Wei's reveal to be fascinating. There might be other minor members of the conspiracy to be revealed. Who else might be involved? Raiko? Varrick? MEELO? I feel like this season just imploded in awesomeness.       Was Aang just like gtfo?   So we got our evil airbender leader, chaos incarnate, chi-blockers, bloodbenders, and more. Some villains bring in fresh new ideas (Vaatu), others are twists on established concepts in the franchise (Amon). What ideas do you have for awesome final season of Korra villains?   Summary: Spirits = Souls. Humans are weak spirits which gain by inhabiting physical bodies. Non physical spirits are strong enough to not need physical bodies. Spirits (and thus humans) die permanently, except when (like horcruxes) a part of them remains somewhere else, and in which case they can revive (that is, they don't really ever reincarnate). When spirits gain physical forms (without killing the host), they become vulnerable to death, as in Raava/Avatar and Unavaatu in the avatar state, AND Yue/the moon spirit/fish, which are the same phenomena. Thus, Unavaatu is perma-dead. Lastly, I briefly talk about how does Korra bend her inner spirit, and what happened when Aang and Raava fuse with the Ocean spirit, with no real answers to these questions.  Long Version: Firstly, "Spirit" and "soul" are indistinguishable. [When Unalaq tries to spirit bend Jinora, he threatens her eternal soul]. Spirits (non-human or animal) as we know them are those which do not inhabit physical bodies. Their spiritual bodies are sufficient to interact with the worlds (both Spiritual and Physical worlds), some seem always solid [most spirits], others can become invisible or visible at will [dragonfly bunnies]. Therefore,  ~~~Humans Are Really Spirits.   Spirits (non-human or animals such as dragons, air bison, and badger-moles) as we know them do not *need* to inhabit physical bodies. The converse is that human spirits must inhabit physical bodies. Human spirits can thus be considered *weak* spirits in this regard. The human being consists of a human spirit (a soul), which is indistinguishable from the self, and which inhabits a physical body, which acts as the medium by which a human spirit can interact with the world(s). They compensate their weakness buy having physical bodies. One advantage of having a physical body is that the body is necessary to bend the elements [disembodied human spirits cannot bend, elemental attacks seem to harm spirits both non-human and human, as when Korra is attacked by Unalaq, or when any spirit is attacked in Book 2].  Most human spirits cannot be separated from their physical bodies (at least until death, see below). Some human beings are sufficiently spiritually inclined that they can leave their physical bodies. As a disembodied human spirit, they can interact in the spirit world (possibly due to its heightened spiritual energy), but not in the physical world, in which they are invisible ghosts [Aang, Book 1]. [The exception which proves the rule is Jinora Book 2, who is visible and can interact in the physical world. The appearances of Avatar Roku at the Winter Solstice and Avatar Kyoshi during her trial are also exceptions which prove the rule]. Moreover, only the sufficiently spiritually inclined can continue to exist as spirits after death [All avatars, the Painted Lady, and Iroh].  There is another reason why human spirits can be considered *weak* spirits, and that is spiritual possession. Spirits (non-human) can possess a human's body [Beginnings, the Avatar, Unavaatu, Yue]. In doing so, the spirit can easily overpower the human's own control over their body, the human body starts to take on characters of the spirit, and the spirit if it remains too long will eventually kill the human body. All of these properties suggest that spirits are *stronger* than the spirit which is the human soul. (Or, it suggests that a physical body rejects a spirit which does not belong and eventually dies).   ~~~Yue/Moon are the same as Avatar/Raava  There are exceptions to the rule that spirit possession kills the human body: 1) a spirit and human can bond using the power of Harmonic Convergence and share a body [The Avatar, Unavaatu]. I claim a second exception: when the moon spirit imbues baby Yue with a part of its life force. Both Yue and the part of the moon spirit which lives within Yue's body without harming her, possibly because neither are particularly strong; Yue's spirit was weak at birth, and the moon spirit only parted with a tiny bit of itself.  I further claim that the bond between the Avatar and Raava and that between Yue and the moon spirit are much the same thing, a mutually beneficial sharing of a physical body. Both get stronger when bonded than when not. Both take on characteristics of the spirit; Yue's hair turns white, the Avatar state, and possibly why Korra could do amazing cosmic things when separated from Raava. A third example can also be said to fit this: Tui and La becoming mortal fishes may very well be another bond between spirit and physical being. Why do I say this? Because while we know Tui and La take on physical forms, we don't know how, and the only way we see this happening elsewhere is when Raava bonds with Wan to become the Avatar, and similar with Unavaatu. It is possible there are other ways a spirit can become physical without bonding with an existing physical being, in that instead perhaps they created or were endowed with physical forms, possibly suggesting that the first animals and humans were also once spirits which gained physical forms. Regardless, one thing seems certain, and that is  ~~~Spirits Really Die, They Don't Reincarnate (and Unavaatu is Perma-Dead)  When a spirit becomes physical, it becomes *mortal* (or at least *vulnerable to death*, as I do think spirit bending actually kills spirits, since Korra words imply that it is similar to 'passing on'). Physical beings, like animals and humans, age and die and are mortal. Tui and La's physical forms can be killed. And we know that *if* the avatar is killed in the avatar state, then the avatar spirit will cease to exist; this suggests that Raava could really die permanently if the avatar dies in the avatar state. It is possible that this only means that Raava dies until the next Harmonic Convergence and is reborn in Vaatu. However it is ambiguous, and it makes sense that while Raava and Vaatu cannot die as spirits, by becoming mortal they become vulnerable to permanent death. If we take this as possible, then it is very possible that Vaatu at the bend of Book 2 had been permanently defeated; by bonding with Unalaq and becoming a giant avatar state being, and is permanently gone due to spirit bending. The other implication of this is that Unavaatu was foolish in separating Raava from Korra and killing Raava independently, as that reduced her fate to the case where Raava is a spirit and not vulnerable to permanent death.  What happens after death? There seem to be two possibilities. Reincarnation, and permanent death. The Avatar is said to be reincarnated into the next generation; however, we now know that it is really Raava's essence which survives, and that the human spirit part of the Avatar remains a separate identity which can be communicated with by future avatars by their connection with Raava. Thus, all avatars have separate human souls. That makes sense since Raava is said to be what is is reincarnated, but we don't know if the past avatars are still around now that Korra's connection is broken. Possibly, those avatars are still around, but they are just impossible to reach. Or, they could have 'passed on' when the connection was broken. It is never said that other human souls are reincarnated, only ever the Avatar, i.e. Raava.  Alternatively, all human souls (and spirits as well) are reincarnated in new human bodies (or new spirits) at death, and all avatars share the same soul, but are cognizant of old memories due to Raava. This explains how Raava transfers from one body to the next, by following the reincarnations of Wan. This would mean that breaking the connection to them really means that those past memories of the same soul are no longer available, in the same way that no other human can remember. However, I think this is less likely than that human souls actually pass on in death (except when they transcend into spirits), for the reasons discusses in the previous paragraph. But then, why do Raava and Vaatu remember their past reincarnations even when defeated? Is it because they are powerful spirits?  ~~~Some Spirits Basically Use Horcruxes  Or is it because they aren't really destroyed if part of them exists in the other (while *connections* to other Avatar spirits *can* be broken). Instead, they seem to escape death because, when they break apart from each other, they leave a little bit of themselves behind, and in turn, take a bit of the other with them. Like Yin and Yang symbols, literally. This matches what is said in Book 2, that when one defeats the other, they come back in the other. This is an alternative to them being *reincarnated* in the other; instead they were never fully defeated in the first place, because (like horcruxes), in the name of balance, they cannot help but leave a part of themselves in the other.   If this is the case, then it likely holds in general for spirits. This is similar to how the moon spirit was able to revive; by leaving a part of itself in Yue, the moon spirit was able to escape death, and the bond between Yue's and the old moon spirit become the new moon spirit. There really was a risk of the moon spirit permanently dying, except, there does seem to be an allowance in the avatar universe for prophecy and destiny for the sake of balance: Yue and her father knew her destiny was to become the new moon spirit, so there really wasn't a risk at all. Likewise, the spirits Raava and Vaatu cannot really kill each other, except in the possibility that they are in the avatar state when bonded with a human being. (Bye Vaatu).  Open Questions: How exactly does Korra bend her inner spirit in the Book 2 finale? Going by the above, my best answer is that because of her bond with Raava, she takes on some of Raava's ancient connections to the cosmos.  Open Question: What exactly is happening when Aang (+Raava) joins with the Ocean spirit to defeat the FN fleet? My best answer is that it is similar to spiritual possession (the Ocean spirit was in control), but *weird* since there were three entities in the same place, and there was also the Avatar state power-up going on at the same time.  Open Question: Why does killing the moon spirit stop waterbending and eclipse the moon? How to reconcile needing physical bodies to bend elements and the ocean and moon spirits? Perhaps the moon is the old physical body of the moon spirit which it leaves behind, but is still connected to.  Edit: This was way longer than I thought it would be. Thanks for your time (if anyone reads this)!   If either Mako or Asami had been just slightly more careful that day, they might not have ever met. What would have happened to the story? The fire ferrets would never have been sponsored in the tournament. The championship may or may not have happened (though Amon did say "everything's going according to plan" so I'm going to lean on the side of did happen). Mako and Korra would have been together earlier. Mako would not have been such a tool. Korra would never have found out about Hiroshi. This may or may not be bad. Lin's metalbenders would not have been captured. Lin herself would probably still have been head of police. This may have affected her interactions with Tarlok and his taskforce, perhaps not precipitating the events leading to Korra's capture and Yakone realization. Hiroshi's mechatanks would have been revealed during the attack on Republic City, and would have more of an element of surprise. But most importantly, would Asami have joined Team Avatar, or would she have joined her father? Imagine Asami as the corporate businesswoman villain of Book 2, avenging her father, teaming up or competing with Varick. Oh how Korra's heart, bless her, would hurt from her absence.   What's your favorite feels moment in ATLA and Korra? I recently rewatched the entire series and was surprised at how many times it made me tearbend. The Tale of Iroh being one of the best, obvi.   Armless waterbender = awesome concept.  Armless airbender, earthbender, or firebender = it would've just been bad.   Anyone think he could be ex-white lotus? It is an ancient society after all, and Zaheer seems well learned in ancient teachings. It also might provide him a motive for wanting to take down the white lotus and the avatar.   So those white lotus guys can just totally metalbend, earthbend, firebend out of that prison.   Rewatching ATLA, it didn't occur to me until now that while most other master benders had 1v1 fights, Toph did not (Aang, Zuko, Katara, Azula, Bumi, Ozai, Pakku, Iroh...ish). The closest that comes to mind is her fight in The Blind Bandit, a fight which was entirely in her favor. She almost always played a support role: first scout through seismic sense, incredibly powerful heavy offense and defense, and the ability to affect terrain. She is probably one of the best benders compared on ability to fight many lesser benders at one time, if not the best. Her usefulness in large scale battle cannot be understated. However, I think that 1v1, she'd be at a disadvantage in every matchup except vs earth, in which she's on the same order as Bumi (only Bumi's incredible intelligence, power, and experience can make up for Toph's unparalleled affinity to earth). This realization kinds makes me sad in that we actually never really get to see her fight 1v1 vs any other master bender (not counting her mud fight with Katara). In any case, Toph probably wouldn't win, since while incredibly powerful, she also has the most obvious exploitable vulnerabilities (ground reliance, feet reliance, weak hand to hand combat, physical vulnerability--we never really see her get thrown around like Zuko or Aang) that a master bender of any other element could easily exploit. Though maybe by sheer power and terrain control, she could take her opponent out faster than they can exploit her weaknesses. This gets me thinking, it seems to me that almost every other master bender level character has a decent matchup vs any other element--Toph is unique in that regard, and thus her combat role is treated very differently (in a good way).   I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the multiple personality/psycho murderer lore. It's based on some reset silliness that happened at the VERY beginning of the game, before anything actually happened in the game. I'm far more partial to the recent Lovely Sunday artwork.  But the real reason I'm not a fan of the multiple personality/psychomurderer lore is that it's driving attention away from the stream itself. People want a protagonist with personality; that's fine. But a personality disorder is not a personality. It isn't IRL and it isn't in TPP. People want an interesting protagonist for which to ascribe an interesting personal narrative; that is also fine. But how is any kind of narrative going to form if we're ignoring the events in the stream itself?  What ever happened to us having to fight Roxanne nine times? What ever happened to marill rollout hilarity or PC antics? What ever happened to our inability to evolve torchic?  Instead of focusing on the developing narrative, we're stuck on this multiple personality/psycho murderer lore. Narrative can only develop by paying attention to what's happening on the stream, it is Pokemon's classic RPG elements + the unpredictability of the stream which generates novel narrative elements. Instead, we've replace developing real personality with a personality disorder, and now A and her 'mons have very little narrative development. Instead of hilarious antics, which was what made TPP so great in the first place, we've replaced that with dark humor and references that have quickly gotten old (A is a psychopath is not funny the umpteenth time without there being actual development on the theme). It doesn't fit into what's happening in the stream, or at least the community has not done a good job incorporating events from the stream. Instead, it's stalling creativity and development, and either it needs to start developing into a actual narrative, or be replaced. (I'm personally partial to the rebellious adventure story of girl and 'mons with occasional craziness reflected by Lovely Sunday, something closer to the in-game narrative of Pokemon). We're stuck making passing references to batman, or mirai nikki, or whatever. Gen I incorporated into it's narrative an utterly ridiculous and hilarious faux mythology from unpredictable in-game events and archetypal biblical stories; Gen II built on that developed characterization based on in-game events, and it worked because ultimately it fit into our destiny of fighting red.  Can we make more artwork and lore based on things happening in the stream, please? Or at least come up with some interest/operations/plans for playing the game itself?  	109

 I was expecting a bag of roasted chile to bring some fragrance on the plane.  I am disappointed in my hopes.     Hell yeah!  What kind of parties have a smoker as a prize?  I mean, that's pretty awesome.   I'm trained as well.  I've never been taught that in any of the fine dining or scholastic settings I've been in.   It's not about getting burnt.  It's about spilling a pudding that is not completely set.  Or dropping the dish.  I personally would fire someone who did that after being asked not to.  Simply because I sell all of mine and only make 8 a day.  Or in the shop that did 300 covers nightly, I would make 20 and sell every one.  If I dropped one, I would have been in a world of shit.  It will get 86'd every night, but not by an employee's fuck up.   I know why someone would say to pick up and roll the dish.  It moves the sugar.  However, if you use the proper technique in dusting, you will never have to move the sugar yourself after you sprinkle it.  It it needs to be moved, you use the forced air of your torch.   Part of what defines a creme brulee is "burnt."  Nothing wrong with a little black.  Those are words that have been spoken by people who are much better cooks than me.  I'll stick to my roots.  There is a fine line when it comes to excellent and ruined.  Don't be afraid that what you think is good isn't up to others standards.  Others standards are just theirs.  If you are making it for yourself, make it how you like it.  That is the beauty of food - you can control it completely if you do it yourself.   As far as getting the sugar right, there is no other way of doing it rather than practice.  However, doing the whole process is a pain in the ass and not cost effective.  So do it over gelatin water.  Bloom gelatin and let it set up in your ramekins.  It will take 5 minutes of inactive prep and cost a few pennies per dish.   Now your torch.  You need to know your torch.  The reason people get burnt sugar compared to caramelized is because they use too much sugar and they try to melt it to quickly by placing the flame to close to it and burn the top layer.  To get around that, place your ramekin on the table.  With a 3 finger pinch, lightly sprinkle sugar over the top in a fine, 1 or 2 grain layer.  Shake the dish a little to move the excess around which isn't stuck to the surface, then tip on its side to tap off all the excess sugar.  Removing the excess is the most important part.  Note that your layer of sugar will not be 100% at this point.   Now lightly melt the sugar with your torch.  While the sugar is still hot, repeat the dusting process again and let sit one minute until cool.  Lightly melt again and repeat dusting.  This third and final dusting is where you're going to want to get the caramel.  Now this is where the practice of the torch comes in handy.  And I can't tell you how to do it without actually using your torch.  You just have to play with it.  But it's really fucking simple.  And even easier to fuck up.  Done right though, it's magic.   Alright.  Now it's time to make a Cubano.  Also.  I didn't ask, someone else did ;)   Hold up here.  Never hold it in your hand. I'll BRB, but while what the posted above said will work, you run risk.   A smoker to subscribe to?  Or a sub?   If you mean sub, i'd say r/BBQ and R/smoking.   Well.  Don't be a dick.  If you don't act like a dick and say dick things, you won't get treated like a dick.  Nor will you get told to go fuck yourself.  I tried investing in a slicer by offering you to purchase one for me.  And then you insult me.  You sir, are a dick and can go fuck yourself if that is how you are going to behave   You know, considering that I care fuck all about plating, I'm almost concerned with it.  And considering that you can not either create or contribute content, only critique it, I almost care what your input is.    But here is what it comes down to.  I make better product than you can probably afford to purchase.  So why don't you either A) go fuck yourself or B) go fuck yourself.  I suggest you take option number two.   My good knives were at the shop and the little home slicer I own is BS.  How about you invest in me and ship me a 12" deli slicer?   Yeah, that's what I was just reading on Wiki.  Staple Toronto sandwich eh?  I might just have to fly out there and have one!   OH!  What is this peameal bacon you speak of?  That is a new term to me, so now I'm going to have to learn how to properly make it.  May the gods continue to bless the internets so that we learn of new forms of bacon daily.   If you want them to succeed, you will have to help them if this is their game plan.  And more than likely, they will need a lot more help from the community than that if it is going to succeed.  Like a landlord that is willing to front up space for 6 months to get ducks in a row.  But in all honesty, good luck.  This is a recipe for failure and would probably ruin their marriage if this is a plan to stick with.  If this is really last ditch, I would suggest they need to dig a different hole to get out of.  Sorry.  But by the sounds of it, this plan will do more harm than good.   From what I have been told, that would be back bacon.   Ya know, I don't know the history of the different cuts so much, outside of Italian.  Now I'm intrigued.  I've read a lot and have a decent library, but I guess I need to hit the books just as much as I hit the salt.  To me, while I know that pancetta is technically an older style of bacon than American, I still wouldn't call it bacon.  It's pancetta for fucks sake, not bacon.  It's all in the nuances of language.  That is why when people ask me stuff is anymore I just tell them to shut up and shove it in their mouth :)   And all my friends keep asking me why I don't start a catering company...   Pineapple slaw.  I think this might be the winner idea out of all.  How did you make yours?    It needs to be charred, no question about that IMO.  Cabbage doesn't seem right.  Mangos or apples would make it to fruity.  Cilantro and pea shoots?  Hrm...  I live in the desert and don't work with pineapple much.  I love it, but it's usually a second thought and in this instance, it would be awesome to have it as a primary ingredient.     They love me in there.  However, I have been asked to not post ingredient questions, only full on sandwiches.  Here is a gallery of snacks if you'd like to make yourself hungry...  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe   http://i.imgur.com/CXR1Bl1.jpg  60 hours in the brine, 6 hours in cold smoke, 3 hours roasted at 200.

Monday nights at Big Adventure Comics is "The Game Thing."  On open to the community board gaming night.  There are hundereds of games in the collection and dozens of people show up every week.  I think biggest turn out has been around 50 people!  There are people that show up who play chess.  Also.  Talk to folks at Stagg Tobacconist.  They are in the moving process to their new location on Cerrillos, but they are the only place I know of in the area that sells Chess clocks and high end boards.  They would probably know of others in the area too.   I do love to share with my neighbors.  In fact, the only reason I cook is to feed other folks.  If you're ever in NM or planning a trip out here, hit me up.  I'll gladly make you a sandwich.     Am planning on it and will do.  This chunk of bacon is week 7 of my "make a different kind of bacon every week for a year" challenge.  So you can expect to see many more pics of tasty from me.     Horseradish.  I've been thinking wasabi or some such nonsense, but I know where I can get farm fresh horseradish right now.  Good call.  And the red onion would pair nice with a lime dressing and pickled ginger.  Yeah...  I can see something delicious coming together...   Good point.    I'm thinking either a lemongrass or sesame slaw of sorts.  Maybe some charred bok choy?  A straight up Bhan Mi would be good, but I make those already.  Anyone have any suggestions?      http://i.imgur.com/ANsz2tQ.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/s2VQu9N.jpg  Salt, garlic, black pepper, Hatch Green Chile, pink salt.  48 hours in the cure and into the smoker it goes...                                                                                                                     cheers!         Title says it all.  I'm an accomplished cook and yet for the life of me I can't come up with a good bean patty burger recipe.  Or find one online.  The only stuff I can find that turns out the way that we like is a falafel type pattie.  Not that that is bad, but I want something to grill that won't fall apart and not be falafel.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!                                                                                                                                                                 	122
 Spoilers...    Amazing name you have, haha   Huh? Is that supposed to be the Human Being?...    I haven't seen it yet but I've heard good things and want to see it   Bad Words and Chef. I don't remember much being posted about either but both are really good   As credible as any rumor. It's false until proven true from a official source   If it doesn't have the little blue indicator by it, for a page that big and a topic like that, it's not a verified page.    That's not an official page and that is just a rumor. Nothing to see here. Move along. Move along   Good. Keep those characters on the original Agents of Shield.    I know but still, no other characters have bled into the other movies   Considering The Force Awakens takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi, Obi Wan died in a New Hope which is a few years before that, was a 60 year old hermit at time of death, and Domnall Gleeson is 31, I'd say YES!   But no, really, probably not.    I am in the exact same boat... Exact.    I just recently did. It's not that it's bad, it's just less good than others. And to me, it's equal with 6 right now. The only season that's less than "really good" is Season 4.   I love that movie. It separated itself from Iron Man to make it feel original yet still fed into the Universe very well   Other than your power ranking, I agree. It's been really good. My ranking would be 2  3  5  6 = 1  4.    He kinda reminds me of James Spader. Not sure why.   Not me. I thought Captain America was too cheesy to be good as a movie like Iron Man. That first movie proved me dead wrong. And he has been one of my favorites personally and has had the best movie (The Winter Soldier)    For sure!    In a lot of ways, yes, but it still will be a Cap movie and go through his arc. The whole story will feature all of these characters but most likely will be told from Steve Rogers' perspective.    It's usually lame, makes the movie darker and less clear. The only good example I can think of is Avatar because it was actually filmed in 3D rather than thrown together in Post. Sometimes it's not bad, but I'd never choose 3D over 2D unless that's the only way I can see it in IMAX   That cast list is HUGE! And Amazing! Finally tying The Incredible Hulk movie back in with General Ross, tying in Ant Man and Black Panther, AND current Avengers. This could be better than  the Avengers movies!    Yea, some movies are or do both but it's not always an option nor is it as regular as IMAX 3D as an option.    I have one by me, didn't know that though. I've seen a few movies there and it's incredible. Just never knew they couldn't do 3D.   You are probably right, but I hope it is actually made for true IMAX. I actually have one close by that is awesome when something has true IMAX shots.   That's an interesting option   I've seen it for a few movies here in America but it's not a popular option only because Studios make more money on IMAX 3D   Well, it's brand new technology so we'll have to wait and see I think.   For sure, I'm sick of either getting a small screen or straight to IMAX 3D. IMAX 2D should be an option.    That is going to look amazing! The first movie fully in IMAX, cannot wait   In the wake of JJ saying that he is removing some of the references to the other movies, I truly have hope that these movies will stand on their own rather than just pieces of nostalgia. Familiar but new   I use chrome for the functionality. It's a little slow sometimes and needs a "desktop only" mode buy other than that, I like it   That is awesome to hear! Thanks for the quote.    It was a moment of aggression after someone called me a shitty fan. Anyway, I agree with you. The Wild went to the point for way too many shots and barely ever got a loose puck. Among many other issues. I still believe we have the talent, we just need to get our shit together.    An educated discussion about hockey was not called for when he said "I must not watch much hockey" and that I'm a "shitty fan". My response was warranted. Im also a former player, which I assume most of us are on here. You know what really made us look Dumb? Losing. The chanting is the crowd trying, clearly unsuccessfully, to get something going. Again, I'm not a huge fan of the "goalie name" chant and I didn't even participate in it because like you said, it won't work on Crawford. But I understand the reasoning behind it.    Exactly how am I a shitty fan?   Haha, I've been to more games than you've seen on tv or otherwise.   I WAS there, i didnt participate in it, but i understand the real reasoning. Yes, there are some dumbass fans, but that is what it is meant for.   Not really. As i said, its meant to get in his head and make him screw up. It clearly didnt work tonight. But chants aren't only meant for after a goal or when we are winning. We need to keep the crowd active, support our team, and get it rowdy to distract the opposite team. Im honestly not a big "Goalie name chant" fan anyway, but that is the reason for the chant.   I never boo my team but the "CRAAAAAAWFOOORD" chant is meant to psych the goalie out and get into his head. He did play a great game, sadly, but the chant isnt saying "You suck" its saying "Screw up". Now, if we started the "Sieve" chant...then you would have a major point.  There is a similar chant in College hockey that DOES mean "you suck". That would go "Craaawford...Craaawford....Craaawford...SUCKS!". I think that is what you are thinking of.   Never sure about the character on GOT but really like the actor   1. Sam Jackson and Gazelle did not have phones with the SIM card that creates aggression. Nor were they close to any of them, therefore it wouldn't affect them. The chip was explained to people getting one put in them that it was to not get affected but really they were control chips.  2. He got the chips to explode because he knew they could be set off (as it did with Mark Hamill's character). Again, the chips were truly meant for control. Not sure what the full potential of them were as we never got that far in the movie but he could use them to Kill someone that betrays him.  3. Eggsy was in the military and learned combat from there, the rest came from the Kingsman training which took place over months (we only saw portions of it but you'll notice the amount of time passing be Eggsy's hair length).   4. Roxy was clearly not quite as good as Eggsy as he helped her along the whole training. Plus she had not directly dealt with Valentine.    I'm really liking the Twelfth Dr. Who. But I think the Eleventh Dr. Who is my favorite so far.    Just wasn't on my mind anymore because you were so unimportant. You don't even piss me off, you are just a nat that won't go away is all. You also base my taste in movies off of one movie, wow. And just to shut your trolling down, this is my last post in the thread.    But I've already gotten to you. I forgot about this thread and you are still running on. And you are right about one thing. You can't get somebody when you are wrong. I can't be gotten. Hahaha   BAHAHA! You are still on this?! Man, I really got to you, is your eye twitching yet?   No, haha. Not many on message boards or friends agreed at the time. I know I'm not that important.    The Amazing Spider-Man did okay critically and good financially but is still the 4th highest grossing Spider-Man film behind even Spider-Man 3. And The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had worse critical reviews and is the 5th highest grossing Spider-Man movie, out of 5. But anyway, my point was more to the fact that a third was not made and rights given to Marvel and Marc Webb has no movies lined up.   Also, I'm not saying it's impossible for new directors to lead a blockbuster, Jon Favreau had little experience and did Iron Man, as you said. James Gunn did Guardians. My complaint was specific to Marc Webb, he did music videos and one mediocre (in my opinion) romcom. And I wasn't entirely wrong because The Amazing Spider-Man franchise didn't exactly become the next Iron Man or anything. It's not all his fault but I still don't believe he was the right choice   Maybe he was initially cast or something. He would be great on the show though.   Not exactly but he wasn't a plus to either movie. He had no action experience and barely any feature movie experience. And people aren't exactly lining up for him to direct their script.   I agree with you on the story. But the product was cool for a single watch.   500 Days of Summer. Great cast but it was so slow paced and didn't ever go anywhere. Yet everyone seems to like it who have seen it. Especially around the time The Amazing Spider-Man had just attached Marc Webb as director. I felt it was a terrible choice. No one listened. We all know how that ended up.   Im not being a dick, im truly curious. Why stop? The rest was just filling OP in on what happened so their not disappointed with Season 4 and not continue on because 5 and 6 are great.   Why, if you are such a big fan, have not watched all of Community or kept up with it? Also, just so you know, Season 4 was not done by Dan Harmon as he was fired. Then he was hired back for season 5. Community got canceled due to the low viewership, and then revived on Yahoo Screen for Season 6.   Pretty sure it's a behind the scenes photo   They are white/cream. Where did you get it?    What is the color of the Jersey? Can you provide a photo of it?    Exactly   I'll still see both and hold any real opinions until I at least see some footage but I'm skeptical now just because those two topics can very easily be botched.   I get that for sure   Not twitching at all. You can have your opinion. I'm not trying to change it at all. I'm only trying, apparently unsuccessfully, to make you understand that the majority opinion of something doesn't revolve around your viewing of a film, nor mine.   No, not at all. I just don't see how people think they outright sucked this past game. We made a few costly mistakes which we should rightfully gripe at. I'm talking about the people who said we straight up sucked and have give up. Wasn't really meant directly at you   My evidence is based on all critics, box office numbers, and everyone who saw the movie who has a rotten tomatoes account. Yours is based on a few reddit posts out of the many enjoying it, you and your friends, and your opinion on what people who haven't seen the movie yet will think. No matter the movie, you are in the minority. I can say for fact that most people who have seen the movie enjoy it and most critics as well. You can speculate what the future viewers might think. Far from fact.   All I'm saying is they didn't score any goals by naturally coming into our zone and scoring a goal. They were all caused by our mistakes which, if fixed, can allow us to win. By the way, it's unbelievable that I'm defending our team against our own fans. Where is our loyalty to a team that actually did play well expect for a few costly breakdowns   Yes, there were some but no different than them at some points in the game. You are taking the negative points in our game and amplifying them to outweigh what we did well under the circumstances.    You don't have to like the movie, but you were trying to make the point that your opinion is the majority which it is not. Not saying I'm right either. Just that I'm in that majority in liking it. And I'm actually not deep into fanboydom. I've not read any of the comics, just enjoy most of the films, including this one. No my soul does not hurt every time somebody doesn't love Marvel. Having said that, it should be expected to receive defense for a movie that a majority of the people who have seen it, like it. No matter what it is.   Glad you have a few friends you can hate on the movie with. That is clearly the minority opinion. As shown by the amount of money it brought it, the critical acclaim, and the audience praise, the movie is good to most.   Just because you, your friends, and a few posters on reddit don't like it, does not make that the majority opinion.    I'm fairly sure movies like this one are made for people who generally like superhero movies. The people who are going to go see it, for the most part, enjoyed the first one and understood it. Clearly those people will understand and enjoy this one. All of the critics that are going to write a review have already done so and it's at a 75% which is damn good (albeit, not as good as the original but still very good).    [Yea...because people hated Age of Ultron](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers_age_of_ultron/)    Our defense had a few breakdowns of which the blackhawks capitalized each time. If it weren't for those, they would not have had any goals. The D had 3 turnarounds that resulted in 3 goals which sucks and is unfortunate but other than that, we played well. If we can tighten up the D to not make those mistakes, we can beat them. The team as a whole did not look sloppy nor marginal, otherwise it would have been 7-0. We had strength, good passing, Good scoring chances, control, speed, and cool heads (especially after getting down again).  3 mistakes cost us the game but that does not make our game play diminished besides those.    You lost me at the title   It's only a meltdown if we just suck and lose out. Both games we played well. Sometimes better than them (others pretty even). We just have to adjust some things to have less turnovers. 3 out of the 4 goals were off of Wild Turnovers yesterday. To give up on a team after two games is a cop out. It's not true fandom.    Have a little faith. We lose two really close games and you are counting us out? Cmon... That's just bandwagon BS.    He was great in the role. I would like it if they revived him or saved him but the death does hold a lot of weight. Either way, this role opens up an already good career for him   Look at it this way, since it wasn't well received, if it didn't have the 7th Doctor, there would be no reason to consider it canon. A lot of people have grown to love the 8th doctor due to his audio stories and The Night of the Doctor. None of that would potentially exist if it weren't for 7's regeneration to 8 being shown in the movie.   That's alright. At least you tried.    Absolutely not. I'm watching it in the Theater for the first time. No two ways about it.    Glenn said that that was a mislead and that is not The Waitress' name. But thanks for playing   Spider-man 3   The 2nd one wasnt perfect but i still thought it was really funny.   Haha! That makes me happy that someone got it   Season 7 is my favorite season.   I would have loved that.   Yes. But the fact that they had him it made it better   Anybody else pissed that the one guy pounding on the glass with seats behind the net is still there from the last game?   The casting of 8 and having 7 in it for the transition. Other than that, it's just okay for me. After seeing 8 back in the Night of the Doctor, I reeaaaally would like to see more of his later years   No fakes look decent...   Edit: Seriously. They are always off colored, have terribly fake looking patches, the numbers/name stitching is shotty. Not even close to the real thing. At the last game I was at, I literally saw one that had the Wild logo Tilted fully on its side. How could they think that was legit or look good?    Grilled Cheese wins. But only in a fair fight. If it's prison rules. I'd take the taco.    Hulu    Sports scores, package tracking, flight tracking, email reminders, TV show reminders, weather, etc. It's very useful once you get used to it and start using it more   Yes, but without the trial and going to jail and everything. I liked the Seinfeld finale but for IASIP it would be great if it were literally just like any other episode   I've said it before but my perfect finale would be just like any other episode. And after its all done, Mac would run in saying "Guys! I got News!" Then it would cut to black and do the usual "Thursday" "2:30pm" "Philadelphia, PA" with them discussing their next scheme in the background and then all the way through the credits. The End. I like to picture that even after we end with them, nothing ever changed and they continued their shenanigans after.    Wow an article talking about how bad a movie is when critics and moviegoers agree it was great and providing no proof nor examples of why it was bad.    It's available for purchase as a Digital set as well. It's not on Netflix or Hulu or anything. Basically, if you want to watch them, you have to buy them. As it should be.    I just went on Taptu and saw that the app was being retired on March 31st, 2015. This was my favorite app, anyone else have a RSS reader that is similar in setup?   I have now tried Feedly and Palabre and both are ok but have terrible or no widgets and no way to flip easily from site to site.   EDIT: Thank you all for the suggestions, Ive checked out everyone's suggestions and am testing between Paperboy and Palabre. Both are nice apps but need some work so I'll stick with both until one gets better than the other. I still miss Taptu.    I go to /Film and ComingSoon.net for movies and they have some TV News but is there a good website that is similar to those but for TV (besides this subreddit)?    It feels like the season started last week. But man, it has been a really good one. What is your favorite episode or moment from Season 10?   Jesus...Am I the only one who had to work today? I know I don't hold the right to complain about stuff being spoiled but I'm dying inside with every minute I can't watch the new episodes... Only an hour and a half left...    I personally hope we have at least an appearance from Shirley. And that Troy comes back obviously. I also am excited about the new characters. My expectations are about medium because I love Community but we are now missing 3 of the main study group members. But I have faith in Dan Harmon. How about the hint to more paintball (Dan's photo of Chang's gold gun)?    I was just watching Attack of the Clones and wondering if the scenes in Anchorhead where the Lars family lives (Luke's home in A New Hope) were filmed in the same location/same sets in Tunisia? I searched Google and couldn't find much. Just thought it would be really cool if they used the same filming locations/sets.          So I just got back and it was hilarious! Definitely not as classic as the original but found myself with uncontrollable laughter a lot! I know some people will see it differently but I really thought it was funny. Anyone else see it or want to know anything?   	102
 thank you very much for your "2 cents". :)      Hello everybody :)   This topic really keeps playing on my mind right now, but I didn't really wanted to post this question on facebook to get some answers. So I thought, why not ask my infp fellows here on reddit? It's the best place on earth!  Now sarcasm seems to be something where opinions tremendously differ on:  For some, sarcasm is extremly hurtful and with always a bad intention, an expression of verbally sadistic, narcisstic people (now don't get me wrong, this is definitely not my opinion).  For others, it's a way of communication, with which the sarcastic person is playing down his/her emotions verbally (to the outside), but still kind of hurt inside. By being sarcastic and playing down the feelings, the person is trying to kind of protect himself/herself from negative reactions.(Can you see this as an introverts trait?) But for some it just seems to be a humorous style with no bad intentions, or even an awesome kind of humor!   Please tell me what **you** think of it! :) Maybe you have a totally different opinion on sarcasm! I'm extremely curious to hear. :)   (I apologise in advance for any mistakes! Unfortunately, English is not my native language.)   Sounds awesome! I'm glad for you. :)   This helps me, too. :) Also, darkening the room and lots of fresh air!  	4
    Are you sure, you dont want the French taxi revolution.Lord knows that would mean a general purging of former Uber drivers, followed by a strongly worded letter from the UN   Indeed it is a totalitarian state in the eyes of completely credible news sources like The Sun and FOX news  Also did you hear batboy is back? Did you hear the US government is forcing bakers to lube guys up for gay orgies?  BUT ITS IN THE HEADLINES      what if America's sane and EVERYONE ELSE is insane?   Vermont into independence again!   because the Nazis were Japan.  	7
 RICKY!  I've worked with Dan alot, was always cool to me   Its probably the result of a penectomy.  Am I the only one here who's been to r/spacedicks?

 DAMN RIGHTWING WGBH shilling for the pipeline proponants   Its not really sexism, just human nature. There are plenty of guys that would hate a random dude who their SO mentioned was attractive. It's all rooted in insecurity.   Just laugh. It's completely jealousy. Hopefully sometime her husband is there and you can flirt with him.   Hey, no disrespect meant to any branch. I'm just trying to dispel the "durr, ure goining to military..u gonna bloww up in Irak" retardism I see all the time. The reality is that barring WW3 (which would suck for everyone) many military jobs are very safe and not very physically taxing.    men would rather die than kill  natural selection right there   Could have been Hungarians, Italians, Bulgarians, etc. as well.   I thought I saw a post on this forum a while ago talking about how they were sometime shot if they came back and the cockpits were sometimes locked shut.   Nah, did both   fack, I was probably in the most bullshit laden part of the military and I'm pretty much the same except some knee pain and a bunch of educational benefits.  If you wanna skip the whole danger/physical toll part there's always 90% of the air force and navy.   hell most people in the military don't like military culture   people living in a communal situation is hardly turning colleges into prisons   let me guess. you arent college educated?  Man, I don't really have a horse in this race but an undergrad saying something like that sure does make you sound like an entitled little shit   True enough, although it meant to support a college student...not a family.   Transferring isn't THAT difficult...and I'm sure people that got into UCB could get a lot of scholarships at less competitive universities. If 200 kids put in their papers to transfer it would make a lot more of a statement than sitting in a building.   yea not many people seem to consider the military option...the post 9/11 gi bill is a great deal   No I mean like a room with 20 or 30 people in bunk beds, hostel style.   IT WAS A JOKE!!!!!   Looking at the UCB website it looks like tuition and fees are roughly 13k and room and board are 14.5k. It seems like there would be some room to reduce costs in the room and board area. There should be an option for students to live in a large room on bunk beds and a lower cost dining hall that has less choices. Students willing to accept these conditions could have their room and board significantly reduced. This may or may not be feasible at USB but it would seem like a good choice to offer in cases where room and board cost more than tuition and fees. This is, of course, assuming that the billing model reflects cost of operations.   why?   private message sent...   So did you wake her up and say "hey, you pissed the bed.....it's okay, I'm not mad"   *thanks NATO   *crosses fingers and hopes Thai government establishes real Hunger Games   Sounds more like shit you buy in Chinatown than a "weapons shipment"   never stand up in court   ABLEISM!!! (stims furiously)   You should do what we do in the states....bus minorities from nearby poor districts so wealthy suburbanites can have a black kid in their english class.   OK, you're stupid   Yea, I'm not saying that lots of women might not feel this way, just that the one who do are stupid.   and that would be a stupid woman you don't want to date   That's more than slightly discriminatory. I'm one of the folks that thinks a lot of complaints about "discrimination" by anyone (men, women, white, black, etc.) are driven more by attention seeking and the desire to create controversy than any real problem. This is a real problem and pretty much the definition of sexism. You should do something about this.  This is fairly shocking to me, what country is this?    "Unfortunately, this doesnt display the results clearly enough". He then  summarily dropped his trousers and shorts, revealing a long, thin, clearly erect penis. There was not a sound in the room. Everyone had stopped breathing.  Science!      maybe they're just better at it ;)   Yea...I know, I'm just picking on France because it's the American Way. I suppose Egypt or Turkey (our "allies") would be more factual.   Good Guy USA: hooks you up with virgins in your area that want to fuck tonight!   I don't hate my parents....then again I'm also not France   Either this is a weird repost or there is an epidemic of this in the indian-american community http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2kzg83/i_am_pregnant_and_someone_sent_my_husband_a_sex/   In the Air Force or Navy you almost certainly wont   this is a great list   While the sentiment here seems to be "no shit" (and I agree that currently that is true) I think many here many be failing to appreciate that this has not always been the case. During the cold-war right-wing, left-wing, and nationalist ideologies inspired a large proportion of terrorist movements.   I'm a man. It depends on context. If I am walking at night in a not so great neighborhood I view all people as a threat until proven otherwise. This means constantly scanning to observe behavior and location, clearing corners carefully, moving confidently, and maintaining distance from unknown people. Clearly I assign a greater "threat index" to a large man than an elderly woman. If I'm in a crowded shopping mall my level of alertness is less.    WUT.... it's 2.85 in worcester   The UK these days with its extensive CCTV network, mass disarmament, and censorship seem to be the culmination of Orwell's vision.....with a dash of deference to muslim extremism.   The new wave of job openings means female Marines in active-duty artillery, tank, assault amphibian, combat engineer, combat assault, and low-altitude air defense battalions and an array of selected reserve units can now fill jobs at the company and battery level  I thought this was ABOUT women getting jobs in company level combat units....perhaps I misunderstood. I recognize they aren't in grunt units yet....but give it a few years. They're already sending them to ITB.   I'm not familiar with the TOE of every type of unit but infantry companies typically have a headquarters section with 4 enlisted (1stsgt, gunny, police sgt, and clerk) in reality it is usually expanded to a "headquarters platoon" which is squad sized and filled with people who are unwanted in the rifle or weapons platoons.   There's gonna be a whole bunch of "Headquarters Platoons" forming   Or that people have a financial interest in creating that impression.   It's jealousy, nothing more.    Thinking of it from a purely marketing perspective...its pretty clear there isn't a conspiracy against a drug for female sexual dysfunction. Clearly most women would like it........but I bet there are a lot of men with wives going through menopause that would really like it too. "Yo this pill will make your wife wanna fuck more!" is second only to "Yo this pill will make yo dick rock hard!" in terms of massive marketing potential to middle-aged men.   oh New Orleans.....the USA's little slice of the third world   twitter isn't that bad   well they DID get cut in half   Forget it Jake. It's Boston.   what's wrong with fake titties?   When I was a 17-year-old in 2001 it seemed pretty clear to me that you didn't want to take out big loans or study something that was unmarketable.    I was born in 1985 as well and heard plenty of the "do what you love," "just be yourself," "everyone is beautiful," BS advice the still predominates our mass media. I also realized that getting a degree field without a clear career path after graduation and taking out huge loans to do it was a bad idea. I turned down an Ivy League education because it would have required large loans. I studied STEM instead of history which I would have preferred. I guess I just don't get it...did other people's parents literally never tell them about money? Did people just assume any college degree meant a great paying job? We DID have the internet, newspapers, and books back in the day.    Widely used on Reddit is not the rest of the world. It has one entry on urban dictionary that makes reference to One Direction fans.    Sorry mom....  also....wtf is it with people on Reddit saying everything is "cringy"? Is this from the UK? The only people that talk like that in the US are preteen girls.   I hear they like it that way down in Brazil   America doesn't need you gay nerd laws UN. MURICA! USA USA USA   I'm sure the Germans will be able to find a solution   absolutely   and German is the largest ethnic group in America....so basically the Germans have mastered this race!   Then they can use money from their jobs to buy shitty food. There is no fucking "right" to Doritos paid for by the government.   God forbid they have a beer or a cigarette....but that doesn't mean the taxpayer should be directly funding it.    Damn Phil is 10 years deep in the friend zone and reaching his breaking point. I'd stay the fuck away from him.   In Afghanistan after one of our guys stepped on an IED and got blown in half. Running all over the scene setting up medical care, security, and calling for an evac. We didn't have time to carefully sweep for more IED's and they are usually planted in groups so I was just running around on my tiptoes whispering "fuckfuckfuck" to myself.   "There's a gun violence problem" Conservatives: "NO THERE ISN'T COMMIE!" because agreeing would imply there is something wrong with gun culture (a lot of their electorate)  "There is a gun violence problem in black culture" Liberals; "NO THERE ISN'T RACIST!" because agreeing would imply there is something wrong with black culture (a lot of their electorate)   NO it's only one party that's stupid   and the same thing happens from the other side when you break down the demographics of gun violence   Hmm, I stand corrected, it looks like NATO is doing more than I thought. I wish we were doing A LOT more.  both sides armed opposition fighters at least 20 times in the past 100 years  probably WAY more   Said ONE Ukrainian general and everyone denied it. I mean AFAIK the Russians have never confirmed supplying the separatists but it is very obvious looking at the hardware they have. On the other hand I haven't seen any obviously NATO equipment in the hand of the Ukrainian Army. Don't get me wrong, I wish NATO was suppling the Ukrainians but I haven't seen any evidence they are. If you have pictures or other info I would (seriously) be interested in seeing it.   HONEST question: Those charges SEEM to be applied to individuals who are not suspects lying to protect someone else. The federal charges seem to sometimes be applied to the suspect. Do I have a false impression of this?   It is against federal law to lie to the FBI (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements) But I can't seem to find any state level versions of this law. Why not?   I think this was the original use for "friend zone" ie. the guy that follows a girl around like a little puppy for years expecting her to one day jump into bed with him. One day said girl meets a guy and mr. "friend zone" gets butthurt, he professes his love for her, and she (reasonably) says something along the lines of "I think of you as a friend."  Guys that begin with a romantic interest and get rejected are not "friend zoned," they are rejected as others have expressed. This may be somewhat complicated when women say something like, "we can still be friends." Generally this may be seen as letting the guy down easy (although I'm sure it is sometimes sincere) but it can be confusing for soft-headed guys.    Well the Koreans have a similar version but age is the primary determining factor not who invited whom. I was suggesting culture contributes to social views, individual anecdota may vary.   I merely suggested that alternate views of individual responsibilities in a social interaction might be colored by the culture of the individuals involved. You seemed to be misunderstanding and getting upset. The culture is WASPs in NE United States.   We can't complain about people being rude?    In my culture the invited person should at least offer, for the host to ask them to pay would be rude.    Maybe she knows the picture is there, maybe she posted it. There is absolutely no upside to you making her aware of it. There IS a downside if she takes it the wrong way.   It may be cultural. In my culture if you are invited out to a meal you ALWAYS offer to pay your share, HOWEVER it is typically expected that the individual who offered the invitation will pay.   NATO arms the Ukrainians?   Welp, if you ever visit the USA ill buy you a beer   That's a lot of writing to miss the point entirely. I vote my own self interests, you cry like a baby on the internet. Looking at your posting history virtually everything is an anti-American diatribe. I smell inferiority complex. You also talk a lot of shit to anonymous strangers which suggests you are a coward that gets bullied a lot. Not far off base, huh?   That two intelligent people, based on the same facts, should reach the same conclusions   She referred you to a psychiatrist because she recognizes that your problems exceed her expertise in the area. She doesn't want to change your meds because if you show up to your psychiatrist and say "problems etc." and then explain that you just switched TWO mood altering medications it will make the psychiatrist's job that much harder.    depends on how much money they make   Yeah...these guys are TOTALLY gonna limit carbon emissions   Lets say hypothetically WMDs are out of the picture, America declares war on Russia, and Russia is exterminating all civilians in occupied countries.                     Around 830 last night there were 50-100 bicyclists riding against traffic in both lanes down River St. in Cambridge. Most of them did not have lights on and I about squished the first few before I saw them. Anyone know what this was about?                       	104
 This is from the early 1980's : http://imgur.com/A3l9gso  Full video here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JAJrZ1PTlw            Hello,  So far in my code i've set it up where I simply switch out my panels in my frame when I need to change what is shown on the screen. I've been looking at a few tutorials for making a 2D sidescrolling platformer game, but all of these tutorials start from scratch and i'm having trouble implementing them into my code.   Could someone give me some advice as to what would be the best way to go about this that dosen't require me to rewrite my code ?   http://www.mediafire.com/download/67iudjaxl5gfmmp/Game.zip those are my project files, if you need the actual images I can pm you them but i'd rather not make them public.  Thank you for any assistance!            It seems like they made such an effort to make the gameplay fun, but completely ignored any type of level/team balancing.   I've been listening to Alan Watts, and one thing he emphasizes is the getting rid of concepts like the past and the future. Perhaps i'm still stuck on semantics but then when are memories ? My train of thought leads me to believe that they are always in the present, but it doesn't make sense semantically.         Hi, unfortunately one of the modes on  the Quick Fire TK keyboard does not include only WASD, infact you can't even disable the backlights at all. It's really distracting when they're on and annoying having to turn off numlock every 2 minutes to use the keys. Any ideas ?   A few questions, i've recently been listening to Alan Watts talking about meditation, namely Zazen.   I'm wondering, do you keep your eyes open or closed ? I think I remember him saying that the monks would keep their eyes half open, as zazen's way is not to exclude any of the senses.   When doing the crouching position, do you sit on your heels (it's a bit uncomfortable, maybe it's meant to be that way ? ) or do you turn them on their sides ? I don't have the round pillow, only a small cushion which I sit on.   What do you concentrate on when meditating ? If someone could provide me a recourse or even better, explain it here, that would be awesome.  Thank's in advance.            Has anyone here had any experience on living in a Zen temple for an extended period of time ? I've had a hard time finding any monastery/temples that advertise anything past 7 day seshin's. Thanks!            Hi, I managed to get the first one downloaded but whenever I get to about 500mb on the second/third zip files (of the large one) the download will stop, saying : unable to finish the download. Even if I try to download it manually and install it through NMM it still wont download all of it.  Any ideas ?   Thanks in advance.   Cheers.   If it helps, i've fit a 6950 in there before. I'm using a CM 690 II and have a P67A-GD65 mobo. I'm currently looking at the DirectCU II model.  Thank you!         The sub plots are pretty silly, some of the characters are melodramatic and even the episodes can be a bit strange. But that's why I love it. It's such a good contrast for when they try to do the gut wrenching episodes such as when the doctor fell in love with Seven. It lifts some of the faux seriousness and in turn uses that to highlight the really excellent episodes and two parters. Thoughts ?       Looking to upgrade from my 6950 which i've been using for the past few years. I've already got an Accelero cooler on it (the card itself died) so either something that that would fit on or a card that comes with a built in aftermarket cooler. I've got a i5 25k@3.3ghz and 8gb RAM incase youre thinking something might bottleneck.  Thank you in advance!  EDIT : Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit,not sure where else to put it.   Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1  Mobo : MSI MS-7681  Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2500K CPU @ 3.30GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.3GHz  Memory: 8192MB RAM  GPU : NVIDIA 9400GT  Speedtest : 33ms,1.4 mb/s dl, .65 ul.  I used to have a 6950 installed but that very randomly died, so i've had to switch to a 9400gt until I can get a better gpu. Ever since I have youtube videos, even when fully loaded, will randomly pause. I've tested this in both firefox and chrome. Any ideas ?      Anyone have any idea who won/lost what ?      Let's assume that you had 1 year to learn as many languages as you want, what would they be and why ?   Let's assume that you're learning them to hopefully put them to use in a job of some sort.               Since the next show is Tuesday can you please upload them before then so that we all have a chance to catchup and watch the live stream ?  --EDIT-- I thought we'd have to watch the next one without the vods even being up. This is fine I guess as long as they're all up before the next one.   I always want to save my mana as ADC,mid or top. When can I use my mana to secure cs?  Is it always a better trade ?         Hi, regarding ability scores like someones chance to learn or fail a spell how do you work out if they succeed ? Say if it's 80% to fail a spell, do they fail if they roll a d100 and get less than 20% ? Or does the DM just decide arbitrarily ? Thanks! (I'm playing on 2e)   Hey,  So i've been watching a really awesome D D series called 'RollPlay' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsFwQMjeWuo). I know that the DM is running on 2e. How hard would this be to get into with no experience of D D ?   I'd probably be the DM for 2 or 3 other friends. Would it become pretty clear how they do it if I were to start out with 4e first ? I really like how it's more story/ 'theatre of the mind' (as described in the sidebar) rather than combat oriented (although the combat does seem a bit drab). Maybe it would be a better idea to go with 4e with a more freeformed gridless play like they did ?   He describes in this post how he's changed the rules of the original 2e to sort of update it : http://www.reddit.com/r/itmejp/comments/196d2n/rollplay_wrap_up_for_week_2_campaign_info_plus_qa/c8lfeum  Cheers for any help or advice!     ???      Destiny is there any chance of you switching up your LoL/Sc2 for EU viewers like 3 days of the week (or even 1 or 2, just make sure we know them that we can tune in) ? I never get to watch any Sc2 because it's so late.    I really don't know much about US Politics but i was under the impression that it wasn't a religious country ? Did he just say that to appeal to the religious majority ?   I remember seeing these quotes on the Newsroom, "As the government of the United States is not, in any sense founded on the Christian religion--" -John Adams (The Treaty of Tripoli)  "...that our civil rights rights have no dependence on our religious opinions.." - Thomas Jefferson  "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." - First Amendment  EDIT : Just realized that the title might be a bit unclear, by a 'religious country' I mean not that the majority of it's population might be religious (which may or may not be the case, idk) but that the country is and always will be a religious nation, founded 'under God'.         Iv'e got an ATI ScanFX (UK brand) 6950, and I put an aftermarket Accelero Xtreme cooler on top of it because it was just making way to much noise and heat. It's on 1100mV Voltage, 800MHz core clock, 1250MHz Memory clock.   When watching a 1080p movie the fan bumps up to 80% speed, and the fan stays at 90deg. Even on some older games like Darksiders 1 it ends up ovearheating (although I can run bioshock infinite on low for hours on end). My question is, is the fan speed/heat normal ? It's still pretty loud when it's on full load. Maybe i'm expecting too much. Thanks!  Also looking for some help to upgrade this some time in the future, made a thread on /r/buildapc (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1bdzhe/upgrading_2_year_old_pc/) if any of you don't mind looking at that.   Hey, wondering what/when I should start upgrading my build ? I can only play bioshock infinite on low and i'd like to play that and other games like that on high in the future. My current build :  Intel Core i5-25000k @ 3.3GHz (Never got around to overclocking it, how much would it affect gaming ?)  8GB(2x4GB) Corsair XMS3 DDR3 PC3-10  Coolermaster CM 690 II Advanced  1GB ScanFX HD 6950, PCI-E 2.0 (x16)  Accelero Xtreme 6950 Cooler  620W Seasonic S12II-620 Bronze  Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD3-B3, Intel P67  Coolermaster CM 690 II  Like I said I can run most games that came out in the past year on high/ultra, just want to futureproof for 2~ more years. Probably just looking for a better GPU, something like a 7979 or a 680 ? Cheers.   So what's the difference between OSL/GSL/GTSL/KeSPA PL/Proleague and WCS ? (Especially what's the difference between the korean ones ?). What's the difference between a season/yearly pass to GSL ?   AFAIK GSL is just comprised of Groups A-H, and then they fight it off and then it's done, is that just one season then they repeat it 4 times orrr ?   Should I buy a season or a yearly ticket if i want to watch it to the grand finals ? Thank you!  Edit : thanks everybody for the help      **N.B. None of the below means anything if this is just temporary and will stay temporary. The reason i'm making this thread is (as the title suggests) because I have a *lack* of information.**   I think people will agree that his twitch chat is definitely one of the most entertaining things to be around or even participate in.   Taking away the large majority of people's ability to chat is really off putting for me to be on his stream now. Now you can relate this to why he switches games, to get more money (At least afaik, maybe twitch admins are the real nazis?) but at least that doesn't hinder the actual 'experience' of being on destiny's channel (please stop me if this gets too meta edgy for you). It's so much more entertaining when he pulls of a crazy 1v3 and the whole chat explodes, retards and all.  Edit : In anticipation of 'why don't you just join raidcall', I want to be able to open his twitch page and directly talk to him. There's also the problem of annoying as fuck adverts (I have both of stevens stream pages whitelisted on adblock). mini tldr: practicality.  Edit 2 : Has anyone noticed how fucking boring the twitch chat is now ?  Edit 3 : Nice idea by Janeway, " Subscriber Janeway_ta: I am all for raidcall chat being his go-to chat. I think that's totally cool, it allows him the control he needs and gives people a way to talk to him. But censuring Twitch chat seems to me to be counterproductive. Rather than trying to enforce an artificial level of decorum in Twitch chat, I think he should just go completely hands-off twitch." I like the idea of having two chats, one that might have more 'decorum' as previously described, possibly not hands off but maybe just the Dharma bott to stop actual spammers.   tl;dr Chat integral part of lay destiny experience. Back pls. #naziamerica #basedtwitchat      Just saw this post on the euw forums, http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1098231 seems like somebody that's going to just make account after account to troll deserves an ip ban??      I know there's a reading list however the list of pretty short and they seem like quite heavy reading. I was looking also for something a bit more focused on the problem of evil ? Or maybe someone could suggest a good introduction ? Cheers.    It's just a tad confusing but from what I can see it really depends on your standpoint, for instance, if you take up that all scientific theories can be reduced to being logically primitive (you can't explain the scientific law behind the scientific law behind the scientific law etc etc, it all has to be un explainable somewhere down the line) then I assume this makes it theory ? And then the standard pragmatist atheist would believe it fact because of the evidence ?  Thanks for any help.   Hey, just wondering in what school/sub-school my viewpoint would fit in. The belief that God (or a deity if you will) created the universe, but does not interact with it in any way. So all he was there for was to create the universe, either he dissapeared or he might as well have. I would side with the standard deistic ideals but i'm not sure I agree that observing the natural world is enough to prove the existence of God.  I could be misunderstanding things whereas the whole idea of God creating the natural world means that he existed ? Not quite sure on that part. Thanks!   Title, thanks!   Recently watched Day[9]'s funday monday on HotS units (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7GLSKThYYQ) and it looks really fun, anyone know of any giveaways or preorders I can do (i'm in the UK) to get one ? Thanks!      I wanted to ask if anybody here knows anything about getting a job in applied ethics ? The only thing I can think of is being on an ethics committee, if so what did you study to get it ? How hard are they to get ? Or even something that's as close to getting a job in philosophy as applied ethics. Thanks !         Curious because of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5OaDzGWhFk feature=youtu.be the guy obviously gets tackled and maybe injured, could he have defended himself with reasonable force without getting arrested ? Of course they have it on video.       Some games including Serious sam (the new one) darksiders 1, COD Black ops cause my PC to crash after about 10~ minutes of gameplay, first the video goes then the audio and I have to reset it to get my PC to work again. I'm on quite a good machine :   AMD 6950 @ 1920x1080  i5 25k not overclocked  8gb ram  MSI-7681  DX11, latest graphics drivers (just checked)   Good cooling system, idle temp is 42c, at first I thought it was just cooling but even some games like Civ 5 which cause my gpu to run at 100% I can play for hours with no trouble, while an older and less graphically intensive game like darksiders does. Any ideas ? Best thing I can come up with is that some engines cause my gpu to overheat/crash. Any help welcome! Thanks!

Blurb~~~~ Hi, thanks for clicking on this and if you will, taking the time to read what I wrote.

I wasn't really happy with my character names  but they will do. Of course any critique is welcome, whether it's on the story, the descriptive parts or just how I write. Could you tell who was telling the story and did you expect the ending to be what it was ? Thanks.~~~~    The Cat.    They say behind every great man theres a greater woman. Sure.  Its remains sat still on the warm, sticky tarmac, the stench of lifelessness emanating like burnt toast from a morning fresh kitchen. So much emotion, all in a smell.       They chose the poor thing for one reason  selfishness. Their desire for an emotional attachment to a soul that wouldnt judge them, that wouldnt give up if they forgot to do the washing up, or left the oven on. That is what makes them despicable, fate didnt neglect its need for food or its predatory instincts, I didnt put in a cage like some bacteria under a microscope. No. They did. And that is what makes them the most despicable creatures I created.             Their journey starts at the pet shop. A family of three, leading the way is the father, Tom. Short, about five foot nine, slick short, curled back black hair and the swagger to match it. The epitome of my perfection. Retreating behind him is the mother, Mary-Anne. For the purpose of this story no description is nessacary. All you need to know is that she was a coward and by far the worst example of a human being I could possibly give, envy and loathing were second nature to her cruel mind. Last is the son of the family, George. He plays the largest role, the protagonist of our short story. 10 Years old, brown hair like his mother and blue eyes like his father.    Their family was, at best, lower middle class. Tom worked for the Ontario police force           Chief Detective Tom Hilde Roberts. Mary-Anne stayed at home, looking after the dishes, the carpets and the child. The child, yes, George was George  he was the innocent in this.    So, back to the pet shop. As they walked in the squeals of creatures echoed, from the squeaks of mice to the moans of cats and dogs, innocently being pawned off. Lucky for them (and us) they were not aware of this. The Roberts had gone out looking for a cat, Tom was the leader in this little endeavour, and where he went Mary-Anne followed.    George, of course, being the child that he was, was ecstatic! A wonderful, fluffy, cute new friend to play with. The three of them walked up to the cats and before Tom could finish his word George leapt out from the cover of his father and said that one! They agreed on this, and soon enough took the cat home along with the full set of amenities.     This cat was black, from head to paw, eyes like deep black Obsidian gemstones, always heavy on the human heart, always joyful. Persuading humans was second nature to her.  You havent seen a cuter animal than this.     She would look up at you, as if she was inquiring as to the nature of her existence  George would look back, with his curiosity peaking he was in a very similar situation, just on a different scale. They were perfect for each other, thats why they had to be split up; or at least thats what Mary-Anne thought.    You cant just have that cat as a friend, I wont let you. Im your mother and I wont allow such an unhealthy relationship to continue she used to say. Weeks passed, Mary-Anne when she was at home would look back at the cat in a completely different way. Instead of looking at the cat like George, filled with curiosity, she despised the thing. Mary-Anne saw the cat as something that was dismantling their precious family. Of course this family didnt exist. A simple creation of Mary-Annes imagination, of course she believed this, and thats all that mattered.    The calendar read June 7th, everybody and everything was relatively normal for a Saturday, half the time Tom would have to spend his Saturday at the office, this was one of those days. George ,Mary Anne and the Cat where home. George was playing very innocently with the Cat, with a smile on his face and laughter coming from his room. His mother called him down to do his chores, first up was taking out a relatively small rubbish bin. George passed through the kitchen and his mother, who was at the time drying off the dishes, saw his smile. She turned her head in anguish and gave out a negative hmph,  turning her head back to the attention of the sink.    George returned from the garden, twilight was beginning to set over the suburban city blocks, giving any sounds or locomotion a dim calm. This was about to be shattered. George returned into the kitchen. Mary-Anne watched him come in from the cold. She tried to make herself believe she cared for him. She didnt. Mary-Anne saw his neutral-ness turn into a smile. She turned her head to see George and Cat connecting in the happiness that they had. She shouted. Bellowed from the top of her lungs. Anger in its purest form was let out. GET OUT ! GET OUT OF MY SIGHT ! She pointed to the door as Georges smile turned into a frown.   George ran outside in the simple sadness that a child could have. He ran to the front door ,eyes filled with tears. The portal opened, he ran.. Heart beating like never before. George covered his eyes to wipe the tears off, to clear his vision. Too late.    Its remains sat still on the warm, sticky tarmac, the stench of lifelessness emanating like burnt toast from a morning fresh kitchen. So much emotion in a smell.   So Tom sat, holding George on the  road of his sons final resting place. A heartbroken expression was conveyed to Mary-Anne, eyes and mouth big. She stood in the doorway,  washing up gloves and all. Minutes passed as Tom simply starred at her, as if to say you. As if to act surprised.   Sure.

I've never actually had any formal philosophy education so my thoughts are sort of everywhere (and iv'e read on this sub-reddit that philosophy helps you to organize thoughts and concepts) so if anybody could help me out just to develop this, or drive it into the ground if it's flawed (tbh there's probably a good chance it is) please feel free to.

 I'm a contractor. I can lie about being sick anytime and not get paid for it.    And a butt!    Your mom doesn't call because she knows you touch yourself.    Excellent!  I have 37 new bond ideas the Austin taxpayer will happily pay for before they have any idea what it actually does.    It started with his love of bracelets.  Then he built a career around it.    I think you've had enough carbs for today. Don't you?    At Walgreens I found Phillips Colon Health with a 1.5 billion cell blend of L Gasseri KS-13, bifodobacterium bifidum G9-1 and bifodobacterium longum  MM-2.   Does that sound sufficient?    Wow.  You'd better have a little talk with your manager and find out where all that electricity comes from that you plug your little computer into.  (Lots of it is coal.)  Also, that chair you're sitting in isn't manufactured by wind energy.  Those lights above you?  I have some bad news about the manufacturing process.  You want the technology but don't want to think about where all the energy required to produce it originates from.  But sometimes symbolism is WAY better than actual substance.   What dollar amount would that require of me for an upfront investment to become partially liberated from the grid?   Perhaps you have vested interests in the technology industry.   Is that why they'd have to pay your trinkets made off the back of the planet from your cold dead hands?    Damn! That was awesome!    http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg302/Natalya_suicide/gifsss/dutchridergif.gif   If the kid is retarded enough not to actually spell out the entire name of the game, he deserved it.   Nope. Because I wouldn't be preaching that a byproduct is what makes an industry evil as you might say. Do you feel guilty for having a phone?    People used to make a great living and entertain themselves without any of the stuff you mentioned. Actually, some still do. You just choose to use modern technologies for your own comfort it sounds to me. You choose not to do without.   I'd be willing to bet that you're even involved in an industry that not only utilizes said carbon unfriendly ends but that perpetuates the usage of them. Basically, it seems you're willing to use up the earth's resources for your own devices but at a slightly slower rate.   So sad. So hypocritical.   Man.  People used to exist just fine without computers.  Apparently you crave modern convenience without all the consequences.   Don't tell me you have a phone too...    Yeah, but do realize how much petroleum those individual commuter parts take to manufacture? I would just give up your computer.    Never has the thought, "Need help?  Find a mosque!" ever crossed my mind.    Ooooooh man, computer huh?   http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html   Sure! As long as you don't actually make use of any of those terrible petroleum byproducts in your daily life.    I just assumed you walk everywhere. What's more important? Saving the Earth or saving yourself some struggle by using petroleum based transportation?   That way you can still preach to those that do and be in the clear.    How do you get around?    Gosh! You're saying that not everyone has done that yet?  Evil evil.    Maybe that's because right now it doesn't pay for itself.    Yeah. Groups of people are just inherently evil because of their position on the planet!    I look forward to seeing your 20 new news channels dedicated to all of the world's iniquities.    /s  I was being facetious in my comment.    Well good. Hopefully you're not so hypocritical as to ride in or drive a car at any time or wear or use items made with petroleum byproducts.    Oh no. I do. I also don't admonish people for doing the same.    Which has had more world impact?   Prrrrrrrobably Syria.  By about a mile or so.    Solar powered jets!    Number 13 will make you shit your toilet / Jew hiding place.    Apparently not enough for capitalists to smell money in them yet and hence the non payoff.    Bigger ongoing stories. Pretty simple really.    I guess we should dedicate an entire channel to wronged people in third world shit holes. It would probably require 10 channels going  24 hours a day.    If you're not against being surveiled you're for it. I assume you are standing on a street corner with a protest sign every day.    Eh, it happens hundreds of times every single day in those countries.    The US would only be condemning acts if that were true.    "We" is right. I assume you support your local oil fracker or have come up with a sustainable alternative energy.    Finger right on the pulse.    "Ships from Japan in 28-51 days??"    He still makes him touch him inappropriately.    My computer only loaded half the image.                                        As a conservative, I have gained a greater awareness of the problem of crony capitalism and money in politics as pertains to both parties as well as corporations and unions, etc.                                                                                 At the beginning of this month I re-signed a new, 10-month lease with my apartment complex.  I had been having my lease paid with an auto-deduct from my bank account previously and had been out of town from 6/27-7/7 while another apt resident came by to walk and take care of my dog every day.  Today I was gone all day and left my door unlocked since I'd misplaced my key in my luggage.  When I got home the door was locked and I had to pay a locksmith $150.  There was a notice to vacate for non-payment of rent, utilities, etc. charging me with unpaid rent plus $160 in late fees.  I guess that by re-signing the auto-deduct was not in effect but I didn't know that.  The dog walker said there were no notices from the apt complex on the door while I was gone and I did not receive any phone calls from them about my missing rent.  I even went into the office to temporarily borrow a mail key and a guy working there said nothing to me about anything.  I have not discussed anything with the apt complex yet and have never been late on rent before.  The notice dated today 7/9 states that I have to be out on 7/12.  PLEASE HELP!                                                                                                                          	122
 They probably want to avoid a lawsuit/shitshow.   /muricanhere   All true   It's a copycat industry.  Sometimes it takes a little longer to step up their copying game.    Ecoboost balls.   Satire doesn't require an accent.   Not true.     http://th05.deviantart.net/fs12/200H/i/2006/289/0/8/mitch_hedberg_by_xsindicatex.jpg   The twist: they're placebos.   Blasphemy   Is $1100 worth the trouble and risk?    Now look at all the people who aren't upset.  They're less vocal.    The show's main stars are the cars.    The only thing different is that the show isn't advertiser driven, so they can openly criticize and mock companies like Ford, Porsche, whoever.   Serena Malyon  http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/van-goghs-paintings-get   There's a reason why ODB had 13 children.   Ha.  I thought he just smashed the top tube first then tried sawing it thinking it could be welded back.  I'm guessing he pulled it from the trash (hence the rebar bike stand) or purchased from a police auction where they overbid crap.  I think a professional thief/seller would pull the parts and sell it or put them on another frame.  Maybe I like to think we live in a world where thieves are a bit more savvy.   Rip   "fart" - brain   Does age matter to you that much?  You sound like my sister playing the maturity card.  I just don't think comedy has an 100% approval rating.    He was funny when he cracked on Jim Norton for having a mancrush on Dice.  "Hey Jimmy you want to go to the mall together, ohhhh!" in Dice's voice.   Name one funny thing he's said or did besides hacky race comedy which is rarely funny?   The old oversell   He's a character, not really a comedian nor really funny.   Hannibal is genuinely funny especially in The Eric Andre Show and 30 Rock.   "No" - Bill   Helmets and pads also teach humility.   The developments in the technology of selling and delivering technological goods is important.  Dealers are made into useless middlemen by the internet.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_reversal   They've known for years   Done by a puppet?   It's heroic and sad.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell   Buying a Ford car is kinda like suicide.  That's how they became the best selling truck.   This was an episode of Mindfreak with Cris Angel   I think it's more than plausible he's gay.  You probably can't be openly gay to be on a shitty family sitcom.  He can date and marry much further up the Hollywood food chain yet chooses Diane.  Like he's not interested.  His apartment has all butts.  Not sure of the sex of those butts.   http://i.imgur.com/47fiXHZ.jpg    Bojack doesn't exactly act like a horse, man.    Dogs can also be gay.   There's a lot of girls who look like that around classic car clubs.  Whatever works for them.  edit: and tattoo conventions   Modded to the point of consored.      Dat inside info.  I think he knows all the gym, training, personal life gossip with all these fighters.   I forgot this was /r/nfl where everything is serious business.  Yes, I know who Howe is.  Met him once.  He didn't act like a star just an ambassador for the sport.  I thought that was great.  He's big.  Especially for an 'old timer'.    Up high the backlight of these things blind you a bit at night.    Navigation screens just suck shit in general.  I'd rather have it all dark inside looking out into a well lit path.     Does nothing.  A picture is a snapshot of nothing.    A video tells another story.  You can send that to their safety director and that will do something.  They also talk to all the other safety directors in the area and nationwide.  Semi drivers are on a schedule.  They might not want to drive like shit, but are kinda pushed to.   They don't care.  Unless it effects them financially.     Abuse of power still comes as no surprise.   Lay and pray   Gordie Howe, eh?  Never heard of him.  It was actually Gordie who signed for less because the Red Wings "weren't making money" and had to sign his teammates too.  Then they leaked Lindsay's contract that was inflated to discredit him and his attempts to unionize.  Howe became a household name.  Lindsay got railroaded by politics.   Scrolling past something you've already seen is hard.   There's a hockey movie about how the Red Wings did pretty much the same thing.  As far negotiating salaries.  They won the Stanley Cup then traded away their best player at the time because he tried to start a union.    http://www.amazon.com/Net-Worth-Aidan-Devine/dp/B0000D9BCU   /r/mma is worth checking out.    UFC needs hype-worthy "name" fighters to survive.  Rousey is one of the last one's left.  Concussions, PEDs, gruesome injuries kill their talent quickly.  They pipelined a woman's division for Rousey.  I think she's a bandage to buy time for the UFC to clean up their men's side.   The business side of UFC is more interesting than the fighting.  The hyping of Rousey in lieu of all the men getting popped for drugs is pure magic.   snap(s)   Gerald and his fanboys can never compete with Apple and theirs.   /r/conspiracy   More time to roid up.   This is the catcher.  Cobb spiked him in his arm effectively ending his major league career.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krichell   It has performance enhancing benefits.  https://barbellnation.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/nicotine-great-drug-or-greatest-drug/   It just seemed like they pandered to the audience.

But looking at the shit he sells on his site.  He's just a goofball gym guru.  http://www.maxwellsc.com/steve-maxwell-dvds.cfm   Maybe this is the reason NBC didn't want it.

I think it's all trial and error.    /r/skincareaddiction is worth checking out   and this:  http://www.earthclinic.com/cures/broken-capillaries-treatment-folk-medicine.html   I listen to his podcast on mute.     Keep going.   Sounds like karma - based moderation.   Where?   Friends probably has a younger demographic.  Younger customers equals longer term customers.   I prefer the .gif explanation.  Magic.

Dennis Duffy dummies.   As long as they sound like a band with a cool name: shit.   If they have the same plot, sure.   I think a moving picture meant to be entertaining is pretty similar to another moving picture meant to be entertaining.   If velocity and angles and striking position and legitimate goal scoring chances don't matter, then yes you are correct.

I don't think deadspin has any reverence for the NFL nor sports in general.   Is it open to the public?  I've only been in the lobby.   NFL players don't last that long anyway.

       Hey guys, I know there are the two movie theaters in Morrisville that do $5 movies (one on Tuesday and the other between 4-6 everyday.) Does anyone know of any other places around the triangle that has special discounts on certain days or shows cheap movies?   EDIT: Awesome responses guys - thanks!    Since a lot of people are coming in with a couple of thousand words written, consider using this additional rule for the challenge: extra words written in a certain week don't carry over. So even if you have 1,000 words written and you are ahead for week 1 (100 words written), this count doesn't carry over and you STILL have to write 200 words for week 2.   Just my two cents.     You'll have to make a copy of it for yourself, but here's the [link to the word count tracker.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFevF2WQhWsdEN6VEVtWnJfQVpUanZGaHFGNE5sLUE usp=sharing)   For example, the default is "readers", but subs like /r/archerfx it says "Duchesses" instead.

Consider using the additional rule on the sidebar if you are far ahead but want to keep on pace with the rest of the community.   You can refer to [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFevF2WQhWsdEN6VEVtWnJfQVpUanZGaHFGNE5sLUE usp=sharing) to keep track of your word count. The column on the furtherest right is the cumulative word count.   **TL;DR up top: I invite everyone to join me on my 52 Week Writing Challenge. Every week you will write 100 more words than the week before... so that at the end of 52 weeks of continuous writing, you will have produced 137,800 written words, equivalent to a 500+ novel.**  It's simple: start small, build a routine, form the habit, and WRITE.  We're all aspiring writers here. But it's not a secret that it's hard to find time to sit down and actually commit to writing after a long day at the office or a long night of homework and so you tell yourself "Oh, I'll do it tomorrow". Well, eventually tomorrow turns into next week and next week turns into next month, and sure enough - *another year has gone by*.   But there's Nanowrimo you say. True, but for someone who writes a few thousand words every couple of months, the idea of finishing 50,000 words in one month is *absolutely daunting*. That's an average of 1,666 words everyday!  So how exactly do we become comfortable with doing this? Practice. Routine. You do it so many times that your brain just does it unconsciously and naturally. Think about it... from touch typing in the dark to playing the unmarked strings of a violin, these are not things that were picked up or developed in a day. It was drilled in through sheer repetition and routine. That's what I hope to accomplish this year with my writing challenge.   Start small. No one started by playing Beethoven concertos... we all have to begin with Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or Mary Had a Little Lamb or something equally mundane. Start small and easy and repeat and gradually build on it.    So I was inspired by the slew of new year's posts on reddit by proud people who had just completed the 52 Week Money Challenge (which was in turn originally inspired by the following [blog post](http://savingabuck.com/2013/01/try-the-52-week-money-challenge-for-2013/).) I decided to tweak this for my own purposes.   **So it's simple.** Week 1, you will write 100 words. Easy-peasy, right? Awesome. Week 2, you will write 200 words. Psh, still easy. Week 3, write 300 words... you see where I'm going with this right? **Every week you will write 100 more words than the week before... so that at the end of 2014 and at the end of 52 weeks of continuous writing, you will have produced 137,800 written words, equivalent to a 500+ novel.**  **With that said, I would like to invite everyone here at /r/writing to join me in this challenge.**  So at the end of this year, **we** will all not only have written a complete novel but more importantly we will have developed a consistent weekly routine of writing so that the next 100,000 words will come so quickly and so simply we will look back and wonder what exactly was holding us back all those years ago.   Personally, I'll be starting a [blog](http://52weekwritingchallenge.blogspot.com/) to chronicle this (mis)adventure though I will be posting to this subreddit regularly as well. I'm putting myself out there so that I might feel some sort of accountability on my part to actually stick this out throughout the rest of the year.   For those who want to keep track of their writing and word counts throughout the year, here is a copy of a [simple template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsFevF2WQhWsdEN6VEVtWnJfQVpUanZGaHFGNE5sLUE usp=sharing) I created for myself. You can copy and paste it onto your own file if you want to use it.  (I know it's already 1/16 and we've already missed the first two weeks worth of writing! Well, I will be doing a little catch up this week to catch up to week 3, but feel free to start your challenge ANY TIME and go for 52 weeks!)   EDIT: So some people have expressed interest in creating a separate group to track progress and/or engage with each other. Personally, I will only posting snippets but I think checking in with each other to make sure we're all on track is a good idea. If you are interested, **please join /r/52wkwritingchallenge**! Otherwise, feel free to use the google spreadsheet above to track your progress yourself!  EDIT 2: Since a lot of people are coming in with a couple of thousand words written, **consider using this additional rule for the challenge: extra words written in a certain week don't carry over.** So even if you have 1,000 words written and you are ahead for week 1 (100 words written), this count doesn't carry over and you STILL have to write 200 words for week 2.      Any help would be greatly appreciated. Any HA and IVs would be an awesome bonus! Females are preferred - thanks!!    Female preferred for Vulpix and Snivy. Male preferred for Sandshrew. Any HAs or IVs would be awesome but I'm totally cool with whatever.   Thanks!!       Any recommendations on brands would be helpful. My current pair  was given to me by my mom but sadly it has no labels (and they are completely ruined). I also own 2 pairs of very opaque tights from Express, but I'm looking for something that's more semi opaque.

I'm already on asiatorrents, but content is pretty limited. I'm looking for several 80s-90s TV shows and a long time ago, there was a Chinese tracker that I used but that before the Chinese government cracked down on trackers and that site got shut down. I haven't really kept up with the different trackers since then - just looking for some pointers. Thanks!    See other thread for details. PM me for the address.       It's being aired as a global simulcast starting at 2:50 PM tomorrow on BBC America.   I thought it might be fun if some people wanted to get together to watch. Let me know if there's any interest.                 Anyone interested in another Arkham Horror night? I'll have printed rule sheets for everyone to use as a reference.   Can be at my place this time now that's not a complete mess of moving boxes.             Hey guys, looking for some players to have fun and chill with while playing zombies. Looking for good team players who want to go far and who are 18+.    Amazingly a google search did not turn up anything. Here are some of the lyrics: "high and low i've traveled / far and wide i'd go / from the desert track to the mountain side". The chorus has a bit with "traveling alone". It sounds a bit Johnny Cash-esque.  Someone said it might be original content. Anyone have any ideas?  Link here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lncRSnc6AQ8      I couldn't really tell from the information provided on the website. Thanks!    Anyone know of any place showing this live on Sunday on a big screen?   Anyone know of any place showing this live on Sunday on a big screen?      Just watched that video of the guy waking up post-surgery - apparently this behavior is quite common. (Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqebEymqFS8) Reddit, what are your best/funniest post surgery stories of your friends, SOs, family members or yourself?    Long story short: I bought a short sale house that was empty for at least 8 months before I moved in. This is the sad state of my front yard (the back yard is actually fine which is weird). The front of the house faces southeast. Since it's mostly weed than grass, I guess torching it all and replanting would be my best bet. But I have zero experience and I'm also a small female person - what should my plan of action be?  Pics: http://imgur.com/a/OChgR#IjpfmHL  Thanks for any help!      As mentioned above, I pulled up the vinyl and the underlayment and almost none of the staples came up with the boards. Do I need to remove all of these staples or can I just pound them into the subfloor and go about putting my cement board on top?   Thanks!!   EDIT: The staples are super long and can't just be pried up with strength alone. They were stapled in 1-2 inch intervals. So far, I've been using the corner of the back end of a hammer to wiggle them up.    I'm thinking maybe Wed or Thurs night? But I'm open to suggestions. Looking for 2-4 more players.   EDIT: Meet at 8 PM tomorrow at /u/Bio-ScienceGuy's place.          I love this seasoning, just wondering if anyone knew what's in it. I tried looking up the ingredients and I couldn't really find anything.   This is what I'm referring to: http://www.amazon.com/Prudhommes-Magic-Seasoning-Blends-24-Ounce/dp/B0000CDBRN   Hey guys, I just bought a house with no appliances so I'm looking into buying a whole set (stove, fridge, washer, dryer, etc). I've applied for two credit cards with good sign up bonuses (Chase Sapphire Preferred/Citi AA) but I'm wondering if there's any other ways I can rack up some good points or rewards while I'm doing all that. I'm most likely going to be buying at Lowe's/Home Depot. Anyone know of any good coupons for these stores?       Hey all - I recently bought a short sale and it was sold as-is with some issues to the upstairs AC. It's not blowing cold air and I got a service guy to come out and he said there was a leak and I was low on roughly two pounds of refrigerant (it's a 2.5 ton split unit). He also said it was most likely the coil which would cost roughly $1500 to replace (and I did not have him perform the leak search.) The guy said I could try to fill it up with refrigerant but if the leak was bad, it would just quickly leak out again.   My question is this - since the house was unoccupied (and power was shut off) for about 6-8 months before I moved in do you guys think that the leak is actually somewhat small and it was mostly due to the AC being off for a long period of time? (The guy told me that ACs with leaks will actually lose more refrigerant when off as opposed to on.) I was thinking of just adding some refrigerant for now to get it up and running. I have alot of other house related expenses and I'd rather not repair for $1500 or replace for $5000...   Also, bonus question - I got quoted $5300 for a 13 SEER Carrier and $6900 for a 16 SEER Carrier (in Raleigh, NC). Are those prices somewhat in line with what's to be expected? Also, heard prices for replacement might be cheaper in the fall - should I hold off if I do elect to go the replacement route? How much cheaper would it be?   Thanks for any help with this!    Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/bMm5B  First is the shower - it looks like someone used caulk maybe instead of grout here? What is the proper way to remove and re-do using proper materials?   Second, the bathtub has a small missing ding in it. What's the best way to fill it and cover up? It's on the far side of the tub so water leakage isn't a major concern.       Resubmitting as text post:   Deck pics: http://imgur.com/a/xJpMa  A little background: house was built in 1999, no structural issues.   1. Would I be able to to just replace the warped boards by removing the individual boards and getting a new piece to replace at say Lowe's? Is this as simple as it getting them up and screwing in new boards? 2. What is the best way to seal the deck and prevent this from happening in the future?  EDIT: Bottom of the deck: http://imgur.com/a/xtzzj      Hi guys,   I'm about to close on my first house and the first thing I want to do (before I put appliances in) is tile the kitchen. I'm a total DIY beginner but I have been reading up and watching videos on the tiling BUT I just want to run through my plan and ask questions beforehand to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just for reference, house is from 1999 so fairly new.   Currently there is vinyl in the kitchen (which looks like is over plywood - http://imgur.com/AGbdy4t ):  1. Score vinyl with utility cutter.  2. Peel up.  3. Remove plywood (EDIT: someone said there's probably plywood there and needs to be removed)   Now for actual flooring:   1. Use modified thinset between subfloor and Ditra. Spread and stick it on.  2. Use non-modified thinset above between Ditra and tile. (But must use latex additive for porcelain tile? Does it apply to ceramic as well?)   Some general questions:   1. How long does it take to dry between all the layers? I've heard it takes awhile - up to a week? 2. How do I tile around/cut the tile to work for this vent? (By the window - http://imgur.com/3o1Zk0W) I have read some stuff about using a wetsaw, but is there no other way to do it? I am planning on using a snapper. 3. I am planning on doing a diagonal pattern, are there any guidelines or suggestions where to start? (For example, for just straight squares it is recommended you start in the center and work outwards.)  4. If I decide to go with Wonderboard instead, do I need pay attention to how I screw it down? Or just evenly spaced works?   I would also like any recommendations on the following tools:   -Tile snapper (or saw if that's better)   -Modified Thinset (Someone recommended Versabond)   -Unmodified Thinset (Someone recommended Laticrete ? on the actual one)   -Places to buy cheap tile? (The best I've found is .86 ceramic tile that's on sale at HD)   Is there anything else I've forgotten or failed to think of?   Thanks for any and all help!!   I'm about to close on a house that doesn't have any appliances so I need to purchase a full set of everything. I've been checking out the Lowe's clearance section and general outlet/scratch   dent places. I stumbled on this rebate - wondering how good this deal is/how often Lowe's does stuff like this? Should I be jumping on this deal?   Link here: http://img.rewardpromo.com/1/1638/3813.pdf          1. Do they attack all players once one player goes into the house?  2. How often can you go back through the house and get the free perk? Someone said it's whenever the lights go back on?  3. Is there a set number of times they come after you?  4. Do they always come from the front until you leave the house?   Thanks!                 Wondering if it would be feasible idea to offer up unwanted items on the subreddit before you guys trash or donate them. I'm sure there are people on here who would love your unwanted items and even pay you to ship it to them. What do you guys think?          This is working really well for The Last of Us Factions so I figured it would be great for zombies as well:   **Link: http://us11.chatzy.com/86155072157619**   Please make your username the following format:   *Username[System/Mic or No Mic/Time Zone/Age]  *Example: mrmariobro[PS3/Mic/EST/24]     Hey guys, I used to read a lot of manga when I was high school, but pretty much stopped once I got to college. I recently caught myself up with Billy Bat and it just reminded me of how awesome manga can be. So I'm looking for recommendations of newer series, specifically ones that started after 2009. I'm slightly flexible on this but try not to recommend things that started way before this date bc changes are I will have read it or heard of it already.   I read pretty much any genre, though I like plot/character driven ones and dislike mangas that are super fanservice-y.   To give you some idea of things I liked from before: FMA, Rurouni Kenshin, anything by Naoki Urasawa, One Piece, Death Note, Flame of Recca, Eden, Jiraishin, Goth, Black Lagoon, anything by Kaori Yuki, stuff by CLAMP, Bleach, Anatolia Story/Red River, Basara, 7 Seeds, Hikaru no Go, Prince of Tennis, random things by Mitsuru Adachi, Hana Yori Dango, Hanakimi, Ouran High School Host Club. This is just off the top of my head to give you a sampling of mangas that've enjoyed in the past.   Appreciate any recs! Thanks!    My PSN is mrmariobro (but I'm female to avoid any confusion). I've got a mic and I'm a pretty good team player. Please add if you wanna play for a bit now or later tonight. I'm on EST.                Hey guys, I'm not much of a makeup user, but I started wearing makeup regularly for work (9-5 everyday) after college and I've noticed that my skin has now has blemishes and bumps and just other general imperfections that definitely didn't exist before. I've never broken out and it doesn't turn red or irritated, but my skin was definitely much clearer and smoother before I started regularly using makeup. My mom's has commented on this several times whenever I visit so I don't think it's just me.   Since I'm no make expert, do you guys think it's the quality of the makeup I'm using? Or maybe the brands I'm using is not good for my skin? My skin is not particularly oily or dry, though it does very occasionally get dry.   My usual face make up is L'Oreal powder foundation and Milani blush. I almost always take it off immediately after work using baby wipes. (I didn't start using baby wipes until about a year ago, but do you guys think that might have also contributed a little? I used to use Target brand make up remover wipes.)    I'll take any suggestions, comments or even recommendations for different brands. If it makes a difference, I'm Asian and have had fairly good skin in the past (never really any break outs, acne, etc).    Anywhere in Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary or Raleigh (west side) is fine. If you could include prices/schedules that would be great too.    http://www.ebay.com/itm/Womens-Girls-Double-Layer-Chiffon-Pleated-Retro-Vintage-Maxi-Long-Skirt-Dress-/380654568243?pt=US_CSA_WC_Skirts var= hash=item58a0c7c333                  I'm looking for a red maxi skirt, similar to this [one](http://imgur.com/l6t0HPd). I'd prefer that knit/jersey style, but I'd be okay with a chiffon like material as well. I'm looking for something under $50~ and I'd be okay with a fast fashion type quality.   I've looked at online/in stores at Macy's, Gap, Old Navy, BR, Express, Loft, Limited, F21, and CR with no luck.     Hi guys, so I recently bought an olive dress at H M that is just a little bit too small. It was on sale and I loved it so I said why not. It zips up in the back, but my entire torso feels like it's in a corset - chest and stomach areas are being completely compressed and in a way thats not acceptable to wear out in public.   I probably need half an inch around the waist and maybe a little more around the chest area (I can get these measured when I take it to tailor's). Since they'll probably need to add fabric to it and I feel like it's going to be pretty hard, if not impossible to find fabric that matches the dress, **where and what do you guys think is the best to add onto this dress to make it bigger?** I was thinking a stretchy black strip down the back where the zipper is or possibly along the sides under the arm. This only needs to be added to the torso part of the dress.   Here are some pictures of me wearing it (a bit hard to see the bad fit due to the light): [Here](http://imgur.com/a/bdVQ7/)    Here are some more pics of the dress I found online (clearer pictures): [Here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLl5FSNPwiw/UVh3qXxPg4I/AAAAAAAAEcQ/vLi4X97Booo/s1600/h m+olive+sheath+dress+.jpg)  EDIT: Picture of the seams: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/ebtlZ)                              I'd like book or film recs, but will also take TV recs that are not popular shows as I've seen most. Thanks!!      Hey guys, I'll probably be heading to Shanghai sometime this year or next year - wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a good (and relatively cheap) place to get glamor shots? Specifically I mean the places where they do all your makeup, have a wardrobe, do the touchup and usually give you a book and also a large print afterwards.  By cheap, I mean  cheap on American standards so I'm looking for maybe the $300-$500 range? Is that sound reasonable? But if you have good places that are more than that - please shoot those over too.   Thanks!       Anyone have a recommendation for a good (and cheap) female hairdresser? I live in Cary, but it can be anywhere in the triangle. Preferably under $30, but I could go up to say $50.    Anyone want to play? I've got a knife, psn: mrmariobro - mention you're from reddit when you add.    The situation: I found a short sale that I really liked about 2-3 weeks ago and I put an offer in on it (full asking price with conventional loan 20% down). I found out yesterday that there is now an all cash offer that is "in line" with my offer (which I assume is a little lower but close to my offer). My realtor says that banks/sellers look very favorably on all cash offers just because there are no contingencies or risk involved.   Is the bank really more likely to take a 250k cash offer over a 260k financed offer? Don't they get the money anyways in one go? Do I just need to prove I am no risk buyer?   I really like this house and would like to get it. Can you guys give me some advice/help on a couple of things:   * Does the bank consider my offer first since I submitted it 2-3 weeks ago or will they look at both with equal consideration?  * If I increase my % down to 40-50% or get a 15 yr mortgage, will that help show that I am more than financially capable of buying and I am strong serious buyer? Will that hold up at all against the cash offer at all?  * Will increasing my offer by 5k (it's a 260k house) be more of a draw than the above method?  * Would it be completely not ok if I tracked down the seller himself and just flat out asked him what price the other cash offer was so I can compete directly with it?   I appreciate any help guys.    I only need it for 1-2 months. I've found one called CubeSmart on Chatham that does the first month free but wondering if there are anyone other cheap ones closer to Morrisville?   Also, do you guys think a 5x5 is big enough for a circular dining room table and 6 chairs?   Thanks!             Hi all! My boyfriend has recently started to get into drinking whiskey and I'd like to surprise him with a bottle of something nice. I'm fairly clueless when it comes to whiskey - the closest I ever get is a nice Old Fashioned or Washington Apple. I know he has a bottle of Auchentoshan right now that he's been drinking and he seems to like that. He's mentioned that he likes Jameson and that he dislikes Johnny Walker (because it had a weird taste to him?).   I don't really understand the differences, can you guys give me some recs on what to buy him based on the above? And nothing that will break the bank please. If you could split your recs into whiskeys under $50 and those between $50-$100 that would be great. Thanks!! :)            For example, usually when you bake lasagna, the ingredients are all cooked at that point. Except for melting the cheese in cases like this, is there a purpose of baking already cooked ingredients? Thanks!       Does anyone know where I can buy sushi grade fish in Cary or in Durham near the Southpoint area?    I'm thinking of buying a house to rent out - I've mostly been looking Cary and Raleigh (West of downtown). Does anyone have any areas they would recommend to rent out to professionals and college kids (Raleigh?) as opposed to families (Cary)?   Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!  EDIT: Including below comment for more info:  I'm planning on living in this place for the first couple of years and then renting it out afterwards. My current thoughts are Cary because it will hold value (but houses are a little more pricey and it's suburbia) or downtown Raleigh (much older, small homes but rent to young professionals due to location). Plus, Raleigh is consistently ranked as highest growing/best for professionals/etc city in US so I wonder if buying there is better in the long term if I'm planning on holding onto this place for 10-20 years? Do you think Cary value will experience the same sort of bump because of Raleigh being up and coming?                My grandfather passed away earlier today and my parents don't really know where to start. They wish to cremate my grandfather's remains but we also need a small service/showing (I'm not really sure how this works) beforehand (just for 6 of us, nothing fancy required). My parents need a place that's affordable. We live around Palmetto Bay/Pinecrest. Any advice or recommendations would be extremely helpful.       Hi guys, I'm really craving some authentic Chinese food, in particular Shanghainese cuisine - does anyone have any good recommendations for the Triangle area? (It seems most good places do Sichuan food.) I'll take general recommendations on Chinese food as well. Thanks!!   Here's a list of places that I've been to already:  Grand Asia Market, Li Ming's, Super Wok, Taipei 101, 35 Chinese, Shanghai, East Coast Chinese Express, China Buffet, Dim Sum House, Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant, C T Wok, Gourmet Kingdom, Able Bar and Grill       Hey guys, does anyone know of any open to the public Chinese New Year celebrations in the triangle area? Thanks!         Also, has anyone used FMRealty before and have any opinions?  EDIT: Thanks for all the input guys! I will definitely look into all your recommendations!    Hey guys - has it been confirmed if all 4 DLCs will have zombie maps? I'm debating whether or not to buy this if my sole reason for getting the DLCs is the zombie maps. (And I already have Nuketown.) I don't want to wind up paying more if one of these 4 doesn't have a zombie map.   Thanks!      I've been running into this problem lately where half the time my highest rounds won't save on any random map (this has happened on Town and Nuketown so far). Other than the game/network being messed up, my theory is that if someone backs out halfway through, it won't save the highest round. FYI, I'm playing on PSN.   Can someone confirm or deny this?             	124
 i don't buy it. delusional kids are easy meals.    don't take investment advice from strangers seriously. best thing you could do is put it in the bank. maybe look at cars once a week    do you have a piece of gum?   i paid $600 for a vet to hook my my cat up to an I.V. overnight. the vet knew my cat was dehydrated right away but still half the bill was for running tests.    wishing i was caught up in a bank robbery. i would close my eyes and put my hands over my ears so there's no need for them to kill me. the robbers would be so impressed that they would give me money.   why do Scotsmen wear kilts?  because sheep can hear zippers   rock paper scissors. the trick is, after awhile people usually forget about one of the choices and if you keep track of what they do then you will beat them   the ability to slide on anything, regardless of gravity and friction. all i would need is a running start and i would be able to slide along the side of buildings   we share 99% of our DNA with apes. so apes are 1% less smart then us. so imagine the species that is 1% smarter then us. they can make whatever drug they damn well please. so far DMT is the only drug we have made purely for recreational use, and that is some intense shit. our brains would not be able to handle the drugs these advanced aliens use    every sailor has at least one blow up doll (most are male because they are in the navy) and when they take gun fire they deflate them and fill them with helium so they float. they then tie them to the ship and the ship is unsinkable   i put my dog down when he was unable to stand by himself. i tried holding him up so he could pee but he was too proud for that.    don't have to go back in time but i would ask emma watson to blow me   i got poop on my dick   i wouldn't remember it    but when it's nice out it's fucking perfect   i potato   i can't compare it to anything else. some people say it doesn't rain much but it rains hard, some people say it rains a lot but not that heavy. it just fucking rains.   seattle: i guess i'm normal    WHO THE FUCK DOWNVOTED THIS! THIS IS HILARIOUS   work out everyday and you will feel better instantly   i love you   looks like i'm the first one to call bullshit. if two things compete against each other for long enough, one will eventually dominate the other. men have the choice of the litter and women will have to settle- whether it be for money or security or whatever they will have to settle while we can get what we want if we work for it. fat women stand no chance at getting an alpha male and will have to settle for beta, while fat men can provide things other then looks. i'm drunk and will delete this comment tomorrow.   i introduced my friend to 4chan and reddit. he is failing all his classes   one of my balls is a lot bigger then the other. it's from riding my bicycle into a car.  edit: wait, i thought these were supposed to be 100% true   don't be THAT GUY. just chill and have a good time   why do people (i mean women) care so much about their own birthday and get so upset if it doesn't go perfectly?    i just wrote this in another thread. one time at a high school party i overheard a cute girl say she only came out tonight to have sex with me. i pretended not to hear because i was a shy virgin at the time.   google it. don't downvote because you're too retarded to believe something that seems unlikely   i bought my friend in the hospital a e-cig and it broke the next day. and i couldn't find the receipt/   there's a type of jellyfish that never dies of old age   i blacked out and woke up in detox in wyoming surrounded by drunk natives and not knowing where i was.   that's pretty interesting about the emperor. i wonder then if nuking a non populated area really would have worked the same.   actually over 400,000 japanese died. half vaporized, half died later from fallout and such.   i wish i never started smoking cigarettes. now i can't stop   ok, speech therapist is right.    thanks. what's a logoped?   i can't pronounce the letter R and i have a stutter. this really makes my life hell. i've almost given up making new friends and no one will hire me.   based on your comment history, you are going to get stabbed. enjoy death asshole   since you paid for him, legally he belongs to you. take this cunt's ass to small claims court and you'll definitely win.   when is mothers day?   SO YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE WHO DOESN'T TIP ME!   wow i can't wait. thank you, doesn't sound too crazy so i'm not so nervous anymore.   i'm getting some soon and just want to know what i'm in for. i've tried shrooms a few times and some super weak acid once.   what can i expect my trip to be like? i mean what was yours like?   aww fuck yeah . awesome thank you. i'm getting some soon and i want to know what i'm in for.   shit. i meant to put "AMA request" in the title.    i would smoke a lot more weed   oh yeah i forgot about that thing. but i'm talking about on a much larger scale. like a fire extinguisher that you can use on wild animals to get them high so you can catch them.    now that i'm thinking about it, after i payed and picked him up they showed me how they knew he was dehydrated. something with his eyes and the skin on his neck didn't go right back into place if they pulled on it. and they still ran a buttload of tests even though they knew what was wrong.   the tests they ran accounted for most of the bill   ooh thank you   thanks   you also have my ideas. my first idea is a weed gun. it's like a fire extinguisher but it blows out weed smoke. you can get animals high so you can catch them.  my second idea is jeans with velvet on the insides.  i have more ideas but i forget them.   how do you find a prostitute? i want one.   say someone who doesn't know anyone in the tv show/movie industry writes a pilot episode or something, what does he do from there?   "What the fuck?" I say aloud as i frantically search my brain for clues as to how i wound up in the middle of a dense forest. As I take in the absurdity of my situation I think back on the previous day. I didn't drink and I only left the house to get a pack of cigarettes.  "Oh fuck yeah, cigarettes."  As i take my first drag I approach my situation with a new sense of calm. I hear running water so i make my way towards that.  I don't remember falling asleep but that's not new. I don't think I'm dreaming but I've never been able to have a lucid dream before.   how did you do that? that must have taken some effort   i would pay a pilot to fly me around the state so i can drop bags of weed attached to parachutes   that's weird. you lose a lot of water when you sleep so maybe you just got dehydrated. alright then i'll quit talking to you.   i have insomnia   she self serves when we play hacky sack... and misses... again and again   i live in seattle... so no. it was only a drop or two.    jack off twice   i smoked my piss once. i peed out my window and jiggled my dick to get all the piss out and some of it landed in a packed bowl. my last bowl.   i blew a smoke ring and turned it into a heart   would a lesbian be aroused by her own boobs?   pyramid apricot ale   i got the big scar on my leg from fighting tigers in asia as a child warrior prince   yeah especially since my name is charles   i also want to be a stand up comedian but i stutter and can't pronounce the letter R that well. i feel for you.   i wish i could give you more then one upvote   yes   women aren't funny.   i turned on the tv right when my dad came home and there were two guys having gay sex. we watched it together.  	72
 7/10   Ha! Personally I think monogyny is overrated anyway.  Don't let society pressure you into having to have a bf if it's not what you want. But you're hot, so I'm sure getting what you want shouldn't be a prob!   You're young and beautiful.  Please don't go putting on a lot of makeup.  You don't need it and I see so many girls killing they're natural beauty by wearing paint. Also, at 6'4" - I can really appreciate a tall beauty.  9.5/10   You're hot. 8/10.  Why do you think you've never had a bf?     You're so cute! 7/10   Is this thing the size of a truck or is that guy just *really* short?   That wasn't a question. It's not efficient to work employees to the point where they kill themselves.    8/10 - I'd smash   If you're a company making your employees work 100hr weeks you need to create two jobs and hire two people.  Gah.   Really. You are a joke and you're hilarious. In a sad way. The other comments ring true and honest. The fact is that I have very high self esteem, I frequently get requests to model, and I'm drowning in pussy. Maybe a slight narcissism exists but there is nothing 'quite tragic' about seeking approval and showing off ones hard earned abs in this sub is to be expected.  Btw; you're full of shit with your obvious contradiction:  I wouldn't say you're ugly because that is unfair  vs   you can't accept that you're ugly  You're pathetic.  Get help.   Hard work pays off.  Good job.   Good one.   Enough about some president that was before our lifetime.  Are you on Mount Rushmore?  How will you be forgotten?     6/10.  Do some squats or something.   Velcro wallets: age 10  Drinking too much: age 25  Not caring about your health: age 30   You're a handsome fellow.  7.5/10   Athletic high (runners, swimmers, fighters, etc).   Carb filler: Brussels Sprouts.  I just eat them raw.  They have a ton of fiber, + some protein, and they fill you up fast and keep you full.   You're hawt!  Nice thigh gap.  9.5/10   Porn magazines.   I agree.  That can't be working for her.  She'll either have to be less of a bitch or be hotter.   Stop making a duckface. That piercing is not flattering at all. Go with your natural hair color. 6/10   I'd eat your ass.   It must suck being fat, ugly, and generally unattractive.     Undercover shitlord.  I get it.   Don't as for honesty if you can't take it.  You're fat, ugly, and age terribly.  Honesty.   3/10.  You look like you're in your late 30's.  And you're fat.  And this picture is of horrible quality.     Hi.  The website asoftmurmer.com works wonders for me.   You're beautiful.  9/10.    Step 4: Get new glasses. Those are too small on your face.  OR; get a smaller face.  Your face is too big for your glasses.     You look like you're 40.  Are you balding?   I have a fix: Consume less than you expend (talking calories here).  Repeat this behavior consistently until you are no longer obese.  Then consume as much as you expend.      Why you Russian, are you late for something?   8. I like the bangs but that just might be b/c I live in BK.   Good at Google.  	34
  It really isn't the entire 1% that's the issue. It's the 1% of the 1%.  It's more of a philosophical issue, rather than an actual practical issue. The .01% should probably pay more taxes. However, the rate that they pay on average as a whole is still substantial. And their 'lack' of taxation does not negatively effect the middle class and lower class. It's not like we raise the tax on the poor when the rich don't pay enough.   It doesn't feel right - sure. But overall it shouldn't even be a top 10 issue in this country. However since it is an emotional appeal (appealing to anger, jealousy, resentment, and ignorance), it works well for politicians and pundits to dwell on the relative non-issue.  .01% btw is 30,000 people. Not to mention that these are the type of people who would just leave the country if they started to get taxed more (or at least take 90% of their assets to another country).    Private colleges? Republican owned? Public school tuition is just as big, if not more of a problem. Big state schools now cost almost $30k to attend. Leave the political Republican hating nonsense at the door. This isn't /r/politics.  Irony you attack the bias/quality of the article, when you are clearly just as biased and ignorant.   Wtf is wrong with this thread...   Yea I think using a try catch might be the best option. Thanks. Sometimes I just can't get the obvious stuff. I'm doing the poker problem on euler.   I have a method where I am passing an index of an array as a parameter. I then want to use that index (int value) to loop through the rest of the array. However the first line of the method is like this:       public int hasTwoPair(int index) {          if (cards[index].getValue() == cards[index + 1].getValue()) {          //problem because index + 1 might be out of bounds  is there a way around this without adding an extra 'if' statement?     Considering administrators are the highest paid staff in any given school system, this is probably a good thing. Wish we would seriously evaluate the usefulness of so much administration overhead.    OP you need to work on your title creation abilities. Less is more my friend.   If you want breakfast in bed - sleep in the kitchen.   That's exactly what I am referring to...   Should have left the Quaran not the bible, as that is what Hagar did to Ishmael.     Probably because he started with "for (int I=0;"...  Does that capital 'I' bother anyone else?    NAME YOUR FLIPPING AXES   It's only 5 cents more than some of the other pods...       for (int i = 0; i  100; i++)          System.out.println((i-100) * -1);     }  You can do this with an incremental or decremental (thats not a word?) loop.  EDIT: but if you want to use a decremental loop, it looks a little cleaner:      for (int i = 0; i  -100; i--) {         System.out.println(i+100);     }   Interesting. Thanks! Pretty hard to find a good review of these limited editions when they come out.   Upvoted for the title.   Sure you get 5%, but you end up paying a 2.5% purchase fee - so at that rate, you are paying a 25x higher rate than the Amex cards I posted.   9000 pts would cost $9 with this discount.  9000 pts with VCG purchase would cost $45-$50 in purchase fees (I can't remember if it is $4.95 or $5.95 purchase fee for the $200 gift cards).  You save $36-$41 with this discount. Per 9000 points. And you don't have to make 5 trips to Staples/Officemax.     He's absolutely loyal to his constituents, and a great voice for the Hispanic Community (Little Village in particular), as well as the Teacher's Union who essentially drafted him to run. Those constituents stand to gain the most if he's elected.  That is the biggest problem.    Oh man should I make another post about dibs? I'LL DO IT I SWEAR!   That's my governor!   Well lets say you are already maxing out your Redbird - is this worth it if you cash it out some other way? Not sure how. Maybe they can be used on Evolve and not get charged any fees?   Not sure, that's kind of my question.       The article is not talking about SNAP. The new proposed law does not effect SNAP at all (and it's not like you can use SNAP at the movie theater), so I'm not sure why you are talking about foodstamps.   So it has an overall economic benefit, but that doesn't mean it's good for them - and that's who we are trying to help, right?   The problem is there are people who will still drive 55-60mph. They will end up causing accidents.    There is no way Fox is more biased than MSNBC  Did you mistype? 'lol no, show me the link' - you can't use Google yourself?  Anywhere you can read [here](http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/12/is-msnbc-worse-than-fox-news-179175.html)  or [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/)  They might be both quoting the same study.  A quote - "But here's the thing, and I hope it doesn't ruin your dinner: MSNBC is certainly as bad as Fox News, in terms of presenting ideologically biased information and demonizing the opposition."  [one more](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-11-02/entertainment/bal-pew-study-suggests-msnbc-really-is-more-partisan-than-fox-20121102_1_pew-study-msnbc-fox-news) that shows how much more MSNBC was biased during the Presidential election.   Reporting integrity and bias. Lesser of two evils when it comes to Fox, but MSNBC even more biased than Fox. You can Google it.   You are comparing FOX to what exactly? Fox should be compared to MSNBC. And in that case, Fox comes out on top.   What about Senator Warren who got into Harvard because she marked down that she was Native American? I guess NYT doesn't care about that...   So when I do that. it puts a cursor everywhere in my file (what is Alt+Enter anyway?). not just that one string.    Hit right and enter to give them each a line  Not sure how this works. You mean hit right on my keyboard? Doesn't seem to do much.   You should put this on /r/learnprogramming. A lot of readers there might not even know about ST   Oh ok, I avoided it since it's Beta, but maybe I'll upgrade.    How did you put a cursor between each character? Did you do that manually? I know in Windows you can just ctrl + left click to add a new cursor - but that would seem annoying for so many cursors.   Wow. I just downloaded Sublime Text 2 recently, and so far I really like it. It might be worth the money.   Why is this in /r/shittyprogramming? THIS IS BRILLIANT!!   It was pretty easy in college as long as you have an internship or two - or some really good side work.   You need to look up the String split function. Google something like "Java String split method".       Thanks for the pods! Loved it! and you sent me some Maragogype too! You da bomb   Who says they hate gay people? They didn't say "we won't serve gay people", they said, "we won't serve at gay weddings". Gays are more than welcome to come in and buy pizza. Doesn't sound like hate to me.   From what I understand, you could buy gift cards to the flight. Also keep in mind this goes towards flight changes and other fees. I had to pay $75 to change a flight, and Amex covered it. Also drinks on the airplane would count for this as well.  Also bear in mind that you can downgrade to a Amex Green card. You can get your points, downgrade, and get a pro-rated amount back. You might end up only paying $140 for the annual fee, but still get the bonus. Not to mention you also get TSA Pre for free as well ($100), plus free in flight wifi and Boingo at airports, and Priority Pass Select (free lounges!).   I did. On the highway. It was quite scary.   I received this offer, and I took it. The benefits that Amex gives you are worth quite a lot. I saved a lot of money on checked baggage and upgrading to economy plus.  I haven't used the points yet, so they are still sitting in my account. Was going to fly to Israel with my wife, but she is due with a baby at the same time we wanted to go, so we will have to wait.  Also my offer was for spending $15k total, *not* $20k.   Eh no one? Could use some help on the PL/SQL side.    Can I execute PL/SQL in Tableau?  I basically need to write some PLSQL that returns a table, and pass that table to Tableau. I am copying my problem here:  I am trying to do a query where I combine entries from the same table, but from different schemas. I can do a query to find which schemas in my DB I need to look at. I'm kind of new to PLSQL, so I'm not sure how to go about doing this. It would look something like this:  Loop (over v_schema)     select * into myView from     v_schema.myTableIneed  end loop  so in the end, 'myView' will have the the entries from the table myTableIneed, from multiple schemas. The other issue, is that there is a chance that the table might not exist in every schema. That's ok, so I would need to handle that exception. Something like that. I guess I'm not sure how to properly loop, or how I get the list of schemas into the 'v_schemas' variable.  Someone suggested that I use cursors with a procedure. However that might not help me, as I don't think calling a procedure from Tableau could work. I think what I need is an executable block of PLSQL. Please advise.

So because it's a stylesheet it doesn't belong in shittyprogramming?it's funny, and it's a comment that claims there is shitty programming. Sounds like a great candidate for that sub. It's not a serious sub.   ?   Any thought's on LIQD? I bought at $.37   Lol that's hilarious, but post this in /r/shittyprogramming   There is a special place in hell for those who DDOS attack Github.   Yea for some reason that was their intended look. I'm not sure why they felt the flat look was better.     The tides come in, the tides go out, you can't explain that  haha ok thanks.   I have to pluck my eyelashes every week or so. I take out about 10 eyelashes per week. If I don't, they get bunched up or too long, and get in my eye. I am a guy btw, and it is not intentional. I just have lots of eyelashes.      Also to note, make sure you don't use your own credit card with your name on it. That will get you flagged. Use an AU or a spouse's card.   Also Square is helpful for accepting payments when selling on Craigslist. I've even benefited by charging 3% extra to use a credit card (when selling on Craigslist) - so I end up making more money, even with the fees.      And rational normal liberals also still vote for shit candidates. So what's the difference?   ? Umm the gravity of the moon... I'm not sure I understand your joke/statement/sarcasm?   Yea but I think some cases of refusing service are legitimate. For example if you are a web developer - and you are asked to make the website 'TheBibleIsAllLies.com" - i think that it's fair to refuse to do this service as it directly goes against your beliefs. The problem is there is no way to distinguish between that and, "I won't serve you a burger cause you're a fag".     this was held up in court and created a psuedo R  Thanks for the info. Seems like the bill is too open. "I'm not going to serve you a burger cause your hair isn't covered" is a possibility. Although I think there is a bit of an overreaction as if there is going to be rampant baseless discrimination. Business aren't going to just start refusing all gay people service just because. It would yield too much of a backlash. Maybe I'm just not pessimistic enough   Can someone explain the actual problem with this bill? Like what does it say that would increase discrimination and allow people to be biggoted? I don't understand. Not sarcasm, I just don't know what the fuss is about.   I wouldn't touch a suzuki with a 10 foot pole. What pieces of shit.  Subaru is the best value on this list affordable to most people.  EDIT: There are 5 idiots out there who like Suzukis.    Kind of lame since I already have both checking and savings with Chase.   I didn't say no cell phones tv or computer. That's not what I said at all. First of all, I said no smartphones. I never said I wouldn't have a computer in my home. I also am not completely forbidding my kids from using/seeing such things. TV just will not be in my home.   As I mentioned in another comment, their peers will have parents who have similar viewpoints to myself. If I sent then to public school, then yes it would be quite problematic.   I posted on here a while back that I wanted to get some information from my fantasy league on ESPN.com. I spent some time learning some HTML and PHP basics and started trying to figure out how to post a login on [ESPN here](http://games.espn.go.com/frontpage)  I tried using the code from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11171713/scrape-a-site-content-with-a-secure-login) StackOverflow post, but to no avail.  The problem I think is that the login is actually a popup (or is 'frame' the correct term here?). I'm not sure what to do here. Noob web developer here, so any help is appreciated.    My website has a title, a subtitle, and a picture. I like the way it looks on my browser. However on my mobile phone (Note 4), the text is not center adjusted, and is way too small. [Here](http://askyourlor.com) is the website.  I am asking this in /r/learnphp because it will have php in it, and /r/learnhtml is a ghost town.                        I work in Chicago, and I see a few people asking for money everyday. I really don't see anyone giving, and I think part of that is because very few people carry cash around nowadays. I can't remember the last time I even had change. It's kinda sad, and there isn't much we can do about it - or is there?   I committed, and pushed (although I inturrupted it eventually, i think most of the file was pushed) a 200 MB file. Since then, I reduced the size of the file to 2 MB, and comitted/pushed that change.  From what I understand, anytime someone clones (or do a pull for the first time since my change), they will have to download the entire file anyway - since it is part of the changeset.  How can I eliminate this large file entirely? Cloning now takes much longer.       So I was thinking that it might be difficult to get the gold Macbook a few weeks after its release. Why not buy a few and then resell them? Even if you resell at the same price, you can easily get a few thousand points.   Thoughts?      In theory, I should be able to to CVS and buy a $500 Paypal load card for $502.95. I should then be able to load that money onto my paypal account. Then, I should be able to use my Paypal Business Debit Mastercard to pay my bills on EvolveMoney.com - without paying an extra fee (since it is a debit card from a large bank).  Can anyone confirm this? I just got my debit card and don't want to load my paypal account unless I know this works.   What is the difference here? A variable has to be public or private (correct?), and I think when you declare a class variable, and you don't specify public or private - then the default is public.   So if I change my declaration from 'public static final String...' to 'static final String...', then is anything different?    I was so unbelievable disappointed that I missed the special edition cubania (strength 13). It sold out so quick. Can we make some sort of alert/sticky when it is available again? It's on Ebay, but it's double the price now.   I wanted to make my own website to further my career. I plan on using it for tech blogging, resume, projects I've done, to give me a greater 'presence', etc.   Of course myname.com is taken ('myname' being my real name). So is firstname-lastname.com. However firstname-lastname.net is not taken. **Any reason I would not want to use the .net domain?** It's only $10 a year, and there is no strange spelling.   This is in /r/cscareerquestions because this website is for the purpose of advancing my CS career down the line.   I started doing some PHP development (just started) on the side. I installed PHPStorm and a few other things. Is it ethical to be doing this on my work laptop? My job doesn't require any of these skills, it is purely for personal development.         They were going to have financials released yesterday but delayed. Not sure when they will be released. Looks like a good time to buy.   Tmobile will pay **up to** 1/2 of your phone when you upgrade. However, this is only after you have paid 1/2 of your phone.  Basically they are saying, "We will buy your phone off of you for 50% its original price, 1 year after you bought it".  The truth is, you can simply resell your phone for the same amount, if not more. All JUMP is providing you an easy way to sell your phone. That's all. Sounds pretty worthless to me, especially since my phone might be worth even more than they are giving me.

It's been recommended here before, just linking again because of the sale. Just bought the course myself!            Just trying to start learning PHP on my own. I got phpStorm - and I downloaded (and installed?) WampServer. I am looking at [this](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php-101--pre-73284) tutorial. I get the error message "PHP Interpreter is not configured". What am I supposed to do? I just want to run PHP locally for the time being. What file is the interpreter?  Actually I just opened a command window and typed 'php' and it said command not found, so I must have done something wrong.   I know this is super-noob. Would appreciate any help. I feel embarrassed to ask people I know how to do this.  EDIT: Haha I figured it out! Found the php.exe file and pointed to that, and voila! Cool stuff!    I got my gas bill this month, and it was more than half of my bill from Dec - Jan. I'm comparing both bills, and you can see [here: snapshot of both bills](http://i61.tinypic.com/e1dv81.jpg), there is an extra line in my last month's bill called 'supplier charges' for an extra $189. What is that from last month? Any ideas?   Edit: tried calling earlier but got hung up now. At work and wanted to know if anyone had a similar issue. I have Spark Energy as a 3rd party provider (not sure how that works), but I didn't drop them or anything - and they shouldn't be charging me more than PeoplesGas. That's the whole point of switching to them.    **My background:** I am a recent CS grad, currently working at a large company doing Java/SQL only (for the time being). I have spent most of my time with Java, but I am familiar with C as well. I dabbled in Python and Haskell as well. Sadly, I have absolutely ZERO experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, or really anything having to do with web development.  Right now I want to create a webpage based on data that I would pull from my Fantasy Football league on ESPN's website. From what I know, there is no API available from ESPN to access this data. Furthermore, the data I need is specific to MY league - meaning I need to login into my ESPN account to get  this info. I want to take this info, do some simple algorithm, and then simply display a text box on a website.  My question is, what are my options for implementation? I would want to know what would be a way I can implement this, with or without Java. I'm open to learning something new, but I know so little about web development that I honestly don't even know where to start.   EDIT: To explain what I want to do - I want to create an alternative ranking system for my league. What I would need to be doing is taking the total points scored by each team (each week) - and then run an algorithm to create a NEW ranking/point system. So where on ESPN's website, you might be ranked 3rd, on my ranking system you might be ranked 5th. In order to get this info, I need to access my league and see how many points each team has scored. ESPN's stats and news API is not helpful because I need to know how the teams in **MY** league scored.   Second Edit: Thanks so much everyone! Looking forward to maybe trying more than 1 way to do this. Just telling me I need a 'scraper' helped. None of this ever came up in school, at all.   Anyone have any good suggestions on what to get on Amazon with Subscribe and Save? Trying to save 15% by subscribing to 5x things, but I haven't found that many items that are actually cheap. Paper towels seem to be waaay too expensive.    I have a query that is like:     select ... from ... where ... x=y (+) and a=b(+)  What is the **(+)**?   I've been reading that a lot of you recommend newcomers to go to a pro shop. I was just wondering if stand alone pro shops tend to be better than pro shops inside a Brunswick zone. I live on the very north side of Chicago (Touhy/Western) if anyone has any suggestions for that area that'd be great.            No more dibs. The snow storm was a week ago. 90% of parking spots are clean. Get your junk off the street. Don't be a selfish jerk. No more dibs.   What is the best forum to post a code review? I know stackExchange has a codereview page, but it seems significantly less populated than other sites. Is this a page I could post a code review? Are there some places I might not be aware of? I am mostly interested in Java for the time being.   I've downloaded emulators in the past, but they were always riddled with terrible malware. Any legit and clean emulators for older game consoles?       http://oi62.tinypic.com/2ufw0ab.jpg  If you look at the picture above, the main folder is labeled as 'main.src'. I had to change the names as this is happening in my project at work.  src is a subfolder of main - but it's showing in the project view as if I have a folder called 'main.src' that has certain contents. How do I prevent Intellij from coupling a sub directory with its parent directory?   I know there is not a native way to do this in Windows 7. I Googled and found many links - however I'm not sure which ones to trust, and this is a work computer so I need to be certain that the download is legitimate. Any consensus on safe .iso to USB utilities?  I found this http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/   which seems really cool if it works.  I am also fairly new to Reddit ( 2 months), so please be nice. if I made some sort of faux-pas   So I compared my Galaxy Note 4 (LOVE IT) to my wife's iphone 6 plus (thank heavens I don't have to look at that tiny 4 inch screen anymore), and I was a bit shocked at what I noticed.  When looking at something that is supposed to be white, for example, the background of Facebook, I found that my Note 4 is considerably less white. In fact, the parts of the screen that are supposed to be white, look more like 'off-white' or maybe even a slightly yellow tint.   Has anyone compared their Note 4 to an iPhone 6 plus and noticed this? It made me quite sad. I'm hoping its a defect - although it's been 3 weeks since I bought the phone.  I read a lot of iPhone 6 plus vs. Galaxy Note 4 reviews, and no one mentions this.  Also to note, this is my first time using Reddit. If I have violated reddiquette in some way, please be nice - point it out, but don't get pretentious about it.   	113
 I think there can be differences of opinion about what the 2nd Amendment is about, but do even those who believe it's about the freedom of individuals to arm themselves against a tyrannical government believe that that right is absolute, and that every person in the country should be able to build an arsenal of every conceivable kind of weapon, regardless of the firepower of the weapon or the criminal history or mental competence of the individual?      GalantGuy, I agree that the issue is more complex than simply banning assault weapons and I appreciate your reasonableness and civility. I am in favor of being as reality-based, scientific, and results-oriented as possible in trying to solve the problem.   Studies have shown that violent video games and movies don't seem to increase a person's propensity for killing other people, as does the common-sense observation that they obviously have those things in countries with much lower rates of violence.   I don't think it's practical to have an armed policeman at every entrance to every school in the country, plus in school parking lots, sporting events, etc. Even if we could do that, kid-shooters could just go elsewhere, like parks, Little League games or Chuckie Cheese.  I don't go for stop and frisk or TSA style screenings.   I agree that all these measures are overkill. The whole country shouldn't be on lockdown to guard against a relatively few nuts. I do think improved access to mental health and more realistic reporting laws on dangerously unhinged people might help, but even then you have family members who are enablers or in denial, like Nancy Lanza.   It just seems more logical to me to make the weapons that are designed to kill a lot of people quickly unavailable. I don't see why anyone outside of the military or law enforcement would need those weapons. Mass shootings would still occur from time to time with non-automatic weapons, but at least the killers would be less efficient and a few more people would live.  If we had a way to prevent lightning strikes, wouldn't we try to do that?     I'll concede on that.   I think they are all gun deaths and that is what that particular report was measuring, rather than deaths from violent crime.               I agree that pro-gun control citizens should get off their duffs and call their legislators too, especially because they are in the majority in this instance. If they don't and legislation fails, it will be their own fault.   No it doesn't. No one has to turn in their guns.   If I were reading a report on drownings I'd expect to see accidental drownings and suicide drownings as well as any murder-by-drownings, so if I'm reading a report on gun deaths I would expect to read about accidental and suicide gun deaths as well as murder gun deaths.   They do indeed.   I guess it's the thought of some guy blasting his prey full of holes that seems a case of overkill, literally, and not really sport.   "You'll never stop them completely, and it is tragic, but at the same time, we need to realize that very few people die in these kinds of shootings."  Tell that to those Newtown parents.    It's "family's." And they are not. But if you think your family is in as vulnerable a position as the family of the leader of the free world, you either have a very inflated sense of your own importance or you are very paranoid. Maybe both.   You're not the first person to ask me that question.   I guess those academic and journalistic sources I cited are just making the data up...Look for the raw data by state on the CDC site and then compare them.       What kind of gun policy do you support?   Are you able to take down your prey with a rifle?   Here's a report from Penn that references the CDC sources that are used for this data: http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ficap/resourcebook/pdf/monograph.pdf     Man, the thought of guys hunting with rapid fire arms is just depressing.    Do you shoot a deer with multiple rounds?   Gun deaths are gun deaths. Having a gun in the house makes it more likely that a gun suicide will occur, and that an accidental shooting of a family member will occur. I don't think it's unreasonable to include suicides and accidents in gun deaths.   Even if you don't buy the 25%, what about the 75%?      Are military-style weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines designed for hunting?   All gun deaths, I believe.   Your day is over, NRA.   When exactly are you planning to start the revolution?    Brady Campaign is actually a good suggestion. They have a new guy in charge who seems very sensible, thinks we should concentrate on things the NRA membership agrees with, like universal background checks.   But why would you take out the per capita? Isn't that what matters?   Also here is how the Daily Beast arrived at the numbers I linked to above: "Our methodology was simple: Rather than measure the number of guns, we measured the measure of gun deaths per capita in each state, using the most recent data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That counted for 75 percent of the ranking. The other 25 percent was derived from the Legal Community Against Violence's state-by-state comparison of firearm laws, which ranks all 50 states by their relatively severity, incorporating everything from policies on mental-health background checks to whether loaded guns are allowed in bars."   No other president has been asked about having armed guards at every school in the country, so we don't know what they would have said. And btw there was an armed guard at Columbine.   Actually, Illinois is #43 out of the 50 states in per capita gun deaths. The states with the highest per capita gun deaths are all pro-gun states:  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/01/11/20-deadliest-gun-states-from-mississippi-to-arizona.html   All presidents get Secret Service protection for family members. You must know that.         I hope Anonymous takes on these conspiracy theorists.   These people are revealing what they really are and it is very ugly.   "What can we do to help him?"  Put Anonymous on the case.      "A prosecutor who does not understand proportionality and who regularly uses the threat of unjust and overreaching charges to extort plea bargains from defendants regardless of their guilt is a danger to the life and liberty of anyone who might cross her path."  http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html                                                                                                                                          "The negotiating style Obama has displayed in these instances is what poker players call tight-weak. A tight-strong player avoids throwing in his chips, saving them for a big hand, which he plays aggressively in hopes of a huge win. A loose-weak player plays lots of hands, bluffing frequently. Tight-weak is the worst of all worlds  when you have a weak hand, you lose, and when you have a strong hand, you fail to maximize your position."  Ugh. I foolishly thought Obama had learned his lesson. Guess not.                  Case-control studies, ecological time-series and cross-sectional studies indicate that in homes, cities, states and regions in the US, where there are more guns, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide.   "The people who fight and lobby and legislate to make guns regularly available are complicit in the murder of those children. They have made a clear moral choice: that the comfort and emotional reassurance they take from the possession of guns, placed in the balance even against the routine murder of innocent children, is of supreme value. Whatever satisfaction gun owners take from their gunswe know for certain that there is no prudential value in themis more important than childrens lives. Give them credit: life is making moral choices, and thats a moral choice, clearly made."

Here's one from Harvard:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/index.html   But the mass killings are the specialty of young white males -- is that what you are?   "We have to make ourselves better. Otherwise, the story from Connecticut is too unspeakable to bear."   And yet all these mass killings seem to be perpetrated by young WHITE men, don't they?   And why would you take "urban demograhics" out of the equation, anyway? Don't people killed with firearms in the cities count as much as people killed by firearms out in the country? The majority of people in the US live in metropolitan areas, you know, something like 83% I believe.  Yes the US firearms murders are cultural -- the result of a culture in which access to guns is easy.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/14/schoo-shooting-how-do-u-s-gun-homicides-compare-with-the-rest-of-the-world/  Personman04, try getting your stats from a source that is not a propaganda tool.   Great Silver piece that shows how the right has successfully shifted the terms of the discussion of gun control.    not true   ""...If they [Republicans] have entitlement cuts as part of this deal, they would make it, through their marketing ways, and theyre better communications operatives than Democrats, that the president would own the entitlement cuts. Theyre not worried about that. They would say the president owns that in 2014 and 2016."   "This isn't just cognitive dissonance. It's irresponsible reporting."   I hope Obama pays attention: "Recent events have also demonstrated clearly what was already apparent to careful observers: the deficit-scold movement was never really about the deficit. Instead, it was about using deficit fears to shred the social safety net. And letting that happen wouldnt just be bad policy; it would be a betrayal of the Americans who just re-elected a health-reformer president and voted in some of the most progressive senators ever."   Let's hope you're right and that the news media is all over this.   Silver weighs the polls when he aggregates them, taking into account their biases and various leans and their history of accuracy. Not foolproof but safer than any one of those polls alone.   Problems with women?   Definitely see the McGonagall comparison.    And Mitt Romney just released an ad endorsing him.   "First, Romney's story about seeking women applicants was a lie. Second, during Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, there were exactly zero women partners (not enough binders?). Third, during his one term as governor, he invalidated a half-dozen executive orders establishing affirmative action policies for women."    He's afraid of The View.   "Here's the difference between Biden and Ryan: whereas Biden has been studying foreign policy for many decades (over which he's made his share of mistakes), everything Ryan knows about foreign policy, or at least everything he's shown us he knows, comes from interventionist ideologues with talking points that test well among the base and bear little resemblance to reality."   Actually, Ryan is a member of the House of Representatives, not a Senator, and what are you talking about with 43 days?    "[the window display of] Skuby   Co. Lifestyle Clothing store in Spring Lake, New Jersey...includes this photo of President Obama as a witch doctor. The store's proprietor, Bill Skuby, tells the Asbury Park Press, 'We deal with a 1 percent customer; they come in here and shake my hand. My business is through the roof because of this.'   "...can you even imagine Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh tearing their hair out over a weak debate performance by Mitt Romney the way that liberals have been over President Obama's? I can't."   "This is not a poetic rallying cry, but there is human suffering to be minimized and a new foundation to defend."   "The furor over Fridays report revealed a political movement that is rooting for American failure, so obsessed with taking down Mr. Obama that good news for the nations long-suffering workers drives its members into a blind rage."   "During his time at GE, the company began a system of tweaking their earnings that eventually resulted in a $50 million fine. But just because he oversaw a cooking of the books doesn't mean that's a standard national practice."   That is super mature, and not desperate.   Something might get done!   Thanks.   Occam's Razor. Simplest and least convoluted explanation makes the most sense to me. I also think it's telling that conservatives seem to be interpreting Romney's statement the same way I do --it's not just the liberals who see it that way. But as you say YMMV.  I also think it's interesting that even your interpretation starts from the same assumption Romney does -- that people always vote only from their own financial self-interest.  It says a lot about the way his type of conservatives vote. I can't find the stats now, but read earlier today that twenty years ago 80-some percent of Republicans believed in some sort of government support for the poor, as opposed to 40-some percent now.   I live in a reasonably high-earning household but I don't support the government giving me a tax break and raising the taxes of the elderly, the young, and the poor so that my family can pay less. I believe in the concept of citizenship and the social compact. The kind of concentration of wealth we have now is not good for our country and will strangle our competitiveness if we allow it to continue.    "Those Americans who paid payroll taxes, but had no income tax liability, still pay about 15 percent of their income, higher than the 13 percent Romney pays."   "Those Americans who paid payroll taxes, but had no income tax liability, still pay about 15 percent of their income, higher than the 13 percent Romney pays."   Here are links to some of the problems commentators -- liberal and conservative -- have had with what Romney said:  http://www.memeorandum.com/   http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/romney-unplugged.html  And btw, this sentence --  Ill never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives" would seem to imply that the 47% are indeed lazy. That is an inference a reasonable person would draw from that sentence.   I think the more salient detail of the article is the rapacious behavior of the guy's hedge fund. Unfortunately that is not in the mojo headline.   "Mitt Romney says citizens who don't pay income tax will never vote for him. But eight of the top 10 states with the highest number of nonpayers are red states."    "A triumph of fact and reason."   Reporters and commentariat:  Please read these charts.   While I don't disagree that Congress deserves scrutiny, realistically any changes in seats are going to come at the margins.  The race for president is too close for us to take our eyes off it now. Even if it's true that Reddit is overwhelmingly for Obama (which I see you got some pushback on), hopefully we go out and propagate these news stories and opinion pieces elsewhere as well, in addition to just talking to each other.   If we support Obama, we should be trying to get helpful articles out there to undecided folk, via facebook or links in emails or whatever means we have. It's about convincing the undecided and about getting likely Obama voters to actually get out there and vote.    But the Republicans will appeal.   Note this quote: "Quite simply, the Romney campaign isn't adhering to the minimum standards required for a real policy conversation."   I don't really think that's true. The tax returns are not analogous to the birth certificate.  It is reasonable to expect candidates for president to release their tax returns. It's not reasonable to expect them to repeatedly show a copy of their birth certificate.  The birthers are extreme fringe types asking something of Obama that has not been asked of any other candidate. Those asking for the tax returns include his primary opponents, journalists, and members of his own party who are just asking for information most candidates provide.  Romney saying he won't release any additional returns because opponents would only clamor for more is an excuse, not a reason. If he were to release even five years of returns, reasonable people would probably not ask for more.   There is obviously something in those returns he doesn't want people to see.    Obama is still giving away the farm before the negotiations even get started.   If only "the people" would realize that the supposedly grass roots Tea Party is only a tool for right-wing corporate interests.  If only the mainstream media had more interest in pointing that out.  	136
    amazing! you are so lucky because you can enjoy such beautiful scene on your way to work. i just meet the crowd of people every day.    what's the karma for?   so you mean they use the same number in different movies? why? why 555 can not be used? and they can just create a number that doesn't exist.    I always do the same thing as you. even if i have watched them for more than once, i still enjoy them when i watch them again!   you mean you will watch them again and again?    yeah! totally agree with you. Friends is still funny and i do think good sitcoms will never be outdated! besides, i enjoy Good Luck Charlie very much.    recently, i have been watching the Friends. but i found some of the plots are unfit for our life now. so i wander if anyone will still choose to watch TV series years before?   i like the photos with the natural scenes and this one is good.   my friends recommended me to see this TV series and it is really out of my expectation! it is awesome!   it is interesting, i am thinking about making a similar one for my boyfriend to give him a surprise.    looks delicious and easy to make. i will try it this weekend!   i am not quite sure but it seems that i know this scene.    It is said that the movie intended to make people pay attention to the protection of wild animals. but i think it might have some backfires.      	15

 Tortilla Flats by John Steinbeck  I would definitely recommend this book to any veteran transitioning over to the civilian world. It's a really great book that portrays the brotherhood of soldiers and how its a lifelong bond that helps brothers through difficult situations. It does this through the story of 3 poor veterans of World War 1.    I disagree.   I know of many others things that very closely relate to being a parent. Yes, being a parent involves a mass amount of time and dedication, in which you are legally obligated to dedicate such time. However, many other things require lots of time and dedication. The only difference is the ability to give up on those things without legal/social repercussions.    A dog. Fishtank. Garden. Career. Significant Other.   Definitely!

Hours you most likely do not drive... being a musician and all...   Damn dude, your brain is already damaged if you're legitimately concerned and asking this question on Reddit instead of researching it yourself or seeking medical advice from a medical provider. You're done, that brain has been vaporized.   Because I can afford it and I like it. I'm sure if you could afford something and liked it, you'd have one.

       Any thoughts on this?            This question is purely theoretical for the time being; however, I am genuinely extremely curious about this: Is putting sperm directly into a man's bloodstream a guaranteed way to permanently sterilize him? As in, is this type of male sterilization incapable of ever failing for any male?  Any thoughts on this?  Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question.   This question is purely theoretical for the time being; however, I am genuinely extremely curious about this: Is putting sperm directly into a man's bloodstream a guaranteed way to permanently sterilize him? As in, is this type of male sterilization incapable of ever failing for any male?  Any thoughts on this?  Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question.      OK--here is my question:  Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?  This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.  Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.  Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:  1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.  2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.  3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.  4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.  Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!  In addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.  Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?  Any thoughts on this?               OK--here is my question:  Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?  This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.  Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.  Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:  1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.  2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.  3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.  4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.  Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards.

Rather, I am simply advocating giving men who want to do this the opportunity to do this in a safe, medical setting.   I want to know so that I can post there.

Basically, this question is pretty self-explanatory: Other than a massive screw-up on the doctor's part during a surgery, are waivers an extremely effective way for doctors to avoid getting sued by patients who change their minds about their surgeries later on?  What especially got me curious about this is this part of this article:  http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/no-sex-please-were-eunuchs-28469767.html  " Before the operation he had a half-hour consultation with the surgeon about why he wanted to be castrated. At the time I didnt know why I wanted to have it done, Roger admits. I just knew I wanted it. He wanted to make sure that it was the right decision to make. I had to sign a waiver so that I couldnt sue him for any kind of negligence. He gave me all the opportunities to back out of it. "  Frankly, as far as I know, the doctor mentioned in this article (who I think is now deceased) never got sued by any of his patients for performing elective castrations (which, for the record, I strongly applaud him for doing due to my own egalitarian views on this and due to the fact that it is better than self-castrations and "back-alley" castrations).

In your opinion, how much of a role did 9/11 have in Al Gore's decision not to run for U.S. President in 2004? After all, 9/11 and its aftermath helped push the dispute over the 2000 election into the past (which might have helped Bush) and also helped Bush by giving him an anti-terrorism and anti-Axis of Evil platform to use in his 2004 re-election campaign.

Any thoughts on this?         I know that this might be a pretty unimportant issue, but what if the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum narrowly failed rather than narrowly passed (as in real life)?

As for me, I am tempted to say that I would have created a very loose Iraqi federation with three extremely autonomous parts--a Sunni one, a Shiite one, and a Kurdish one. All of these parts get a share of the Iraqi oil revenues (based on, say, their population or whatever) as well as the right to secede (in which case they gain full control of the oil on their territory but lose their rights to the revenues from oil in other parts of Iraq). If neighboring countries have a problem with this Iraqi right to secede, then I would tell them to deal with it. Also, I would have had Iraq create a Western-style constitution which would allow democracy and free elections to occur in Iraq. In addition, I most certainly would not have disbanded the entire Iraqi Army in 2003; rather, I would have only purged the "bad apples" (as in, those with a lot of blood on their hands) at the top of this Army.  Also, before I forget, I would have also demanded that Iraq give the U.S. a part of its oil revenues in order to compensate the U.S. for its losses in Iraq.  Frankly, if my approach in regards to this would have been followed, then there might have very well been no Sunni insurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and likewise no ISIS presence in Iraq right now.

Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?   I was wondering if anyone here who still has a penis but who already got rid of his or her testicles (for whatever reason) is able to tell me how exactly penis-in-vagina seek feels for him or her right now; specifically, does this sex feel good? As good as it was before?  The reason that I am asking this question is because I myself want to get castrated/have an orchiectomy in order to be sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all, even vasectomies can fail), in order to regulate my sex drive, and in order to help feminize my body to some extent (after all, I am a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person). However, I would still like to keep my penis indefinitely as well as to have penis-in-vagina sex.  Any thoughts on this?            Was the Safavid conversion of Iran to Twelver Shia Islam an early example of a nationalistic move by a government? After all, as far as I know, the goal of this mass conversion was to help create an even more unique Persian/Iranian identity which would help Iran (then known as Persia) preserve its independence in the face of threats from the Ottoman Empire. Plus, this move made Iran an "island" of Shiism surrounded by a sea of Sunnism.  Frankly, to me, if one replaces the religious aspect with the ethnic aspect, this Safavid policy appears to be very similar to some of the policies of European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond; after all, as far as I know, some/many European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond (such as those in France) pursued policies such as teaching everyone the same dialect of their official national language in order to create and foster a greater sense of national unity and cohesiveness in their countries.

Any thoughts on this?       And frankly, I have to admit that she was extremely hot right before her death. Indeed, she was probably one of the hottest women on the entire planet Earth right before her death.   Any thoughts on this?  Also, for the record, I myself don't intend to get married for at least a decade.                                 Any thoughts on this?   Get it? ;)                     Thoughts on this?                  What if Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi would have tried pursuing a rapprochement with the West in the early 2000s (such as by renouncing terrorism, paying compensation for Lockerbie, et cetera) but refused to give up his WMDs and nuclear weapons program? In this scenario, would NATO have still intervened in Libya during the Arab Spring in order to help overthrow Gaddafi?  Any thoughts on this?

This might be extremely unlikely, but here goes:  What if the U.S. had given Saddam Hussein a crystal-clear and stern warning that the U.S. will intervene if he will invade Kuwait and Saddam Hussein thus decided to invade Syria instead due to the fact that, while Syria doesn't have much oil, conquering Sunni-majority Syria might allow Saddam and his Sunni supporters to further consolidate their power in Iraq. Plus, Saddam might come to believe that a rematch between Iraq and Iran is inevitable; thus, he would like to pursue regime change in Syria in order to overthrow the Iranian-allied Assad regime there and in order to eliminate the possibility of a two-front war (for Iraq--after all, Iran is on the eastern side of Iraq while Syria is on the western side of Iraq) in the future.  How exactly will an Iraqi invasion of Syria in the early 1990s (say, sometime between 1990 and 1995) turn out? Also, would there have been a significant difference in the outcome of this war if this Iraqi invasion of Syria would have occurred before as opposed to after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

Thoughts on this?         This joke is in the form of a story; anyway:  -Bob goes to Mary and Richard's house (for the record, Mary and Richard are boyfriend and girlfriend).  -Mary opens the door wearing nothing but a towel.  -Bob tells Mary: "I'll give you $500 if you will show me what exactly is covered by your towel!"  -Mary thinks about this and then temporarily removes her towel, thus showing Bob her naked body.  -Bob then gives Mary the $500, and Mary closes the door afterwards. Afterwards, Bob goes back to his house.  -With the $500 in her hands, Mary goes upstairs, where Richard currently is.  -Richard asks Mary: "Who exactly was at the door?"  -Mary replies: "Oh, it was just our creepy neighbor Bob."  -In response, Richard asks: "Did Bob ever tell you anything about the $500 that he owes me?"  ---------------------------------------  Get it?   OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, the idea of feeling female extremely strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, the idea of living as a (trans-)woman full-time would extremely strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I do strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly not all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)  Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a completely voluntary basis, obviously)?  Also, to clarify--I myself certainly don't care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.  Any thoughts on this?         Here is my question--once we will be able to alter people's brains*, how exactly will we regulate this technology?  Any thoughts on this?  *In regards to this, I am talking about both getting rid of undesirable things, such as a sexual attraction to prepubescent children and a propensity to commit crime, as well as talking about more casual uses of such technology, such as changing one's sexuality (such as from straight to gay) and/or gender identity.

I was always curious about this considering that the timing of this appears to have been too good to be coincidental.  Anyway, any thoughts on this?         Would such a move on Obama's part significantly backfire? Or would no one really care about such a move?  And Yes, this is a silly scenario, but it is purely hypothetical and I am genuinely extremely curious about this.  Anyway, does anyone have any thoughts on this?      Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?   As you hopefully know, when Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1948, Palestine was (supposed to be) partitioned between the Jews and the Arabs. Likewise, when Britain withdrew from India in 1947, India was partitioned between the Hindus and the Muslims so that each of these religious groups would have a state which they would solidly dominate (of course, the Muslims in British India appear to have wanted this much more (and for obvious reasons) than the Hindus in British India did).  Anyway, what I am asking here is if there could have been any other realistic cases where European powers partitioned their colonies into two or more separate countries (in order to create separate countries for various ethnic and/or religious groups) before they (the Europeans) withdrew from these colonies and gave these colonies independence. If so, then exactly which other former European colonies could have been partitioned in this way shortly before they acquired independence?  Any thoughts in regards to this?

As you hopefully know, when Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1948, Palestine was (supposed to be) partitioned between the Jews and the Arabs. Likewise, when Britain withdrew from India in 1947, India was partitioned between the Hindus and the Muslims so that each of these religious groups would have a state which they would solidly dominate (of course, the Muslims in British India appear to have wanted this *much* more (and for obvious reasons) than the Hindus in British India did).

If so, then exactly which other former European colonies could have been partitioned in this way shortly before they acquired independence?  Any thoughts in regards to this?   Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?   If so, then how exactly should Bill Clinton have chosen as his VP in 1992 (and 1996) instead?  Any thoughts on this?      Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?   OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, *the idea of* feeling female *extremely* strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, *the idea of* living as a (trans-)woman full-time would *extremely* strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I *do* strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly *not* all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)  Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a *completely* voluntary basis, obviously)?  Also, to clarify--I myself certainly *don't* care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.  Any thoughts on this?   My question is this--would Hillary Clinton be running for U.S. President in 2016 if U.S. President Barack Obama would not have picked her as his Secretary of State (which in turn would have caused her to remain in the U.S. Senate) and if Obama would have picked a younger and less gaffe-prone VP such as Evan Bayh or Tim Kaine?

Thoughts on this?   How exactly would the 2004 Democratic primaries and the 2004 U.S. Presidential election have turned out if 9/11 didn't occur?  Would Al Gore have ran again in 2004 in this scenario? Would Hillary Clinton have ran in 2004 in this scenario? Would George W. Bush have still been reelected in this scenario?  Thoughts on this?   In regards to this contraceptive testosterone gel:  http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/block-that-sperm/384971/  "A testosterone gel: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is nearing a second round of clinical trials of a hormonal gel that men are directed to rub daily on their shoulders (a place thats not too hairy and not too sweaty, the NICHDs Diana Blithe told me). The gel contains Nestorone, a synthetic progestin that, by inhibiting testosterone production, stops the testicles from making sperm. The drug would also deliver testosterone to the blood, in an effort to prevent any change in libido, ejaculation, or muscle mass. Blithe says she hopes the gel will make for an appealing alternative to vasectomies and condoms."  I've got a question--other than the fact that it is presumably temporary and presumably capable of failure, how exactly, if at all, is this contraceptive testosterone gel *meaningfully* different from physical/surgical castration plus testosterone replacement therapy? Maybe I am totally missing something here, but the only *meaningful* differences between these two things which I see are the fact that this gel is presumably reversible and the fact that this gel is presumably capable of failure.  Any thoughts on this? Is my analysis of this spot-on, or am I completely missing something here?  Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. :) Also, I am certainly *not* trying to provoke anyone here; rather, I am simply trying to learn more information myself. :)   Let's have Al Gore officially win in 2000 by winning Florida by several hundred or several thousand votes as a result of George W. Bush saying a(n additional) stupid remark shortly before the 2000 election.  In this scenario, what exactly does U.S. foreign policy look like from 2001 to the present-day?  As for my own thoughts on this, here you go:  Al Gore (U.S. President between 2001 and 2009):  -9/11 still occurs due to the fact that, as far as I know, at least some of the issues (such as various U.S. intelligence agencies failing to sufficiently work with each other) which failed to prevent 9/11 would have still existed in this scenario.  -After 9/11, Gore would have still invaded Afghanistan due to the Taliban refusing to accept all of the conditions in his post-9/11 ultimatum to them. After helping the Northern Alliance overthrow the Taliban, the U.S. would have successfully killed Osama Bin Laden. However, after Bin Laden's death, Al-Qaeda would still continue to exist and to function with new leadership (but would gradually become weakened over time). Hamid Karzai is still installed as the new President of Afghanistan in this scenario, and while there is much more of a U.S. and Western focus on Afghanistan in this scenario, a lot of the issues which affected the Western war effort in Afghanistan in real life would have still been present in this scenario. Thus, I suspect that the U.S. will eventually lose its patience in Afghanistan in this scenario (and earlier than in real life) and thus eventually push for the creation of a Northern Alliance-"reformed" Taliban unity government in Afghanistan with a small long-lasting Western troop presence in Afghanistan in order to help keep the peace there. Whether the U.S. and the West (as in, the other NATO countries) will succeed in regards to doing this is anybody's guess.  -Gore does *not* invade Iraq due to the fact that he does *not* have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein like Bush Jr. did. Rather, Gore exploits the aftermath of 9/11 to fully restore the sanctions regime on Iraq and to keep a close eye on Saddam Hussein.  -Gore successfully pursues a rapprochement with Iran due to their mutual hostility to the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Saddam Hussein. Gore views a U.S. rapprochement with Iran as a useful tool to help stabilize Afghanistan and to put additional pressure on Saddam Hussein.  -Without an Iraq War, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi takes longer to pursue a rapprochement with the West. However, 9/11 helps gradually push Gaddafi and the West closer together, which in turn results in Gaddafi fully renouncing terrorism and giving up all of his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program sometime in Gore's second term (2005-2009).  -There are more U.S.-Israel tensions in the early 2000s than there was in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, doesn't fully support *all* of the anti-terrorism actions which Israel conducts during the Second Intifada. After Arafat's death and the second of the Second Intifada, however, U.S. and Israeli relations become warmer and Gore unsuccessfully makes a push for Israeli-Palestinian peace which fails due to Ehud Olmert's 2008 or 2009 resignation as a result of corruption allegations against him.  -Gore *might* militarily intervene in order to stop the genocide in Darfur, perhaps with the help of NATO; however, I am certainly *not* completely sure about this.  -North Korea probably does *not* build a nuclear weapon as early as it did in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, would probably *not* be unequivocally hostile to North Korea.  -Without the Iraq War, U.S. relations with Europe would be better and warmer than they were under the Bush Administration in real life.  Some Republican (maybe someone such as George Allen; U.S. President between 2009 and 2017):  -Once the Arab Spring occurs, the U.S. and NATO still overthrow Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya. Likewise, NATO (including the U.S.) and Iran launch a joint large-scale military operation/campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein during the Arab Spring due to the fact that the Arab Spring provides a good opportunity to do this. Afterwards, Iraq either gets partitioned into two or three separate countries or becomes a semi-functioning Shiite-led democracy which gives large autonomy to its various ethnic groups and regions. However, the process of stabilizing Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein could take a while, just like it did in real life.  -Likewise, the U.S. provides a large amount of assistance (including lethal military aid) to both opponents of Assad's regime in Syria and to the Ukrainian government (who are fighting against Russian-supported rebels in Eastern Ukraine). In turn, this results in Assad eventually getting overthrown in Syria and to a more difficult fight for Russia in Ukraine but one which Russia nevertheless still manages to eventually "win".  -The U.S. is no more successful at making peace between Israel and the Palestinians between 2009 and 2017 in this scenario than it was either under Bill Clinton or under Al Gore.  -North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and successfully builds and tests nuclear weapons sometime between 2009 and 2017.  Anyway, what exactly am I forgetting to list/state here?  Also, does anyone have any thoughts in regards to any of this?   Both make Jews run faster!  (Sorry, but as an agnostic Jew myself, I hope that it's okay for me to make this joke.)   For the record, I myself say Yes due to the fact that Pakistan will be unable to ever get a better offer than this and due to the fact that this will allow Pakistan to spend *much* less on defense and thus *much* more on improving the lives of its population.   Both make Jews run faster!  (Sorry, but as an agnostic Jew myself, I hope that it's okay for me to make this joke.)   that she went to the funeral naked!   OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.  Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated? Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is). Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me. Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing. The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.  Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.  Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.  Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.  Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. Indeed, whenever I shave my face, I am always reminded of just how incredibly beautiful of a (trans-)woman I would make. :) However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).  Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!  Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?  And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post.   After all, the money from this sale can be used to help finance Syria's reconstruction after its years-long civil war.  Thoughts on this?   For the record, I am personally going to say No because I expect another recession to begin in the U.S. sometime between 2018 and 2020, which in turn will result in Hillary Clinton either losing reelection in 2020 or not seeking reelection in the first place. After all, an economy can't keep growing non-stop forever.   What exactly are your thoughts on this wedding song?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FULXLzn4Gl0  (Love of My Life - The Wedding Song by Darla Day)  Personally, as someone who is a Pastafarian on my good days and an agnostic on my bad days, I strongly like this wedding song despite its religious tones. After all, it just sounds so beautiful and wonderful! :)  Also, while I myself am too young to get married, say, within the next decade, I might decide to use this wedding song when I will eventually get married (if my future wife will be okay with it, that is). After all, the references to "God" in this song can certainly be interpreted as references to the Pastafarian God. ;)  Thoughts on this?      I am curious to hear all of your thoughts on this.   How exactly would the 2004 Democratic primaries and the 2004 U.S. Presidential election have turned out if 9/11 didn't occur?  Would Al Gore have ran again in 2004 in this scenario? Would Hillary Clinton have ran in 2004 in this scenario? Would George W. Bush have still been reelected in this scenario?  Thoughts on this?

I myself am pro-choice, but I tend to view things from both sides in order to see where exactly one is coming from.  That said--do you agree with the statement above?   Back when I was in middle school, I had a very tall teacher named Richard; looking back, I should have called him Big Dick. Also, it is worth noting that Big Dick was hard but pleasurable and that all of the teachers at my former middle school liked Big Dick. As of right now, Big Dick is currently the assistant principal at that very same middle school; thus, one can certainly be surprised as how far Big Dick can go. ;)   OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.

In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!  Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?  And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post.        	152
 ohh nnnoooo   Awesome.  Superman's origin seems to be very much like Birthright also. Birthright and All Star are by far the best Superman stories I've ever read so I'm certainly excited.   It's crotchtastic    That Jurassic Park one is definitely not true    I'm not really familiar with Leos Carax and I haven't seen Holy Motors, but is that the same sewer monster man from Tokyo? Is this film somehow related?   Most of the screenshots have made the map look huge and expansive and dense and detailed.  This one does not.   The guy from Live Free or Die Hard, Sunshine and Colombiana is Cliff Curtis and he was absolutely not in Star Trek. The guy from Iron Man and Star Trek is Faran Tahir and he looks nothing like him.   I definitely don't think Miley is anywhere near the hottest girl in the world, but her new short haircut is pretty damn hot    Just a HD re release of Destroy All Humans 1 on the Destroy All Humans 3 engine would be worth a purchase.  2 and 3 were pretty terrible. But I loved 1 so much and stll play it today, and one of the best aspects was the awesome campy 50s setting and atmosphere. But 3 had a really cool next gen physics engine and way more advanced TK and flying saucer abilities. Plus more destructibility.    If by giant black cock you mean [this guy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006535/) then sure   It always looks awkward when a dude tucks his fancy dress shirt into cheap ugly jeans   That was such a dumb scene. Does Alfred just google Bane and get all this info on the secretive League of Shadows and Bane's past and everything    Do people really jerk off into socks? Why the hell would anyone do that...    That was hilarious    Fuck yeah Action Hank   Is that Juliette Lewis?   That chick is hot   Is this from something? Because its hilarious.   That's the one thing I didn't like about it. Otherwise it was a really fantastic fun action movie. But once it started going down *that* path in the third act it felt a little off. It kinda cheapened what was supposed to be the most emotional and important part of the movie. Also I thought the cameo towards the end was dumb.  But pretty much if you liked the first you'll like this. Fun and cool and fast paced and funny and with a surprisingly interesting and unpredictable story. A little bit darker and more serious, but nothing drastic. Maybe not quite as good as the first one, but its definitely worth seeing. I really really liked it.   I am Australian and I have never seen of heard of this thing before. That's crazy   What's up with that guy's cheeky exposed nipple   Adaptation is definitely my favorite Nicolas Cage film, and one of my all time favorite films altogether. That would have been a perfect example. Or Leaving Las Vegas or Matchstick Men or Raising Arizona or Lord of War or Bringing Out The Dead or The Weather Man or even The Rock if you wanna get silly-but-still awesome.  Nicolas Cage was brilliant back in the day, but 8mm is just not at all very good.   There are so many absolutely fantastic Nicolas Cage movies. The man even has an Academy Award. And to make a point about all his movies being not silly you choose a cheesy over the top Joel Schumacher movie that is universally thought to be pretty silly.   *Kill them, Machine! Kill them all!*   Jeez, textures look rough as hell   Looks a lot more like Shaun than Fuzz  I am excited as hell. Shaun and Fuzz are two of my all time favorite movies and I never get sick of watching them over and over again. Edgar, Simon and Nick know how to pull off some of the most fun and fast paced, and yet incredibly intelligent and well crafted comedies you're gonna find today.  Honestly, in my opinion, this trilogy might even be revered years from now along with other brilliant cult comedies like Big Lebowsky, Airplane and Dr Strangelove.  EDIT: I hope Bill Nighy has a cameo   LOL NARWHAL BACONS AT MIDNIGHT   The Jim Lee was is pretty meh    Brad Bird made an amazing film I really hope he returns, but I heard something about Christopher McQuarrie, the director of Jack Reacher and Way of the Gun, directing this one.    Rebel of the Caboose would be a great title for the eventual porn parody    That opening paragraph did not make you out to be much of a sympathetic protagonist    I heard 3x bigger in terms of landmass, 5x if you include underwater and interiors   Those weird girls from middle school   So many new features and so much new content. I was not expecting this. Surely they're going to port this over to next gen? The next consoles come out like 2 months after this game is released, it'd be crazy to not have a simple ported version playable on them.   Thanks!   Yeah I understand real dinosaurs had feathers, but these are Jurassic Park specific dinosaurs, so I love that they're sticking to the classic design. It doesn't take much more than a quick throwaway line to explain it away through genetic engineering or whatever. I mean in real life raptors were like 4 feet tall, and I don't think anyone wants that.    No feathers. #JP4 - @colintrevorrow Twitter  https://twitter.com/colintrevorrow   Bah, sorry, I don't know how to link to a specific tweet   Should have been played by Michael Ironside   The director already confirmed no feathers    Except the Wolverine character in the movies is not short at all. Wolverine in the comics is short. Wolverine in the movies is the exact same height as Hugh Jackman. In no other Xmen or Wolverine movies including this one has he been short. He is always just as tall, even taller, than all the other characters.     *Punches television*    Weird. I loved the documentary series, but this really doesn't look like its presented in a documentary format at all. So it's like a normal movie about a dinosaur without any dialogue or anything?    Wow that is sad. Even the dog leaves.   BioShock Infinite came out recently and is one of the best games I've played in years   In the actual film the title is spelled out like that.   IRON MAN THREE  It looks weird.    I fucking love it   I don't think any GTA has ever had a song appear in a trailer and not in the final game    Well that looks ridiculously awesome    Did you go to one of the screenings?   Yeah the idea is really cool, but the boat seemed way too small and light.   I'm pretty sure Guillermo said that the voice was using 100% the same computery filter effects in the first trailer, and that the voice in this trailer, which is still very similar, will be the once in the film   I thought NPH and Bruce Greenwood were spot on for their roles, and DiMaggio was a really fantastic and different take on Joker, it was great to see that he didn't just try to copy Mark Hamill like so many people do. But I thought Jensen Ackles was pretty weak.   It's totally a valid excuse, but not when you're trying to get people to give you thousands of dollars for your weight loss program.   :(    I'm guessing Martian Manhunter will be next. But I reeeeaally hope we better get either Animal Man or Swamp Thing.   GD   A couple of references to the incident in New York and the Avengers, Happy Hogan calls them the Super Friends, which was funny. The Exxon oil company or whatever is mentioned. And of course Bruce Banner in the post credits sequence. Other than those little winks and nods this movie felt very separate from the rest of the Avengers universe.   I need an adult   I am up to here right now   Yeah that one stood out to me too. That was brutal.   nope   Stan Lee then says that he is anticipating the storyline that Palmiotti wrote for the game. Which is probably just a nice thing for Stan to say. He's a very busy man but I get the distinct impression he doesn't really read many comic books these days - Marvel, DC or otherwise - and is interested in other creative ventures, so I doubt he really has the time or desire to check out the in-game storyline here.  In the interview he did with Kevin Smith on Fatman on Batman he said he had never really read any DC comics at all   Yeah that's right. Whoopsie. Fixed   [spoiler](/s "Kinda obvious. I thought Gary Mitchel fit better and was a more interesting, less well known character, but Kahn is still pretty cool. I thought it might be a bit early in the new franchise to have that character show up,") but if the movie is great then it doesn't really matter who the villain ends up being.   I figure most people here have played the game with all the crazy posts about it recently, so I thought this would get an answer. I haven't bought it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually.  So I was wondering, what happens if you use Doomsday or Superman or Flash's super move while on the Watchtower map? The animation for those three supers definitely can only take place on the earth. Even Hawkgirl, Captain Marvel and Black Adam's super moves deal with the characters being below the clouds. Do the characters just magically teleport down to earth for the super move and then magically teleport back to the Watchtower to continue the fight?         So it seems that the Injustice: Gods Among Us roster is as follows:  Ares  Aquaman  Bane  Batman  Black Adam  Catwoman  Cyborg  Deathstroke  Doomsday  Flash  Green Arrow  Green Lantern  Harley Quinn  Hawkgirl  Joker  Killer Frost  Lex Luthor  Nightwing  Raven  Shazam  Sinestro  Solomon Grundy  Superman  Wonder Woman  That's 24 in total, and it appears there will be another 4 characters available as DLC with the season pass, which brings us to 28 characters. So if you could pick any 28 characters to be in Injustice, who would you have gone with?    Since there's still no confirmed director for the next Bond film, I thought it might be fun if we just discussed who we'd like to see take over from Mendes. Here are my top five choices, plus I think they're all fairly realistic.  1 - Martin Campbell  Directed two of the best bonds (in my opinion) and while it might be a safe or boring choice to bring him back, we'd be assured a great film. Plus his non-Bond films always end up being disasters anyway, so he might as well stick with subject matter he can pull off.  2 - Edward Zwick  Last Samurai, Blood Diamond, Defiance (with Daniel Craig) He just seems like exactly the kind of director who could make a great Bond film.  3 - Guy Ritchie  A lot of rumours are floating around about him taking over, and while it seems like a strange choice to me, the Sherlock Holmes filmed certainly showed that he's capable.  4 - Joe Wright  Another name that I've heard being mentioned a lot. I actually haven't seen anything of his besides Hannah, but I've heard good things.  5 - Matthew Vaughn  I'm not the biggest Vaughn fan in the world, but Layer Cake (with Daniel Craig) was pretty great, and the first half of Xmen First Class with all the Magneto revenge stuff is brilliant, and convinces me that he could potentially nail Bond.  EDIT  Bonus Director suggestion - David Yates  I wasn't super into Harry Potter, but the last couple movies looked incredible, and had some really impressive action sequences and some really cool and interesting directorial choices.  So what do you guys think?   Who would you like to see take over Bond 24 and why?  (Other choices that would be too weird or unrealistic or unlikely, just for fun, would be David Fincher, Tomas Alfredson, Kenneth Branagh, Pierre Morel, Chan Wook Park, Niels Arden Oplev, Luc Besson, and of course, Christopher Nolan)   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_(video_game)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POZEB-H_k_0  http://au.gamespot.com/bc/  BC was a video game under development by Lionhead Studios, but it was cancelled in 2004. I remember being so so incredibly excited for it as a kid, and I still haven't really gotten over it. It was going to be super huge and elaborate, super violent, really intelligent, but mostly really fun and over the top and a bit goofy.  Basically it was an open world RPG/action adventure game where you take control of a tribe of cavemen and have to fight dinosaurs, killer apes, sabretooth tigers, and other prehistoric monsters to ensure the survival and evolution of your species. Upgrade your caveman, craft new weapons and potions, learn magic, expand your campsite, manage your tribe, hunt for food or survival or fun.  Also dinosaurs, you guys. More games need dinosaurs.  Just imagining a game of this scale and awesomeness on the next generation of consoles and PCs makes me think they really need to get this project going again. No other game is like this, it's a totally new and original and exciting crazy fun sounding idea. At best I can guess it'd be like a prehistoric Skyrim meets Turok meets FarCry 3, only campy and silly and super violent with dinosaurs and monsters, and most importantly, bright colours and a fun cartoony art design, like games used to be before they got all super serious and big budget.  I would donate half the organs in my body to bring this game back.      My sister is 14, and she's always been very smart and good at reading. She's read the typical teenage girl stuff, but nothing really outside what everyone else her age is reading, and she never read very often. But recently when the Hunger Games movie came out, I mentioned that it was very similar to Battle Royale.  She seemed really interested so I got out my copy and borrowed it to her. She read it super quick and seemed to really love it. So I gave her Enders Game, and she loved that too. So I started giving her some of my favourite books, and told her she can read anything on my bookshelf. (as long as she asks first)  Now she doesn't want to read the normal stuff her friends read or her teachers reccommend her, now she wants the next book by Vonnegut or Gaiman or Twain. She even came home from school one day and said her English teacher mentioned that they'd be reading Animal Farm the next year, and that the teacher was super impressed that she had already read through Animal Farm and 1984 several times.   Now we can talk about awesome literature and we have even more in common. I feel like we've bonded closer as friends now and we always have something interesting to talk about. This is the first time I've gotten anyone into reading and I guess I'm just super proud. Thought I'd share. :)    So I've watched both these movies recently, for the thousandth time, and I just realized some weird similarities between the plots and events of both movies, and I was wondering if anyone else noticed this or maybe knew if it was intentional or anything.  Not only do the plots of both films involve a dysfunctional (to say the least) family being forced to live together in a remote building for extended periods of time with little contact with the outside world, but both films also have a climax at the end where the child in said dysfunctional family is chased through a maze by their murderous father.  Not only that, but both films remain relatively ambiguous as to whether or not the supernatural elements of the story are actually occurring, or are just the result of the main character's deteriorating mental state, with the exception of a scene in both films at the start of the final act where the supernatural beings help the main character escape from an otherwise inescapable imprisonment. (Jack is freed from the pantry by Grady, Ofelia is freed from her bedroom by the Faun)  So what do you guys think? Coincidence? Intentional parallel? Bit of a reach? Do you guys know of any other films with oddly similar elements?   When the New 52 started, Animal Man and Swamp thing were my favorite titles. They were so unique and weird and dark and well written and funny and fucked up. Both their first arcs were absolutely incredible and they quickly became my favorite current comics. Snyder and Lemire are definitely among the best writers working in comics today, and I have no problem at all with long story arcs. But then the lead up to Rotworld started and both titles seemed to just be spinning their wheels. Especially Animal Man. I love both characters, and I love the Rot, and the characters were great on their own in the normal world, but it hasn't been grabbing me like it used to. And now that Rotworld is underway I'm not really into it at all. Plus now Snyder is leaving Swamp Thing so I'm even less enthused. I really hope Lemire and whoever takes over after Snyder have some awesome unique stand alone stories because this whole crossover event has felt really drawn out and disappointing to me.      I've watched a couple videos and I think the game looks awesome, but I've never played any XCom games before, or any turn based strategies before. I've played some RTSs casually and enjoyed them, but I'm no expert. Will this game still be fun for someone who enjoys aliens and strategic battles, or will I be overwhelmed and destroyed like a caucasian StarCraft 2 player?   I watched the movie on tv while cooking dinner, so I feel like I maybe missed something. I absolutely loved the movie, and I thought the shot of Kong riding the nuke down would have been a perfect final shot before the nuclear explosion montage. But what was the point of the final scene where Strangelove freaks out and stands up? I totally got and loved the conversation they were having about basically restarting the arms race in a hundred years after the apocalypse, very funny and poignant, but what was happening to Strangelove? What was the Russian guy doing with that clock thing? Why end the movie there on that final line? What does it mean? Or is it just a funny line to go out on with no significance? I feel like I missed something and probably need to watch it again.  Also I wish that alternate pie fight ending was kept. That sounds brilliant.   I've started collecting Batman figurines, and so far I've got a Darkest Night Batman, a 70s Justice League Batman, an Arkham City Batman, a Batman Inc Batman, and a New 52 Batman. However, when it comes to a Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises design, every figure I can find is 6 or 12 inches, whereas all the other figures I have, as well as everything else on DC Direct, are 6.75 inches.  I bought a 6 inch Dark Knight Batman but it looks too small and silly next to the others. Does anyone know where I can get a good quality 6.75 inch figurine?         I'm looking for a cool book about aliens or an alien invasion or some sort of sci fi paranoia thriller type stuff.  I'm really sick of alien invasions and apocalyptic scenarios and anything big like that. The first acts of alien stories are always my favourite. Where it's just mysterious sightings and media hysteria and paranoia and suspense and all that jazz.  If anyone knows of some more slow-burning alien sci-fi books, that are less about alien invasions and more about the mystery and conspiracies and suspense, and most importantly, if you know of any books that can really give you something to think about, I'd love to hear about them!  Thanks, guys   I really want to try to tackle his massively convoluted epic of insanity, but there's just so many TPBs to track down. Plus, I heard that it'd all be coming to a conclusion sometime in the near future when Batman Inc finishes.  Has there been any word of a big clean collection of everything?   Grant Morrison and Barry Sonnenfeld have been hyping this thing up like crazy, and it looks like a nice fun bit of insanity, so I picked it up today.  Did anyone else know that this was not at all a complete story? I paid 20 bucks for this graphic novel, and it's 3 or 4 chapters, basically an introductory first act, and the Dinosaurs and Aliens don't even fight. The book was actually pretty cool. Nothing special, but a lot better than the silly premise would make it seem. I was actually really getting into it and enjoying where the story seemed to be going, and I was looking forward to exploring the crazy Dinosaur culture as well as the complex 'villain' aliens. But then it just suddenly ends before anything happens.    I'm assuming there must be more books coming, but for 20 bucks I was really expecting that I'd actually get the full story, not just the first act. Especially since that it didn't say Part 1 or anything on it and it wasn't advertised as being an incomplete novel. I can't find anything about when, or even if there's more coming.  Maybe I missed something or I'm just dumb.   I love gangster films, and especially Scorsese films, but I have a really big interest in Japanese Yakuza and Chinese Triads. Are there any really fantastic films based around these gangs that you guys could recommend? Preferably more 'modern' films would be great.  Thanks!   I don't know much about what happens 'behind the scenes' of comicbooks, so forgive me if this has been answered already or is kinda already common knowledge or something. Animal Man is probably my favorite book in the new 52, and one of the best books currently on the stands, and a part of what makes it great is the super surreal fucked up art by Travel Foreman. But the last couple issues it seems that the art has changed every couple of pages, as if another artist is taking over at random points. What is the significance of this?   I've been meaning to read through the 'Demon' trilogy I've heard so much about, but I'm not sure which books are officially part of the trilogy and in which order I should read them. According to Amazon there's Birth of the Demon, Bride of the Demon, Son of the Demon but then also Tales of the Demon. Can someone help me out?   I thought I had found one on Amazon, but when it arrived it had the new grey coloring. I'd happily buy a second hand one if such a thing is for sale anywhere.  Thanks in advance!   I thought I had found one on Amazon, but when it arrived it had the new grey coloring. I'd happily buy a second hand one if such a thing is for sale anywhere.  Thanks in advance!            Show us your weird animal friends!   Oh Jesus Christ I feel so empty now. We've been together for two years. She was the only thing in the world that mattered to me and she made me so happy and I loved her so fucking much. I have nothing now. I can't stop weeping.   But when Bane's men are hanging down from their plane and blowing the tail off the smaller plane and whatnot, wouldn't they be flying behind the speeding aircraft like a couple of weightless plane banners, instead of easily hanging straight down like they were repelling from a hovering helicopter or something?      I don't know a whole lot about comics, so forgive me if there is an obvious loophole here. But if Animal Man and Superman were in a fight for some reason, could Animal Man simply adopt Superman's powers to fight him? He can adopt the powers of pretty much any creature alive or dead, and I remember he even adopted Bwana Beast's powers that one time. Couldn't he just start taking powers from Superman and Flash and Captain Marvel and Aquaman and other heroes instead of just animals?  What is the limit to Animal Man's amazing and underappreciated power?      It is insanely packed with things to do and unlock and side missions and activities and cameos and oh my god I can't take it I'm so overwhelmed it's so glorious         I've only ever bought graphic novels and trade paperbacks from my local comic store, but now seems like as good a time as any to start buying comics monthly now that DC has rebooted, so I was wondering what you guys use to read your comics digitally.   An IPad is way out of my price range, but I was thinking a Nook or a Pandigital Novel would be a good choice. Do I have to download a DC app to download comics or is there a website I should use? What about other more obscure comics from other brands? Can I subscribe to titles I like? I've never bought eBooks or used a tablet so I have no idea how they work.  Thanks in advance, guys!   I was looking for a cool noir-style Elseworlds tale, and I stumbled across these two titles.   I don't have a lot of comic stores where I live, so pretty much the only chance I have of reading these is to just order them online, but I'm wondering if anyone here had read them and which one you guys thought was better? They both sound sorta similar.   [Gotham Noir](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Gotham_Noir) stars Gordon as an alcoholic detective and was written by Ed Brubaker, and [Nine Lives](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Nine_Lives) stars Dick Grayson as a PI and was featured on IGN's list of the best Batman graphic novels. Anyone have any opinions on which one makes for a better read?      I've been a Batman fan for only a couple of years, but I think I've started a fairly cool little collection of around ten or so graphic novels.  Today I purchased Black and White volumes 1, 2  amp; 3, I also have Year One, Dark Knight Returns, Hush, The Long Halloween, Dark Victory, The Killing Joke and Gotham by Gaslight. As much bigger Batman fans than myself, what other great trade paperbacks/graphic novels do you guys recommend I check out? If you could give me a little info on the titles you think I should read so I know what they're like that'd be fantastic. I hear Grant Morrison has done some really good stuff with Batman, but I'm looking for mostly self contained stories.  Thanks in advance!   And why? Would you choose the voice of Freddie Mercury, the guitar skills of Hendrix and the songwriting skills of Springsteen and become a rock god? Or would you choose the creative minds of Einstein, Tesla and Galileo and become a brilliant mad scientist so as to take over the world? Or would you take the witty word-wrangling skills of Douglas Adams, the Piano skills of Beethoven, and the voice of Isaiah Mustafa and just become everyone's favorite drinking buddy? You can choose any random combination of people from history, living or dead.      Apparently he was being a bad influence on the children as that music goes against Christian values. Australian school system, I am dissapoint.  It wasn't even Highway To Hell. He was teaching them to play Back In Black. Parents complained. He got fired.      Hey Reddit. I'm kinda new here. I haven't made a whole lot of posts or anything on Reddit before, I've just been browsing and enjoying the website for a little while, so I don't really know how these things work, but I thought maybe you guys could help me out with something.  My friend sent me a message today saying that her aerobics coach has been diagnosed with cancer and is bedridden and refusing to let people come see her. So my friend has decided to start sending her funny YouTube videos to cheer her up, and was wondering if I could help. I've sent a few, but I thought you guys would have tonnes of hilarious videos up your sleeves. So if you guys could maybe post the funniest YouTube videos you know of, I could link my friend to this post and she'd have tonnes of videos to send to her coach.  I have no idea what exactly this person finds funny or what kind of videos she likes or anything, nor do I know what kind of cancer she has, but I can fill you guys in once my friend replies to me. In the meanwhile, if you guys could just post me some funny videos I'd bee incredibly grateful.  Thanks!     	109

 The internet is full of people from all over the world.  Reddit is part of the internet.    Some people are stupid, stubborn, arrogant, or just plain assholes. Sometimes all of the above.   Nowhere else besides the internet can you interact with so many people all at once.   You're bound to come across this pretty regularly. Don't let it get to you or let it tarnish your view of humanity as a whole.   Perhaps its just a thought provoking question that could garner some interesting answers from people ranging from hilarious to sound advice, or sometimes both, quite likely read by some new users, as these questions are viewable by everyone and not just the person who asked the question.   I really wanted to tell her that there was some problems and point at her kids and say "Their atrocious manners, or in this case lack thereof, was the problem."  I probably would have gotten written up for that though, no matter the situation.   A very detailed story about my cats Prince of Persia antics that resulted in broken things and toilet water all over.   Millions of active subscribers on a single subreddit, and occasionally a question gets asked that's better suited for a different sub.  *IMAGINE THAT!*   There needs to be pre warning in general, so people aren't surprised by a sudden blockage in the road and 10 relatively unprotected people.   Also, a good portion of the time it's a lane closure, and they begin to taper the two lanes into one slowly giving 2 lanes of cars plenty of time to merge into one, in theory.  Also, they're often preparing construction even where they aren't current working (or so it appears). This can be misleading. They are actually doing something there.   I don't know. I've never met my teenage parents.   Remove the word naked and that's not a sentence that makes any sense...   "I had my clothes on, buy at least the dog was."   An underage smoking ticket. I was under 18, and smoking, so let me clarify *why* this was so ridiculous.   The legal smoking age in the US (or any tobacco products for that matter) is 18. This is also the age where you legally become an adult.   I was definitely breaking the law, so a ticket was in order, but here's the fun part: Since I was 17 years old, I was charged as an adult, which for this particular citation meant triple the fine. Instead of a $100 fine, I got a $300 fine.   Yes, you read that right. I was **charged as an adult for committing a crime that had I been an adult, would not have been a crime.**   People who are quiet. A lot of times these people have some degree of social anxiety and the last thing they need is to be called out about being quiet and become the center of attention. Happens way too frequently.   TIL. Never ceases to amaze me how no matter what the topic is there is *always* a relevant subreddit.   If you have to resort to asking anonymous people on the internet, it's not very thoughtful... at least not on your part...   I work in a gas station and this kind of thing is bound to happen occasionally and it's not really a big deal. Sometimes you grab something thinking you want it and decide you want something else and put it down there. It's lazy but not really a big deal.   The other day though... this lady stops right in front of the door (which is a no parking zone as per fire code) but made a very fast beeline to the bathroom. I figured she had a turtle head poking out so I let it slide (no pun intended) and said nothing. She was in there for like half an hour. When she finally came out she just walked outside and got in her car and sat there for another 10 or so minutes. Then she got back out and came inside with 2 girls (I'd guess 10 and 13). I figured they were gonna buy something, but no, she says to the kids "Wait for me here I'll be right back".  The kids immediately begin grabbing handfuls of merchandise from one shelf and putting it on other shelves. Like 30+ misplacements with a minute. So I calmly walked out and began putting things back where they belong and said "You're gonna stop doing that." Now one of the kids keeps grabbing a random item and running to me saying "How much is this???", handing it to me and then saying "Never mind I don't want it" while the other one slinks away behind some shelves or aisles to continue misplacing items and potentially steal shit.   Normally when I watch a suspicious person, I try to make like I'm doing something else that requires me to be near them until I actually see them shoplifting or whatever. Not this time, these kids were straight up **brats.** I just stood there staring daggers at them the entire time their mom was in the bathroom.   So like 10 more minutes go by and mom comes back out of the crapper and says to the kids "Were there any problems? Did anyone bother you?" The older one says "This guy (points to me) was following us around staring. It was scary." then hugs her mom. Her mom gives me a death stare and says something about how she was gonna buy something but not anymore, bitches a bit more and storms out with her daughters. I was dumbfounded.   If it's regular than yeah, but a lot of minimum wage dead end jobs have extremely sporadic schedules and this happening from time to time really isn't that ridiculous.   Midwest USA.   That's impossible without knowing the highest form of evolution, which would be purely guesswork for a multitude of reasons.   Life has no objective meaning to it other than to continue. So if you really want an objective meaning, it's to survive long enough to fuck enough times to have at least a few healthy well adapted offspring to perpetuate your genes. That's kinda depressing though, looked at as face value.   Aside from that, every person's "purpose" ,if you will, is for themselves to decide.   Telling someone to walk in and demand (politely) to speak with a hiring manager to leave a good impression, and in theory upping your chances of being hired.  More often than not these managers are busy as fuck with all types of things, not just looking through applications and resumes, and chances are pretty good they've already seen your resume anyway. They often feel like you're just wasting their time.   This applies less to small business and "mom and pop" stores but let's face it how many competitive wage jobs can be found in those markets?   "Is your ass jealous of the incredible amount of shit that comes out of your mouth?"  	19
 very cool!   very good!   very cute!   I learned the 7/11 breathing method from a counselor...you breathe in for 7 seconds, then out for 11....this will bring a panic attack under control Hope this helps!   pretty cool idea!   very cool!   very cool pic   I certainly don't mean to wait until they are three to read to them, I am just saying by that age they will learn to enjoy chapter books   Seems like your food budget is extremely high...you could easily cut that in half I would think   I have figured up how much it costs us for mortgage and utilities.  Me and my boyfriend each put $200 in our joint account a week.  Our expenses are about $1200 a month so we have extra in there for home maintenance, a snowblower, lawn mower, etc.  We each pay our own car insurance, cell phones, and 1/2 of the food...keeps things simple, I only write 3 checks a month from the joint account and all the bills are paid.   gorgeous!   great pic!   awesome!   what kind of dog is he? very cute!   happens here too   great pic!   so cute!   cool!    very cute...have an upvote   Plus I think freezer jam tastes so much better than canned!    Read to your kids alot....as soon as they are 3 or so, start reading chapter books, like just one chapter each night... choose classics like Charlottes Web.  It will give them a love for reading when they learn that  not every story ends in 15-30 minutes...and kids who love to read are smarter, because they learn so much  	21
 Outside of pressurized storage, there have been a number of different research directions, including metal hydrides, porous materials, and different versions of chemical storage. The metal hydrides have seen more than a decade of intense research, and the challenges remain - one may be able to enable H2 uptake, but then the release kinetics are slow, or vice-versa, and they may be unstable over many cycles (and hence degrade).  Another area that has been interesting is that of metal organic frameworks, which the materials community called MOFs (pronounced 'mops', but with an 'f').  MOFs are synthetic porous structures that have enormous surface area, and most importantly, they can be tuned through synthetic chemistry to enable precise tailoring of characteristics.  They were shown early on (work of Omar Yaghi and others) to enable gas storage. Early concerns about stability of these structures to industrial conditions are being addressed by people like Jeff Long, and others.    Yaghi Group: (http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/bio.html)  Long Group: (http://alchemy.cchem.berkeley.edu/home/)  Dichtel Group: (http://dichtel.chem.cornell.edu)  I heard Jeff Long give a talk recently, and his results for industrial applications of MOFs (he was talking about CO2 storage and gas separation in that seminar) were very impressive - the stability was excellent at higher temps, in the presence of quite a nasty mix of effluent gases.    Storage, of course, is a huge issue.  For solar, the two big problems, of course, are clouds and the diurnal cycle of the earth (i.e., night!).  In addition, for mobile applications, storage is essential at all times. It is interesting to watch what is going on with respect to solar-powered water splitting (electrolysis of water) to generate hydrogen.  What I will call the "Dan Nocera/Nate Lewis" vision is one of cheap solar cells that generate electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen; the hydrogen can be stored in a tank under your lawn, under a park, village square, etc, and then fed back into inexpensive fuel cells to generate electricity on demand.  Some good overview links include: Nocera TEDx talk: (http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-Sustainocene-era-of-perso-2), Lewis Lab: (http://nsl.caltech.edu/energy).   It sounds completely corny, but it's highly motivating to interact with such incredibly smart people every day - authors, reviewers, my fabulous students, our editors, and editors of other journals with whom I often work. I often feel worried that I will let them down, and so I try to use even 2 minutes of downtime to get something done.  2 minutes here, 5 minutes there, it all adds up.  People like Paul Weiss, Prashant Kamat, Kirk Schanze, Laura Kiessling, are all high flyers who are always smiling, and going going going - their attitude is infectious.    Hello Reddit! I am a Professor of Chemistry at the [University of Alberta and the National Institute for Nanotechnology in Canada](http://buriak.chem.ualberta.ca). I am also Editor-in-Chief of the journal, [Chemistry of Materials](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/cmatex), published by the American Chemical Society. The focus of my research group is the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials and surfaces for applications in renewable energy, self-assembly for semiconductor-based electronics, and lots of other related directions.  Research in renewable energies is one of the fastest growing research areas in science, if not **the** fastest. Thousands of scientists worldwide are focusing their careers and working lives on developing the means for civilization to be powered by renewables. Seem like a dream?  Research that is ongoing both in universities and industry around the world is pushing hard to make renewables a widely-deployed reality.    More solar energy hits the surface of terrestrial earth than all of humanity uses in a single year - we have a massive fusion reactor 'burning' in the sky, which represents the largest single source of energy humanity has at its disposal. The use of widespread solar energy has been stymied by a number of factors, including storage issues (due to intermittency caused by pesky clouds and the rotation of the earth), real or perceived higher costs of solar-derived electricity compared to fossil fuel-based generation, and general lack of understanding.  At our journal, Chemistry of Materials, we receive many manuscript submissions each year, more than half of which are related to applications in renewable energy, including solar energy capture and transformation into electricity and solar fuels, battery storage, chemical storage (i.e., hydrogen, and CO2 conversion to diesel), and others. People are working hard on designing and producing cheap and flexible solar cells that can be printed like newspapers, while others are envisioning batteries that use salt from the ocean as their electrolyte, amongst many remarkable ideas.  Please join me for a discussion about the materials being designed and produced today that are already being tested and applied, worldwide, for renewable energy generation and storage. Thank you!  **Hi - I have to go (day-job is calling), but I will try to answer all questions throughout the day. Please keep the questions coming! So interesting  Jillian**  	4
 That's what my friend said! It would be fantastic!    Has anyone had an actual lucid dream with the dream Z app? I've tried but with no success. I want to know if I should keep trying or just stick with using an alarm to wake up 5 hours after I sleep.    Wouldn't it be great if they played the Rings of Akhaten song, The part where the girl sang?   Xlan16 is right. You're never  going to know what happens in your dream. What you should do is try biting your tongue, or try plugging your nose and try to breath. The biting your tongue almost always works for me. Good Luck!    More then likely he won't be seeing any of 11 because in an interview he said that he wasn't invited back for the 50th episode, unless they decide to throw him in there before 11 regenerates.    I want to be something happy but then sad at the same time. Anyway they do it will be brilliant.    Great job, that looks incredible        	9
 Aw man... . You know what is sad, I don't have to. I already know what his reaction will be. He's going to look hurt and then tell me he is sorry but he doesnt want to do those things. Then he'll sleep. When he wakes up he'll tell me he's sorry again and tell me he'll try to learn about what I would like to try. That will be done to placate or 'shut me up' and then he will never look into dom/sub stuff, he'll never talk about it again until I bring it up, and he will seem bored and unconvinced that he should do it. Then he'll go back to sleep.   I think it's pretty much already been stated, this convo has been being had for 2 years now...and nothing from him. No inkling of wanting to do it. Also, ive never seen anyone look and act so bored about sex as he is. So moving on? I think we all know that answer.   Raises right hand, it's still holding the slider from my bong toke!   Breaking that prudish part of yourself can be hard. But I think it's easier to get a chick to do this than a guy. A lot of women have rape fantasies. Something as simple as blindfolding her and using a feather w/ alternating spanks on ass, thighs, even feet, can be amazing and stimulate the senses.  Man, I hope this stuff works for you!! Good luck!!!   well in that case, OOoh la la, where have you been all my life! You ready to chain me up to a wall and turn me into a trained pet?   I really like your idea! And best of luck to you with your wife!!   When in doubt, don't put out!   I think you did too. I have been made to not cum for up to 10 hours. I couldn't sleep or get off or anything. And,...o man, it was great. =P when i released i came 14 times. FOURTEEN   You hit the nail on the head. It is ending. I can't help but feel responsible for it since what my needs are are vastly different from his. I thought my urges would go away but they are only getting stronger and I had tried suppression. Heh. that SO did NOT work. But you are right, the communication is nil. I live with a man that I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm a stranger around him.   We've been together so long, I think, because its comfortable. But it's less and less comfortable for me. It's almost like I do not know him anymore :(   Your post freaking helped me! We should look for men together!!!   Heh, I wish he'd even try that. I actually did try something similar that you suggest...and he just rolled over and went to bed. That is how he 'solves' everything, by sleeping and ignoring the issue.   He won't leave me. He's freaking bonded like crazy glue. Nope, I gotta do that. And teasing him,...he does not register it the way I would, he ignores it.   Like I stated before, I might not want it 24/7 if he would play with me even a little. I am beyond the point of making excuses for him. He just simply WILL NOT PLAY. I am 100% ok with doing what ever he wants. But that has to end, b/c I ALWAYS do what he wants and the most crazy thing we do is "lets stand and fuck". I'm not kidding. I wish I were.  BTW: It took us a long time and my bff yelling at him to realize that its actually important to get the girl off. Otherwise he would just roll over and sleep and tell me to "finish myself". He's starting to do that again.  As for your wife, I'd say start with small things. Leather paddle maybe, or even some restraints tied to a bed. Just her arms then, if she likes that, you can move to the legs being tied up. You could blindfold her and really go to town haha!! Just make sure she feels safe. That is your number one goal!! Good Luck!!   LoL.   It's true!!   1. He refuses to compromise, at all. He simply will not do it. It's so aggrevating I want to tear my nails out sometimes. I can't express how awful it is to bend over on someones lap and tell them "ive been naughty, spank me" and have them nonchalantly push you off them and go back to watching Youtube. 2. I am very focused on sex. That is why I came to r/sex. I feel like my sexual health isn't being exercised, and I wanted to know if what I was feeling was ok or right. What I am finding is my sinking feeling of I need to break up is something that a lot of people would agree with. I'm not being selfish, he is by not even trying. I'm willing to do pretty much anything for him and I think I posted that I've asked what he wants. He wont tell me what he wants. He just...it's like he has almost no libido.  Also, you're right, relationships are more than just sex. But when your being sexually stifled and have 1 libido that is GO at 96% of the time/day or night...and one who is about 5% eh, ok, we can fuck, once a day/every few days/week...I'm sorry, but I can't do it... I've tried like hell for two years...   Haha... I have this cute comment waiting but I don't know if this is the right place. ^_^   I don't believe he has one dominant bone in his body. He ignores his own sexual needs to the core. That being said, I think the internet wants me to leave him, which is fine by me, I can't be denying myself for much longer.   No one abused me when I was younger and it's not about 'being treated like shit'. Its absolutely wonderful to be treated like a slave/pet/sub. It's what I prefer. You don't, it balks you to say nasty things on reddit. But I am sure that anyone in a healthy D/s relationship will tell you it's not abuse and it's not unhealthy. It's consensual and beautiful.   I've actually got an acct with them...thanks for reminding me. I should really go over there, see whats going on.   I'll check that out, thanks :)   Thank you for your support. And yeah,  I hope to find someone better   I kind of did, didn't I?   That's kinda where I am at "what's the point"   Piedmont of NC   Its hard to not feel selfish. I fought myself for a long time about who I am sexually-speaking. I hated my sub-self. So I hid it, and when I realized thru lots of self exploration, reading, and learning that there is not one thing wrong with me I had to get over that head game. When I expressed it to him, what I wanted he seemed just..non-interested. Like what I need is non-consequential. It's stifling to be told no and that it's you, when really, deep down, I know it's not me. I'm not repressed the way I was, and I can't deal with being in a repressive relationship.   Full-time, but he won't play at all.   I have tried the porn thing. TODAY even I tried it. His response was to look at me funny and go to bed for the next several hours. He's up now and still nothing.  But your right, he is wasting a perfectly good sub. I want to be trained!!   I need to seek hard to find a good one tho...   I'll be on my way as soon as I figure out how to leave this dude I am with. I'm so beyond done. I care about him but he refuses to perform and he knows what I need...one can only care for so long before boredom and loathing set in.   I live in the southeast bible belt. I am an atheist. Trust me, this is isn't going to be as easy as it looks. I might have to relocate!   It's been years since I've looked for men. This is going to be crazy hard...   Well, I've been 'really unhappy' for a while now.  Where do I find hair pulling men??   I feel like I have done all I can do. It's up to him and he'd rather roll over and pass out with No stinging the air. There is no play, not one little bit. Maybe I wouldn't desire it so strongly if I could get it out of my system, but it's going to get bad if he doesn't turn around. I will leave him. It's the only fucking recourse here.  Thus comes the whole "find a new guy" crusade, one that does what I need. I hope it's not freaking hardcore to locate!!   I just don't think he realizes that it is important. Then he'll apologize later on for how he is. I've tried to find out/do things he likes but there's very little response in that category. It seems very wishy washy   Well, it's also how I am talked to and treated and made to feel. But yeah, it's like that.   I'm 27. And yeah, it is like he doesn't care. Then he gets all apologetic to me saying "i don't know why i can't do those things for you, and I'll try", but it's much more pacifying talk than anything.   O.O   Oh, I have. Many, many times. It's gotten so bad I've actually cried later on b/c he gets this No thing and just shuts down, rolls over and goes to sleep. ONCE he did tie me up, and b/c that happened 'before' it doesn't need to happen 'now'.   Haha... I don't think cheating is quite the answer. But if I break up, expect a different posting from me...it's really THAT bad.   hehe, i have this guy's exact problem but in reverse.   I want to be treated like a sex slave. All the time. I want to be tied up and have my hair pulled and have slave bells, I want all of that. I have a boyfriend, and Ive tried for 2 years now to get him to do anything beyond vanilla with me. It's proven to be incredibly frustrating for me, as I ~~want~~ need to have this done to me, otherwise I don't get any fulfillment with sex...Any ideas, tips, thoughts, suggestions?   your a lucky man, but she's even luckier you're actually going to do it. i want to do that for my guy...he's absolutely not budging, it makes me so sad ;_;   Me too..Id like the email option   I don't know if I actually trust this guy's theories. He seems kinda 'we dont know therefore aliens', kinda guy.  ..and before you get on my case, I have had my own experience(s), but I'm still very skeptical of this guy.   That's actually kinda sad :(   Mmm Yummy :)   And then shit the fire of Mordore   I just threw up a little in my mouth, excuse me please.   I love this guy. I'm actually going to friggin' vote. edit: I think he should do an AMA. I'm not kidding. Let's get behind this guy!!!   no, no, they were fakes... but thats not to say there aren't VERY good, clear photos and videos of unusual phenom in the sky  Happy hunting!   I have almost all of this except for the SP. Not bad. As a kid I used to concentrate on the floaty feeling really hard and could make myself actually dizzy by making my body feel as though I were floating. To be truthful, I love it. However, I agree, it is better when you sleep alone...having a shifty in bed partner...kinda sucks...   I have no problem with eating meat. However, the treatment of said "meat" while in life is, to me, of utmost importance. I'm not saying they get heated floors and mani/pedi's every Saturday morning with a latte.  What I'm saying is I am 100% for ethical treatment of food while it's alive. No matter if it's a dog, cat, rabbit, cow, pig, duck, goose, or fish. It's mind boggling to me that people could feel ok with doing this to something alive. Not to freakin' mention that mammals when living in a stressful and/or unhealthy living conditions release chemicals from the brain that DO NOT EXIT THE BODY. Instead, they build up in the muscle...and what of animals, pray tell, do we eat? The fucking muscles. So what? You might think. Heh... These chemicals don't release from our bodies, either. That means even if going thru the digestive system they can be absorbed into the body and are not passed. This build up of negative emotional chemicals into the body happens in our own lives! Why the fuck would you want to eat something that has been freaking miserable its whole life, knows nothing but misery and has been releasing this chemical into it's muscles and then YOU and your Family ingest this meat. Maybe, just maybe, the reason so many people are on things like Prozac or Zoloft might actually stem from the living conditions and overall mental soundness of the freaking meat we are eating.  Ok. Sorry to write all of that, I was going to make a short comment and that just blurted out of me. I feel very passionate about this idea of mine and I really do feel that it does matter what you eat and how it was handled in life. In fact, if you have ever gotten meat from farmers who have clean pastures and feed their, say, cattle with grains, oats, molasses and not just soley corn, you know you can taste the difference. And I also feel good after I eat it, not like the feeling you get from McD's or even most store bought meat. /my 2cents   i knew i didn't like clowns   Well, hehe, since I get a choice, I'll go with Fission :)   you were touched by his noodley appendage and ye, you were filled. :)   how do i set fire in space????   no one else will get this, but..that is sooo minty   Yeah, I thought the same thing. I'd lie lie lie to get my ass outta there   I never felt like it was bad., but it was never really impressed upon me, either. I can absolutely see this as something the women will only share with the bishop and feel absolute inner guilt that something that feels amazing is demonized and "satan is within you, controlling you". I feel lucky in that way...however, I was incredibly sheltered from all things sexual so for the most part I really didn't know I was even engaging in masturbation(i didn't exactly touch myself so it wasn't the same, right?!)   Basically this translated to me: we won't give you this money unless you do some work, and what better way for us to keep an eye on you and control you more then you keep you in the church building itself and make you work! Nothing wrong with working for your money, but working for money that keeps you in a perpetual guilt for something absolutely natural is sick and twisted.   When my Bishop was gone for a while, his First Counselor took over the interviews for the temple. He actually did ask me if I masturbated, and I lied and told him no. But they never discussed this with the women the way they do with men. It's freaking crazy, and really really awful. It kinda...makes me sick   How does that even come up in a meeting with the Bishop? Do they ask you if you do it, or watch it and how often? Or is like, more than one offense grounds to recommend this?   So... I had no idea about this til today. I am very disgusted about the level the church steeps down to in regards to masturbation, especially to the priesthood. And for what? To instill in these youth/men that there is something wrong with them, that they are addicts to porn and masturbation. Wow. So,..I did a little digging because I was curious and found this :) http://www.sonsofhelaman.org/?p=program_summary  I very much enjoyed this: http://www.sonsofhelaman.org/?p=answers qid=63  Then I found these: http://groups.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=74358 sid=1307514490.1743_12604 city=Ogden county=Weber state=Utah#group and http://www.blogger.com/profile/02766236371559828795  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14969804/Final%20Complete%20Writings%20of%20SoH%205-2-2011.pdf  http://mwharkertherapist.blogspot.com/  Ugh. It's just sickening to read this. I feel for people living in Utah, going thru this. If anyone has ever been to one of these meetings or knows something about this, let me know.   im reading this and drinking a beer, so i am getting a kick :)   im reading this and drinking a beer, so i am getting a kick :)   I  Jimmy Johns...this does not deter me from my Italian Night Club with Salt and Vinegar Chips and a Root Beer. ...anyone else? /munchies //also..they do use sarcasm in their marketing...it's no matter   my brain is bleeding   Hitler was involved in occult practices, this was stricken by Winston Churchill but it's not unknown.

And, for real, congratulations :)   this needs more upvotes and we need to make a youtube channel and maybe get some tv commercials going if it really takes off. i support this fully. I'm in.      I don't normally upvote, but when I do it involves Blow Up dolls and Raptures :)  I want to do this now!!!   ^_^ it's just skin! haha...we taste like pork   I've chewed and eaten the skin tags on my thumb...does that count? it's kinda salty..   This kinda shit has always bothered me. Even Amish know to bring their families into the hospital, dr, dentist if someone should need it. These people are just batshit insane and one step away from having a 'Children Under The Stairs' scenario.  /Everyone knows The Flying Spaghetti Monster DOES NOT FAITH-HEAL     high   omg yes they do, and i dunno if this is normal but they also asked me if i did inappropriate behavior with my siblings. i freaked    ...so tornados hitting TORNADO Alley is now considered a part of Global Warming?...okay....I'm still not 100% on the "every storm is global warming" bandwagon. I do, however, see an intensity with these storms that is upped from previous years but, we don't have thousands of years or even more than 200 years of info on what tornados can do...I dunno.

Thank you for writing all those words.   I was not aware there was! Thank you Flat_Lander :)   ^_^ thank you. that was rather awesome of a reply. maybe i have been talking with really big douchey atheists? and you are correct they are loud (anger and hatred have a tendency to be loud anyways) I dunno, I still don't like the term Atheist, but I guess that it doesn't really mean to imply the anger, just the lack of belief of god.   i know, but i was just thinking about that off-chance and kinda got sad :( fgm is so sad :(   **also-atheism isn't about belief, it's about a lack of belief**   No, no, you are right, I am indeed bitching. Also, I am not a "sir", heh. I just, I'm new here and I don't get how all the hating of theists is really any different from the hatred coming out of the Westborough Church. While the Westborough Church'll say god(who doesn't exist) hates you and is glad that our soldiers died, it's really not that different from how Atheists I see on here act toward religion/religious people. And while I don't believe the shit they spew at churches, I do find that most religious people are generally nice if you don't tell your views. In fact, lots of people who are religious don't even really discuss it, they show they are "good christians" through their actions of charity and kindness. While maybe it's only b/c they think the flying spaghetti monster is always watching, it's a helluva lot nicer than sitting in a room of Atheists who are bitching about the theists. I dunno, maybe the poster above you is right about the "anti-theists". I'm not an angry atheist, and I'm not trying to push anything on anyone. I kinda like people to be, oh happy, and not oh, try to make others feel badly for what they think. :/   it's nice to see that part of your good day was to make her feel bad... i am an atheist but it really pisses me off when atheists get off on making theists feel terrible about how they feel. if they aren't pushing their irrationality on you, leave it alone. ...consider the football player that always wears the same socks for a game, he thinks it makes him always win when he wears them, but doesn't tell anyone. he never hurt a single person due to his irrational thought and didn't press it upon his teammates to do something similar, and why would you make that football player feel bad about the socks he wears? same goes true for religion. however-if they are pressing their religion on you by all means talk with them about your viewpoints and don't agree with them, but for fuck's sake making people feel bad and being happy about that later, that's fucking sick and it's sadistic. goddamn atheists have a better than thou or smarter than thou attitude ... and you wonder why ppl hate you so much? think about it.   I can't believe I am the first one to point this out but... if this story is true, and that girl just happened to be foreign, there is a chance she may have undergone FGM[Female Genital Mutilation], and would, indeed pee and bleed out of the same hole. Yeah, it's absolutely infuriating to think about it happening, but it does happen in USA and Canada as well as many First World Countries. TERRIFYING(fmg should be an awareness rage comic or somethin')   I want this to be true, oh so true. /misses Pete and Pete too :(   i thought it was something spiritual as a child til i got older and realized it wasn't. always wondered if it had a name...both my boyfriend and i have this   good to see other people get out of that religion. i was raised in a part-member lds home, and i believed. i did until i started learning about the history and a few other things... grats.  did you ever study the history of joseph smith and what he did?   I live there off and on. Nice peeps! Cook out rox!!   I absolutely concur. 100%. I had this tequila hangover that wouldn't quit, but two hits later I was a-ok. Still a little groggy, but I was able to stop vomiting on a cross state trip thru Florida   I just went to PP for the first time yesterday. Thank you for working there. I am saddened that there is so much controversy over such an important service for women. The people who work there are not monsters, they are giving women a choice, a choice to keep themselves healthy and prepared. If it weren't for PP, so many home abortions would occur which are incredibly dangerous. I don't comprehend the negativity surrounding this, it's primarily for the safety of women and the choice is there's. BTW, PP is not just about abortion, but for many religious groups that is all they think about. Once again thank you and I hope your funding doesn't get cut.  	98

A new trailer for DC Universe Online has been released today where Game director Chris Cao Shows us a portion of Metropolis that all comic book fans are familiar with - Suicide Slums.     This is why foreigners hate Americans.  I mean, how pathetic can you be?  At least she let one of our men in uniform go ahead of her.     Can I have an Amen!   Fantastic.  You should dell those bad boys. amazing   Someone named Joseph Senior, just made me think that Hello Kitty was kind of cool.  That's an amazing artist right there.  Mr. Senior has crossed Hello Kitty with mainstays of popular culture such as Wolverine, Batman, Star Wars, Star Trek, Buzz Lightyear, and even Robocop.  Genius.   Gfest loves exclusives.  Especially SDCC exclusives.  The word exclusive to a comic/action figure lover is as powerful as cocaine is to Lindsey Lohan.

Remember the scene is in the original "Men in Black" movie where Will Smith auditions for Tommy Lee Jones and Rip Torn to determine if he has what it takes to be a part of the team?  Well Heidi Montag apparently put together this god awful audition tape for Michael Bay to land Megan Fox's role in "Transformer's 3."     However, hidden in the latest Warner Brothers studio report at The Hollywood Reporter is a hint at what role DC will play in the studio's future plans in the way every fan has been waiting for: more DC movies. And apparently first up on the slate will be the fastest man alive himself.   Actor Temuera Morrison, best known to gfesters as Jango Fett in Stars Wars, has been very candid lately about his role as Abin Sur in the upcoming Green Lantern Movie. In fact, in an interview with Latino Review, he revealed several great little nuggets of wisdom about the film.   Mattel released the exclusive packaging and content of this years DC Comics SDCC exclusive Plastic Man action figure, your friends at Gfest were as excited as Dick Grayson when he became Batman (despite the fact he is a whiny little bitch).

Andrews garnered almost 40% of the vote from the user-determined contest. The most popular video montage of Andrews on YouTube has been viewed over one million times.   lucky baby benjamin   Apparently, JJ Abrams has a trailer for a new movie entitled "Super 8" all ready for everyone to view this weekend when Iron Man 2 debuts.

 For my fellow ladies who are endowed with fleshy labias- getting your inner lips shoved into your baby hole during sex. It pinches the clit and pulls and ow :(   Sorceress, by Celia Rees. I don't know if anyone is familiar with it, but it's the sequel to her first book, called Witch Child. They're more young adult than fiction, but if you are interested in the Salem Witch Trials, I highly recommend both of these books. They're not about Salem, but about colonial era witch superstitions. Anyway, in Sorceress, the girl ends up married to an Native American man named Jaybird, and they have two children, a boy and a girl. I'm not going to spoil what happens, but just the writing is so heartwrenchingly good, I've read this book three times and every time I end up crying.  Also, Before I Fall. Bawled my eyes out.     	3

"SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years    He Never Blamed the Booze!   His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze!   Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/anthrax-exposure-estimate-climbs-to-84-at-atlanta-lab-1.2682263  And we are all fucking terrorized now.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.  This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.  We cover these types of global stories:  * Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.  * Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.  * Floods and flood watches/warnings.  * Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.  * Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.  * Food Recalls.  * Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.  * Mass animal die-offs.  * Nuclear accidents and events.  * Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.  * Wildfires.  * Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.  If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.  We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.  As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.  Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.  If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.                                                                           	198
 If you found $//10,000 right now, what would you do with it?   What would your superhero name and power be?    Dude, I'm pretty much the same. However, I HAVE had relationships and sexual encounters before, but right now they don't interest me. It's not like there are harrowing memories which are causing me to distance myself from intimacy, it's just due to the fact that I can't be bothered, in all honesty.   Some will say it's weird and unnatural, but it's my body and I don't feel obliged to share it with anyone.    Good question! I'm not entirely sure but I can hazard a guess.  Your home is your fortress, your emotional base and safety net. Inviting somebody into your home and showing them around is probably a sign of trust.    Woody Harrelson would be livid.    Classic Internet.   Good luck! Stay focused :)   Yeah, such a shitty thing to do to the people that are keeping you afloat! Companies like this are just more interested in money than anything else.    The snuggliest thing ever.    Some guy that went I my school. He thought he was the best, whereas he was in fact a total cunt. Silly, arrogant cunt.   And somehow he was popular and the ladies loved him. *sigh*   Classic Internet.    I tend not to complain, purely because I know what it's like to have someone complaint to you, and it can be uncomfortable.   However, in a restaurant once, my garlic bread was soggy, so I asked for it to be replaced in the nicest way possible. They obliged and I got an extra portion for free.   I'm more likely to 'politely question' the service I'm receiving, as people are much responsive to soft probing, as opposed to ranting and demanding. If you are kind and explain your point reasonably, most service staff will find it hard to turn down your requests, whether your complaining about the state of your hotel room, or you want your soggy garlic bread replaced.   TL;DR: Politely question the service you receive instead of complaining. You'll easily get what you want.    I'm travelling around the world come January and I want to teach English as a foreign language. I hear that teaching in China is well-paid and sometimes they even pay your accommodation. Do some research into teaching English in Asia, there's TONNES of info. :)   I live for adventures and making others happy. I care very little for my own well-being, I am too focused on the world around me.  Life is huge!    People that don't understand the difference between respecting somebody's opinion and respecting someone's RIGHT to hold that opinion.   I respect that people have the right to say what they want, when they want and to who they want. Doesn't mean I have to respect what they say.    Whenever the woman doesn't look like she's enjoying it.    Absolutely agree. So stress-free; you know where you are going to be at what time, your whole day is planned for you, you know who you're going to see.   But life is huge! The world is full of wonders. Do what you love, no matter what anyone else thinks or says. Stay chill, stay true to yourself, be kind and be the person YOU want to be.    I've slept naked all my life, no matter what the weather is like. At someone else's house: just boxers.    From now one, I'll flip my cupcakes over. What a genius idea! I love frosting!    Yeah! When my mouth is really dry, I feel like cold water doesn't 'wet' the inside of my mouth or throat. I'm rehydrated, but the thirst isn't quenched.    I've only used it once out of interest.   Found a contract killer's site. He charged $10,000 (or the BitCoin equivalent) per assassination; $30,000 if it was a political figure.   There are also marketplaces for every drug under the sun, guns, stolen goods and even counterfeit money. I found one site where you asked for an item and the guy would go and steal it for you.   LOT'S of child pornography as well, which is why I don't want to use it again. I didn't actually see any myself, as most of those sites/image boards are flagged, so you can avoid it if you want to.   I did hear that there's also a lot of very useful and helpful stuff on there, but I didn't stumble across any of it.    http://i.imgur.com/GwrxA.jpg   Such good ideas. I'm so absent-minded it's pathetic.   For anyone on a disciplined diet, cure your sweet-tooth cravings with sugar-free gum.    Saw this walking down the street: http://i.imgur.com/0CREl.jpg   Trying to deal with the notion that you can't always thank someone or do something to help is hard. I just try my best to help anywhere/anyway I can. I love actively making someone's day better. It's the little things that count, I suppose :)   Get out. You can go to Washington DC anytime you want if I means that much to you. Focus on surrounding yourself with love, kindness and positivity, not people who bring you down all time. Life's too short.   PS. That person isn't your best friend. I'm sorry if that hurts to hear.    I remember learning about this at school. We got told also that some of the women died as a result of infection, due to the pipes cutting their oesophagus as they were force-fed.     I had a good one about some butter. I won't tell you because you only spread it.   Thanks a lot, take care, all the best x   Takes me back to my rent boy days.    Shit! I'm actually doing this in January!  Me and my best fucking bro in the world had been talking about travelling the world for ages. About 2 months ago I handed my notice in at work and bought a one-way ticket to Australia.   We're going to live there for a year with a working holiday visa and then just go with the flow.   I'm in the process of selling all of my possessions. It makes you realise how much shit you have. One of my friends described it as, 'shedding my skin.'  Take the plunge and shed your skin. You said it yourself, nothing is holding you back! :)   I was addicted to getting achievements when I first got my 360. Eventually, I would hear the 'Achievement Unlocked' sound ALL THE TIME.   Also, playing Gears Of War everyday for 2 years, I would get really angry/upset if I had a bad run of games.    http://i.imgur.com/Rq0Fl.jpg   I said the same thing after reading 'Vasectomies For Dummies'.   My cock and balls. So disappointing :'(   Speeding is my biggest peeve; as a driver, a cyclist and a pedestrian.   One time, in a 30mph zone with a speed camera, some guy is driving up my back while I stick to the speed limit. Out of nowhere, he drives up on to the pavement (sidewalk) and overtakes me, eventually dropping back down onto the road, screeching to a halt in the middle of the lane and blocking my way. He gets out his car and storms over to my window, telling me that the reason I've been driving so slowly (AKA: The Speed Limit) is because I've obviously been drinking! (I hadn't). He speeds off and gets flashed by the speed camera. I followed him all the way down the road tooting my horn and flashing my lights; he was livid.   The town where I grew up was full of boy racers. If you haven come a cross this term, it's the name we in the UK give to youths with shitty cars that they mod with huge spoilers and dampers, then drive around the town all night at ludicrous speeds. Round and round they go for hours in convoy, music blaring, engines 'roaring'. About 6 of them have died in crashes in the past few years. Their own fault every time.   I hate speeding, it's so irresponsible.    Farted today at work and it sounded like 2 drawbridges having a conversation.

It can be hard to get info on what is going on recently.   Another good one on this subject written by Anarchist Jacques Ellul: [Propaganda: the Formation of Men's Attitudes](http://www.pdfarchive.info/pdf/E/El/Ellul_Jacques_-_Propaganda.pdf)   Thanks. Even though I'm basically outing myself as a lunatic!   I know. Whenever I post any MKULTRA related stuff, not many seem that interested. I honestly don't know why, whether people are tired of it, don't know enough about it, or if they don't believe this stuff ever existed.   The official defense budget doesn't include such small items as the intelligence agencies, maintenance of nuclear stockpiles, VA benefits, and debt payments on foreign wars going back to Korea.   Basically this was a real life Apocalypse Now. US soldiers went AWOL and formed a village in Laos which they thought was a safe zone. The army didn't like that much and Operation Tailwind was undertaken to wipe them out. The op started with a dawn raid kicked off with sarin gas being dumped on the GIs.            Here's a good place to ask specific questions about JFK stuff and especially about document authenticity. A lot of very serious researchers hang out there. Don't ask me why it evolved out of a teaching discussion board, but over the years it became a gathering place for old researchers with thousands of publications collectively between them: [Education Forum Kennedy discussion board](http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?s=cea89a971e30e336a9785dc7303dc23c showforum=126)    Exactly.   A lot of people in the JFK assassination community are now conjecturing that Oswald was working undercover with the FBI in order to infiltrate the CIA because Hoover suspected the CIA of engaging in domestic subversion. The theory holds that Oswald was set up because they figured out his true agenda. A lot of strange pieces of this puzzle fall into place neatly when one follows this line of reasoning.   [Good discussion of this phenomenon by Linda Moulton Howe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csc0f5daafE)   People in the UK were making jokes for years about Jimmy Savile being a necrophile. It seemed ludicrous. It turned out that he really was, and that he was guilty of far more than the worst rumors/jokes ever suggested.  The Savile case was a really strong example of the mindset people have where they simply can't comprehend the kind of abuses a small percentage of the human race are capable of. Elements of intelligence services probably are using pedophilia as a way to blackmail and control politicians and powermongers, but the only people open to this possibility are those who allow themselves to entertain a degree of paranoia in their own worldview.  If I could put this another way, every year, the world seems to become a bit closer to the batshit crazy reality that David Icke has been describing for decades. I'm still not sold on lizard shapeshifters but I've learned not to take anything off the table until I have absolute proof that it does not exist.   [Evidence of Revision](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/evidence-of-revision/)   No, I mean they should be called "sheep dudes" as opposed to "Dude they're called sheep."  I'm going to be counting this conversation tonight.   Sheep dude.   I'll tell you what, why not post these comments as a self-post in the conspiracy subreddit. It's a bit silly to try to address any of these in a comment chain. You can give people a chance to explain their reasoning on some of this stuff, there might actually be a chance for putting links into answers, and if you can cut the ad hominem for a little while you might come away with a better understanding of how to communicate with a non scientific community in a way that doesn't  antagonize them.   Plato also believed in the rule of enlightened elites. What's Greek for Illuminati?   This is a smart young woman. I hope she comes out of this OK.   COINTELPRO, debt slavery, severe economic distress, unstable employment, a police state that scares the bejesus out of every sane human, a prison system with 25% of the world's prison population, endless distraction provided by conglomerates with what from the outside appears to be a satanic agenda, constant misinformation from mainstream media, bogus wars on drugs, poverty, Islam, you name it. People don't know if they're coming or going. People know they're getting screwed but they're so tired that why should they give a shit if the government is peeping at their computers? You want them to care about GMOs when they never cared about high fructose corn syrup, increased cancer rates, depleted sperm counts and countless other things connected to our modern diet? People aren't stupid, but they are burned out. People need to heal before they will believe that resistance will amount to anything effective.   Here you go: (http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/10/24/the-medicine-of-the-trans-pacific-partnership/)   Gotcha.   People have to wake up to how incredibly awful this thing is. This is a game over scenario. Call, don't e-mail. Phone calls make a much bigger difference. Most of the dipshits in congress probably have no idea what this legislation is.    Not to blame her at all because the drug laws are BS, but what I don't get is that  they came back with a warrant three hours later. Why in God's name didn't she flush the stuff?   Personally I became interested conspiracy stuff in the 80s because of the sixties assassinations and the CIA. I knew about MKULTRA earlier than a lot of people because my university was a major site of MKUTRA research not to mention CIA weapons development. I developed a big interest in researchers from the sixties who published in underground papers and magazines like Paul Krassner's The Realist, Ramparts, The East Village Other and many others. They are still very readable and depressingly relevant and I encourage anyone to seek them out especially since a lot of these publications are reappearing on the web in digitized form. Mae Brussell's radio show was great. Still worth listening to and every bit as controversial as it was thirty or forty years ago.  As for UFO stuff, as far as I remember, there was a shift in the 90s to that being about abductions and government intrigue. Into the 80s, although people started to talk about Roswell and Area 51, UFOs were still largely considered benign. No one cared about Bush pere when he was VP, but everyone started talking about the New World Order as soon as he became Prez. I still don't think people have ever focused anywhere near enough on his tenure at the CIA. He oversaw a transition to electronic warfare/surveillance which defines our current world. Then of course there was a huge amount of focus in the 80s on satanic cults in the aftermath of the son of Sam and Jonestown.   In my experience, people are fatter in the UK than in the US.    Nice one, thanks.   Not to defend Mossad, but Bull was trying to build his gun for Iraq. He was also dealing with the South Africans and the CIA. Plus, if I'm remembering right, I think he had a hand in Fuel Air Explosives research at McGill University. Nasty dude.      Tobacco was never really considered safe. Even back then cigarettes were widely referred to as "coffin nails".   In 1944, the LaGuardia Committee in New York State issued a report that concluded that marijuana was safe. It systematically contradicted claims made by the U.S. Treasury Department that smoking marijuana resulted in insanity, physical and mental deterioration, that it caused criminal behavior or juvenile delinquency, that it was physically addictive, or a "gateway" drug to more dangerous drugs.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Guardia_Committee  http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/lag/lagmenu.htm         I'm having trouble deciding whether you don't know what the word "literally" means or the word "definition".   People from New Hampshire literally do nothing but sit around reading the Constitution all day. I swear to God they're all like this.   Look at a place like Buffalo which I think is the kind of place you're describing. Not too fucked, but lots of room for improvement. Possible to rent relatively cheaply, existing arts scene, some interest in non-conventional politics. Bring back the idea of communes, but this time, keep them in cities. People living together to keep costs down, rent and food costs down, share medical through private clinics. Also, people need to see that right now it's more important to vote in local elections and go to city or town council meetings since most of the fascistic control in the US is coming through local ordinances. The police state needs to be controlled at local level, especially since there is no longer any real democracy at the national level.   There used to be a magazine called The Idler that had the basic premise that laziness and doing nothing can be one of the most potent forms of resistance to technological systems that control humanity. I think that's what they were getting at, I was too lazy to finish the articles.   I've found that eating more vegetables and fruit has cut my food costs a bit. Cutting out refined sugar and flour also gives me more energy.   I'll buy that for a dollar.   "Enlightenment is idealism." I disagree with this. Enlightenment is a real thing, not an imagined thing, not something that you will into being. It's something that's already there inside of each person, not an ideal to be reached. It's our humanity, our spirit. It's the very essence of pragmatism, but not the bullshit pragmatism of mass manipulators and psycho controllers. It's the pragmatism of knowing who you are and realizing that anything that subtracts from who you really are is a fiction.   I wouldn't say that it's possible to cut out my exposure to all ads, but by quitting cable, using ad blocker, and keeping my head down, I've drastically reduced the amount of advertising that reaches me. Every now and then, I'll try to turn on a basketball game, and I am at the point where it is like an assault on my senses all the crap they try to push. I can't make it through a full game these days, I just start feeling fucking nauseous. Consequently, I barely ever buy anything anymore besides food and books.   Great post. I totally agree. When a culture gets to a point where you have to take a side on everything, where you can never say "I don't know", where no amount of cognitive dissonance is tolerated, then that is a culture of pure control. People can look at enlightenment as this airy fairy spiritual thing, but at the end of the day it is really a very political process. Waking up to one's place in the world is highly political. Gaining some measure of control over one's own thoughts is as political as it gets. Buddhism offers some very useful techniques to learn how to control the ego, but it is far  from the only way.  Ultimately, spiritual or political awakening take a lot of work and endurance. No set of dogmas will do it, and there is no one way to get there.   Huxley wasn't advocating mass hypnotism, he was against it. "Another lucky accident was Freuds inability to hypnotize successfully and his consequent disparagement of hypnotism." He's saying it was a good thing that there was a delay in bringing about this kind of governmental control. Huxley was a brilliant, perceptive thinker, and in many ways, he was warning about a world that resembles our own even more than that of 1984.    VALIS is actually more of an autobiography than a novel. That shit actually happened to Dick. The Black Iron Prison is a real thing. That's what makes his writing so powerful. I think Philip K Dick will eventually be regarded as the greatest mystic of the 20th century.   Just say no to memes.   Beck rules, fuck Kanye.    I think you found the right sub for this.   It's a mix of truth and exaggeration in Zeitgeist. A lot of the religious stuff comes from a woman named Acharya. She is basically repeating a lot of the claims made by a 19th century writer called Gerald Massey who really was coming up with ideas using nothing more than his imagination. Some of the broad claims are absolutely true, ie: how Christianity was changed by Emperor Constantine into a sun worshipping cult based around Apollo (with Constantine the stand in for Apollo) but most of the claims about how these deities repeat in different religions are strained. The stuff equating Mary with Meru for example is just garbage. There was no global religion. There are probably broad global archetypes that most religions draw on. Zeitgeist is repeating a 19th century obsession with seeing the religions of the West as originating with India, but these really are very different species. Until you get to Gnosticism at which point, all bets are off.   Someone said years ago that the elites would create phony enemies out of the Soviet Union first, the Islam, and finally extraterrestrials. The real enemy is humanity. It must be fun to destroy an entire planet and enslave a species if you're a psychopath.   Do cops get a sexual thrill out of murdering innocent dudes like this? These asshole police are not like normal people, they scare the shit out of me.   The CIA was deeply involved in Jamaican politics in the 70's and Marley scared them because he had a lot of sway with a broad spectrum of Jamaican society. He was involved in peace concerts during a period when Jamaica basically was at civil war.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Love_Peace_Concert)   No unions, no anti-corporate rhetoric. What's left? Pray to our godlike overlords? Will them to improve themselves morally? The best jobs I've had, the ones where I've come closest to being treated respectfully, have all been unionized.  Left wing libertarianism is a beautiful thing, check it out.   For most of your news? Really? Sweet Jesus.   Spot fucking on. People need to watch this guy.   What were the other 17 years, police actions?   Speak for yourself my friend, it's been hitting me and my wife damn hard and we haven't been 19 in a long while.   Sickening.   Even a stuffed shirt is correct twice a day.   Add regular extreme weather events, never ending war against fictional enemies, drought and disease cleansing the population in the poorest countries, Fukushima radiation spilling out and poisoning half the planet, and the death of our oceans... then you've got a picture that looks like today's world. The Apocalypse is already here.   Borders should be open for human beings and restricted for capital. But we have the reverse right now which is why the world has become a giant playground for the mega-wealthy. Also, did you realize there are one million American citizens living in Mexico? No one seems to complain about that!   Immigration is just another issue used to distract people from the real issues. Anyone on this reddit who is still busy getting angry about immigration basically doesn't get it. You're being manipulated whatever your views on the subject. Stop letting people stir up your emotions, that's how they control you. Come to every issue with an open mind and use logic.   I saw that vigil at UC Davis. It was inspiring. I slept at Zuccotti Park and had to walk past a gauntlet of 100 NYPD revving the engines of their fucking bikes as I went past them. Goons. That was the first time in my adult life that I really woke up to just how much of a police state the US has become which would have been heartbreaking but the people at OWS were like this collection of the best this country has to offer. I left there knowing that the Goons will win battle after battle, but they can't stop real Americans even if those Americans don't get on TV or in newspapers.    People like to ridicule the Boomers and sometimes deservedly so, but the anti-Vietnam war movement of the sixties was the last time the people of America seriously threatened the powers that be. Student activists were a major part of that. Where is today's Mario Savio? Savio was a classics major who could express powerful thoughts in an articulate way. Today he would probably be studying for an MBA or a professional degree and be saddled with so much debt that an arrest record for civil disobedience would destroy his life. People on this subreddit would do well to study what happened back in the sixties.   They also worshipped a bat god.   Good post. I could care less if someone believes in God or not. I'm personally agnostic but very interested in spirituality, but what makes me nervous is that atheism seems to be a new kind of religion. A fundamentalist, intolerant one at that, and what is worse is that the adherents of this new religion refuse to acknowledge that they've formed an organized religion. I can't imagine that ending well.   I hope she makes a million dollars out of these jerks.   Thanks, I'll read that.   Huh?   Now we have our very own Gulag. Well done America.   McAdams is so absurdly biased that he loses credibility. Try this site instead: (http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showforum=126)   Dorothy Kilgallen and Mary Pinchot Meyer were two extremely suspicious deaths in connection to the JFK assassination. Kilgallen was a very well known reporter who just before she died did an interview with Jack Ruby that she told a friend was going "to blow the case open". Mary Pinchot Meyer was one of JFK's mistresses who was murdered within a year of the assasination in a quiet, safe part of Washington DC while taking a walk.   Here's a link with a list: (http://www.maebrussell.com/Disappearing%20Witnesses/Disappearing%20Witnesses.html)   I saw that, good article. I'd also include anyone sitting in US prison for non-violent drug offenses to the list of political prisoners.   The US has 5% of the world's population and 25% of its prisoners. We have far more prisoners than China including even China's political prisoners.   Afghanistan was about the minerals, approximately one trillion dollars of untapped resources... [(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Afghanistan)]   Does this mean he's going to break into his own house and shoot himself in the head?   Doesn't sound like a rant at all. Sounds like a neat assessment of the challenge that is facing us. In stark terms, human beings are born into slave systems where we no longer own our own bodies or food or land. These are the purview of corporations and governments. But the one thing in our favor is that it only takes a tiny percentage of people to make these entities look really bad.   Rogan did another earlier show with Randall Carlson who has also appeared on Red Ice Creations.   It's damn hard for the poor, but there are ways. Learning to grow their own food in community gardens is one, something that has taken hold in unexpected places like poor neighborhoods in LA.

In case you haven't heard this, might interest you: [(http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/randall-carlson-2)]   Don't know if this counts as bullshit, but in case you don't know about Manson 2 and Hollywood/ the music industry: [(http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/2013/01/the-process-church-of-the-final-judgment-and-the-manson-family-2/)]   I'd like to know more about the history of the military industrial complex as well as the development of specific weaponry for behavior modification.         Change starts in you. Stop putting poison into your body and pretending it's food, stop taking on debt, stop doing things you don't want to do because you're scared you might look weird for doing something else. Stop looking at things in terms of left/right, Democrat/Republican, right/wrong, black/white... try to see different sides of issues. Read, think, reclaim your mind. Don't wait for the government or business to save the world. Only you can do that.   Welcome to the controlled internet.   And so it begins...   Cowards shooting a man running away. This looks like some Central American death squad. It's lucky no one else was killed by their stray bullets.   I found the comments section of that article incredibly disturbing.

"It's also a bit interesting to see that a TI BQ24296 charger chip is used instead of a Qualcomm solution, which means that the Quick Charge protocol isn't supported.

The definition of tchotchke is "a small object that is decorative rather than strictly functional; a trinket.".  My statement was not an insult, it was a statement of fact.  "Blew" is a colloquialism for "spent" as you must be well aware.  I can even use it in a sentence: "OP blew all his money on tchotchkes".  Translation: "OP spent all his money on decorative items".  See how that works?  You may believe the way I phrased it was insulting, but that's just jumping to conclusions without thinking about the meaning of what I wrote.  Telling me I have no friends, drive a rice car and will get tickets is nothing BUT insulting, as there is no factual basis for any of those statements.

I don't autoX so if that's what you'd rather spend your money on, more power to  you, but don't insult my choices just because they're different than your own.   That may be true for you but other people use their cars for different purposes, and no one will ever sit in my back seat, so why not save the weight?  Also, the delete kit still provides separation from the trunk.  It's not just removal of the seat and that's it.  There are carpeted panels to make it look nice.  And Seibon has a CF delete that looks really sharp if you have a few grand burning a hole in your pocket.  Muffler delete, 25 lbs, lithium battery, 26 lbs, spare tire and tools, 25 lbs, rear seat delete, 27 lbs IIRC...Things begin to add up pretty quick.  Lightweight flywheel, 10-12 lbs, AL or CF driveshaft, 12 lbs, wheels, lightest I've seen will lose about 6 lbs of rotating mass per wheel, crank pulley, 4 lbs (apparently not good if you have done a flywheel), brakes 5 lbs per corner.     http://www.rearseatdelete.com/FRS-BRZ.html  This company has made them for various vehicles for years.  Plastic, covered in carpet, with sound deadening.  $380 shipped in the US.   OFT can also be used by a tuner to generate a custom tune.  Same process as ecutek.   Ok so I searched Japanparts.com and found everything except the STi logo thing.  Works out to about $400 before shipping.  Start button, $137.  Oil filter, $30.  Key cover, $43.  Battery hold down, $80.  Oil cap, $83. Radiator cap, $40.  So basically, OP could've bought an OpenFlash Tuner, an intake, a lightweight battery, a rear seat delete, i.e. something that would increase performance, for the amount of money he blew on these little tchotchkies.     Flying back to DC in the morning...looking for something to pass the time in the evening.  Thanks!  Flying Thursday morning that is.   You used a PAPER TOWEL on your paint???  Are you mad!?  I'll bet you rubbed in a circle too.  Oh, the huge manatee!  Never, never use paper towel.  You, without realizing it, have scratched the absolute shit out of that spot on your ride now.  Also, it's "rest assured".  And "ffffuuuuuuuuu..."  And "who could HAVE done it..." :D   So this is what it's come to.  Db is the new Rickroll.   Didn't have a floppy drive?  Are you 5?  Isn't Titanfall rated PEGI-16 or "M for Mature" or something?  Where are your parents??  Or, is it just that your first "computer" was an Xbox? :D  Very concerned now given your posting history...  Or, is it just that you don't realize 3.5" diskettes were also colloquially referred to as floppies also?   OpenFlash is $645 or $535 if you already have the OFT...But they also tend to have a long wait.  I'd do whichever you can find in stock.  Personally though, EL all the way for me.   Wondering the same.  I caught a bunch of hell for making a similar comment in a past thread.  Personally...not a fan of unicorns, ponies...Don't know WTF this has to do with our community.   Good work.  Sleep well.  I'll most likely kill you in the morning.   Oh, cool, never even heard of Jackson Racing.  However, I looked both up on the CARB site and neither are ok (yet) for 2015 vehicles, so something to keep in mind.   OP is not in a CARB area - he posted a thread about Wawa gas.  They aren't in CA.  Also, I believe Innovate is the only kit out there that has a CARB option.  Finally, turbos affect mileage as well.  It's not free horsepower.  Common misconception.   ...IF E85 is available nearby.  For me it's over 100 mi to the nearest station.   I have a torn meniscus and arthritis in my left knee but I purchased the manual.  This is my first manual.  Passed 4000 miles over the weekend, 17 weeks in.  Driven in DC traffic quite a bit and my knee doesn't bother me.  I'd say the clutch is light but it is only holding 160ish lb-ft of torque.  Haven't wintered in it but plenty of Canadians over on ft86club that have...just need proper winter tires.  A car like this, I'd buy new.  They're likely to be modded, being a niche/enthusiast vehicle.  I'm actually leasing mine but that's because, on average, I don't keep vehicles longer than a year or two.   Erm...he says the deal breaker is the concern of someone reading his password as he enters it...I guess I don't understand that issue.  My password only shows up as dots and my entry keypad is randomized (obviously a randomized entry screen wouldn't work for,a,blind person without a haptic screen).  But honestly, we're worried about reading a password over a shoulder?  Really?  Is it only one character?  I can't believe this is a thing...   https://www.subarugenuineparts.com/index.php  Everyone on ft86club.com prefers this joint.  Interior parts for the Scion and Subaru are largely the same.   Yes, installed, super laggy, removed.   I think OP was talking about the relocator that mounts in the front tow hook location, not just the $2 plastic frame.   Man it absolutely drives me nuts that the phone is commanded to play music on connection.  There should be a way to disable that.  Either in the headunit or in my phone, but there's not.  My girlfriend's Hyundai doesn't do it.   Hey you're featured on Driveway Labs' Facebook page awesome :)   Welcome.  Treat her with respect and she'll do the same.   The SR-71 display at Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson AZ is much more impressive than in DC.  You ca touch the plane, it has an interactive display, you can get much closer...DC is fine for commercial aviation but for military Pima blows it away.  I'm lucky enough to live near DC and travel frequently to Tucson for work.   Already have an OFT?   Which Fumoto did you go with?  Nipple, no nipple or short nipple w/ plastic insert?  After my free maintenance is over I'm planning on a Stahlbus as I have one on my bike.   I am.  My first shift knob being this is my first manual car.  Wish I didn't have to wait a month though.  In that time I'll probably get a set of winter wheels and tires ordered up.   I understand except that you're talking about a mechanical system.  It can't rotate at whatever RPM it wants.  At 40 MPH the engine is going a certain speed, the torque converter is going a ratio of that speed, the transmission input and output shafts are going at their ratio speeds, the driveshaft, differential, axles, wheels... It's not magic.  The link I posted in my response this morning has the graphs.  Also at WOT the torque converter is not locked up so it's not as efficient as a manual clutch at transferring energy from the engine to the wheels.   No, I understood you were talking a specific speed range.  In an MT 40 - 60 MPH can be accomplished without shifting.  I can't see how an auto would be faster as it would be operating at lower revs at 40 so would not be making as much power?  This is assuming both cars start in 2nd gear.   Anarchy Motive Mammoth shift knob in rough red from the FT86club groupbuy that ended yesterday.  Will be about a month though as they're being made in a single batch.  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=71435   Proof?  Or is that just like, your opinion, man?  Stock redline, may be so.  Once tuned, not even close.  OpenFlash Tablet, for example, raises redline to 7600 so it's only a single shift to 60 in the manual.  Stock, 60 is right at redline.  http://www.dragtimes.com/2013-Scion-FR-S-gear-ratios-top-speed-47.html   The 86 is my first manual vehicle.  It was the first manual vehicle I've ever even driven.  The first time I drove it was after I signed the papers.  (I'd driven the auto of course but not the manual).  I drive it in DC.  The clutch is pretty light.  I have a messed up left knee and sometimes it causes me pain after driving for long periods of time in traffic but it's worth it, honestly.  Also, the auto's rearend is geared up from the manual (numerically lower) - it'll get better gas mileage but it will always be slower.   Amazon   Looks good.  Question though, why does your bumper seem so much darker than your hood?   I have the 3D Maxpider Kagu floormats.  Similar to the WTs but a (as I understand it) thicker material (helps keep that stepping on plastic tap tap tap sound down) and they were also significantly cheaper ($40 when I got them a few months ago).  Pic from my build thread: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v698/train_subject5569/FRS/IMG_4014_zps5cba4f43.jpg   Also 6' and no problems.  Girth will be a bigger problem than height.  If you're much over a 38" waist you may feel constricted too much by the shape of the seat.         Life, uh, finds a way.  You two are evidence of that.  Congrats on the wedding!   I've not encountered any sibling rivalry amongst my fellow Twin owners.  Pretty stupid given it's springs and a bumper that make the difference.   There are tons of Canadians on FT86Club who DD their vehicles through the winter.  They often talk about Nokian Hakkapapaletta (spelling...I could never spell the Greenland volcano correctly either) tires and/or Michelin XIce2 (3's are often stated as not as good).  Also, weight in the trunk - toolboxes with a sandbag each over each rear wheel for example.   OP asked about an intake and an exhaust.  My statement was a list of intake and exhaust parts.  Neither an OFT nor an OFH are an intake.  Even the OFT folks recommend replacing the intake pipe.  Also, OP said he was on a tight budget.  $300 (pipe, filter, muffler delete) vs. $1K is a pretty huge difference.  And that $300 will change the character of the car significantly.  I'm not saying that OFT+OFH isn't worth it - they absolutely are.  However, I was trying to keep my recommendation as low in $ as possible while answering both parts of the OP's question.  Also, not everyone has access to E85.  Where I lived in California and where I now live in Maryland, there is not a single E85 station within an hour's drive.  Kinda hard to use it when it takes a third of a tank or more just to go get it.   If you insist...  http://www.nigel-jdmparts.com/toyota-86-frameless-mirror  http://www.ft86speedfactory.com/high-output-drl-fog-light-bezels-frs-1683.html   Any reason why the mirror costs more than new and the LED DRLs are same price as new?   Ah, not so.  They can do one other thing - reduce weight.  Or gain it. But a single Berk track pipe like I run knocks 25lbs off the rear end.   Biggest gains at lowest price are simple: Silicone MAF pipe (Mishimoto, Perrin, Supertek....), panel filter (Perrin, aFe, K N...) and a single exhaust muffler delete track pipe (Berk, Nameless...).  And then as others have suggested go grab an Open Flash Tablet as well.   You're correct.

They will not allow you to move the cat at all.  Not by a micron.  And, within the first 50000 miles the cat if damaged has to be replaced by an identical OE part.  Also, at least in Southern California, they actually have roadside sniffers.  So yes, you don't need a smog check for the first six years of a brand new car's life, but if you get caught doing something naughty by a sniffer, well, ouch.   I have a tire repair kit/inflator and a toolbox with a Shorai lithium battery charger and TCW3 2T Oil (with which I was trying to quell the crickets).  Both are velcro'd in place with industrial velcro inside the spare tire area (spare and tools were removed).  P.S. The hard side of velcro sticks to the trunk liner so if you have small things in your trunk just attach a little square and it'll stay put (adheres well enough to hang from the trunk lid liner on the BRZ in fact - I added the kit to my FR-S).   That's not even possible since the stock exhaust manifold has a cat in it.   DO NOT BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  If you're financing, try to get a preapproval from your own lender.

Also... it's not a study, it's a seminar paper. And if you look at the actual statistical analysis and the graphs, it is impossible to support this headline at all. The economists found a statistically significant, but weak negative correlation between religiosity and patents per capita. Meanwhile, other factors, such as education, had strong correlations.  Many 'religious areas' (Egypt, Texas) are 'leaving behind' more secular areas (France, New York), according to the graphs. But really -- since when was an area being 'left behind' because it has a low rate of patents per capita?   All this reddit flip-flopping is hilarious.

An empty desert is also much less fun to explore than the destroyed ruins of a major city. That is why it got worse reviews. In my opinion, the storyline of New Vegas was far far far better than Fallout 3. But that aspect of the game is really a matter of taste.

Slavery has existed all over the world and all throughout history. Slavery in the United States is only notable because it was particularly cruel and brutal for the time. Schopenhauer, for instance, said American slavery "constitutes one of the heaviest indictments against the human race" and North America was "a disgrace to the whole of humanity." The slave trade was a type of brutal mass slavery that hadn't been seen for centuries.   You mean lynching? I can't imagine white people ever doing that -- especially not in recent American history.   Dammit, HBO.

Ah, ok. Thanks for clarifying. I've studied ancient religions for some time and never encountered Gnosticism used in this way, but it makes sense in this context.   Where did you pick up this unique definition of Gnosticism?   I think it got picked up by the media because a black teen carrying only skittles was gunned down in the middle of the street and the man who admitted killing him was not arrested... LOL, JK, it is actually a national conspiracy of journalists to repeal a particular statute in Florida state law.   Uneducated or just plain dumb? The proposed route runs from San Francisco and Sacramento to Los Angeles and San Diego. $90 billion budget deficit? You mean $4 billion budget surplus?  Every other high speed rail in the world runs a deficit? Ok, except for Great Britain, France, Japan, Australia and, oh, I don't know, the United States (N.Y. to D.C. line.) You're bitching about Perini, however, is valid.   Even though there was a lot more to do in terms of quests, FNV felt empty compared to the urban landscape of FO3.    Not purely history, but Entitled Opinions is great.   It is a well-known fact that empowering women in any and every form is a major contributor to earthquakes.   People get very defensive when their primary form of entertainment is questioned. I think the haterage stems from the misperception that she is trying to make people feel bad about enjoying video games.   A superb summary.   This article is terribly plagiarized from this: http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/01/levar-burton-explains-his-ritual-to-prevent-being-shot-by-police/   TIGTA said, "The term 'Progressives' appears, beginning in August 2010, in a separate section of the BOLO listings that was labeled 'TAG [Touch and Go] Historical' or 'Potential Abusive Historical.' TAG is a group within the IRS that processes applications that are potentially related to terrorism or tax abuse...   This structure is... different. Blasphemy! Blasphemy! Lord Vanu proclaims there can only be one dozen building designs.   I concur. The resource system needs to be fundamentally changed.  I doubt toying around with numbers can solve anything. Increasing resource costs just increases frustration without achieving much else.   My current number 1 frustration: repetition. I wish there was more to the game than "Attack point A/B/C, repeatedly endlessly."   Besides the Lasher and Lancer, the current infantry weapons don't feel futuristic at all. Hell, most of them seem like they're from the '80s.   Completely agree. Infantry caught in the open without vehicle support should be easy pickings for tanks and aircraft.   Read some of the abolitionist literature about how slaves were treated in America's "peculiar institution" and I think you'll change your mind.   PSA: Just because someone is trying to unearth how one particular gender is portrayed and utilized in video games doesn't mean you can't still enjoy those video games or that you are a bad person for enjoying them.  But you might be a bad person if you attack someone for simply trying to take a critical look at one of the most popular forms of modern entertainment.   Tribes:Ascend was getting rave reviews and a flood of free marketing when it first came out. I was able to get many people hooked on the game who had no experience with the Tribes franchise at all. From what I saw, everyone thought it was amazing.   But I also saw people abandon the game after a few months because they got bored with the lack of variety and the seemingly infinite grind needed to get basic items. A game that is already frustrating for new players should not add to that frustration with a grind. In T:A, you have to either pay good money for items, or play the same damn map over and over again for experience points.  From what I have seen, the game died because of its business model -- not because it was a "niche game." The ONLY complaints I saw (albeit from "casual" players) was the lack of variety and the grind.   So, Tribes?   NSA obtained a secret court order for telephone metadata. This is a shitty situation, but it wasn't warrantless wiretapping.    As someone who feels guilty about frequently using squad deploy to drop on top of tanks and Sunderers, I disagree. There is no way for armor to counter the drop pod engineer-suicide-bomber tactic besides avoiding all combat.   No teleporters or jump pads? I approve.   Knives are uninspired. I'd rather have one of these: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9z2F0crCWM   Is there a prominent liberal who hasn't demanded campaign finance reform?   Happens to my Lasher all the time, and the glitch completely breaks iron sights.  	108
 Go Blue!   Aren't all games free if you do it right? :P   Lights,  You are coming to Phoenix on Halloween. Going anywhere to hang out after your show or going straight to the airport?   Don't listen to Mrknowitall666.  What he is referring too is a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) which is done by any bank when someone deposits or withdrawals $10,000.01 in a day.   When this is done the bank will ask you for your ID and get information from you such as your employer and what you do for work. They do send all this information to the government.  Now if you owe back taxes, child support, etc. YES this money will be alerted and subsequently have your account frozen. If you are not in this situation you have NOTHING to worry about.    TL:DR  If you are an honest citizen deposit that shit into your bank do not deposit it over time or sit on it at home.  I did this shit daily in banking.   EDIT: Added bonus unless you trigger the $10k amount in a day nothing gets reported at all to anyone except maybe a banker to sell you shit you probably don't need.   this photo was kept in excellent condition. I can't even keep my clean laundry from getting wrinkled   [Did anyone else think of this](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/19967983.jpg)  or am I the only one   She 18 yet?   Fuck Ohio, GO BLUE!    Waiting for people to get off the phone so I could use the internet to play muh games   Still sat in economy too.   And there it is.. the realization your cities sports teams are terrible. lolol  Last time we won the series...80's.. but last I checked we still have more than you :D   3   lol  Red Wings  Blackhawks Tigers  Sox/Cubbies and lets also look at the NFL last year - Lions  Bears (but we both know the Lions haven't been relevant since Sanders)  You can have basketball and continue losing to the 8 seed in the playoffs.   lol such a fucking tool. It's not my fault Chicago sports hasn't been relevant in years or they choke hard on a big black dick (Bulls).   Tell your boys to play better next year. :)   Not my fault you guys can't win when it matters most :)   Go Tigers!   Damn.. upvote for tight jeans!     	17
 Almost everything by Simon Armitage is great. His poems capture an enjoyable blend of darkness and humor.  I quite like this one: http://m.poemhunter.com/poem/i-am-very-bothered/      I think it's best to stick to an idea of a thyme scheme aabbcc can work but often it just sounds busy, maybe try other rhyme schemes but never feel like you have to be confined to it, especially in spoken word. With meter, it can be just a matter of going over it. Good luck.   Happy Birthday, 1951 by Vonnegut is an amazing short story, made me feel many emotions.     	5

       Yes, no business, no moneys.    Plot twist, it IS your dad.   Yea, he is really getting downvoted to hell.   Yea, I work in the restaurant industry, tonight is going to be terrible.   Up next- tornado fries!   by Jack Handy   Definitely common on boardwalks as well.   The only available runningbacks that weren't kept (1st rounders anyway) are Jamaal Charles and Shady McCoy. I'm leaning towards Shady at this point, and grabbing a bigger name reciever with my second pick...thoughts?   Ugh still don't know yet. A Pete, Aaron Rodgers, (Aaron Hernandez lol) the more I think about it, the more I think Megatron might be taken. What else could I go for? I was thinking maybe CJ Spiller, but like I said, not sure who is being kept. Our commissioner is kind of lackluster this year with relaying information.   The kicker is that the guy with the very first pick has a hard-on for Tom Brady and is almost GUARANTEED to pick him. I'm looking at Megatron or Shady McCoy. Any thoughts?    Wow! It looks like when I play Kerbal Space Program drunk.   Who are you talking to that regards this game as the best ever, Rockstar employees? I have never heard of anyone calling GTA IV as the best game ever, or anything remotely close.      8 years ago, I used to sell weed. One day, me and Momma Dukes got into a bit of a tif, (I was 17 at the time, so the argument was pointless) and all of the sudden she says, "Ya know what?" and proceeds to walk up into my room, a few seconds later, comes walking down the steps with a quarter pound of weed I had in my room. She throws it at me and tells me, "There's no way you are smoking all of that bud!" (My Mom, 48 at the time, referring to my weed as "bud," was shocking enough, on top of the fact she found it) She then tells me she already called the cops..I walk upstairs and put the weed right back where I had it. I come back downstairs and my Mom let me sit in absolute fearfor about 10 minutes until she told me to get rid of it, I was a moron for doing it, and she didn't call the cops. That ten minutes, I thought I was fucked.   Reddit.      Makes sense, maybe I should devote more of my time to wasting it on Reddit...   Heard that.   Remember AOL? Young redditors don't.   It took me FIVE YEARS to get this song out of my head, ten years later, IT HAPPENS AGAIN!! DAMN YOU TO HELL, here's the most nostalgic upvote I've given so far.   I was expecting a math equation. Still, I'll take some boobs.    You're welcome good sir. Good day to you. I SAID GOOD DAY!   Sometimes I wonder...do some of these people READ comments before making a comment that is almost exactly like one made a few comments before...then I think...this is Reddit...so no.   How would I like my BLACK coffee? In a cup? Yea, don't just splash it on my face.   After reading everything, watching the video..I've come to realize that this guy is a total dickbag, and what he did was absolute garbage. I have no endearing things to say towards him, and I certainly hope he gets all 4 years in jail. What you did was help our government further their fight towards "owning," the internet entirely. Thanks asshole. (Oh, the people with the Guy Fawkes mask at his press conference, 100% serious? Wow.)   It wasn't the booze...it was a front wheel drive slowbalt ss that caused this :(   You're* 2 hours later, and we are just catching this? Somebody must pay.   Are you reading them all right before bed too? Terrible idea...but I can't stop....   MCA from the Beastie Boys...only time I've ever been upset over a celebrity death. Guy was awesome, Beastie Boys are no more. :(   I see what you did there.   Fuck.    I have given up social networking for lent...I mainly use twitter and facebook, my girlfriend gave up pinterest and fb, as that is the only social networking she uses...we are still debating, should I have to give up Reddit too?   It's the smile.    Worked right out of high school as a cabinetmaker for 5 years. Realizing how depressed everyone in my trade was due to money and general unhappiness, I looked at myself and realized...time to face facts, I'm gonna encounter some shitty times if I go to school and work a shitty job...I'm now enrolled in school, on par for President's list, and loving every minute of it. (I am in school for computer networking) Quite a change, best decision I've ever made.   I can't upvote this enough. I believe this is a dream that all well-qualified, yet underpaid workers have. Good luck at your next job, hopefully better pay with less a-holes.   Such an awesome AMA! Never heard about  you before til now!! Cool to see you do a straight up, quick response AMA.    How did you know that producing edm was or you? What was the thing that just made it all click for you? Also, Philly soon? :)   Sexy...but the wrong place.   You guys are just plain cold with all these jokes.   I'm down voting because, why are we still talking about Kazaam?    Guess he is skipping all of the valuable advice from this thread and coming right from your intelligent idea.   	43
 Why is The Room so amazing?    Are you still in contact with Tommy? Does Tommy actually view the film as a black comedy? Does he hurt ever that people don't take the film seriously as the drama it appears to be? Is Tommy in a relationship? Is he married? How's his sex life?    When will the Neighbors Happen? Are you going to be in Foreclosure?       How dare he criticize RuPaul's Drag Race.    Is Amsterdam seriously that ballin'?   that's freaky   you're pretty cringe as fuck if you think I'm being sarcastic... you think those people look good? i saved those pics to my computer they were so funny.    are you kidding? this is cringe as fuck. look how horrible their cosplay is.    "Don't cry because you're getting divorced, smile because you had sex." Something tells me she's never had sex.    Who is this guy? I love him.   i dunno.. they seem innocent n goofy...    super cringe   kinda epic tat   death penalty come on   no, i actually liked their sense of humor... maybe i'm the .7% but i thought it was funny...   THIS IS WHERE IT BELONGS.   i think there is a hell and it was watching that...    It looks like it's going to die soon.    u just made me cringe      Thank you... The real hipsters pf vancouver - final cut was one of the most cringe things i've ever seen.... "Lena Dunham would be an example of somebody who I basically idolize."   the thing that makes it so cringe is when a hipster says he's a hipster and then become like a real hipster and those hipsters are the worst. good hipsters hate being called hipsters but this guy goes vote for t at the end... and his soft spokenness. sooooo bad.    GREATEST VIDEO ON THE INTERNET. HANDS DOWN.    Kinda amazed by how far he was getting with her.   link to videos? would love 2 cringe   I LOVE GUYS IN FEDORAS!!! I'VE NEVER SEEN A GOOD LOOKING FEDORA POST 1957!   I loved it. I would watch more Simpsons in this style.    So good.   So much better than the other Everything I Do video. Highlights include any close up of his face, the guy who came out of his dorm and saw that really weird guy making a video and the ending where he turned into a ghost. 10/10    I can just hear him saying in Jasper from Family Guy's voice "Girl's Night!" I don't know why.   do things get lost in a white hole? i'm uh tell you the same thing, why does it gotta get lost in black hole? why does it get lost in a brown hole? why does it get lost in a black hole? oh, because some scientists said it? is that the reason? i wonder what color those scientists were. Ah.   The end when they started playing Thrift Shop was so bad I had to laugh.... and I wish it went longer...   i wish i was still deaf was definitely the winning line for me. skinny doom ftw!   That was so amazing.    This makes me cringe.    Yay! Napoleon Hill! (the interesting thing about the sex transmutation thing is that it encourages edging but not ejaculating... if you have a different interpretation let me know.)   I actually enjoyed it.    24 my ass.   Genius. Revolutionary.    Do you think they have sex with eachother?   I know. I feel really smart now.    if it was fake he still ate something out of a murky toilet bowl... and it looked real... and the kid was really weird... it was disgusting regardless.    I don't think I will ever see anything more cringe ever. EVER. You have won /r/cringe.      I cringed.   That was kind of amazing.    I can hear Jane lynch in some fucking apatow movie calling somebody a fucking retard.... This is BS.... Retard is not a slur.    OMG What a faggot. LOOK AT HER BRACELETS!!   I think they might have autism... In another video JB mentions making a documentary about autism... Now I feel kind of shitty for laughing.   Everyone's just trying to jock the 90's kids swag. Only 90's kids will get this.   That kid pissed me off. I just wanted to punch him. Couldn't even make it through the video.    Surrrre they wrote it.    Those girls definitely did not play Magic The Gathering. Also, where the fuck was Inspector Gadget?   Sooooooo goooood.   Did anybody think she sounded a little like Kesha? The other guy's voice was sooooo bad. As was the music and lyrics. Her voice was eh.    Please repost this in cringepics somebody. Please.     Telll me whyyyyy? Why must I cry? Why must I cry? Why??????????   Howard is too funny.    Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   She kind of had a post op trans-male Judi Dench vibe. It was interesting.    I feel so bad for her.    Does he actually think people believe that shit?    The pic made me chuckle...   You deserve more upvotes.   That was actually the worst thing I've ever seen. Ever.    I used to think his myspace photos were sickening, and I wanted to love this... but no.... His voice sucks and the lyrics were shit...    That's pretty fierce.    The Room meets Kill Bill. A must watch.   the impression is amazing... but... cringe...   I love efukt   Literally made me say "What the fuck."   I think that was Chris Dorner.   I am so sorry for all of you that go to SUNY..... Just wow....   ehh... its just an unpopular opinion so i guess the voice in my head was reluctant to admit how it feels.   i think its better. i mean.... taking batman so serious... there are still gaping logic flaws..... in begins... then with dark knight we get heath which is the best thing about the series.... pure genius... and some great scenes... but still... the full package is a little too ultra serious for me.... with too large logic flaws... and then rises.... what a steaming turd that was.... this has my favorite scene when selina kyle goes insane.... danny elfman's score is ridiculously amazing.    That might have been the worst thing ever.   I've seen waaaaaay worse.   whoa.... who the f upvoted this shit?   that movie is underrated like crazy. still think it's the best batman film...   well... i loved it   That was seriously weird...   right?   i seriously don't see how this is a joke... it's not particularly clever...    wow   is it spoiler free?   i hope they don't get killed by any drones   this kid should audition for american idol or some shit... he had an an amazing voice..... but like.... yeah....   biggest cringe ever   maximum cringe level reached.    the best is the zelda tattoo lady showing her tits. sooooo cringe   Camp Joy from 1:01 - 1:14 was the best thing ever.   that was amazing... it was like a cringe video inside of a cringe video   same   that was amazing.   What's with the dub?   The photo for that meme is pretty epic.   Keep your wife close, but your daughter closer?????????   LMAO   *CRINGE*   that shit aint cringy. that shit true as fffff   What is this from? I must see it.   I don't find this that WTF... People get obsessive over artists all the times... MJ's music was actually amazing... This just seems like an uber fan collection... Just saying.   I kinda feel like all the negative effects from masturbation come after the orgasm. The guilt, the shame, the loss of energy etc... If I edge I feel better than before.    I think so but I'd like to hear what you guys think.   I want to hear the story about the poop coming out of the vagina.    I'm only on my 5th day and last night I had a sex dream which I've basically had only maybe 2 or 3 of in my life... I PMO'd everyday for the past 10 years...    I'm sorry but I did not hear Islam is the light. I heard Mmmm-mmmm ei uh ei-light.    This seems like some Human Centipede shit to me.... The last photo makes me think the guy performing the operation was not a real doctor... Unless the operation isn't complete in the photos... Srsly WTF.   Do you think she got that dress off a Snow White doll from the Disney Store?   That's actually the cutest cat I've ever seen.    That was one of the greatest reactions to anything I've ever seen.    I kinda wanna try it...   Oh my goodness. I started yesterday... This shit is so much harder than I thought it would be... I congratulate you on getting so far. You are a true inspiration!   Is that real? Please be real.   Messed up... Shoulda titled it "Excuse Me! I can't resist!"      I agree. This isn't what this subreddit is about to me. When it leaves the confines of your bedroom / private place it becomes total faggotry.    Seems pretty real.   I thought that was a dildo at first, when I realized what was going on I was like.... W.........T.........F........   I love that your name is Phayded and you're a cop.             So... I can't remember as much detail as I'd like to about these encounters because they happened almost 10 years ago when I was in 8th and 9th grade but I'll tell you everything I remember.    I had just begun training to be on freshman football for the upcoming year and everyday after school I would take the bus to the high school I was going to be attending the next year and practiced for several hours with a small group of other 8th graders. Practice would end each day around 5:30 and most of the guys would have rides by 6. Not me. My parents have been notorious for picking me up late since as far back as I can remember.   I was sitting in front of the gym at the high school on my Sidekick 2 AIMing with some friends while waiting to be picked up but not expecting to be for at least an hour or more. There were still around 15 - 20 high school kids still waiting to be picked up hanging out in front of the gym but they were sitting on large steps about 30 yards from where I was. I was a shy little 8th grader so I sat alone on a brick stoop on the the sidewalk waiting to get picked up.   It was now around 6:20 when I noticed sitting about 20 yards down the stoop to the left of me was another person. I could tell he was African American and in kind of dorky cheap looking thrift-shop quality clothing but that was all I could see from the distance. I assumed he was just a high school student.  So I went back to my phone and continued chatting with my friends waiting for my parents to pick me up. It was probably now around 6:45 and the sun was beginning to go down. A lot of the kids had gone home. This was at the end of the school year so there weren't many Athlete's at school late. I think at the time all team sports had ended. I noticed that the guy was now sitting on the big steps right in front of the gym where the high school kids would sit, but alone, estranged, almost as if he was trying to blend in with the other kids even though he was not friends with them. I just assumed he was some dork or loser who wished he had friends.   I went back to my phone for a little and then decided to look behind to see how many kids were still left when I saw he was looking at me. When he saw I had looked at him he quickly looked away. I thought... "Oh, that was just one of those simple awkward moments when you accidentally lock eye contact with somebody. Totally innocent.." But I still hadn't gotten a good look at his face.    Now, about another 20 minutes passed and it was now almost completely dark. The street lights had come on. A few kids were still around, but not many. The guy gets up and now comes and sits on the brick stoop I'm sitting on and is now maybe only 15 feet away, and I can now get an actual good look at him. He was much older, maybe early thirties, light skinned, mildly overweight with short curly light brown hair. He had a real innocent boyish looking face but you could tell he was older. He had light blue eyes too. I got really creeped out at this moment but then thought, maybe he just seems older and is just a high school student. Maybe I'm being too paranoid. I saw he had no backpack, to which I then thought, Oh, it's probably on the big steps. He wasn't right next to me, he was probably just a high school kid I thought.    So, now at this point there's only 2 kids still waiting to get picked up, besides me and this creepy guy. I realize he keeps looking at me and smiling like he's trying to get my attention. I look at him and I smile, just to be nice because at this point I've convinced myself he's a student. He smiles back. Nothing happens. I'm relieved, he didn't attack me or even start talking to me. He then sits there, constantly shaking his head back and forth smiling, and like rubbing his upper thighs on top of his jeans. This goes on for about 15 minutes and I message my friends about this weird guy and how "funny" it is. I really thought he was probably just some unfortunate high school kid who looked much older than he actually is... That's until the last 2 kids waiting to get picked up leave. I remember them just walking down the street instead of getting into a car and me being left alone with what I thought might be a pedophile. About a minute passed and he came and sat right next to. Our thighs were touching. My heart started racing a million miles a second. He kept rubbing his leg in a sexual way when he sat next to me.   "Can I help you?" I asked in a harsh tone that implied he was it my personal space.    "Can we be friends?" he said with a sinister grin   I got scared and got up and started running with my backpack on. I ran to a hotel 5 blocks from where I was because I was so freaked out. I could tell he wasn't a student, but I had the security of the other students nearby in case anything happened so I could just ignore his ominous presence. When I saw him looking at me from a distance and then slowly creeping up to me, it just felt so weird I didn't care if he was just some losery guy, which I later realized he wasn't... But after that moment I felt I might have been a little mean. Like, what if that guy actually, wanted to be friends, and I just made him feel like the ultimate loser by running away because he has no social skills? This lingered with me for a little bit until after seeing this guy some places a few more times I realized, A. He was not a student of my high school and B. He was not the age of students in high school.    --------------   So the first thing I'll say is, this man was very memorable. His face, his look, the whole experience. When I saw him again I was sure it was him. I could undoubtedly pull him out of a line up of lookalikes, nobody looks like him, he just had this creepy aura about him. Very very very creepy. I saw him 2 more times after the first time and I remembered all his weird little mannerisms. I say this because I know he was not a student at the high school at the time or anytime after because I went to the high school and never saw him, and because of the following encounter...    So, it was my freshman year of high school and it was Homecoming night. I wasn't on the Varsity team so I was in the crowds with some friends. I had some older friends and they asked if I wanted to leave the game and go to the park nearby and smoke some weed. I said yeah and we walked to the park about a block from my school. When we got there one of the older guys pulled out a joint and we all started smoking it. It was one of my first times getting high so I really enjoyed it. We were all starting to feel the effects of the Marijuana and started to become more giggly and joyful. We decided we wanted to go play on the swings and go on the jungle gym.    So we started toward the kiddie area where we weren't expecting to see anyone but did... A  lone figure was sitting on one of the swings just kicking his feet in the dirt. At first we assumed it just another high school student but as we got closer we saw it wasn't another student, it was the creepy guy! I quickly said to everyone "Oh, my, God, I think that guy is a pedophile or rapist or something, I swear, last year I swear he was like checking me out or something and then like asked me to be his friend but I ran away." One of the older guys said "That guy is definitely a pedophile." I asked them "Have you ever seen that guy at the high school before?" and they said "No, that guy's like 35." These were current Seniors, so I knew he hadn't graduated the year before, you would recognize him for looking so much older, he's just some creeper who hangs around the high school. I remembered how bad I felt for him when I thought he might have just been some horrible loser who wanted friends, but then I thought there was probably something more sinister at play. I wasn't the only one who thought he was a little too old to be hanging out around high school kids... So, we decided to go play at another end of the park because this guy was too creepy.    --------------   The last time I saw him was later that year, when I think about it it still gives me the chills. It wasn't as if he had actually done anything to me accept look at me, smile, and ask to be friends... He never assaulted me or nor did I ever see him assault anyone, so, it's not like I could ever report him for anything... But this was the creepiest for me. I went to the Public Library after school one day to do homework because I had had a lot of work culminating over time and I was going to force myself to finish it all before I left the library... or so I thought. I went to the back where it's very academic. About 16 tables, everybody working in pure silence, lots of shhhh's, lots of hard work getting done.   I sit down at one of the only two free seats. Everybody is absorbed in whatever work they were doing. I remember the man across from me looked like a homeless African American man writing a screenplay by hand on notebook paper. "That's awesome" I thought. I assumed it was probably really interesting... whether it was crazy or genius, the screenplay of a homeless man would be an interesting read... But then I stopped thinking about that because I noticed somebody in the computer section just beyond the section I was in. It was the creepy guy and he was using a computer 30 feet away from me. Just then a woman came and sat next to me. I can't remember the details of who she was but I do remember the relief of the open seat next to me being filled. I began to feel safe like I did the first day I saw this man.    I began to start my History assignments, I was safe in public, and best of all.. he couldn't get near me. I had gotten a good thirty minutes into reading when I noticed at another table the creepy guy had sat down and started to do some work. I tried to ignore it and just think to myself he was just a sad guy with really bad social skills trying to better himself at the library. (I hoped) He probably didn't even notice me. The library was still packed. I was safe... So I went back to work and tried to ignore any thoughts I had of this man and focus on my History... That's when it happened. About an hour after creepy guy sat down to start his work the woman who had been sitting next to me started to put her stuff away. She packed her books into her purse and left. The seat next to me was free, as were many others. I thought, "How creepy would that be if that guy came and sat next to me... Nah... that won't happen... he has a seat. That would be super creepy and suspicious. There's no way that's gonna happen." And then it happened. He picked up all the stuff he was working on and came and sat down right next to me. He even had a big smile while he did so.  He came to my table and sat next to me. I looked at him for one second and he had a creepy smile on his face as he was looking at me. It scared the living shit out of me. I quickly stood up. Grabbed my book and notes, shoved them in my backpack and quickly fast walked to the entrance of the library.     I never went back to the library again after that day and always made sure I only hung around groups in public places. Luckily I never saw the man again. But in that moment, when he sat next to me, I knew he had been watching me... For how long, who knows? Waiting... Hoping for something... For what? Something I'm glad I'll never know...  TL;DR: When I was 14   15 a much older creepy man watched me from afar and slowly got closer to me until he sat down right next to me scaring me so much that I would run away. Once after school when I was the only kid there waiting to be picked up by parents in the dark many hours after school had ended, and once at the public library where he knew I was afraid of him.        	127

       This article gives a pretty good explanation of the study:  http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/06/low-doses-of-psilocybin-help-extinguish-conditioned-fear.html   Re-posted to correct misspelling in title. Here's the original paper: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am401956s      Oh, and here's the original paper: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am401956s.   Misspelling in title: There should be a "try" between "to" and "some." But your brain probably filled in the gap anyways. Isn't that crazy?               Meh, I'd let the mods decide. Cheers, mate.   I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but one thing to also keep in mind is that the experts that you contact will also likely have "agendas and biases," especially if you speak with competing scientists.    There's also a great article here when this paper was originally linked to Reddit in June:  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1fslo3/low_doses_of_psilocybin_speed_the_removal_of/   Pretty sure the subjects only did it once.   TL;DR of the study:  http://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2013/07/06/violent_video_games_dont_make_you_mean_106583.html   Yep. The study was also conducted in vitro, so that could also affect the results.   What's really interesting here is that short-term exercise produced the hormonal changes with inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth. A previous study showed long-term exercise to have such an effect: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11490320.             Here's the actual paper. It's open-access over at Scientific Reports: http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130625/srep02066/full/srep02066.html                     The piece is based on a recent study from the Scripps Research Institute that looked at cocaine addiction in a rat model.      I don't put much stock in computer simulations, but this is quite a provocative theory that makes some intuitive sense.      Yep. And according the the article, the researchers were working with low doses of psilocybin in a controlled environment. Self-medicating in an uncontrolled environment with higher doses may not be effective at all, and may instead be deleterious.             Yep! I'm super pumped.   In general, science television today is but a shadow of a shadow of its former self. There are a few bright spots of course, like Planet Earth, Mythbusters, and Bill Nye, but for the most part, anything on Science Channel or Animal Planet is garbage.  I just finished watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos for the first time and was blown away.  If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you  must first invent the Universe.  -Carl Sagan   The paper is open-access and available over at PNAS:   http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/16/1305923110.full.pdf+html      The researchers found that when they deactivated the macrophages, the salamanders healed in the same way other animals do: scabs and scars, but no new limbs  Thus, by process of elimination, they've found that macrophages are key to regeneration. It will be even trickier to find out why.        	42

 How do you know it was a Brazil guy? Do you have his Steam profile? If not, how can you prove it was not you who was hacking? I'm not jumping to conclusions, just asking.    Somehow... Players are still playing and don't complain. Why did you come here? GO back and play FACEIT! Noone is forcing you to play matchmaking at Valve servers.    From the way you talk, it seems like you don't mind cheating yourself. Good luck on mining those bitcoins too... :D   I do bar pull ups and tricks mostly, when i go play CS:GO i can't get a single kill cause my arms get all twitchy/shaky. I think taking a run before playing would be a better idea :P   I was hoping for an eco ace... The title should be called "How to exploit a glitch to get an unfair advantage".    Wait... There is no defuse animation..?     Oh god, "Freeman was here" is a reference to Half-Life saga o.O   Make the smoke mass rotate towards player, not it's camera.    I could agree with you on that, however it still needs balance improvements as i keep finding the round outcomes unequal. I'm not talking player skill wise, I'm talking about rotation time it takes for CT's to come from A to B, CT's wouldn't be able to defuse in-time if they are on the other side of the map.    I firstly do the layout, then i make the spawns for a show. Every other part of the map is being made afterwards. (DEV textures, scaling, geometry, texturing, props, decals ETC).  Usually spawn is the first place you see when you start playing the map, so i wan't that place to be as impressive as possible.     But not THAT complex! :D    That's why I'm changing scale and layout :)   Haha, i didn't explain quite well. What i meant is, CS:GO is running on the newest Source engine version! :D   Sure thing, PM me. :P   Agreed, that's why I'd love suggestions how to improve the layout. I will be removing some parts of the map, as well as bringing new ones. Thank you for feedback! :)   CSGO is a brand new engine, don't worry, i won't make the map cluttered. Every mappers 1st priority is optimization, as it plays the biggest part in competitive!  I will focus on bringing de_storm and de_vegas as soon as I'm done with de_torn. :)   If so, why? What do you think would make you wan't this map? Any suggestions are appreciated :)   http://imgur.com/3vBhZh7.png Very early sneek peak... CT spawn is way shorter than on 1.6 due to ridiculous time it takes to get to the bombsites. Also, the spawn roof has been lowered unlike original Torn, as when jumping down it dealt 40 health of damage.  I would love suggestions coming, if anyone is willing to collaborate you can always PM me, as at the moment it's 1 man project. :)  Let me know if you'd like some more screenshots!   Give it a try, here's a better layout - http://www.counter-strike.pl/pliki/images/092001/CS2D_DE_TORN_SUB.jpeg   You managed to do it by playing with the most over-powered auto-sniper in the game. Against Silvers.      We need to do a fundraiser for a CS:GO tournament, maybe a petition?   That's such a minor thing i didn't even knew this thing existed.   I feel you mate, i got 6 days left of my ban cause of this stuff. WHERE'S THE FIX VALVE? It's been almost 2 days!   There's a bravo case model in Hammer, I'm so making this when i have free time :P Haha   I did contact. I just want Valve to notice that this is happening not only to me, but a lot of people.      How about we just have a classic 1.6 knife, with it's finger flip animations?    It's all about preference, some people like me would rather take careful but  deadly shots conserving ammo, instead of spamming bullets going for a kill. I'm not saying p2k is bad, but USP-s iss just a bit more "accurate" choice for me.   Or, like wise man once said - Treat everyone like shit cause they'll still treat you like shit. :D   Oh god, not another silo/storage/crate style map! Also, where's the overview? I wan't to see the layout before downloading.    It's not a DDOS, Valve servers are way more powerful than for a single person just to go and simply crash them. It was a lag switch, and for those who don't know what it is - It's basically turning cable on and off, making server loose client packets. To be simple, you can "simulate" lag to other people.   I love how they keep fighting against VAC, and our job as community is to assist Valve fighting them back. I think what's important for Valve is to be aware of such websites/forums, where they can keep track of new cheats coming.  The best way to reduce the amount of hackers is not to simply ban every cheater once they pop up, it's the core. They should keep making VAC updates more regular when a new cheat comes out, so that it takes longer for them to flood.  It's an idea. I'm sure they are working very hard against cheaters already. OP, thanks for informing. :D   I think a way to fix it would be to place a clip brush where the bug occurs at Hammer.     I'm been learning Hammer a shit-ton recently. Does anybody wanna cooperate working on this? PM if you're interested. I'd love to work on something like this! :P   I like the connector between two buildings, apparently they are too close as bombsites together. Maybe, make the parking building the bombsite? The round multi-stories one. It would be hard to make it though.    Props are a bad way to hide maps flaws, i personally suggest focusing on geometrical brush-work and beauty of the map (lighting, look, theme) instead of trashing all over props. Also, to start you gotta make these pics into a layout, hard part :(   If you downvote this, at least tell me why. Write your opinions in the comments.   Fixed.      Cpl_mill is de_mirage on CSGO if I'm correct. EDIT: I'm mistaken, it's cpl_strike   Way too over-edited :/ Nice frags tho.   BOT Frank vs BOT Lester... I can't image that.   I don't wan't to make wallbang areas too powerful though, as in 1.6 you can pretty much wallbang anywhere you wan't and still pick a kill or two.  I will take your advices into consideration :)   Get a VPN. Free ones aren't the best ones, but should be something to help against DDOS'ers.   I will be replacing them. Don't worry :D   I just don't like the theme of Nuke and how it's CT side oriented, that is all. It is also because of Nostalgia, and some features which Valve removed; Such as ability to open doors by throwing a grenade at them, or crouching in vents.  Yes, I'm using 1.6 port as a bare-bone, although I'm slowly replacing the geometry to more detailed brush work. I wan't to keep 1.6 scale and features.  For more detailed answer, look at the post i made above. EDIT: ImDose explained it the best, it's just for fun. Some people enjoy stuff like that. Like i do! :)   As you can see it's not an edit of Valve's Nuke, it's a complete 1.6 port. All scale and layout is completely the same. Some players asked me to port the Nuke and make a detailed version of it. Instead of retexturing it, i also try to add geometry additions to it, prop models and everything else.   There are a few good reasons why i would wan't to remake Nuke, first of all - There's way too much "Competitive Edits" for Valves Nuke. You can't keep bashing it. It's been released, and every slight change makes a huge difference (Like the outside entrance by Volcano's edit, it added a whole new tactic to the game. You would have to change layout drastically. That's why, i wan't to make my version of Nuke. It would feel close, but it wouldn't be the same map.  Also, it's because of nostalgia. I think a lot of 1.6 veterans can relate.  That's why I'm asking what people wan't, because if i find this as a good opportunity to expand the map and i will gladly do it if people wan't so. (Add new routes, choke points, make it different.)  I also think that the original theme for the map was a lot more realistic. (Blowing up nuclear missiles in deserted base) At the moment de_nuke is basically a de_plant/de_nuclear. I'm talking about design.  Lastly. Pro players even though they love Volcano's edit, they didn't appreciate that you were able to run in vents. I find it silly. In 1.6 version you would get slowed down when running around at upper A, in CSGO you get a lot more space which gives a way more tactical position to CT's on an already CT sided map. You could simply run over above the squeeky door and the whole "A strat" would be ruined. At the moment i wan't to limit space at A for CT's, but still keep the option to shoot at squeeky/house/outside. Even adding a ramp from house to heaven would make a RADICAL difference. Also, on 1.6 you were able to fake open doors by throwing a grenade at them, in CSGO you can't do that in Nuke anymore. I'd love to bring that back too.  Anyways, i could remake the whole map, and i could keep it as a detailed port/remake of 1.6. Depends on how people wan't it.   I would really appreciate constructive criticism, and i really favor everyone's opinions/thoughts. I note them, and i will try to reply to questions.  Thanks for asking.   P.S - Train has already gotten an 1.6 edit by Volcano, take a look - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epMBBbcxVL8   Maybe you can flashbang boost there?  Valve said they removed flashbang boosting but it still seems to work partially :D        Lester OP   I imagine the way to fix it, would be to make smoke particles rotate at player rather than camera.   @codename_rondo Exactly my point. If i was the guy to get trapped I'd kindly ask them, or just stay in the room till they get killed by someone. They wouldn't stand there all round anyways.  Team-killing is not always a way out, especially considering 7 day ban :P  Also, in the video he even tried to shoot one of the guys through the wall, which looks very obvious to me. He was rude, and he got what he deserved.   He deserved the knife :D   Did you actually watch the video?   Oh... I think you've got very high FPS, lock it down to under 500 (100 is enough for me.)  fps_max 200   I'm not too sure about this, though.   If you look very closely you can see that it's fake.   You're very right at this point.   Watch the comment i made above, i didn't say anything about ranks being associated with unboxing knifes :P  About the Smurfing, i know you can't find out if someone is playing on friends account/computer, but you can find out if someone has alternate accounts on IP. It wouldn't solve the problem, but it would reduce it drastically.   Let me explain it a bit, i didn't articulate what i meant properly :D  What i mean is; Some people get lucky with getting a knife from a case, maybe even a few (Which is what i doubt). If you sell a knife on Steam Market, you can pretty much buy as much CSGO gift codes for alternate accounts as you wan't. Ignoring that, you can still buy CS:GO for VERY cheap when it's on sale.  @BrokenStool You don't know what i meant. I didn't even say anything about trading...    Valve needs to do something about smurfing, it's getting out of control lately. Recently i had a match. It ruined my whole day, i didn't even wan't to play competitive anymore. I had a high ping, it is my internet provider problem, even though that wasn't the cause. Pretty much the whole enemy team were a bunch of smurfs, one Global Elite and a few Master Guardians on Silver accounts. They weren't those nice smurfs who tell you what you do wrong.. Give advices, help out in situations and do it for a purpose of making stuff better. No... They we're making fun of us, purposefully ruining the match.  Here's a few ways Valve could reduce the problem - - Make a limit of Steam accounts per-IP. - Add option to Solo Queue on matchmaking, so you don't get pit against a pre-made team. (While your own is random picked) - For friendly smurfs, add a new feature - Coaching. Something like TF2.    Am i the only one here that thinks this is kind of creepy? o.o   Wait, is SweetFX VAC safe?   Friberg, so majestic :P   You mean, this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CoRJb82SQ   It happens to me too. Hope Volvo fixes that.  But there are still people who wait untill the last second, those, are the annoying ones :P   You know those moments when the "accept" button appears, and someone doesn't press the accept button or wait till the last second? I really hate those people. Hope i'm not off-topic.  What do you guys think? (It's specifically if your not playing with a team but with random people)   Please, no... Don't do mistakes that COD montage makers do. Especially that shockwave effect when shooting. It's nice tho.   Interesting bug... Not useful though.   Actually, as a mapper i can say this is possible to have certain objects to have different prop locations at every round/match. I even saw a tutorial on how to do it on 1.6 Worldcraft.   It needs logic controllers (Only mappers will understand).  In short, yes, it's possible. But very limited.  	70

XYZ Healing Arts practitioners offer a wide range of therapies for healing body and mind including: Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapy.  I went in for Chiropractic, Massage and Physical Therapy and they did a great job. Thus I just tolerated the homeopathic advice.    Since I made the above post, I read other posts and analysis.  The "Memorandum" is not a treaty - it is an agreement.  In the case of aggression, the remedy "if Ukraine should become a victim of *an act of aggression* or *an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used*" is to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine.  Morally I believe the U.S. made a commitment that it needs to keep.   If you Google "nightshade foods" you will find many suggestion that they can cause indigestion (and other intestinal issues) and joint pain. Since I was pretty shaken up in the car accident he recommended avoiding nightshades  - at least until my back recovered (which it did - I'm fine now). He did great physical therapy work, so I politely tolerated his homeopathy suggestions.     translation into different languages  If you want a real answer, I would suggest calling a librarian. They are amazing with topics like this, and they generally love the chance to answer questions like this.    Nightshade also includes eggplant and tobacco. I had a physical therapist (after an auto accident) tell me to avoid all nightshades. F*** that - I love them all way too much.   I don't know, but I'm guessing there are many translations.  You can get free e-book versions since it's in the public domain.   The "Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances" is a diplomatic memorandum signed in December 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom under which signatories made promises to each other as part of the denuclearization of former Soviet republics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Ukraine promised to remove all nuclear weapons, and kept this promise.  In return, Russia and the Western signatory countries essentially consecrated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as an independent state. In the "Budapest Memorandum," Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They also pledged that none of them would ever use economic coercion to subordinate Ukraine to their own interest. They also pledged to protect Ukraine if its security was threatened.    Meat with nightshade - a Shakespearean pizza    When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation**.  Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.  **If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**?

Abe has said at times that with the current interpretation of Article 9, which forbids both the use of force to settle international disputes and the maintenance of regular armed forces, it is difficult to protect Japanese citizens in a changing security environment.  The Liberal Democratic Party has already presented a draft amendment to Article 9, and amending it is to carry out our duty of protecting the lives and assets of Japanese citizens, Abe told the Upper House Budget Committee on Tuesday.

From the AP Stylebook: "Lowercase **sun** and **moon**, but capitalize them if their Greek or Latin names are used: **Helios**, **Luna**."  But why? That does not make any sense to me.  **Edit**: Unless I missed it, no one has any answer as to "**WHY**" moon and sun are generally not capitalized by:  AP Stylebook, Garners Modern American Usage, Merriam-Websters Dictionary of English Usage, the NY Times, and many other literary sources (however scientific sources do tend to capitalize). **The "*WHY*" of the preference not to capitalize is still a mystery**.                                           At 40 it finally dawned on me that between haircuts it's up to me to shave my neck to keep it looking neat. DUH!      A top EU court ruled Google must amend some search results at the request of ordinary people as a "**right to be forgotten**", saying links to "irrelevant" and outdated data should be **erased on request**.  - In 2012, the European Commission published plans for a "right to be forgotten" law, allowing people to request that data about themselves to be deleted  - Online service providers would have to comply unless they had "legitimate" reason to do otherwise  - The plans are part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the commission's 1995 Data Protection Directive  While this does not apply outside the EU  what would *any* of you want erased?            After what I've just seen on Reddit, I have to ask. Do you care about others? How are you demonstrating that you care?   [Here's the post that's getting credit as a good dad](http://imgur.com/4epJWSk) [and here's the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/21p6s7/does_anyone_else_think_this_is_just_bad_parenting/)         Is this common if you post on certain topics? ...

       Hey guys,  I know that heroic and normal raid instances now no longer have *instance lock* and instead have a *loot lock*. So that if you've cleared BRF, you can still do BRF on the same difficulty, you will just not get loot  Just looking for some clarification.  How does this work with extending previous weeks raid IDs? If I clear 9/10 on normal, then extend that raid ID the next week and form a raid. Would we still have all the bosses in that raid? Or would it be cleared up till the 10th boss?  Cheers in advance  edit: typos     So while I didn't mind the last movie in the Hobbit triology, there was one portion of the final battle which really rustled my jimmies. **(Spoiler warning)**  It was after the face off between the 500 battle hardened dwarves and the thousands of elves. So they have a little tiff then the orc army arrives. The dwarves (hard arses as they're) form up a 3 stacked high phalanx in front of the army ("AWESOME" I thought..).  THEN, right as the orc army hit this phalanx then elves dive over the top of this wall and go into free form combat. WTF Jackson, thats just retarded. You're telling me that an army of thousands of elves can't see the tactical blunder of diving OVER a wall of phalanx'd dwarves, forcing them to break their formation? YOU DIDNT EVEN FIRE A SINGLE ARROW. Stupid. Also eagle ex machina can DIAF  Gah, pointless rant is over.   ...The Australia v New Zealand final will be epic? :D  Fuck me, yesterday was all over the place. After having such a good start we just feel appart. I was pretty much done when bmac started opening up. Then that final half! Oh god, my 'nus was tight.   We've now seen how the aussies can handle a NZ pitch and crowd, lets see how NZ handles an aussie pitch and crowd! Excited as hell!!!!   Hey guys,  Growing up I used to get horrible nightmares. I think it was because I had an over active imagination combined with an older brother who would relentlessly try to scare the shit out of me by jumping at me from around corners at night.  Either way, I remember it actually being rather debilitating. What started happening was that I discovered a way to wake up from dreams. I would (in the dream) shut my eyes and *poof*, I was awoken. Still to this day I can still do it, normally when a dream is about to turn south.  It was not until recently that I actually started to realise what was going on, that I could become conscious to the fact that I was dreaming and thus control what was happening. Most of the time I never thought to try a control what was going on when I became aware but it meant that if shit was about to go down, I had an out.  Is this a standard thing, do most discover lucid dreaming by accident?            Hey guys,   I've been having an on going argument with someone about the main reason for why BCCI opposes using the UDRS.  The reason I keep seeing over and over again is because BCCI feel that the system is fundamentally flawed and that unless it can be 100% correct, its not worth implementing.  My friend has said that that's wrong and the REAL reason for why they oppose UDRS is because they feel its unfair to implement a system which maybe too expensive to setup in other countries.  Help us out with this disagreement, are we both right? Both wrong?  Some sources would help            Did anyone else not want to have anything to do with this kid?  Everytime he appears I always choose the option to not talk to him or not reveal anything, even after everything that happened in the second episode I still am suspicious of Cerseis spies lol            I've seen this quote from the 1993 outline being posted all over the place as **proof** that GRRM has lost interest and *that's* why his writing has slowed down.  I don't think this alarmist approach is correct. Read the whole paragraph in context.  **As you know, I don't outline my novels. I find that if I know exactly where a book is going, I lose all interest in writing it**. I do, however, have some strong notions as to the overall structure of the story I'm telling, and the eventual fate of many of the principle characters in the drama. Roughly speaking, there are three major conflicts set in motion in the chapters enclosed.  By omitting the first sentence of the quote you can't see that GRRMs quote is about providing detailed outlines of his story. Since we know from multiple interviews that GRRM knows the destination but not the route to get there so this is hardly him admitting defeat.  I honestly am excited by this leak, I feel... Sated. For the first time in a long time with this series. Its sadly the first piece of TWOW news (pseudo-news anyway) in a very long time. I very much doubt we'll get any more morsels till the book comes out.     What the title says   That was so fucking hilarious lol   Hey guys,  There are a bunch of really exciting episodes coming up, but I'm still fairly new to Telltale. When they set a date for releasing an episode, what time do they normally release it? (please post replies with timezones)  I'm asking because as an aussie, this can be the difference between playing it on the day of release or days after :P   Hey guys,  I've been playing Pathfinder for around a month now and while I'm having a ball with my level 4 summoner I'm nearing the stage where I could use some input on building her further.  For a quick rundown (be aware, I'm going off memory - there may be some missed info), I have a level 4 half-elf natures call summoner with a bipedal rock golem eidolon. She has a master worked light xbow and a quarter staff. I've taken spell focus conjur and augment summoner as my feats. For spells I have:  *Level 1:* Grease, mage armor and lesser rejuv eidolon  *level 2:* Bull strength and haste  My eidolon is medium sized with the power attack feat and has the following evolutions:  - Imp natural def  - Imp attack (slam)  - Imp attack (claw)  - Pounce  - Reach  - Ability score increase   So with that being said, what are good choices for spells/feats/skills for future levels?  Also for eidolon evolutions, feats etc      Hey guys,  A friend is about to DM a 5e campaign for us, I've been away from 5e for many months and I could use some inspiration!  Now I know its a very broad question, but I'd appreciate any cool character concepts you've worked with. Or any battle tested characters!    Hey,  So I've finally gotten to The West Wing in my list of shows to watch and I've since been binge watching it. After the second episode I instantly got addicted to it, they did such a good job of establishing characters **quickly**, so I was already invested in them that early on.  Not many shows can do that. So anyway, I literally *just* finished season 4 and I'm itching for my work day to finish so I can rush home and find out what happens with Zoey. (please no spoilers)  Just thought I would muse out loud about how impressive the show is, The Wire has a challenger for best drama.  What are the remaining seasons like in comparison?  I've also developed a drinking game with 1 rule which will get you fucked up.  1) Any time someone knocks on a door interrupting a conversation and enters, take a drink.  Seriously, it happens a lot.   Hey guys,   Our group finally had its first Pathfinder session yesterday and it was so much fun I figured I would regale you with the session! Holy shit, 2900 words. This is a big one.  Just as background, we were following a unnamed pre-made campaign so don't drop spoilers please :). We have a total of 6 PC's (due to working schedules, some cant always make it) and due to several of us never having played Pathfinder, we opt'd for something a little bit more fun when it came to character creation..... Completely random!   Several of us randomed gender, class, race, archytype etc. Fuck it made some fun creations. Luckily for me, I rolled a half-elf summoner which just so happens to be rather ideal. Unfortunately one of our PC's rolled a female gnome samurai! Our GM was nice enough to allow some changes to make the fluff/stats work (removed the gnomes -2 str by adding some fun fluff about the character).  So after all that we ended up with the following team:  - Half-elf summoner with a bipedal rock golem named Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson - Chilaxian magus - Gnome samurai riding his wolf steed of doom - Half orc druid with his pet gorilla called Mojo Jojo - Gnome oracle - Dwarf alchymist (away for the session)  Quite a team right? Our 7 hour first session started in the large city known as Korvosa, we all had to write our own personal reasons for being in the city and were also given a connection to an evil man named Gaedran. Varying from being responsible for selling our druid and his gorilla or from being connected to the murderer of the summoner's father, this was a bad dude.  The story begins with an explanation for each of us by the GM that we all have received a mysterious card in some fashion which explains very briefly that they know how Gaedran has wronged them and that we should meet at 6pm at this address.  Driven by revenge and hatred all of the party converged at this rather suave house by 6pm to be met by an open door and a note explaining that Zolara will be returning shortly and to make ourselves at home. What a strange room this was, regal and elaborate tapestries and expensive furniture was all over the house. The group of misfits all meet each other for the first time (minus the oracle and the samurai, the players had not arrived IRL yet).  Some shakey introductions were said, as it turns out a rock golem and a gorilla in a strangers living room make for a great social lubricant. The magus feels a strange magical presence with the room, specifically the walls. Hes not sure what to make of this strange magical feeling.  Zolara finally appears after we've all gotten to know each other, she explains how Gaedran has wronged her and taken all she holds dear, a family Tarot (cant remember the actualy name) deck of cards. She explains how we have all been wronged by the same man who appears to be above the law and has escaped justice for too long. She has charged us with a quest to seek out this horrible man and end his reign of terror, our party is supplied with the address of his known base of operations. "Whats in it for us" states the reward hungry magus. Zolara explains that she cannot pay us for our services but we're welcome to anything we loot from Gaedran's hideout and she is willing to tell our fortunes for us.  After we all have had our fortunes told, we agree to take out this evil bastard who has made our lives worse in some way. Gaedran's hideout is a merchants warehouse which hangs over the city's river. As the party reaches the outskirts of the hideout. We devised a plan. The magus will sneak to one side of the building to try to peak in through the borded up windows, the summoner would do the same on the other side and the druid will check the back of the house.  The druid discovered that the deck which hangs over the river has a door leading inside of the building, after telling the summoner he would climb up the hatch with his gorrilla and attack the house from within after we came in through the front. He was just awaiting our signal.  Neither the summoner or magus could seem to get a good look in the windows. After a failed attempt to climb to the roof, the magus asks Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson for a boost onto the room to peer in. While the rock golem rolled well for a strength test, the magus rolled poorly on an acrobatic test which caused him to almost fall off the roof. "Roll a perception test" the GM asks, both the summoner and magus are told "You hear a loud splash". We both are busy so we think nothing of it. What was that splash? It was the sound of a massive half orc druid being retarded and falling into the water after trying to climb under the deck.  "Roll a perception test" the GM tells the druid while smiling like an idiot. "There is a shark rushing towards you :)". Oh fuck, the druid frantically tries to get to the waters edge, after rolling poorly on swim tests, the druid is stuck mere feet from safety before the shark attacks him and takes a chunk of HP off him. He tries to attack the shark to little avail. His gorilla bravely jumps on the shark to try to save his master. After a battle where both druid and companion finally defeat the shark, the fatigue of battle took its toll on them and after several attempts to swim back to shore blood was in the water. The druid didn't know it, but another shark was hot on their trail. The druid finally reaches the shore just in time, 1 more turn and the shark would've reached him.  After finally reaching the shore, his critically injured gorilla is told to convalesce on the shore while he returns to help with the seige. During all of this, the magus gently pulls the roof shingles appart and gains a detailed view of the warehouse's layout. All of this commotion has spooked the inhabitants however. He witnesses several armed men rushing young people to arms for battle. They're heading towards the front double door.  After warning the summoner of this, they prepare for a fight. The magus casts enlarge on The Rock and the summoner casts mage armor. The Rock positions himself in front of the front door to block it. The defenders open the door to a 10 foot tall rock monsters! As a response, the summoner casts grease across the floor infront of the door, this causes several of the tightly packed warriors to fall over in front of this massive rock golem. First turn goes to The Rock, who after seeing a half orc warrior proned on the ground decides nows the time for **The People's Elbow** ;). After doing damage to the half orc and repelling damage from all sources inside the house (AC 18 FTW) and with help from crossbow fire from the summoner and from the flanking magus. We were able to finish off all but 1 of the attackers. Dwayne sees a caster hiding at the back of the room, he decides to barrel past the mob in front of him, through the grease with the intention of barreling into the caster like a bowling ball. Despite the promise of a hilarious maneuver,  a horrible acrobatics roll resulted in The Rock tripping over and squashing the last enemy in front of him. While this is happening the druid bashes through the side door intent on reaching the fight.  After a successful perception check, the summoner and magus see a gnome warrior trying to flank them, the magus makes quick work of him. Everyone enters the main room and corners the caster. The druid wants this guy dead in a thousand ways since he sees him as responsible for his gorilla getting hurt. He kills him, cuts his head off and is rather brutal about it.  After a quick search of the remaining rooms, we discover the room which the deck overhangs river. In this room are a dozen terrified captured children. The summoner rolls well with diplomacy and convinces the children that they're safe and can leave, they all get up and run out of the house.  [**Ran out of room,  continued in comments.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/2q1a5x/summary_of_our_first_pathfinder_session_warning/cn1wzub)   Post your favourite family connections between characters in the series :)  Ill start, Samwell Tarly is a first cousin once removed to Selyse Baratheon, which would make Stannis a first cousin once removed *in law*?            So what struck me as odd is the seemingly missed time between Juice being handed over to the Sons and him being handed his cut back. At first it looks like Juice is being planted to try to assassinate Linn to *get good* with the club. What if thats a secondary purpose?  Heres what I think happend during the off screen conversation between Jax and Juice. Juice breaks down and admits he was present at Tara's crime scene, explains that Gemma was responsible. Jax decides to use Juice as a trojan horse to both kill Lin in prision and to feed the *killer* to Jarry.... Not Gemma. Marks. IIRC Juice still has the gun? If not, its obviously not impossible for Juice to have some sort of proof of his connection to the crime.  What if Juice is to frame Marks for the murder of Tara and the Sheriff and to assassinate Lin, that would be a two birds with 1 stone. This would then open up Jax's revenge to Gemma for Tara.  It very much as the feel for what SoA does towards the end of a series and fits the narative.  That being said, I'm probably wrong. Who knows. It probably is the case that Juice will just turn in Gemma, Jax wanting to kill Marks himself seems probable.   Hey guys,  I'm an Australian and have been raiding since vanilla. After raiding for almost 10 years on 200-400ms, I have no idea what to expect.  Can anyone shed light on what its going to be like raiding on double digit latency? How noticeable of a difference is it? I'm obviously asking those who have experienced both overseas latency and domestic latency.    Hey guys,  Question is in the title, I'm going to be playing a pathfinder campaign in a few months and I was wondering if there are any major things I should know, I've primarily played 4e and 5e over the past year and a bit.  Thanks :)   Hey guys,  I thought some HYPE would help out with our TWOW woes. A comment from GRRM on his blog has made me realise how much fun this subreddit is going to be after AWOIAF is released. When asked about spoilers to the books, he stated:  **[Most of the material contained within is history, set centuries before the events depicted in the novels, so spoilage should be minimal... but there are very passages that will give things away, yes.](http://grrm.livejournal.com/384996.html?thread=19621860#t19621860)**  So despite a missing word in the last sentence (I think its **few**?), there is going to be some serious combing through the bookies for any tiny scrapes. I'm very much looking forward to new theories which will be contrived after October 28th! :D      Hey guys,  I was as shocked and annoyed as all of you when S4 ended without an awesome scene where Merrit Frey gets killed and there is the big Lady Stoneheart reveal. But I'm not yet worried about her character being completely cut from the show, I think most of this talk about her perhaps not being introduced is bullshit and misdirection by D D and Co.  If you look at the books, apart from her reveal at the end of ASOS she doesn't appear until well into AFFC when Brienne encounters her. Since S5 looks to be putting the focus on Dorne rather than the Riverlands, it is perfectly reasonable to think that she may be introduced later on in the season. They can't just have the Brotherhood disappear without and further information.   What do you think? Are you as optimistic as me?  **TL:DR - I'm not yet convinced that Lady Stoneheart has been cut completely yet (no pun intended). I think she will be revealed towards the back end of season 5.**         So the idea has been going around for quite some time that Gemma has to be killed by Jax.  She doesn't have to be murdered. Obviously Jax has to learn about Gemma being the culprit eventually and once he does, this is going to be a massive conflict for him (I'm really looking forward to that scene). But how about instead of Jax executing her, he imposes something more painful. Exile.  What if Jax turns her in to the police, what would cause the most amount of physical and emotional pain for Gemma? To lose her family and to lose her freedom. You heard it right here, Gemma heart will give out and she will die while she is locked away in prision. It may be more cathartic for Jax to know that the person who killed the one he loved is behind bars for the remained of their life.  What do you think? I guess Occam's razor points towards a gun shot to the back of the head.   .... Giving Gemma up to the club? I mean, could it be a last ditch effort for him to reveal that Gemma was the killer? It would be his word against hers, but who knows? Juice is rather desperate.  I love it when you put typos in the title and can't edit it  -.-   Hey guys,  I was having a read through the PHB and thought up a new PC I could make.  The idea is a human beast master (doesn't have to be a beast master, just seems cool) ranger, equipped with two hand crossbows, with the crossbow mastery feat. From a flavour stand point, I love the idea of firing two hand cross bows in combat while stealthing around with a wolf.  What I was working out was around which fighting style to choose. I could go either the archer (+2 to hit with range) or two weapon fighting (+mod to offhand attacks). Its a toss up to me, bonus to hit or bonus damage to offhand, I'm leaning to bonus to hit.  I would have to carry around a lot of crossbow bolts though, shooting twice a turn is rather costly haha  What do you think about this PC? Stupid? Awesome? Stupidly awesome? Perhaps there is a rule I may have missed or something cooler i've missed?   Hey guys,  This may have been obvious to some, but I missed it. On my current re read I noticed a potential play on words that the kindly man used when Arya tried to ask about Jaqen Ha'gar.  In Arya II of AFFC after she mentions Jaqen's name, the kindly man responds by saying:  "I know **no one** by this name, child."  I guess its not technically a lie :P     Hey guys,  *Obligatory 'sorry if this has been posted before' notation*  On my recent re-read, I picked up on a quote in Danny III (ADWD). When she was approached by Xaro on behalf of Qarth, he warned her that while her dragons (when small) were a marvel, her fully grown dragons are:  "....death and devastation, a **flaming sword** above the world."  An interesting choice of phrase since we're all trying to work out what/who Lightbringer will be. Now I'm of the opinion that Azor Ahai won't be Danny, she fits the prophecy too well, too early into the series. Perhaps thats just wishful thinking for Jon to be Azor Ahai :P  But the the concept that the dragons are Lightbringer seems entirely plausible :)    Put yourself in Arya's shoes at Harrenhal. Jaqen has thanked you for saving him and asked for 3 names from you. Knowing what you know now, who would you name?   ...abandon his rendezvous with Dany? You would think that a joining of their forces would be advantageous to Tyrions want for revenge.  Perhaps he figured that Aegon and the Golden company is enough to assault Westeros?  Any theories?       Hey guys,  There is lots of talk about what will happen with Jon's assassination but little about the volatile political situation at the wall. With the three factions (wildlings, Stannis supporters and the NW) living in a strained relationship, how will this *murder of crows* (coining it) affect the alliance?  Do you think we'll see anarchy? Perhaps the annihilation of the NW?   Hey guys,  I've been looking into potentially playing a new PC, I initially wanted go a wood elf monk with a quarter staff. But upon thinking about it, thematically I love the idea of a druid/monk multiclass.   So ill still go a hermit wood elf monk/druid, but when shit goes down I turn into a bear or a wolf. Is the idea of a bear doing a flurry of blows completely retarded?  What do you think? Has anyone done this before?   Hey guys,  I had a shower thought about a quote from season 4.  Dany is told that due to the size of the Meereenese navy, she has enough ships to bring her army to Westeros. IIRC, in the books she does not have this transport available.   Could this be evidence that the show intends to either drastically shorten the Greyjoys involvement or completely cut them from Danys story? Of course in the books the Greyjoys have quite a few links to the main story, Euron and his dragon horn etc. And there are also several prophecies around Krakens. Could the show be setting up to remove the need for the Greyjoy fleet to simplify the Dany arc?  I would like to add that I hope I'm wrong, I love Euron and would love to see him come to life on screen.   I'm an idiot, its taken me this long to realise that Stannis's sword is not some form of ancient magic sword from a god. Its a glamor by Mel. The description of a normal sword with crazy awesome fire rippling through the blade yet it is cold to the touch and doesn't burn, is exactly how a glamour would work.  This as well as the show only scene in season 4 where Mel essentially tells Selyse that she has a potion for every kind of deception spell to convince people of her *truth*.   In short, I'm a goose for not connecting those dots earlier.   Here is the 4th session of our LMoP campaign! Its been a real blast so far and this one was the conclusion of the Redbrand Ruffian hideout. To read the [3rd part click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2f505e/our_dd_5e_experience_with_lmop_so_far_session_3/). Links to the previous sessions are in each thread.  Here is our current roster for this session:  - Human bow fighter   - Tiefling sorcerer  - Dragonborn barbarian  - Pirate themed tanky fighter  - Dwarf control wizard (Player away this week)  - Human GWF fighter  We pick up where we left off in session 3, we've just killed the giant penis monster (nothic) and we've discovered a magic invisible wall! We heal our wounded players and head out. The bow fighter asks that the fighter go first with him behind him, they pass through the invisible wall. and cautiously walk down the hallway, the fighter hears some movement in the room and decides to bust down the door. He sees a man in wizards robes writing away on some parchment with a glass staff next to him... Wait a minute, we're looking for a bad guy called *Glass Staff* **DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNN**. The shoe drops and the fighter points his sword at the wizard "stop what you're doing, you're under arrest" the wizard stands up, smiles and says a magical word. He casts charm on the fighter, the fighter fails his wis saving throw miserably. He is now convinced that this wizard is his best friend. The bow fighter fires an arrow at the wizard, he hits and does some damage. everyone else piles into the room. The fighter yells "Dont hit my friend" and charges at the bow fighter, grappling him successfully to the ground. The pirate charges at the wizard and does some damage and the other two do some damage to him as well. I should note that the DM upped the HP of the Glass Staff to around 80 HP because he had a feeling he would die too easily.   After that first round of combat, it comes around to the bow fighters turn, he tries to break  the grapple and fails. In the fighters turn, he faces his attention to the pirate wailing on his new buddy wizard. He tries to crash tackle into him, rolls very poorly and ends up smacking his face into the side of the bed, hes knocked out for a turn. The wizard opens a door behind him and disengages through it past 3 of his friends in the next room. Everyone piles in and charges the ruffians. They're taken care off easily. The wizard backs into a corner and falls to his knees in submission "Ill tell you everything, please don't hurt me!". What a pussy. The wizard explains that he is just an agent of another called The Black Spider, a drow. He is at the echo wave cave, there are only two more rooms left in the hideout and there are several bugbears, one of them knows the location of the black spider. Jesus, we didn't even have to torture this guy. The fighter starts going through his quarters and finds some cool shit, brings it back to the group. He is kind of ashamed of his behavior and appologises to the group.  They tie up the wizard and gag him, you going to jail. They decide to have a short rest since that wizard did a number on everyone. around 40 minutes into their rest the door gets bashed down. Oh o. This is all very small quarters fighting, the ruffians come through the door one at a time, this is tricky shit. After the first one dies, it opens up a gap to get into the other room. The sorcerer tries to cast again, wild magic kicks in... He rolls confusion. What a cock head. All players within 10 feet need to roll d10 in their turn to see what they do. Everyone affected either does nothing or is unaffected. It comes to the fighters turn. He rolls a 1. That means that he runs full distance in a randomised direction. Roll a d8, 1 or 2 and he runs at the other room. Rolls another 1. He sprints full speed past 3 ruffians and a bugbeag, they all get opportunity attacks. The fighter gets reasonably lucky and only ends up being brought down to 0 HP. Fuck this sorcerer man. Hes knocked unconscious. Thats right, a few hours in and this fighter has done nothing helpful lol.  The rest of the team is able to kill the remaining Ruffians and are able to lap around the side of the bugbear. With advantage they're able to bring the fucker down without any further deaths. The experience is given. BOOM!. Level up. Everyone is back to full hit points. Lucky for that, the fighter is hurting like a bitch. They all prepare themselves, they know there is another 2 bugbears in the other room. FOR SPARTA. With some clever positioning the team is able to position it so the bug bears get disadvantage in their opening round, and combined with a decent surprise round, we're able to take down the last two bugbears without any deaths :D  The bigger bugbear appears to still be alive, the fighter and the bow fighter try to interogate him, they fail miserably. The Barb says "Dont do it like that" he approaches the bugbear and says "If you don't tell us what we want to know, ill start cutting body parts off, you're not dead yet" after rolling a natural 20 on his intimidation check, the bugbear tells us everything about the Black Spider including where he is and where Cragmaw castle is.   That was it, we returned the wizard to the town leader for prison transfer. Overall we had a great time, I was playing the fighter and I was having fun even though I ended up doing fuck all due to some funny circumstances lol.  Sadly it was a shorter session, but what ever. Still awesome.  We're taking this next week off, but Ill try to post the 5th session when it occurs :)  Too be continued....      These are time consuming but fun to write, we did our 4th session last night and it was rather hysterical, ill try to get to writing it asap. [Here is part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2ew9qq/our_dd_5e_experience_with_lmop_so_far_session_2/) for those who want to go back and read. The first session can be found in the above link too.  Here is our current roster for this session:  - Human bow fighter (Player away for this week)  - Tiefling sorcerer  - Dragonborn barbarian  - Pirate themed tanky fighter  - Dwarf control wizard  - Human GWF fighter  From the second session, we left of at the entrance to the Redbrand Ruffian manor. We entered the first room, all is quiet on the western front. We all spread out and check the room out, check out all the barrels nothing too exciting to see. The GWF fighter wants to inspect the water. He approaches and rolls well for his investigation. You find a rope leading into the water, what does he do?.... Pull it out of course, lets hope for no nasty traps. Quite the contrary, CASH MONIES plus a potion of heath and invisibility. (The idea came up to force feed the potion of invisibility to the bow fighters pet hawk so he can't find him anymore haha). Roll a perception check again GWF, rolls well. You hear voices coming from behind the door next to the water feature, it sounds like people scuffling and donning armor. Fuck this shit, the fighter says. I ain't no bitch. He kicks the door down and charges in. 3 baddies half dressed barely with their weapons out. CHARRGEEEEEEEE! Yells the fighter, he goes all out and explodes the first dude with a massive strike, then with his bonus attack wounds the next one. His teammates charge in afterwards and kill the last dudes in there within the surprise round. What is this fighters problem? Apparently has something to prove.  After looting these bastards the pirate points out the other door in that first room, the fighter runs point, jesus this guy is keen. Sure hope nothing happens. "Place your miniatures where you want to be in this hallway" the DM asks, the fighter puts his front and center half way down the hall. Hes clearly not the smartest in the bunch. Oops. Triggers a fall away trap. A narrowly passed dex check allows him to luckily grab onto the ledge as the floor falls away. When will this fighter learn. (Btw, I'm playing the fighter haha. Hes an overzealous soldier easily lost in the moment, so much goddamn fun.). The barb jumps the gap with the tiefling and they proceed to throw a rope down to the dumb fighter and try to pull him up. Not to be outdone, the pirate throws the dwarf wizard over the gap (nobody tosses a dwarf) after a failed athletics check to get the heavy stupid fighter up the pirate assists and he gets up without further issue. The dwarf notices that there is a latch on the other side of the pit which activates the door. He tries to communicate with us this fact (if you've not read my other sessions, this dwarf cannot speak our tongue and can only understand us when he casts a communicate spell). We all fail our perception checks (to see if we see what hes pointing at) and we think hes dancing. We dance too.  After this, the fighter is funnily enough pretty reserved. All it took was a almost fall into a 30 ft pit, what do you know. The party enters the next room, 3 coffins. Coooooool. Everyone spreads out a bit, then we hear a noise. Oh god! The skeletons are alive! 3 skeletons engage the poor party. Some damage is taken, but overall they're easily beaten. That was spooky. The pirate opens 1 coffin, the dwarf another and the barb opens the last while the rest of the party investigate the doors in the room. The pirate notices a platnium ring on the corpse in the coffin, he passes a sleight of hand check and pockets it without saying a word. The Barb finds one and tells the group, the dwarf also finds one, he likes shiny things he starts dancing with it waving it at the group. "Oh cool, hey Mr Pirate did you happen to see a ring in your coffin? There was a platnum ring in the other two" "Nah man, no ring" says the pirate, deception check. Passes, only just though. Fighter rolls an insight check, fails miserably. "Oh well, guess we can't always be lucky can we!" exclaims the convinced fighter.  The dwarf performs an arcane check on the ring, he wants it to be magical! Rolls a natural 1, "Your PC is **convinced** that this ring is the most powerful magic item on the planet". In response to this revelation, the Dwarf puts the ring on his finger and holds it in the air like He-mans sword. The Fighter tries to open one of the doors, his hand is blocked by some warding spell. Damn. The tiefling does an arcana check and notices that it is protected by an Elvish warding spell and notices a word on the top of the door written in Elvish. No one know the language, damn. Oh well, lets check out the other room. This one is unlocked, the fighter puts his ear to the door. "You hear a woman whimpering". "Don't worry ma'am, Ill save you!" says the fighter as he opens the door. He hears a whoosh then a thud as a throwing axe hits the door frame next to him. Oh, shit. More bandits. The fighter yanks the axe out of the wall and throws it at the closest ruffian and charges in to take another swing (with negs because I tried to do something that was cool sounding) and missed.  The ruffians take swings at the fighter and do some damage as his party members come in and help out. They dispatch the remaining dudes. There is a woman huddled in a cage, the dragonborn barbarian is sick of her whimpering and yells at her to stop crying. What do you know, its made it worse lol. The fighter manages to calm her down, this dude is charismatic as fuck. She manages to stop sobbing to let them know that she was taken hostage after her family was killed by the ruffians. We ask about a key to open the door in the other room, she says that shes never seen anyone with a key, she does how ever keep hearing a funny word that they say in the other room. She tells them the funny sounding word. The tiefling puts it all together (apparently hes seen LOTR). He goes over to the door and says the word. Nothing. The fighter pipes up "You're not saying it right, let me try" the fighter says the word. "Does your fighter still have his redbrand cloak on?" the DM asks, yes he does. The door opens. "See, whose the sorcerer now.". After they release the woman and let her know that there is a ledge over the pit that she can move across, they all pack into the hallway and take a right. Its an armory. Nothing exciting in here. The pirate scores a crossbow, hes pretty happy about that.  Everyone is confused, they check the room. No exits or trap doors. Back into the hallway. Everyone checks the walls for any secret doors. The fighter falls through the invisible magic wall in the corner. When they enter the room. Everyone is cautious as they hear a noise, something inhuman. A quick history check reveals that it is the sound of a dreaded nothic (we call him the purple headed one eyed monster, seriously. Check the photo out in the starter set, hes a giant penis). So anyway, we slowly approach the crevasse. Someone accidentally kicks a rock down there, the nothic is spooked. Ooops. He charges up the incline and engages the pirate, he does some pretty nasty damage to our tank. Ouch. The sorcerer has the next turn, he casts a spell and rolls for wild magic. Rolls a 41, turns into a pot plant. Sweet jesus this guy is useless. At this stage we need a minute break to stop laughing IRL. The nothic doesn't like this magic attempt on his life, he attacks the pot plant which just so happens to have to take double damage because hes a pot plant. Luckily for the sorcerer he has a feat which allows half damage after a con save (or something like that, I was still laughing my arse off at the pot plant to listen). Either way he ends up on very little HP. Luckily the fighter is able to wrap around the side of the throbbing one eyed purple monster. The fighter has advantage, opting for his -5 to hit +10 damage, BOOM. Natural 20. Crit. Rolls like a beast, ends up doing a total of 46 damage. Apparently the DM increased his HP because he didn't want him dead just yet lol The penis monster is now on very low HP. The barbarian finishes the penis monster off with his own hands, I'm glad he came. Ejaculation.  Victory! While the pirate and the fighter rappel down the crevasse, the dwarf notices a glitch in the matrix, there is another false wall. He jumps up and down and gets the groups attention. The spelunkers find a chest with some cool shit in it, the barb gets the +1 sword and gets an erection both in game and IRL. Thats where we leave this session off.  It was a rather funny session, we all had a great time with the combat and I was rolling like an absolute beast this session. Stay tuned for the 4th session, ill try to get to writing it asap. I will note that my fighter has the worst week in session 4... You'll see :D         Here is the long awaited second part of our D D groups LMoP experience, the first part is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2ew6ur/our_dd_5e_experience_with_lmop_so_far_session_1/).  So after last week, we completed Cragmaw cave with humorous results. The PHB came out just before this session, so several of us rewrote our characters. FYI this is a summary of events, most of the session was narrative.  Our current list is:  - Human bow fighter  - Tiefling sorcerer (was the shooty rogue)  - Dragonborn barbarian (was the dwarf cleric)  - Pirate themed tanky fighter  - Dwarf control wizard  - Human GWF fighter (was the sneaky rogue)  Picking up where we left off, (with our old group) we have our cart with Sildar (still woozy from his dagger *err I mean* goblin arrow wound) and we continue on our way. Sildar suddenly has a flashback about how he got hit with the dagger of sneaky rogue and how sneaky tried to pull a fast one. He straight up executes sneaky, no one seems to mind (we only gave our DM small notice of our new chars so he didn't have time to work out how everyones new characters will be introduced haha).  With that, the new group is on their way to Phandalin. Oh noes, goblin ambush! Defensive positions! Goblins go shooty shoot! A few hits with small damage and one bad miss which causes the goblin to accidentally shoot a friend! He dead. Barbarian does some impressive javelin throwing, dead goblins everywhere. The fighter crits and cuts a goblin in half, great weapon mastery proc and kills another goblin, there is green stuff everywhere. Then 4 goblins appear next to the road, oh shi- Suddenly a small figure dives off the mountain and crashes in the middle of the 4 goblins with a huge magicaly explosion. Woah, that was awesome. The lumbering fighter walks over to the dwarf wizard, clearly impressed. He slaps the dwarf on the shoulder with a hearty laugh "Good show friend! That was incredible", the dwarf bites his hand. What a little fucker, the fighter is intrigued though. He tries to communicate with the dwarf, he points to himself and slowly says his name "Gregor", the dwarf shrugs in confusion and hands the fighter a chunk of goblin meat.  I should probably explain whats going on, this dwarf PC is a control wizard who has been living in the wild his entire life. He doesn't speak a word of the common language and can only understand us when he casts an hour long comprehend spell. This guy doesn't even have a name, the goblin meat is apparently an offering of friendship.  Dazed and confused, the fighter turns to the party, everyone is fucking confused. The fighter loudly laughs "Im going to call you shrug, little man", the dwarf smiles. I guess hes joining us then.  As we continue to town, the pirate strikes up a fascination with Shrug, this dwarf has coins woven into his beard, he doesn't need pockets.   We arrive at town, Sildar says to meet him at the Inn in an hour. We split up, the fighter goes to the Inn with the Pirate and sorcerer. The barb, bow fighter and Shrug go to the trading post to return the cart. While they wait to hear back about the cart, the bow fighter heads to the armorer, he wants to get a goblin scimitar all spruced up to be a nice shiney weapon that he can use. The blacksmith strikes up a conversation and the bow fighter brags that he killed a bugbear in a few arrows. The blacksmith asks if its the bugbear who stole his shit that lives in Cragmaw cave. It is! He asks if the bow fighter happened to see a chest of his filled with coins and some belongings, he specifically mentions a frog statue which is of personal value. The bow fighter lies and says that he found no chest but will ask his group about the frog, probing for a reward in the process.  The bow fighter returns back to the cart, only to find that Shrug has leaped into the chest filled with coins. He goes all scrooge mcduck and plays in the coins and starts braiding the coins into his hair, hes having a great old time! The reaction of the Barb and bow fighter is that this short bastard is trying to rob them! They start grappling with the dwarf trying to get him out of the chest, no luck, this guy is a slippery sucker! Shrug, out of fear casts a magical fireworks wall to try to disengage.  It works, but it also causes the town guards to arrive weapons drawn. What is the meaning of this! The bow fighter tries to defuse the situation by explaining that its all a misunderstanding and we will deal with it. All this commotion has drawn a large crowd... Including the blacksmith. Whoops, he sees his chest and publically accuses the bow fighter of stealing from him. Shit just got real, they retrieve the frog medalion from Shrugs beard and give it back to the blacksmith. Hes not happy, he takes the frog, throws the gold on the ground and storms off, calling shenanigans apparently. The guards tell them to report to the town leader, this needs to be resolved.  The uninvolved party memebers return to see this turmoil, what the hell happend guys, we were gone 15 minutes! They decide to take their chest and march to the town hall to explain themselves. When they get there, the blacksmith storms out having told his side. He spits on the bow fighter on the way through, everyone in the group are laughing their arses off IRL (except for the bow fighter). The guards stop an escalation and they enter the town hall. The town leader (slash yummy mummy, DM describes her as *a decent 7/10*) explains that she wont let this tom foolery occur in her town, after hearing our side of the story she explains that she wont change the massive amount of coins in our chest unless we help her with the Redband Rebels (we call them *Ricos Roughnecks*, because funny). The fighter flirts with her and tells her that hes going to have sex with her when he gets back from killing Ricos Roughnecks, she wants the D. He flops it out and winks. Making friends quickly, this fighter is. They have their first lead, the tavern to the east of town.  They head off to go sleuthing, once they reach the tavern they're quickly accosted by 5 Roughnecks trying to steal their shit. These guys don't know who they're screwing with. The fighter being front and center draws his great sword, laughing like a manic. Combat is a joke, these guys are plebs. One of them breaks away and starts sprinting for a manor up the road. The bow fighter takes a shot at him, misses. The pirate throws and axe, misses. The fighter throws an axe, misses. This is pathetic. The Barb throws a javelin, fucking god shot he kills the last dude. Nice.  We take their cloaks, the fighter insists on 3 of the PCs wearing the cloak and the rest posing as prisioners. The party bickers about this idea "Fuck it. I'm not taking my cloak off" says the fighter. "I still think its a good idea". The group reaches the manor and enters it. Thats where we left it.  It was a rather amusing second session as most of it was narrative and most of it went off the damn rails! I had a ball. Ill post another thread shortly with the 3rd session, which was more action packed!  Too be continued...    Hey guys,  We're currently in our 3rd week of D D for the LMoP starter set and since I'm on my lunch break, I figured I might let you know about our rather fun experience so far :D  So we're playing with 6 PCs and a first time GM.  Our warband is:  - Bow human fighter  - Dwarf cleric  - Dwarf control wizard (missed first session)  - tanky human pirate themed fighter  - Shooty halfling rogue  - Sneaky human rogue   First session brings us to the dead horses, oh noes. Pirate decides to stay guarding the cart while sneaky rogue, bow fighter and shooty rogue go investigate. Goblin surprise round! Sneaky rogue gets hit, takes 9 damage hes on 1 HP. Others miss. Bow fighter kills one with a shot  and sneaky rogue hits the deck. Shooty rogue kills another, rest get cleaned up. Sneaky gets healed. We find the tracks heading towards the hide out and decide its worth saving Sildar, hes a cool dude.  Heres where it gets silly, pirate decides his character has no want to go chasing after this dude, he has his cart full of shit he doesn't want to risk his life when he already has the booty (words to live by). DM warns that he will get no exp or loot if he does this, stubborness now kicks in and his char stays with the cart...  Right, so anyway. Shooty rogue and Bow fighter scout ahead following the tracks to Cragmaw cave. After investigating the entrance, sneaky rogue hears two goblins in the clearing near the entrance gambling and having a good old time, its go time fuckers. We make quick work of them in our surprise round. We sneakily enter the cave, weary of any potential traps and/or patrols. We take the stairs, oh god! Wolfies! They mad and they loud, bow fighter insta-reacts "THEY'RE BEING LOUD AS FUCK, KILL EM" so after he executes these helpless potential friends despite a few of us saying "Arn't you an animal handler? Why not make some wolf-like friends?" doesn't matter, doesn't care.  After scouting the room we decide to press on. Slowly up the tunnel until we see the patrol at the top, shooty rogue shoots, misses. Bow fighter shoots, misses. Sneaky rogue shoots, small damage. OH noes. Patrol flees, wtf is that sound? Mother fucking wall of water. Jesus titty fucking christ, the sneaky rogue moves to the crevasse to the left and the rest go back into the wolf room. We're safe.  Sneaky rogue climbs the two walls to get a view of whats going on, he hears commotion! The rest of his party cross the stream and climb up with sneaky rogue. We see the goblins, its time to die. We engage and kill all of them (sneaky rogue gets fucked up and goes unconscious, saving throws himself back up). A wounded Mr goblin boss dude picks up Sildar and puts a dagger to his neck. Recently awakened Sneaky rogue is convinced of his dexterous skills, he throws his dagger... and rolls a natural 1. Oops. A follow up roll was low enough for the DM to decide that this dagger hit Sildar in the shoulder. Awkward. Sildar passes out. Goblin drops Sildar and gets killed by the party.  Sneaky rogue panics, hes got priors. He grabs the closest goblin arrow, removes the dagger and places the arrow in the wound. Sildar will never suspect a thing. We start carrying Sildar until he wakes up, lucky for Sneaky rogue Sildar says nothing about his wound....Yet. They proceed slowly to the last room scouting ahead we see a bugbear and his mean entourage. Oh noes, this will hurt. Lets hope for a good surprise round. Bow fighter does massive damage and so does everyone else, bugbear dies before he reaches combat. DM exclaims how fucking lucky we are, 2D8 + 4 damage **are you serious**!??!? We only have an average of 9 hp. The party clears the rest of the room without issue.  Its loot time, yay. We carry that shit back to the cart. We laugh all the way back to the bank.  That was the end of the first session, lots of lulz were had and we really enjoyed ourselves. I know it sounded like only a few of us played much, but I left out much of the nitty gritty stuff that the others did. This is a summary after all.   Ill post another thread shortly showing the other two sessions as I think I'm almost at my word limit.  **Too be continued..**  Edit: [Here is part 2!](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2ew9qq/our_dd_5e_experience_with_lmop_so_far_session_2/)      Hey guys,  We're currently in our 3rd week of D D for the LMoP starter set and since I'm on my lunch break, I figured I might let you know about our rather fun experience so far :D  So we're playing with 6 PCs and a first time GM.

I kinda rolled a natural 1 and ended up hitting Silvar. Oops.  But it made me think, how would you all handle that situation? Assuming the person being held hostage is a valuable target, what would you do? Try to kill him? Try to trade his life for gold? Do you drop your weapons?  Just don't throw a dagger if the dice gods are not in your favour.   Hey everyone.  We all know *that guy*, *that guy* who suspiciously knows about the trap door on square 3 for your premade campaign. *That guy* who min maxes the fuck out of his hybrid character and takes 20 minutes to work out which of his 50 spells to use. *That guy* who meta games every turn.  Vent your stories :)   Hey everyone,  So I've been enjoying the debates so far, minus the Mountain that Roleplays (jk :P)  It is entirely possible that Barristan the Bold and Arthur Dayne will meet in the grand final of this debate tournament. I just remembered a SSM where GRRM was actually asked about a duel of this calibre!  [*Who would win in a fight, Barristan Selmy or Arthur Dayne (in their best days)?* **Dayne... if he was armed with Dawn. If both men had equivalent weaponry, it might be a toss-up.**](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Sword_of_the_Morning_vs._Barristan_the_Bold)  Now of course, the moderators can just stop this input from the author from being used but I still found it amusing :P    Hey guys,  As an Aussie, I'm really perplexed by [this link](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=0 p=.htm). Can someone explain why the amount that a movie earns domestically is so **massively** affected by the month in which its released?  In Australia, we watch what ever comes out when ever we can get it (since we can get delays upwards of 6 months from the rest of the world).  I'm sure there is a simple explaination, I'm just missing it :)  Cheers.   Hey guys,  Just thought I would share my experiences with my great weapon fighting fighter. I started our D D basic campaign as a rogue but after my fellow party members decided to be mostly ranged players, my character was very annoying to use. Lucky for me, the PHB got released and boy oh boy did I have some fun with the new feats and rules for fighters.   I ended up creating a new character who starts at level 2,  human fighter with chainmail, throwing axes and a great sword. Decent-ish rolling still ended me up with 18 str which is something at least. Being able to reroll 1s and 2s for a great sword ended up with my doing some seriously awesome damage and made for some colourful death descriptions!  The feats were the interesting additions, ~~the two feats (humans ftw :D)~~ I decided on going for Great Weapon Mastery ~~and Heavy Armor Mastery~~. The option for bonus 10 dmg to a swing in conjunction with a -5 to hit was very helpful for the bigger targets (I would wait till I had advantage before opting to use this skill) and the bonus attack if I bring a target below 0 HP (or if I crit) was especially awesome as there were several occasions where I was able to cleave down 2-3 adds in a single turn with good rolling :D (Just letting you know that we know the rule about 1 bonus action per turn, but my DM has allowed me to continue the ability with negs to hit, he likes the idea of cleaving lol)  ~~Since I appeared to be the only *tank* my decision to go heavy armor mastery was a good one, that flat -3 physical damage really pays for itself and allows for more risky positioning (engaging 2 targets at once so I can cleave) not to mention the bonus str stat.~~  Overall I'm having a ball with the character and I've made a cool little backstory to him which I've asked to be fed into the story for a future plot point :D  Whats your experience with the fighters in D DNext? I don't need to hear about how OP the bow fighters are, I know they're. My brother uses one and its silly lol  **Edit: There you go, thanks for the correction. I should only have 1 feat, not 2. Anyway, on with the discussion.**   Hi guys,  I'm sure this has been said before, it still made me smile. When Arya is first with the Brotherhood is Arya III, she notes that the BWB has access to vicious attack dogs. She muses to herself that "She wishes she had a dog of her own"  Edit: Thanks /u/Xiefyn  "For every man we lost, two showed up to take his place. A few were knights or squires, of gentle birth, but most were common men  fieldhands and fiddlers and innkeeps, servants and shoemakers, even two septons. Men of all sorts, and women too, children, dogs" "Dogs?" said Arya. "Aye." Harwin grinned. "One of our lads keeps the meanest dogs you'd ever want to see." "I wish I had a good mean dog," said Arya wistfully. "A lion-killing dog."      Hey guys,  With all these debates going around, I thought it could be a good idea to have different topic of debate. Are the show changes better than the books.   Now a general topic like that could be fun, but I think something more specific would garner a more even discussion.  A few ideas come to mind.  - Which is better, Talisa or Jeyne Westerling - Is book Shae better for the story than show Shae?  Please post if you think this could be fun, also any other debate topics you can think of in this fashion :D   Lets face it, all of these changes, amalgamations and deviations are snowballing in a big way. I'm less worried about the story that the show will end with ruining the books. Ammarite?   Hey guys,  I'm doing another re-read of the series and I just got up to the UnKiss moment in ACOK. Now I'm fully aware that GRRM has stated a few times that the UnKiss is an intentional moment added by him to signify something bigger than a girl misremembering the name of a sword (for instance).  Anyway, that scene with the Hound and her after the Blackwater battle is *very* traumatic. More so than I had remembered. She is deathly afraid of Sandor and she legitimately thinks he will murder her. He arrives drunk and covered in blood and hounds (heh) her about singing for him. When she refuses he throws her onto the bed and puts a dagger to her throat. She shuts her eyes and sings about ~~Florian (symbolism eh)~~ The Mother. Then shit obviously gets weird, she reaches out and feels his cheek to find that he is crying. Now its a great scene for us readers to get a feel about both Sansa and Sandor.  When you take a step back and think about why in 2 books time she remembers him kissing her and little else of that night, not the threatening, not the fear of death, not the dagger to her throat. "He left a bloody cloak and a kiss". This barrier she has put up is clearly to protect herself from the trauma of what she has encountered.  What does this mean for her? Is she past it? Will she have intimacy issues? PTSD?  Edit: The Hound asks her to sing about Florian, she ends up singing about the mother.   Hey guys,  The relationship between Shae and Tyrion is a rather complex one and the context of the relationship (for us) is always from Tyrions own biased PoV chapters. He appears to show some self consciousness about her truly loving him or just playing the game for reward. This is further exemplified by her betraying him on the stand after the promise of a marriage and a castle is promised to her. (I want to rant further about how the show gutted this complex relationship, but I digress)  So my question is, is there any evidence that Tyrion paid her/continued to do so? I know that his first proposition to her states that she will have gold for her services and that she referenced wanting to wear expensive gowns/jewerly that he buys for her. But if I were in Tyrions position, I might doubt my relationship more with a whore if I were consciously paying her.   There was some worry a while ago that Victarion and Euron will be amalgamated for season 5, during a rewatch I found a piece of evidence that both of them are in the current tv canon.   Rewatch S01E04 at 5 mins 40 seconds, in a conversation between Tyrion and Theon (show only I believe) Tyrion exclaims that he was a child when he remembered seeing Lannisport being burned by Theons **Uncles**. This doesn't completely prove anything, but the pluralisation would've had to have been added to the script since its a new scene outside of the book.  Either way, I was worried we would see the two characters combined too :)  Edit: I completely forgot about Aeron, eep   Hi guys,  Has there been any word if we can use our beta clients for the production version of Wildstar? My house mate has the fully downloaded latest beta version, it would save a shit load of internet usage to reuse the beta client.   Hey guys.  There has been a divide in this subreddit about Kit Harington's portrayal of Jon Snow in the tv show. Can we all agree that Kit has done a great job of displaying an accurate Jon Snow as per where he is up to in ASOS?   I think hes done a great job in displaying the dead pan confidence that Jon displayed after his return from the wildlings. I'm really enjoying Kit's work with my favourite asoiaf character and I **cannot** wait until ed fetches him a block.   Hi everyone.  There were a couple of show only moments in the latest episode which I wanted to discuss. Firstly, Sandor straight out robbing that helpful farmer~~, I don't recall that scene in the books but it does seem rather out of character (he appeared to be becoming less harsh in the show)~~. Do you guys think this occurred just to remind the viewer of Sandors unapologetic moral ambiguity? Perhaps actions like this will rekindle Aryas disdain for him that she shows more in the books than the show.  Secondly, he explicitly mentions a desire to go to Braavos as a sellsword after he barters Arya to the Vale. Now we know that Arya will end up in Braavos, but there were hints that the Hound will end up escaping his fate in the books and end up going with Arya to Braavos. Could we be seeing this happening? I personally liked the ambiguous fate that the Hound had in the books and I would much prefer the canonical ending to his sad arc.  Edit: Thanks for clearing up my first point, what about the second point? I'm more interested in the implications of that.     As I said in the title, this sept scene has been discussed ad nausem (after a single day? Impressive). Can we talk about what I think was one of the best scenes from the episode. The conversation between Tywin and Oberyn in that brothel. I really got confirmation that Pedro is an excellent choice for the Red Viper and that Charles Dance is the perfect Tywin.   When he offered Tywin a drink I thought that this was going to be a moment with perhaps a slight nod to the 'Tywin Poisioning Theory', I didn't catch him doing anything (but its still early days :D). It was interesting to hear Tywin explicitly exclaim that Oberyn studied poison, now the audience knows :P  It was a great scene with lots of angst and tension, I wonder if Oberyn will get his out of book one on one conversation with the Mountain. I kinda hope not, I liked the confrontation at the trial. But HBO has shown that when it comes to changes they *can* do it rather well when it comes to extra scenes.  What do you guys think?      Hi guys,  My friends and I have switched our focus from DnD to Only War. So far it has been quite a bit of fun (About a decade ago, most of us were playing Warhammer Roleplay, so this system was easy to pick up :D)  Have you played Only War? What are your thoughts on it? Any tips?   - Come on everyone - Write a Game of Thrones haiku - Show me what you got.      Hi guys,  I wanted to get some clarification. We get the reveal that Gendry gets dropped off as a ~~baby~~ teenager to Tobho Mott for protection by a 'large hooded man' who he does not recognise. Who is this and why was Gendry being protected if all he is is a bastard of the king, we don't see this other treatment for his many other bastards.  Edit: Stupidity       Most other Aussies will know how irritating it is to be in such a timezone, but this is one of the rare instances where I think we have it better than even the Americans. Since the east coast of Australia is only 4 hours ahead of Thailand, it would probally be a safe bet that the grand final will take place in the afternoon in Thailand. Meaning we can actually see the games live and not have to stay up past 5am on a work night!   Hey guys,  Obviously in the books Littlefingers involvement in Sansa's escape from KL isn't revealed till after the purple wedding and the entire great escape is done through the catspaw, Dontos. The show has instead decided to bench all that book ground work with Dontos and just make LF explicitly tell Sansa that he will smuggle her out of KL.   What do you think about this change? Better or worse?  P.S. The actor who played Dontos in season 2 has been recasted for the role in season 4, so chances are that we will see some of his involvement be introduced this season.  P.S.S Little tidbit on Dontos Hollard. He is the last of his great house, which was wiped out during the Defiance of Duskendale by the Mad King. He (as an infant) was to be executed but Barristan stepped in and stopped it from happening. Very cool.  Edit: The actor's only other appearance is during the battle of the blackwater, doing some [juggling](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92ebpbEFY1re0u5vo1_500.png)   Hey guys,  Rockstar is obviously annoying the shit out of PC/next gen gamers with their hush hush attitude about upcoming GTA 5 ports, I mean seirously? You won't even say that you're developing them? You want hype? Announce that you're working on it, staying silent is just making people like me lose interest in the fucking game. I'm pretty close to the stage of not caring anymore.  But for the time being while I do care, I know that GTA ports have been released up to 8 months after the initial console release but does anyone know how long after that initial release, the actual *announcement* for the port was put forward? If a game is to be ported, I would imagine months of advertising and marketing would be used to maximize consumer interest.    Hi guys,  I signed up for beta this weekend and I go an invite. I created my account and redeemed my code. I appear to get this error when ever I try to log in when the game boots up. I know my information is correct as I have logged into the game's website easily with it. Ihave also tried changing my password, no luck.  The only thing is that I didn't want to download the game from scratch so my roommate (who played last beta weekend) put his game up on the network and I just updated that client with the latest.  Anyone else got this anoying error?  Edit: I wanted to post this on the ESO forums or via their support page. GUESS WHAT? Can't access either of them. Edit: I was finally able to get onto the ESO beta forums, there is a thread where updates on this known issue are posted. I hope they can fix it soon, here's the [link](http://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/discussion/55059/login-information-incorrect)   Hi everyone,  I'm sure I'm not the only one who googles for information on TWOW frequently. Something which has been irritating me of late is that almost every article has the same thing. They keep asking "When is the book coming out?" and the answer is always "When its done". But isnt that the wrong question to ask? George doesn't answer it because he has been bitten in the arse for giving predictions and he just doesn't know. Why not ask him a question he actually does know?  So I'm requesting to you all, if you do happen to get a chance to ask him a question, could you ask how far along he is? I'm not sure why progress updates are difficult for him. Its been almost a whole fucking year since we have heard ANYTHING about the damn book.     Hi guys,  Who would be interested in the idea of a subreddit census being done? I personally, would be interested to see the spread of demographics that this wonderful subreddit has :)  If so, what questions do you guys think should be asked?  **Edit:** If you're a mod and you're reading this, if someone runs with this idea could we get it stickied to the asoiaf front page? I would love to see a large set of data :)  **Edit 2:** Polls around theory opinions have been done before [as you can see](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1lubp7/spoilers_all_major_theories_opinion_poll_12/). I really would prefer to do one about the people!   Hi guys,  I stumbled across this SSM from 2001 in which GRRM confirmed that Howland Reed will be introduced at some stage. What is the best theory for his introduction into the series?  Source:  [**Question 3:** It had been stated that Howland Reed would come out in The Winds of Winter, which is the 5th book. Will he still come in the 5th book (A Dance with Dragon)? **Answer**: He will appear eventually.](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1270/)   Hi guys,  Something which has annoyed me from the get go about the TV series, is the lacking of definition between Others and wights. Instead, there is just a lazy singular reference of 'White Walkers'. By the stage we're during ASOS we know the difference between Others and wights and we even have an idea about their weaknesses and strengths. Are the show watchers informed enough going into future seasons about these undead fuckers, who are supposedly going to be important to the story.     Hi guys,  I'm about a third of the way through AFFC on my second reread and I'm starting to remember why I was irritated by AFFC on my first read. I don't like the idea of the quest that Brienne goes on for most of AFFC. Its essentially 8 chapters of a wild goose chase. I know that her arc seems important as it ends with the confrontation between her, LS and Jaime. But its frustrating to read about her constantly looking for a person that she will never find. What do you guys think about her story during AFFC?   Hey guys,  What changes (big or small) from the books to the TV show do you think were for the better? Perhaps a character omission which made the story more fluid? Perhaps the shortening of a scene which adds more drama etc.  For me, I feel that the way they introduced Tyrion for the first time in the show was *far* better than the way they did in the books. Tyrion tumbling off a bench was one of the silliest things I could think of, first seeing Tyrion drinking wine and whoring? That's a far better introduction.  Also the removal of patchface, fuck that guy.   Hey guys,  I'm rather new to this subreddit and I have not seen a thread on this in a little bit. Whats your favourite story around meta gaming? I do find stories around *that guy* rather amusing.   Hi guys,  I have been playing DnD for the past 6 months and I have been having a ball. One of our players wants to bring his GF in to play with us, she has never played DnD or any other roleplaying before. While I don't have an issue with this girl, I'm worried that we will see issues with them meta gaming due to their relationship.  Do you guys have any tips to avoid this? Have you had a good experience before with people who date playing DnD? Any bad experiences?   Simple enough.  Hypothetically if you could ask GRRM one question which he has to give a yes or no answer to, what would it be?  As much as I would like to confirm R+L=J, I feel that it is all but confirmed. I would probally ask something like, will Jon be a leader in some form (King, warden, etc) outside of the Nights Watch?  Edit: Alternatively, I would ask *Will Dany turn crazy?*   Hey guys,  I would like to expand on [this other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1wkicm/spoiler_all_hbo_should_film_roberts_rebellion/) about HBO hopefully doing a show about Roberts Rebellion. Lets say hypothetically, that the rights to Roberts Rebellion are recieved and the wheels are in motion. Who would you cast and for what role?  I would be keen to get some nominations for the title roles and then do a poll to see who the community would love to see :)  Major characters (let me know if I forgot anyone imparticular:  - Eddard Stark - Rickard Stark - Brandon Stark - Benjen Stark - Lyanna Stark - Howland Reed - Hoster Tully - Catelyn Tully - Jon Arryn - Tywin Lannister - Jaime Lannister - Cersei Lannister - Robert Baratheon - Stannis Baratheon - Rhaegar Targaryen - Aerys Targaryen - Rhaella Targaryen - Viserys Targaryen - Willem Darry - Elia Martell - Jon Connington - Barristan Selmy - Jonothor Darry - Lewyn Martell - Arthur Dayne - Gerold Hightower - Mace Tyrell - Randyll Tarly - Varys - Pycelle - Gregor Clegane - Armory Lorch - Davos Seaworth   Hi guys,  I'm going through my second reread of ASOS and Sansa has already arrived at the Vale and I'm up to the stage past Petyr's wedding.  Something is kind of irritating. Why is Sansa not more ecstatic about her situation? Now I know that her life has been turned upside down with so much death in her family, but she is now as safe as she can be. If my family had all died and I was imprisoned, then I was to be released and be kept safe I would at least be a little happy about that. All of the post KL Sansa arc is from her POV and you hardly hear a peep from her about how much better off she is in the Vale over where she was doomed to stay (KL). Not only that, she does not even seem slightly thankful for the effort and risk that Petyr put into bringing her to the Vale. Whether she thinks that she is being played as a pawn to Petyr, she would always be better in the situation she is in now, over being a perpetual prisoner in KL.  Since courtesy is a woman armor, has her armor weakened?    **Edit:** Please consider that I said "(Spoilers All) Why is Sansa not **more** happy or thankful?", not why **isnt she happy**. I would ask for people to consider the two situations she had. Being held hostage at KL or being held hostage at the Vale and explain to me how she is better off at KL? **Also please realise that the timeline which I have referenced** is at the time before most of the creepy shit from Petyr has occured, as far as she is aware she is to be wed to Robin and have house Stark restored to the north, she has not been kissed by Petyr yet nor has she witnessed her Aunt being killed by him. Lots of down votes today, sheesh.    Hi everyone,  Does anyone have a source on the latest update for the playable classes? I have seen a few different places say a few different things. I was after something more official than I have seen so far.   Hello everyone.  There has been some discussion around my friends half-orc fighter. He purposefully set his character up to have an INT of 7 and a WIS of 10, but stacked his STR and DEX. Which is good for role playing, because it means that he can be a brute who smashes things and he has had lots of fun with it.  But where he hits walls (literally sometimes lol) on occasion, is when it comes to how to interpret an INT of 7 and a WIS of 10. Does low INT indicate a lack of common knowledge? Does an average WIS mean he has some common sense?  We were having situations where we were sneaking down a hall way and someone would whisper "Bu-Shek, I need you to be quiet because we don't want to be discovered" his character would then say **very** loudly "What? Why would I be quiet". Now this was rather hilarious to say the least, but it did put the question forward of "Should low INT mean he does dumb shit, or does it just mean he has a lack of knowlege?". Since he has a WIS of 10, would his character know that staying quiet while sneaking around is important and does a INT of 7 mean that he cannot read or write?   How would you interpret it?   Hi guys,  A few years ago, I used to use an addon called 'Snowfall Keypress'. I primarily used it because it would disable the button press **animation** so no matter how much I was spamming a button, the UI would show it as if I pressed it once.  This addon has become obsolete and has been abandoned, does anyone know of an addon which does the same thing?  *Edit: I'm not talking about the addon functionality of casting a spell immediatly instead of after the button is released. I'm talking about the button press **animation** being removed, so that the animation only occurs when the spell is cast.      Hey guys,  Lets do it, find a quote and take it out of context. I found quite a few moments where I giggled due to poor choices of words.  Post your verbatim quote out of context for the lulz.  ASOS, Catelyn V *"...take the Iron men in the rear, while they beat off..."*   Hey guys,  It has been quite a long time since I have read AFFC (up to half way through ASOS on my second reread) but has Euron given any actual reason for sending Victarion to court Dany on his regard? He is obviously cunning so he would know that his brother despises him and would probably betray him to marry Dany for himself but he does it anyway. Do we have any hints on what he plans to do with the Victarion envoy situation?  I have a feeling that Victarion would be better suited to do the whole raping and pillaging thing that Euron is doing at the moment.   Hi guys,  I rather new to DnD, I may have only been playing 4e for the past 4 months but I'm having so much fun. We are playing with a DM who has never played before either but he is doing a great job. One thing that he has 'expanded' is the critical success and critical failure rules. At first, rolling natural 1s or natural 20s just meant you either did max damage or something comical happen and you're disadvantaged.  But he has added another level to this since he was having so much fun coming up with cool shit to coincide with bad/good rolling.  His house rules are:  - If you roll a 1, he will quickly outline a few possible scenarios and get you to roll a d6. (roll of a 1-2, you lose grip of your weapon and throw it at the ally next to you, 3-5 you drop your weapon, 6 you correct yourself and land the blow successfully but with slightly less damage as you are off balance.) - If you roll a natural 20, roll the D20 again and if you roll another 20 something amazing will occur. That's all hes told us, we're waiting for someone to roll a second 20 :D (I rolled a 19 after a 20 on the weekend against a 'boss').  Now these rules may seem pointless and would add lots of time to the fights but our DM has this weird ability to come up with new shit to screw us up within seconds and it has made for far better combat :). What other fun changes have you guys employed for your own campaigns?      Hi everyone,  We all know (and surely love) how Tywin/Shae met their ends and the implications which followed such a powerful scene.  I heard a while ago a theory that because of the effort D D has put into making Shae a genuine love interest for Tyrion, the show will not have her betray Tyrion on the stand and will have her die by the hands of Tywin which will be the tipping point for Tyrion to kill his father. While most theories about show differences are taken with a grain of salt, this theory seems rather possible.  Am I getting worried over nothing or do you guys think this could happen too?   Hey guys,  Its been 2 days since I had posted the thread with the poll attached which asked Which book have you read up to in the series? in /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones. Now I know that there are a lot of factors into this poll (e.g people who have not read any books are less likely to even open the thread, let alone vote in it) but we did get some interesting results nontheless.  [Enjoy :)] (http://i.imgur.com/6KkkOjs.png)  Discuss :3    Hey guys,  Its been 2 days since I had posted the thread with the poll attached which asked *Which book have you read up to in the series?* in /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones.

Please vote in the poll, I would love to see how many are up to date and being driven crazy by the wait for TWOW.  *Edit* **Poll closed, please head to [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1t4dgy/no_spoilers_poll_results_for_what_book_are_you_up/) for the results.**      Having witnessed how D D deal with hidden characters which can only stay hidden in the books because the audience cant see the actors face (Barristan - Artsan, Illyrio and Varys in the dungeon, etc). Do you think that they will reveal immediately that it LS is actually a resurrected Catelyn?   I think that they have an opportunity (thanks to the drastic change to voice and appearance) to keep LS hooded and do the big reveal at the end of the season.   P.S On a side note, I'm looking forward to the reveal of LS because over the past 6 months I have been planting *fake* spoilers in my friends head about the series (he only watches the TV show). So he thinks I'm joking when I say "Are you looking forward to next season? Watch out for when Ned is revealed to be an alien, Joffrey is actually a robot and Catelyn is now a zombie."   Hi there,  I will admit, I'm rather new to the scene. I only started reading the books once the TV show aired, and I have only been hanging around this subreddit for the past 3 months or so. While here I have noticed for every *suspicion* there are normally several tin-foil theories trying to explain them.  My question is, can you recall any theories which were posted over the years for the most recent books which were dismissed as silly and tin-foily but were later confirmed to be completely true?     Title says it all.  I'm having a hard time sourcing an audio book version of Dangerous Women. Almost all sources do not have the licensing for the Australian audience.  Does anyone have any ideas how to get this new audio book?    Hi guys,  What are you worried will occur in the last two novels?  For me, I have the worry that we will witness some deus ex machina to resolve some of the already complex plot points. While I know that GRRM is not a fan of deus ex machina, I still have the fear that we might get some 'cop out' resolutions to some of the more intricate story lines.   I'm also worried that we might witness some ambiguous endings, I would hate after all this time with a certain characters fate to be *left up to the imagination of the reader*. Fuck that, I hated it in at the end of American Psycho.  Lets just hope that GRRM is as thorough with his ending of story lines as he is as creating and expanding them :)   Hi everyone,  Nice and simple question, there are a few changes that were put in place around the torture, imprisonment and change of Theon into Reek in the TV series.   **Do you think that the changes were better or worse than what happened in the books?**   Since they are strapped for time for the portrayal, I think they did a good job overall capturing the *fucked up-ness* of Ramsay and they have shown why in season 4 we are going to see a completely new 'Reek'.  But if I remember correctly, Reek's castration is only implied in the books where as it's explicit in the show. Which could affect the idea of Theon possible ascending as king of the iron islands, which has been theorised.   Hi guys,  This isn't laziness, I have looked up and down and I cannot seem to get a solid lead on the actual current progress on TWOW from a decent source. Whats the latest you have heard on the progress of TWOW?     Hi guys,  Bear with me on this one, I think you would agree that while its just silly to say "THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY CATALYST TO THE WAR OF THE 5 KINGS" or "IF ONLY SHE/HE DID THIS INSTEAD, THE WAR COULD OF BEEN AVERTED". I think a reasonable statement is that if it were not for Jamie and Cersei's incest a lot of the war would not of occurred.   So lets say that Jamie and Cersei either didn't fall in love or they did fall in love but didn't consummate it and kept it to their selves. Cersei would then have black haired Baratheons, Jon Arryn would have no suspicions thus would not be killed which stops the majority of the events of the books moving forward. Westeros would remain as undivided as it was before the books and any Essos invasion could be met with more ease.  If I were in the shoes of Jamie or Cersei I would feel an overwhelming amount of guilt for the thousands who have died because I fucked my sibling. Do you guys think this just could be because of the characters of Jamie and Cersei? Both of them have had major redeeming moments in the books but there is never much mention of regret for being at the center of the war. I'm also surprised that this responsibility is not brought up to Cersei/Jamie by a smart cookie like Tyrion for instance.   I know that I have simplified the issue a bit here, but I do think that there is a choke point of blame with Jamie and Cersei.  TL;DR - The incestuous relationship between Jamie and Cersei has caused much and more of the war then is brought up.  *Editing the edit for another edit, bare with my spelling*   Hi guys,  What significant plot points (which have been left out of the TV series) do you think disadvantage the watchers the most?  For me, the lack of mention to the discussion that Robb has in regards to naming his heir in the event of his death. I found this to be a very important moment to the reader as it starts placing some of the events in perspective leading up to a potential future Stark come back.  Also, is there a character or plot point that you're glad they left out of the TV series?  I personally hated Patchface in the books, he was so annoying.   Hi guys,  A plot line which to me feels like it was dropped, Tyrion finds out that littlefinger was the one who told Catelyn about 'his' dagger. When he arrives to KL he even states that "he needs to have a conversation to Petyr about that"...   Am I forgetting an encounter or is this left unanswered?   Hi guys,  The other discussion (http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1pcz53/spoilers_all_grrms_characters_asoiaf_vs_show/) I think needs a poll to get a real show of opinion. Please vote below and feel free to add a description of why :)  http://strawpoll.me/619919  *Edit: Sorry guys, I cant believe I forgot Liam Cunningham :(   Hi guys, I want to talk about the prophetic messages which Arya got from the ghost of high heart. Specifically this sentence:  "I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow."  Now while the first portion is obviously about Sansa and her indirect affect on the purple wedding, the last part of the sentence is something which I have not seen anyone talk about. Who could Sansa be slaying? Could Petyr be the savage giant? Perhaps the hound? The reference to the castle built of snow could seems likely to be in reference to the Eyrie but lets not forget Jon's last name ;)  Sorry if this has been discussed before, but I couldnt find anything on it :)   Hi guys,  I just had a thought about a pretty cool way for a reveal about Jon's fate and Azor Ahai. While there are a lot of theories about how Jon isnt dead at the end of ADWD, I think he will die. I think that his characters body will be collected by the NW and burned (as standard practice) and he will be reanimated as Azor Ahai, fullfilling the smoke portion of the prophecy. This should mean that there will have to be a confirmation of R+L=J soon after.  What do you guys think?   I am still rather undecided which army I shall give my allegiance to. I am leaning towards Eldar. I love the idea of being a howling banshee, leaping around the place hacking orks to pieces. Or decimating a wave of chaos berserkers as a reaper :)  Vote your choice, give a reason below too :)  http://strawpoll.me/417280   Hi everyone, I would like to preface this by explaining that this post is only directed to those who perpituated the bullshit drama over the past few days.  I am sick and tired of this crap over the past few days. Why are you all still harping on about this. There is so much heresay, unfounded rumors and flat out lies being told by the public that I am starting to really feel sorry for everyone involved. This whole thing started with a few isolated incidents with sG and has now evolved into a retarded episode of Jerry Springer.  Whether you dislike swindle, khezu, tralf, PPD or ANYONE involved in this matter is irrelevant. Do you know what is relevant?  ITS NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS, if this was never aired publicly it would of been sorted out quickly and without all of this high school gossip rubbish. To those involved who intentionally spread bullshit to incite drama, you are not better than TMZ. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.   	120

Awsome. http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-05-16/music/el-p-and-killer-mike-survivors/   This exhibit is in St. Louis now. They have the TNG bridge and a transporter pad as well.   The R.A. verse is great and Stoup did an amazing job as always. But man Vinnie Paz is clumsy.   This doesn't really answer your question but it was the first thing i thought of when i read it. http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/2906.html  If it sounds like something you want to dig into further i can email you the the paper in a .pdf        I feel the way every time i hear someone talking about the Constitution and original intent.   I read an interview with Frank Zane a while back. He talked how he would always look in the mirror and see something else to work on and improve, never being satisfied. This is a guy who had what is widely considered one of the most developed physiques of all time, was at the top of the bodybuilding world, and he was never really comfortable with his body even in his prime. Yeah, thats something that can keep you driven in that kind of competitive environment but there is also something really dysfunctional about it.  I think about that sometimes to keep things in perspective.    My first thought when i saw this. http://i.imgur.com/uJdJ3.jpg   I just figured they moved it to http://nation.foxnews.com/   Torres defense is bullshit.  He may have lined that hit up while Hossa had possession but after the poke check Hossa had time to turn, locate the puck, and take 2 strides. You cant tell me Torres didnt have time to try and avoid contact.  It was late and he clearly launched himself.  Torres was a dirtbag with Vancouver and hes a dirtbag now.  The right rules are in place to stop hits like this. The refs and the league should be embarrassed that there was no call.    Hes articulating something I think about fairly regularly. Im not a Christian, Im not an atheist either. I consider myself more of a Panenthiest but I sympathize with a lot of the arguments that are made by atheists. However, I have a real problem with the way a lot of atheists approach religious people or religion in general as if there are no distinctions to be made between a everyday religious belief and the most egregious examples of fundamentalist insanity.    great awareness by Perron to extend the leg and stay on side   That fucking trumpet needs to vanish forever.

Garth is probably right on this.  Start building muscle first. Take your time and get your routine sorted out. The added muscle will increase your at rest metabolism and make it easier to shed the fat over the long term. Do all the little things that boost your metabolism and get the fat burning going while you are getting bigger. Drink tons of water, eat small high protein meals every 2 to 3 hours, cardio in the morning if possible.       Ill throw down a hundy that says natural causes is a euphemism for in his closet, dick in hand, surrounded by pictures of Reagan, with an extension cord around his neck like David Carradine.   Ebionites. Couldnt think of it earlier. They were early Christians who insisted that Jesus was just a man. The messiah, but just a man.   The synoptics are also propagandistic, written by men familiar with Jewish scripture to convince Jewish communities of the day that Jesus was the promised messiah. Performing wonders, especially wonders associated with classic Jewish symbols of divine authority fits with that idea. Saying that performing wonders means Jesus was God still seems like a leap to me. While Jesus was certainly an apocalyptic preacher and taught of an impending judgment by the son of man it is not until the later gospels that  he claims to be this figure. There was an enormous amount of diversity of opinion in the early Christian world as to the nature of Jesus.  Just as a couple examples, some Gnostic communities believed Jesus and the Christ to be two wholly separate entities where Jesus was simply a temporary vessel for this divine spirit which abandoned him at the crucifixion causing him to cry out father why have you forsaken me. Others believed Jesus became the Christ only at his crucifixion. Others, somewhat later, said it was at his baptism. Still later, he was born the Christ.  There is a theological progression in the ancient texts building toward the idea of Jesus as man and God. But it is not fully articulated until nearly a century after his death and not settled as a point of dispute between Christian communities until several centuries after that(if it has truly been settled at all). Start with the earliest Gospel Mark, then Mathew, then Luke, then John and read them horizontally, the progression becomes quite pronounced.   How about Mathew, Mark and Luke? We dont get any explicit references to the divinity of Jesus until John which was written much later. And just to clarify Im not saying that they state he was not divine, Im just saying that they dont say that he WAS divine. It just seems like a pretty important point to omit given the centrality of the claim to later Christian beliefs.    Fighting helps the game police itself. I actually think the leagues crack down on fighting has contributed to the rise in concussions. Whats a 2 minute sit down next to having your ass kicked?     	31
 Not necessarily, there's a lot of foreign tourists in New York City and a lot of very distracted tourists. Let's face it, when lots of people go on vacation, they seem to turn their common sense off. I've seen it in National Parks, I've seen it in big cities.   Henry being a KGB agent working for the FBI . . . that's some The Departed level conning there.   New York City real estate is amazingly insane right now. Lots of very wealthy foreigners (especially from Russia and China) are using it as an investment vehicle, a place to store their money. I was listening to a podcast earlier this year and one of the hosts said that he had a friend who lived in a building in the Chelsea area and he is usually the only person in the building because all of the other apartments are owned by foreigners who are rarely ever there.   Probably tourists.   It really needs to be updated on the inside. A lot of that price has to do with location - Gramercy Park is a lovely neighborhood. I bet it will end up selling around $42 million.   This is a photograph of the AP Wire Bulletin that was received by KHOU in Houston on the night of April 29, 1975 (US time), announcing that South Vietnam had surrendered.

As someone who lives in a state with a big border with Mexico, I believe that there is very little that American politicians can do to stop illegal immigration. So long as there are economic/social hell holes south of the US, people will try to come here illegally.

Yep, and once you're arrested, because of politics, the DA will try to get you to take a plea even when the evidence is weak. They hate dismissing anything.   I stopped watching a couple episodes into the second season.

Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager Dan Devine's last season but he could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team's final roster.   I second this.   Click bait doesn't bother me.   I'm going to say that they're incorrect about The Woodlands, seeing as Woods was the maiden name of Mitchell's wife, heck the outdoor performance venue there is the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion.

No, Chevy's latest police vehicle is the Caprice PPV, which was introduced in 2013.   I don't think so, they she passed out   they she acted, I think he drugged her.   People today fail to realize marriages back then were more like business contracts.   I always read he was a vain man, if only Washington had made his admiration for Arnold more clear to the man himself ...   I'm guessing it was his university/college robe and cap.   Yeah, it took me a bit to recognize him.   I know members from Nation of Islam have been doing that too.   I think she was just seriously drugged.   At the end, with her weird facial ticks, her vibe reminded me of a Stepford Wife - Ogre gave her some kind of powerful drink.   I'm in Alief and most places around here have no squeegees outside or available inside.   Looks like a Caprice PPV.

There are Native Americans in Canada - he grew up on the Six Nations Indian Reserve - Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, and Tuscarora - Robbie Robertson is Mohawk.   Oh, I have, several people like that - none of them grew up in Houston, or even a top 10 sized city.   To me all of Houston is "Real Houston." That being said, I'm amused by how people who were not born in or grew up in Houston act like anything outside of 610 is a no man's land.   I know earlier this year there were some guys robbing women in their driveways - snatching purses as the women were getting out of their cars. Not sure if that is still going on.

I know it isn't as bad as the decades before I was at Baylor, but still annoys me. Back in the 1990s, my girlfriend was at UT and I typically drove down to Austin every weekend and would crash in her room at Jester. It was a coed floor, so no big deal there. By 2nd year at Baylor I was living at The Centre and various girlfriends of myself and my roommates were always staying over - some practically seemed to live there for periods. We never gave a f about the moral rules or what ever Baylor Admin calls them.   My policy is to use the article's actual title (or at least the suggest title button) whenever possible.  That being said, it is important for everyone to recognize that the headline, or article title, is typically (and historically) written by a copywriter and not the author of the actual article. Considering how newspapers have historically written headlines so as to grab a reader's attention and get the reader to read the article, I feel there has been a little too much handwringing on the internet over "click-bait" lately.

Ha ha ha. Mine are indoor only, so I don't have trouble with them bringing bugs in from outside, thankfully.   Thankfully all three of mine go after any bugs that move.   Cats.

I haven't heard anything, I know some people who've held an executive position in the government, like mayor, don't like nonexecutive elected positions (house, senate, etc.) because they're used to being "in charge," rather than being one vote among many. But then again, Cory Booker, former Mayor of Newark, seems to like being in the US Senate.   Looks like that's what they did when he reached back into the car. Thankfully the guy in the Explorer wasn't hit, you can see him get out of his care after the suspect was down.

There are a lot of traffic cameras around town, those are usually mounted on the stoplight bar. Red light cameras typically seem to be installed on the medians at intersections.   And because of this database I find it annoying that I have to send in a copy of proof of insurance when I do my registration.

I agree, a 100ft buffer is too much of a buffer to set as red letter law.   Don't blame OP, that title is from the HuffPost. And, to be honest, headlines are designed to get you to read the story (and are rarely written by the author of the story). Not in agreement that the term clickbait applies here, this isn't a slideshow or fluff piece.   The title is a bit misleading. Filming the police is protected by the First Amendment, States cannot legislate around the First Amendment. However, courts do maintain that those filming the police cannot interfere with the police, leaving open what exactly is interfering with police. It appears that this bill is attempting to do that by setting a 100 foot distance requirement. That being said, I think 100 feet is a bit much and I do not support this bill.   The other day I say a couple do this during rush hour even though they were only 5 feet away from an actual crosswalk, what morons. Even if you cross against the light in a crosswalk, at least you are in an area where motorists should be aware of you.   I would so watch that.  	199

What's the working language or languages there?   And here's an amazing video of a very brief encounter with these people...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPYwlXOTzQ     	77
 So basically, I'm writing a proxy server in C. It only needs to handle GET requests atm. I can take a GET request like very simple  GET www.amazon.com HTTP/1.0   and then generate a request header like follows:       GET / HTTP/1.0     Host: www.amazon.com     User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0.3) Gecko/20120305 Firefox/10.0.3     Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8     Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate     Connection: close     Proxy-Connection: close  The proxy then forwards the request to the server in that form and reads the response. I get all the response headers back just fine, but when it comes to reading actual content and forwarding it to the client from the proxy I just get a bunch of replacement characters.      ^3h)UKfD*yh2' Rb8"u                         =qggEyYj1'sp[MI  I don't really know why this is happening or how to fix it.   If you need to see how I read from the response file (forward to client) I can post, but I don't think the way it is done has anything to do with why these characters are coming up.   The solution was actually really stupid actually. I was thinking along the same thing. I figured maybe the charging port had shifted or loosened and couldn't get enough current to charge. Turns out when it fell the charger was actually destroyed like at the end and my spare wasn't working either. Just needed a new charger. Damn I felt stupid.   As said in title - I just dropped my phone and it was almost dead so I tried to charge it and it no longer charges. Turned off/on, reset etc. I have no idea what to do?   I just searched around for them and only found one that looked like it - sadly without color :( If anyone knows I would love the one like the one on the car  	4
    Mike and Rachel killed me tonight! they were so cute, but then she cheated! I was proud of Mike for not forgiving her right away but then I wanted them back togetherIm so conflicted!   Its so obvious Hanna hates Ali. She is avoiding her big time! Im telling youHanna joined Mona. She cant face her. Shes drinking and stressed because shes afraid the girls might find out.     Rhonda is so cute with her root beer and crunchy cheese doodles.     I think E. Lamb was fired and pushed out of town by A.     Poor Ella. I have a feeling they moved the wedding up because she got pregnant. Zach is an Asshole!!!!     Did Sydney slip up on purpose about NY or by accident. (Id love to hear your thoughts on this!)     I want to hear what everyone thinks about Alis behavior. All fake?     I was shocked it was Noel who broke in the Marins house! When Ali first blurted his name out i had a heart attacki thought she was going to say he was A or something tp do with A!!     Just a side thought..didnt Mona also ride horses? Remember she went with Kate and her friend when Hanna went?   Thats all i have. Any comments?    Thanks for the info   Soooo we still don't know what Parrish is....And he doesnt know what he is either obviously. He was too funny when he was like Im only worth 5 dollars?!??? Loved this episode!!!   thanks you 2   thx a lot!!      Thanks so much! I`m going to try it! Have a good one!   Thanks for the input!   Itll bring armies to their knees. Cities will disappear in the blink of an eye. The world will be united in peace by the most just and noble country in the history of mankind. Or it will burn to the ground...  Anyone seen it? Is it worth it?   True Blood tonight was ridiculously boring. I mean come on, this is a final season! Dont put us to sleep! I want some action and some oh shit! moments, preferably lots of them!!!      I was kinda sure about that...well that`s that! After all they are husband and wife....in real life     	15

She couldn't even wait for the game to finish before she hit the bar!                                                                                                                                                                                                  	115
 I have update my original post. After researching a little bit further, chromebook is definitely the best option where cost is an issue.   *Much giggles ensue after Jen leaves the room in a daze*   Would a chromebook be able to utilize the program Scrivener. Its the program I use the most when I'm setting up projects. I know it works on windows and Macs but I haven't looked into chromebooks to know if it would also work on those   Before I went back on the mood stabilizers, I wasn't quite so tired all the time. Now adding im having to take birth control after a surgery, its zapped what little extra energy I had to do anything.Im not exactly depressed, at least not all of the time. Mostly just mood-swinging from my body trying to get used to the new hormones being forced on it. Knowing where the mood swings are coming from doesn't always help though.  Has anyone had luck with vitamins for helping to mellow you out? Or any kind of natural supplement? Caffine makes me too jittery to really be an option   This seems to happen to me too. If Ive been stressed and anxious all day, I day dream about getting home just so I can go to bed      EDIT UPDATE : I believe I have decided to go with a Chromebook after reading an article a guy had wrote who also loved loves the Scrivener program. I will still definitely be emailing the Scrivener team to check into making an app that would work with Chromebook but I will research utilizing Google Docs for now.  If anyone else is having the same issue, here is the article that changed my mind: http://www.jamierubin.net/2013/03/24/writing-with-the-google-chromebook/   Original Post: I don't have the money yet but I want to plan out what some of my best options are . Looking for my most portable option for writing. I will need the internet for research as well.  **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**     * Country of purchase: United States of America    * Budget range: Under $300  *hopefully*    * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.)  I need it to be as ultraportable as possible. I want to be able to take it everywhere. I am in desperate need of a way to write on the go. I type fast and prefer it to writing by hand.    * Screen size preference: Around 14" or less, I want a small size for portability    * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):   I prefer windows. Have not had a lot of experience with Mac systems  * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):   This laptop won't be for gaming. Ill just need to be able to do research on the internet.  * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):   I would like a fairly good wireless card installed. I do a lot of research on web in  lot of different areas. Right now all of it is done from my phone.  * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):   Google. Im fairly good with computers. Just looking for suggestions here. Laptops are not my specialty  * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business  compatibility):   Open to suggestions.  * Any particular style that you like (examples are great):   Just looking for something portable  * Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)     * Long battery life -vs- Low weight:   Low weight  * Build quality -vs- Low price:   Maybe a little in between? I dont want it to break immediately  * Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:   Low noise would be nice  **Would you pay a premium for something that has:**   There aren't really any extra features I want  * High resolution screen:   Doesn't matter  * A great keyboard:   The keyboard is pretty important. It will be used quite a bit  * A great touchpad/mouse buttons:   I usually plug in a mouse. I've never liked touchpads  * Great audio:   Doesn't matter  **List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy sjcreen, matte screen, etc.)  A screen that doesn't glare easy would be nice but not if it hikes the price too much. I need a few usb ports for a mouse and flashdrives.   I sold my 3DS to help with rent a little over a month ago and then Fantasy Life came out and I realized I missed Animal Crossing too so I scrounged to buy for a 2ds :/ and lost all my progress on my games. You'll end up wanting it back, trust me.   Perhaps they will consider bringing the abrasiveness back to some of the characters in another installment then. Either way, it makes no difference to me, the thing I like most about the game is collecting items and decorating and interacting online with people. I rarely have the music turned up   I remember my nephew complain about how long Resetti's rant was going on. I can understand why this happened. It is after all, supposed to be more geared toward children.  	10
 I don't know why, but one in awhile I see strange things, I don't really believe in ghost so I'm not sure what I would call them.  I honestly think it's caused by my horrible insomnia, I have suffered from it since I was eight and I also have frequent night terrors that sometimes turn violent, I have actually scratched myself or thrashing in my sleep has gotten me some bruises, etc.   Anyways! I happened to find this subreddit and thought "why not!"   So this is a couple of random stories of the things that happen to me.  My blood family bought this older house and it was in need of some semi-serious cleaning because the previous owners were kinda pigs...  I helped my Nana clean the house, it was a hard day of cleaning all the bathrooms, the rooms, the floors, and the walls. So after cleaning all day me and my Nana were both exhausted; we still had cleaning to do in the morning so we set up our air-mattress and both passed out on it. Later I was dimly aware of my Nana getting out of the bed, she also has insomnia so I assumed that she was having trouble sleeping. I just started to drift back off when I felt Nana climbing back in the bed, I muttered something unintelligible to her because I noticed she was climbing on top of me, I finally turned over to ask her "What are you doing?"  It wasn't my Nana.  A woman who looked like she was about in her thirties, she had long hair that hung in her face, she as crying. I have always had a hard time waking up when I do sleep, so my brain was having a hard processing what was going on. Between her distraught sobs I realized she was talking. "Please, please give me back my baby!"  Still confused I garbled out a confused question. "what baby?" I guess that was the wrong question because she flew into a rage, grabbed my neck, started to cry and scream. "Where is my baby?!" "Your lying!" "I know you know where he is!"   I honestly don't know what happened after that, but next thing I know Nana was shaking me awake. I had freaked her out because she came back in the room to me chocking and struggling to breath in my sleep. I didn't tell her about the woman.  After moving into the house I would see that woman in brief glances or hear her crying.   The other two "things" in the house was a little girl who wore a bright yellow dress, she liked to giggle and would stay just out of my sight or I would hear her giggle while she hid behind my computer chair, she would giggle even harder when I would try and catch her. The other was a cat that didn't really exist. I don't know why, but I thought it was a boy and I stared calling him Pepper. He was a friendly cat who would sit by me while I played games on the computer or would sleep with me.  I have no idea how or why I see these "things" I have gone and gotten tested for schizophrenia, because I was really worried that maybe I had it. It would be much easier to deal with this if I had some idea of what is "wrong with me"   I have more stories, but not sure if I should post them or not...but I'm more curious about your stories or advice about similar experiences.   Thanks for reading loves!  *Noobly*       	1

                                     It will be a hard birth because she is under 6 months. While they can get pregnant, rabbits under 6 months can have their pelvic bones broken during birth.   I second everything in this post. It takes time and earning their trust is actually a very passive process that just requires patience.   Feeding him his greens by hand, even if just holding out your hand flat with a leaf on it, is extremely helpful as they learn to associate you with food.   Another important thing is to stay out of their space. Whether they have a pen or they are free roaming there is going to be some spot where their food bowls and litter box are. Leave it alone except when cleaning. Let them out and try to clean when they are not near the cage. On a similar note, if our rabbits are in their cardboard hidey boxes we don't bother them. And we open their pen door to let them out and let them go back in as opposed to picking them up and putting them back in.    Bonding usually takes longer than a week. Personally, I would seek to be involved in the bonding process. You need to learn the visual language of the rabbits to know when they are being aggressive and when they are establishing pecking order with dominant behavior. There are things you are allowed to let them do and things you should never let them do.   There is always the risk of them getting hurt. There is absolutely no way to watch them 24/7 and prevent every nip. Checking them over while they are in the process of bonding is important to make sure there are no scabbed wounds getting infected underneath.  I would ask this lady to teach me bonding techniques and include me in the bonding. You will probably need to keep the bunnies in side by side housing for a while as they get used to sharing the same space. You can even swap which pen they are in each day.   Don't go into this blindly and assume she will be able to do the work and you will bring home 2 perfectly bonded rabbits. Bringing home a rabbit into the other rabbit's house could upset the work she has done and require further bonding efforts.   There are lots of techniques and lots of opinions about how bonding can be done best. Do some research, and don't let her exclude you from the process.   Our bird loves to get into our rabbits' hay, too! Cute :)   I love seeing older bunnies doing good!    I think I posted a link to the album the first time and meant to just post a link to this pic. Doesn't really matter as it is the only pic in the album now, but there may be more later :)   Solid linework and beautiful color. Love elephants. Great tatt!      Gorgeous ink. Love the green.                              While the wounds are healing do this twice a day: Take a washcloth with hot salty water and hold it on the wounds to soak them and clean them.  Spray them with this: http://store.vetericyn.com/index.php/wound-and-skin-care/vetericyn-all-animal-wound-and-skin-care-4-oz-liquid-pump.html Make sure they do not close over from the top and have pus building up under the scab. Make sure they are closing from the inside. The soaking with the wet washcloth will help this and the vetericyn will keep the wound from getting infected (and be safe for your rabbit).  This is all information our vet gave us about caring for wounds and she is a very good rabbit vet.  As far as bleeding, rabbits are small and bleeding out is a serious danger. Stypic powder can help stop bleeding from small wounds. http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Care-Kwik-Styptic-Powder/dp/B0002H3RBU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1375141400 sr=8-2 keywords=styptic+powder  Clean q-tip in the powder and dab it on the wound.  If you are worried your bunny isnt eating properly, try critical care: http://www.amazon.com/Oxbow-Critical-Apple-Banana-Supplement/dp/B001FKACXO/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies ie=UTF8 qid=1375141438 sr=1-2 keywords=critical+care It says to mix with water. If your bunny isnt eating it, get some canned organic pumpkin or a little bit of banana to mash up with it. This is what we use for sick rabbits at our rescue. You may need to syringe feed her this if she isnt eating and wont eat this.  And consider keeping your rabbit indoors! There are lots of benefits to having a houserabbit, and we see a lot of injured rabbits come in from encounters with wildlife in their outdoor hutches.   Take your rabbit to the vet. If he is bobbing his head and seems dizzy and spacey it could be head tilt.  If he is avoiding placing weight on his leg he may have hurt himself.  The cost of an exam from my vet is $60.  The rest of the cost will depend on what is wrong with him and what the treatment is.  	32
 Over plan, over plan, over plan!  Make sure that you are rather firm on your classroom procedures and expectations from day 1. Once you have a relationship with your kids, you can ease up on management.  Depending on your grade level, make sure that the first week (unless high school) is really just get to know you activities, team building things, expectations, etc.  Take a deep breath!    I work in a very similar population, about 90% hispanic with high levels of LEP and NEP students.(This will be my second year)  I absolutely agree with brettbaileysingshigh(below)!  I would also say to be a hard ass from the get go. Last year, my first year, I wanted my kids to know that I cared and that turned into me being a target for being walked on. Be firm on your rules and expectations!   Also, make a friend in a veteran teacher! They will know your kids and what works and what doesn't work.  Most importantly, BE YOURSELF!! Kids no when you are being fake in behaviors, rules, etc. Show them how much you care with firm expectations and love!   YIN, Yang!!  	3
 What are you on about?   Tokido is a solid pick. I don't why people only praise for his technical side (vortex and set-plays). His ground game since Ultra has levelled up a ton and it's a testament to his skill as a player that he had to reinvent himself in the way he plays Akuma to succeed in this iteration.   I doubt EX Pugera will do as well as he did last year (9th place). Ibuki might seem top 5 on paper, but in tournaments, his character gets exposed by her bad matchups a little too much.  RB is an inspiring choice. Hope you're right!  Momochi is a straightforward pick. No complaints  Dieminion is also another good pick since he has a decent track record against the asian killers. Although I vouch Nuckle Du to do better since he has the edge of having multiple characters up in his sleeve.  I can't comment on valmaster since I don't know him very much. I do know he's probably the best chun in the world; on par with Vivi if not better.  Fuudo to me has stagnated. At this point, his character feels too linear and already figured out to really make a dent in the tourney. He will remain a solid, workhorse at the Top 16 spot.  No complaints about Xian as well although his myriad amount of pocket characters will serve him well in pools and semis.    Ryan Hart uses Ryu, Yun, Decapre, Abel. What do u expect? He's given up being a Sagat specialist.   He's no Bonchan. He's not even on Gachikun and Santarou Man level in terms of Sagat play.  He's probably on par with Sanford Kelly though. hehehe....   1. AVM Gamerbee (Adon, Elena, Yun) 2. Kazunoko (Yun) 3. MCZ Daigo Umehara (Evil Ryu, Ryu) 4. PIE Smug (Dudley) 5. EG Momochi (Ken) 5. MCZ Mago (Yang) 7. BT Nemo (Rolento)  7. FA Ryan Hart (Decapre, Ryu, Sagat, Yun)   Dashio is Daigo's favourite player to watch fyi   He is a very underrated player (along with Gackt) since he doesn't enter tournaments that much. He's still probably the best Sakura player for the last 3 years. Only other people that come close are Uryo (when he still mained her as a specialist) and Juso.      Eita has better reactions and better anti-airs than Tokido. He is also better at the akuma mirror when these two play.  But, yes he does play very "freestyle" like. He still plays very technical (vortex heavy) like Tokido and -6 (he now plays Poison) though.    So was this a casual match/exhibition or tournament?    I just realised Poongko and Fuudo are going to meet really early in QF Pool from Pool D5 and D6 respectively.   http://evo2015.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/ssf4_d5.html http://evo2015.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/ssf4_d6.html  Could be very interesting!  	9
 How about you...         Chris Jericho loves day ass           	7
 I'd watch this and not be ashamed to admit it. like 500 days of summer. goodass movie   lagomorphs.* I've been yelled at about this before already. I'll remember next time   what about poo. your cage looks so clean. my rabbit used to just constantly leave a trail of shits behind him and I said to myself no more rodents from now on.   A POP POP POP POP POP PAPOW   I want to try this   those gills though. I bet he gets all the ladies   is that where I heard this? what's the episode I wanna rewatch it   about publishing a book, right? I hope so   was not disappoint   ooo throw some gold trim on his plates!   and equally insane buyers. some guy bought a disco volante for 2 million if I remember correct and the car is not even street legal there.   area:volume can't get lower than a sphere so I'd imagine so   ( o  o)   he's spinning his cocoon   no it's because it's fun   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911   people who don't own this van:  1) Jeremy Clarkson   can you assholes stop posting pictures of beautifully cooked tuna? I know you are just doing it to make me jealous   But theyd be white (white) white on a sunshiney day   NO. WATER STONE   it's possible to get a solid black eye from heavy trauma but I'm 100% sure the pupil is photoshopped in. in case I'm wrong can anyone explain it?   and half of them are older than the wheel   "DUDE I'm so high."   you need to swim out there and dive. there's definitely an Easter egg down there. maybe a cool sword or something   I swear a sleepy dog is a liquid   you are the hero America needs   unicycles are a really effective means of transportation  -book of things I never thought I'd hear   shower beers?   next time you're out climbing rocks like that, think of us poor fucks who are stuck in boring flat Illinois and enjoy your life just a little bit more!   that is absolutely gorgeous.    what an adorable little 1920s sailor   sign him out. don't be going through other people's shit.   you need like AT LEAST 50 gallons to keep just one of them :(   it's not about staying warm it's about looking fly as fuck. I bet all the other huskies be jellin so hard   those classes aren't about actually learning art. they're about having fun and that's exactly what this guy did.   it makes no sense to me that everybody on here is claiming they have no problem with growth hormone and then simultaneously downvoting you for saying you wish it were socially acceptable.   his point is that nobody can deny that steroids are taboo among the vast majority of people and he's definitely right. he's just saying he wishes it wasn't the case and all you people are advocating hgh and then downvoting this guy for saying he wishes it were socially acceptable and that makes absolutely no sense regardless of where you stand on the issue.   thanks to David Firth   I don't know how you people do it but props to you. it's really cool to see how loyal and playful birds are with their breeders but oh my god the amount of work it requires is astronomical.   I had a friend named Quetzalli who owned an axolotl. doesn't get more Aztec than that   slooooowride   the worst part is that picture is hilarious without the dumb note :(    even me?   1000 YEARS DUNGEON FOR ALL YOU FRICKIN FRICKS   reminded me of the automatic pilot from Airplane   First off, I got my car brand new. this is in response to the guy who followed the car thief because he recognized the car from Facebook. Do people still steal newer cars? Can you get around the system and get different plates or if the theif sells, does the buyer then just drive the car unregistered to his name because I would think when you register it they'd catch you. I can't understand how stealing a car is worth the trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                        	112
 teeth gritting?   With the facial hair and the kind eyes you're definitely my type!! You're very handsome, 8/10   Brash but truthfully, thank you i appreciate that. I don't think i'm ugly so to speak, but there are definitely features that I would consider ugly and sometimes they're all I can see so it brings me down. That's what it comes down to I think. My boyfriend always calls me pretty truly he does like any good boyfriend would! But i'm a woman and subsequently tend to be too hard on myself..   And i take that as a huge compliment haha. I'm really flattered thank you :)   Actually, regal is a really cool way to put it. I honestly never thought of it that way   i must say, well phrased! thank you!   i may be somewhat biased because i absolutely LOVE facial hair, but i really do think it suits you quite well! I would keep it, you have the kind of look that needs a nice manly beard. Not enough me grow em these days! wear it proud :)   finally a numbered rate! thank you. As for my bulldog bite it is definitely there, it's receded to the point that is a few milimetres past my top jaw. Even with that though it shouldn't be past my top jaw at all so it still makes me fee; self conscious. Love to hear that it's not noticeable though so thank you :)   Keep the facial hair, really suits you and looks great on men in general!   Thank you, perhaps i have anxiety over looking different from the norm. There's always that "typical" pretty and i think just about every girl is looking for it aha.   I am a mix of German and English, half and half. Could that have anything to do with my jaw line? I live in Canada if that provides any context aswell haha. But thank you, didn't know there was a genetic line behind the trait! But i could have assumed..   hahahaha. Thank you ;)   They do seem to be common and I have always wasted one, but that is the way I should be looking at it i suppose. My jaw gives me a very round/oval face and I have mixed feelings about that. But thank you a lot it's reassuring to receive comments like this! :)   Thanks! I grew up with a reeeally bad under bite, but i was lucky to have it recede on it's own to the point that it's only a few millimeters past my upper teeth. It's at the point that I wouldn't bother with the jaw correction surgery but it's still noticeable enough to bother me!    Thank you for the comment! He's my boyfriend of a year so he's not too difficult to attract haha. honestly I've just always been jealous pretty girls with cute pointy little chins! I don't have that but i think it's adorable.  	15
 Yes?   I watched the entire video and there wasn't any mentions of road accidents or how they reached that number?    The Guardian collated all the deaths from all causes, including road accidents, diseases etc. and multiplied them to predict how many will die building the infastructure for the world cup.  Where do you see this? I'm looking at The Guardian's articles and I can't find road accidents, etc. taken into account?      Yup. Now imagine an entire country and its media with the same censorship mentality. Welcome to Sweden. Where any criticism of extreme left-wing politics will result in the media branding you a disgusting racist, where you'll receive death threats and be forced to stay quiet. This is a major reason why beggars and criminals from around the world come here. Because they know that our dear extreme left-wing population will do anything to protect these criminals human rights and silence anybody who is against these criminals.   The post was very clearly about the beggars that came to Sweden. It's a very relevant topic for Swedes which was apparent based on the number of upvotes it received.   Don't worry about it. Hey, guess what, my post just got removed as well.  You've just gotten a first-hand impression of the idiocy that is Swedish political correctness. Talk about immigrants? Censored! I come from immigrant parents, and even I'm not allowed to talk about immigration because it's apparently racist. Go figure! It's only going to be a matter of time now before I'll get banned from here. Watch as the mods will claim that this post very post is racist. Don't even bother with this subreddit.   THAT'S the reason why it got removed? Are you just being sarcastic?  I'm a 2nd generation immigrant and if anything, discussions like those are NEEDED to clear the air. Nobody was riling up against immigrants. People were only talking bad about the organized criminals.   Something fishy is going on here. Your post didn't seem to be breaking any rules yet it was removed. I'd be really cool if the mods would be transparent here and give us some sort of explanation.  Generally, if your post is removed on reddit, it still shows up for you, but for everybody else it becomes a [removed] and it disappears from the subreddit listing.      It's too late to save Sweden I'm afraid.  Sweden is more worried about [the portrayal of women in video games](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/20/the-insane-swedish-plan-to-rate-games-for-sexism.html) and [the lack of ethnic minorities in children's toy catalogues](http://www.metro.se/nyheter/morkhyade-barn-saknas-i-leksakskatalogerna/EVHnki!MCHp6rkn5uAK2/) and to [help ISIS-fighters get therapy and jobs once they return to Sweden](http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/orebro/kommun-hjalper-is-krigare), to be caring about the growing number of beggars and all the other bad things going on in society.

Source: http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/skole-tvang-muslimsk-elev-til-at-smage-svinekoed/5556877  An educational center for cooking in Holstebro in 2010 broke the equality law, when they insisted a muslim student should taste the pork that she prepared.  The court has come to the conclusion that the school must pay the student 40,000 kroners ($6,000) in compensation for lost education. She stopped at the school after she was told to taste the pork.  The 24 year old woman came to Denmark from Libya as an infant, and she is muslim.  When she started studying at the school to become a nutrition assistant, she knew that pork would be part of the foods in the curriculum, but at the school she was allowed to skip the pork.  In the summer of 2010 the administration for the education applied new rules which dictated that students must taste the food that they cooked.  When the student refused, she was summoned by the school to talk about the incident. Here she recorded the conversation.  During the conversation she was told that the teachers agreed that you must taste the food that you cook but that you don't have to swallow it.  Furthermore she was told that if she refused, it would have an impact on her education.  The day after, she stopped her education and filed a complain. She insisted that she was treated differently due to her religion.  The court agreed with her and ordered the school to pay her 75,000 kroners ($11,200) in compensation.  But the school defended itself by saying that the student was absent a lot of the times from her classes and that was another reason why she was summoned that day.  A higher court ruled that her absence from classes had no consequences for whether she was treated differently, and ruled that the compensation should be 40,000 kroners ($6,000) instead.      Because it took place in Sweden.      "I don't like your politics so I'm going to silence you"  Where do we see this kind of behavior now and in the past?   Godt s.

 In reality, Obama tried desperately to extend America's presence in Iraq.  Fortunately for them and us, the Iraqis politely declined.   The first neocon?   Meanwhile, at least 18 police officers and civilians were killed in attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday in a spate of violence that coincided with the start of the traditional fighting season there.   John Kerry, [wind surfer](http://obamapacman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/John-Kerry-Wind-Surfing-539w.jpg)   Yes   Great comment.  Thanks.   All they care about, in the end, is the war itself -- or rather, war itself. Wherever they find incipient conflict, they are eager to exacerbate it, sustain it -- and feed upon it...Almost invariably, the policies adopted by the imperial managers (of both parties) make the conflicts worse, fomenting extremist resistance and ever-more violent repression: a deadly cycle that benefits no one -- except the "masters of war."   http://www.surveybuilder.com/s/IabMHlf1oAA   Here's the survey where you can do just that: http://www.surveybuilder.com/s/IabMHlf1oAA   That's claimed by one of the villagers in the video report.   Me too.  Now I just get an onslaught of downvotes.   Do you think they'll endorse Ron Paul now?   He has, however, taken comfort in their movement toward his point of view on the war in Afghanistan. Mr. Gingrich has recently suggested pulling out of Afghanistan, and Mr. Santorum has said one option would be withdrawing faster than the Obama administrations 2014 timeline.  They know what the politics of it is, Mr. Paul says. **Thats what disgusts me. Why dont they take a stand and save some lives?**   Running for president demands enormous focus and energy. But it also requires level-headedness and personal maturity. Voters may be angry, but they prefer their presidents to be calm and professional.On this front, Santorum falls short and risks leaving a bad taste in voters mouths. If he cant pull it together and clean up his language, hes better off getting out sooner rather than later.    This is where I come to do fucked-up things, Givens said. So I dont do them at home.   The time has come to challenge the military at the level of its reason for being. The time has come to add up its suicides, its war crimes and the rest of its horrific legacy. How long can it survive and honest accounting?   "We are optimistic that a similar resolution can be found soon regarding the gradual transfer of the lead for **night raids** to Afghan forces. Already, Afghans increasingly lead these operations. **The success rate is overwhelming, and in most cases no shots are fired."**   "I keep hearing the president [Obama] say that he's responsible for keeping America from going into a Great Depression," Romney said. "No, no, no. That was President George W. Bush and [then Treasury Secretary] Hank Paulson that stepped in and kept that from happening."   The sad fact is that Bradley Manning is more likely to face the death penalty than Robert Bales.   "The Americans told the villagers, 'A bomb exploded on our vehicle. ... We will get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people,'" Rasool said. "These are the reasons why we say they took their revenge by killing women and children in the villages."  Mohammad said a U.S. soldier, speaking through a translator, then said: "I know you are all involved and you support the insurgents. So now, you will pay for it  you and your children will pay for this.'"   This campaign has been long, the general acknowledged. It has been difficult, and it has been costly. There have have been setbacks, to be sure. Were experiencing them now and there will be more setbacks ahead.  But, he said, I am confident that we will prevail in this endeavor.    Staff Sergeant Bales and any other US soldier involved in the killing spree in Kandahar must be held accountable for his crimes. That being said, the far greater criminals are those in the Bush and Obama administrations who sent them to kill and die in wars based on lies.   Another reason for Pauls weakness is his anti-interventionist foreign-policy views. The one thing that has hurt him some has been his position relative to Iran, former Nevada governor Bob List tells National Review Online. I think thats been a big factor in why he hasnt done better out here.   Bales, if he committed the actions which he is accused of perpetrating on March 11, is a war criminal who deserves trial and punishment. But the more important war criminals are those in the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA and throughout the US political establishment who are responsible for more than ten years of war in Afghanistan, and who are plotting new wars in Syria, Iran and elsewhere.   I kind of sympathize for him, being gone, being sent over there four times, said Beau Britt, who lives across the street. I can understand hes probably quite wracked mentally, so I just hope that things are justified in court. I hope it goes OK.   Check out the photo they used.    The villages are one and a half kilometre from the American military base. We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour at the same time, and the 16 civilians, most of them children and women, have been killed by the two groups.   In another event that calls into serious question the Pentagons unfailingly positive view of US progress in Afghanistan, the US military was compelled to acknowledge that it had significantly underestimated the seriousness of an incident that took place Wednesday, when a man drove a truck onto the runway at the Camp Bastion airport in Helmand, just as the plane bringing Defense Secretary Panetta was arriving there.   **It has since emerged that the individual driving the truck, which had been stolen from an Afghan soldier, was an Afghan interpreter working for the US-led occupation**. He died on Thursday from severe burns suffered when he apparently tried to ignite the vehicle. **Pentagon officials admitted Thursday that the interpreter was trying to run down a group of US Marines assigned to meet the aircraft.**   The incident underscored both the lack of security in an area supposedly secured by the US surge, as well as the continuing proliferation of so-called green-on-blue violence, the term used by the US military to describe attacks against it by Afghan security forces that are supposedly its allies.   A lot of people in this area support the Taliban because they see women and children get killed, he said.   That's just not true.   The shooting echoed through the silent night, and was without a doubt heard by the U.S. soldiers at the camp, Mohammed said.   His real name is Randall Paul.  He was not named after Ayn Rand.   How does that relate to a story about a political rally?  Please explain.   I think you posted your comment to the wrong story.   "I asked the elders here, why no demonstrations, no outcry? They say they are silent because they want to deliberate their moves, they want to decide. And once they decide, there will be no army, no force that can stop them."   When the Americans first came, it was people like me who welcomed them, said Abdul Jabar, 28, a truck driver from Kandahar. Now they are killing our women and children.   "Rare" abuses, "decade of progress"?   Outrageous statements begin around 5:08 of the video.   There's something kinda scary about that headline.   "We have to reassess the entire region," Gingrich said. "We need to understand that our being in the middle of countries like Afghanistan is probably counterproductive."   American forces have been in and out of Mali for several years now, as they have been in other Sahel countries, primarily to help the small army -- the Mali Defense Force numbers 7,000 men and a few women -- develop a counter-terrorism capability, to the extent possible in cooperation with its neighbors.   These people are our allies. They want many of the same things we do. They have expanded the boundaries of what everyone thought was possible in Syria. They have earned our respect, and now they need our support to finish what they started. The Syrian people deserve to succeed, and shame on us if we fail to help them.   "We cant afford to wait much longer, and we certainly cant afford to wait through four more years of an Obama administration. By then it will be far too late. If the Iranians are permitted to get the bomb, the consequences will be as uncontrollable as they are horrendous."   Should we take bets on who wrote this editorial for Romney?   "Due process and judicial process are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security.  The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process," the attorney general said.   "**In this hour of danger, we simply cannot afford to wait until deadly plans are carried out, and we will not**," he said in remarks prepared for a speech at Northwestern University's law school in Chicago.  Sounds a little like George W. Bush or Condi Rice, don't ya think?   None of this is to say that an attack should be ruled out.   The workers and two Afghan officers rescued 216 books, including 48 Qurans, from being burned, Dad said. **They were shouting and pulling the books from the burn pit, preventing the U.S. troops from throwing the remaining four cartons of books into the fire**, he said.   Feel free to do so.  I will upvote you every time.   I have just returned from Israel, where I spent 10 days and had the opportunity to visit with people from the prime minister to street market vendors...   The Romney campaign, however, says this is different.   **Every state budget in the country is dependent on federal funding**, and every governor in the country makes requests for funding, but governors do not get to decide how Congress appropriates money, said Romney spokesman Andrea Saul.    BTW, Ron Paul has [gained 2 points](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/election_2012_archive/february_2012/national_gop_romney_40_santorum_24_gingrich_16_paul_12) in the [last two weeks](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/election_2012_archive/february_2012/national_gop_santorum_39_romney_27_gingrich_15_paul_10).   The Army is offering a $10,000 reward for tips leading to the recovery of the stolen items, which the Army valued at $344,000.   He's still for killing Muslims, but at least he realizes that it's now a pointless exercise in Afghanistan.   And how has it affected supply? Not much. More than 22 years after the biggest cocaine bust in history, the biggest change along the front lines of the U.S. drug war may simply be the accents of the traffickers.   "People are not taking into account what can happen to those who are growing it. There are homes with mold and water damage in the hundreds of thousands and there are children in there too.   Napolitano also expressed confidence that notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who escaped from prison in 2001, would be recaptured eventually.    "Let me just say, it took us ten years to find Osama Bin laden. We found him, **and you know what happened there..."**   FYI, the quote is from Bob Woodward's *The Commanders.*   A $500 million upgrade has begun to fill in the extra acreage.   Check out the pic of the pope.   According to three Afghan security officials familiar with the case, the main suspect was Abdul Saboor, who was said to have worked in the ministry for more than a year as a driver. The two American officers who were killed were shot in the head and the pistol used to kill them was **equipped with a silencer**, the officials said.  Afghan officials said that Mr. Saboor was at large, apparently **able to leave the ministry without complication after the shooting**. That suggested to some observers that he may have had help in the attack.   Photo: http://newsok.com/photo/pid/1650392   Whether they had indifference or feelings from the past, there were no problems with the local population or with Montenegrin officers and soldiers, he said. From the minute weve landed here until today, the relationship building, the team building has been great.   If he was really concerned about the safety and welfare of the troops, it seems like it w/b easier just to bring them home.   "I was ready to shed my blood and kill them or be killed," Jamil told Reuters, sitting in a heavy winter jacket, a checked scarf tied tight around his neck.   "We Afghans don't want these Christians and infidels, they are the enemy of our soil, our honor and our Koran," said Haji Shirin, one of the protesters.  "I urge all Muslims to sacrifice themselves in order to pull out these troops from this soil."    Sounds like a winning message to take into the 2012 election. /s   Saturdays caucuses in Hancock opened at 10 a.m. with prayer and the pledge of allegiance and featured speakers in support of Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. **When the microphone was offered to a supporter of Rick Santorum, no one came forward.**   Begins at around 9:20 of the video.   Starts about 9:20 of the video.   Begins around 9:25 in the video.   Unlike a vast majority of those running for office, [Santorum] is totally OK with going there, penis-in-various-holes-wise. I suspect that it's his apparent comfort with explicitly raising the idea of sex, as much as his out-of-kilter views on it, that rankles all but the most extreme social conservatives. To go from the hypothetical legalization of homosexual marriage to bestiality, you have to have at least given passing thought to the physical act of gay sex.    I cant believe in 2012 the federal government is raiding Amish farmers at gunpoint all over a basic human right to eat natural food, said one of them, who asked not to be named but received weekly shipments of eggs, milk, honey and butter from Rainbow Acres, a farm near Lancaster, Pa. In Maryland, they force taxpayers to pay for abortions, but God forbid we want the same milk our grandparents drank.   Is this a trial balloon from the Rick Santorum campaign?   They've done such a good job in Iraq and Afghanistan that I don't see any reason why they couldn't handle the transition to solar energy.   The new concepts would leave a projected 12,000 Special Operations Forces deployed around the world; some on call for striking terrorist targets or rescuing hostages, and others deployed on training and liaison assignments and to gather information.   From the comments section: The analysis of Mr. Mallon is good, except in regards to his comments on Ron Paul's foreign policy. Endless war and the gold standard don't get along very well. There is no way that this country can ever return to fiscal solvency as long as we have the oversears empire. For 100 years the USA has tried to be the policeman of the world. The Federal Reserve and our endless over seas entanglements started with Woodrow Wilson. It is time to drive a stake through the heart of Wilsonianism. End the Fed. Bring the troops home. Concentrate on this country and let the world run itself. Wars always lead to high inflation and high taxes. Greenspan and Bernanke though that they could get us through these wars without either. Well we see how that turned out.   Value Added Tax   Will sounds like RP: "Do Republicans think it is premature to withdraw as many as 7,000 troops from Europe two decades after the Soviet Unions death? About 73,000 will remain, most of them in prosperous, pacific, largely unarmed and utterly unthreatened Germany. Why do so many remain?"   The Democratic Party owes a sincere apology to George Bush, Dick Cheney and company for enthusiastically embracing many of the very Terrorism policies which caused them to hurl such vehement invective at the GOP for all those years.   Other countries have developed drone technology, and if they follow U.S. precedent, they could start targeting their own enemies across any border they like, including our own.   Too bad he didn't do that with Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and the Philippines.   Additionally, the office is working to arm the drone with the Advance Precision Kill Weapon System...   The former Communist political and military commander for the whole of southern Afghanistan, General Nur al-Haq Ulumi, told me that the Communist Party in the 1980s had 200,000 members as core supporters. **I doubt if there are more than 40 people really loyal to Karzai**, he added. He does not even have the full support of his own cabinet.   Additionally, the office is working to arm the drone with the Advance **Precision Kill Weapon System**, a capability requested by 5th Fleet and U.S. Central Command. Smith said the drones aboard Simpson will not be armed during the deployment.   'Obama's War' was initially used by PBS, not me.  These civilian deaths are the result of [Obama's Afghan surge beginning in 2009](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/01/politics/main5846260.shtml).  Had he ended the war rather than escalated it, these civilians would be alive and well.   What a shock...   The Ron Paul people, the Tea Party and the conservative movement are to Mitt Romney and the country-club wing of the Republican establishment what laid-off workers were to Mitt Romney and Bain Capital. You are property, to be used when you can be helpful, to be humored and condescended to when you become nervous, to be discarded when you are no longer useful, and to be crushed by big money if you show integrity to conviction policies which they deplore behind your backs.   USA! USA! USA?   Meanwhile...[Rick Santorum spoke to a group of about 300 people at the Lone Tree Golf Club](http://www.850koa.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=124975 article=9675858).   Earlier in the day the Congressman spoke to a crowd of 1,100 at C-S-U in Fort Collins.  The crowd in Denver appeared to be just as big.   I'm just using common sense based upon what the "all options are on the table" phrase has meant in the past.   That's what that phrase means.  Obama is threatening to drop nuclear bombs on Iran to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon which they're not developing.   FYI: "All options are on the table" = I'm willing to drop nuclear bombs on civilians to achieve my political objectives.   And he said he did not understand how U.S. President Barack Obama is able to characterize Iraq as a free, stable and democratic country.   "What sort of Iraq we are talking about?" he asked. "How the Americans will feel proud? How the American administration is going to justify to the taxpayer the billion of dollars that has been spent and at the end of the day the American saying, 'Sorry, we have no leverage even to put things in order in Iraq'?"    Note the correction at the bottom of the article:  He opposes the Stop Online Piracy Act, not the Stop Online Privacy Act.   Check out the war/troops category.   "It's not about Ron Paul," McGrady says. "We don't think Ron Paul is infallible. It's the message. He's the only guy saying anything that anyone believes."   Only Ron Paul has confidence that capitalism will prevail. That should tell you all you need to know about the people running for president in the Republican Party these days.   Then you're not a libertarian.   Great point.   What a fucking outrage.   It's been confirmed that the six dead were U.S. Marines.   Newt wants to be our ages Disraeli; he is in fact its Eddie Haskell.   We're continuing to see **unacceptable levels of violence** inside that country, and so we will continue to consult very closely with Jordan to create the kind of international pressure and environment that encourages the current Syrian regime to step aside, Obama stated.  This from a guy that murders his fellow citizens.   I voted for Rick Perry.   See nixons-dog's comment below.   You and I may not agree with them  I do, mostly, **up to the part about allowing Iran to bomb Israel**  I wouldn't expect anything less from a writer for this rag.  How pathetic.   I agree.   Read this [article by Arthur Silber](http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com/2012/01/varieties-of-pissing.html). He cuts to the core of the argument that the corpse pissing is trivial compared to the greater war crime being perpetrated by the American empire.   For the rest of us in the liberal-minded citizenry, we would do well to recall that wars are initiated and sustained by leaders and governments, and by the powerful interests and passions that back them.   To vent frustration for this situation by easy condemnation of some young enlisted marines is a bit like pissing on corpses.    Great point.   A report on CNN contradicts the description of RP's house as a mansion: http://cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/politics/2012/01/13/jk-candidates-homes-kate-bolduan.cnn.html   Another great reason to vote for Ron Paul.   In a statement, **Romney called Bolton a staunch defender of US interests and values**, and said he would be consulting with him on foreign policy. Johns wisdom, clarity, and courage are qualities that should typify our foreign policy, Romney said.   Here's the full video: http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ddb_1326259280   Didn't see that.  Was x-posting from Lew Rockwell.   Great video attached to story.   Video at bottom of piece is worth watching.   Cognitive **dissonance**   Today, Guantanamo holds 171 prisoners and it's an odd mix. Thirty-six await trial on war crimes charges, including the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. There are 46 in indefinite detention as men the U.S. considers dangerous **but who cannot be charged for lack of evidence** or other reasons.   Yes, Obama the man who started a war in Libya without seeking approval from Congress has no ability to close a prison located at a U.S. military base.   Mr. Santorum then backed a move to have the state legislature provide the money. The outcome was that a provision tucked in a innocuous-sounding housekeeping bill **committed the state to lend the money in effect to the owners of the two teams, with an informal understanding it would not be paid back.** It wasnt and still hasnt been...   But I thought The Surge worked, right?   Sponsored by The Emergency Committee For Israel   Here single also went from [#32 to #20](http://www.billboard.com/#/charts/hot-100?begin=11 order=position).   Starts at about 27:21 of the video.   According to Santorum, the Israelis have a right to build settlements in the West Bank because the West Bank is ground "gained during war" following "an aggressive attack."   Why do you think your rivals label you as a fringe candidate?  They are incapable of shifting their opinions. They have been locked into economic planning. They have been locked into not worrying about privacy of individuals. Theyve been locked into foreign entanglements, and they cant really psychologically back away.   Paul was called back for something of an encore.   Why isn't this labeled as an opinion piece?  Paul is just unelectable. A Paul win could make the GOP Iowa electorate seem so out of step with the rest of the nation that is would raise the question of their future role in choosing presidential nominees.   This is where Richard Cohen is coming from:  "The intervention in Libya, a NATO operation but an American enterprise, succeeded. So did the ones in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Libyan bombings will not bring democracy to that country, but they knocked out Moammar Gaddafi, and that aint a bad days work."   **Hes very lenient on legalizing marijuana and drugs,** Al TeSlaa, a soybean, corn and cattle farmer from the small northwestern town of Rock Rapids, said when asked about Paul. **I dont know what hes thinking and why people are falling for that; if its the young people that are falling for that, that are thinking, Oh, man, legalizing marijuana and all drugs or whatever; oh man, were going to have a nice world. **   More than 60 people crowded into the shop's new Main Street location to hear Santorum speak.   Note the poll in the right column:  Who will win the Iowa Republican caucus?    Watched it.  Thanks for the recommendation.   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, also campaigning in South Carolina, said the United States should not rule out military force in removing Noriega because he "represents a threat to the Panama Canal."   I guess it's his [Muskie moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm5bxCoTEkc feature=related).   Well, then I guess the matter's closed.   How do they determine if someone is a "sympathizer?"   Todays Republican Party is dominated by Christian conservatives (44 percent of participants in the 2008 primaries identified themselves as evangelicals) and neoconservatives, who are united in their commitment to an unwavering alliance between the United States and Israel, confrontation with Iran, and a significant American presence in the Middle East. Pauls warnings about blowback directly threaten this consensus.   Obama won the Iowa caucuses.   Ron Paul is the perfect candidate for the bigots in this country. He is not like the racists who paraded in white sheets or the David Dukes who stated their allegiance to the ideas of Hitler.   For those who think we can sit around using drugs legally singing kumbaya, have a weak national defense throwing Israel under the bus and no government to protect its citizens Ron Paul is their candidate.   Never mind Paul being the favored candidate of the lunatic fringe (see white supremacists, anti-Semites, truthers, etc.).   **The Paul candidacy is of course doomed.** But the Paul vote won't die. This vote has been building in the depths of the American political ocean since the spending spree of the second Bush term.    Here is the money quote from Chuck Todd: Look, this is a game of where does Mitt Romey finish and where does Newt Gingrich, or maybe even an upset, a Rick Perry finish.  If any of those guys finish above Mitt Romney that are not named Ron Paul, that person will be, the quote, the winner out of here regardless of whether Ron Paul is the actual winner.  I hope somebody does a video w/ all of these statements about the caucuses essentially being meaningless if RP wins.  That could be very inspirational on the day before the voting.   Todd also states that RP has no appeal to economic conservatives.   RP comments begin at about 5:24.   On Tuesday, a delivery van carrying the document was blocked by about 200 protesters, forcing the vehicle to turn back.   Not according to [Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.tv/paul-hamas-was-started-by-israel/).   I guess to be a "decent American" I have to support torture, indefinite detention and aggressive wars.  Wow.   Does she even know who Ron Paul is?   Even his own supporters don't view him as having the best chance to beat Barack Obama.  Huh? I believe most RP supporters think he's the only one who can beat Obama.   RP's response: If they want to endorse me, theyre endorsing what I do or say  it has nothing to do with endorsing what they say, said Mr. Paul, who is now running strong in Iowa for the Republican nomination.   I hate to post this crap, but it's out there and everyone should be aware of it.   Yes.   Yes, b/c he could end it.   It's still creepy.   I just think it's kinda creepy to have the U.S. military tracking Santa.   [More Details](http://tdn.com/news/local/u-s-army-specialist-from-longview-killed-in-afghanistan/article_d9c6a87c-2d02-11e1-aa42-001871e3ce6c.html): A female Mark Morris High School graduate was shot and killed Wednesday in a guard tower in Afghanistan, according to the soldier's stepmother. U.S. Army Specialist Mikayla Anne Bragg is Cowlitz County's first casualty in a combat zone since the Vietnam War, according to Daily News archives.   There are no attempts at pandering to Iowa, no slaps at his GOP rivals or even President Obama. The lack of partisanship in Pauls speeches might help explain the broad and diverse coalition hes cobbling together here.   Watch the video.   Here are the stories from The Weekly Standard and HotAir:  Weekly Standard: http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/ron-paul-runs-defense-falls-apart_614657.html  HotAir:  http://hotair.com/archives/2011/12/22/paul-in-1995-say-have-you-read-my-newsletters/  In my view, the more people that watch the video the better.  My guess is that it will create more RP voters, not lose them.   How about this sentence from the article: "There is, of course, the matter of his past racism. And that raises the possibility that his opposition to social spending is motivated by racial resentment."   What exactly do Republicans stand for? Aggressive war, torture, Gitmo, big govt statism?  Why wouldn't Ron Paul, or any other rational person, be against that?   RP's Response: I dont have any specific response  People have challenged me on that all along and they should because it challenges people. I think the conventional wisdom of Washington is quite different than the conventional wisdom of the people, Paul said. I happen to think thats one of the reasons that Im rising in the polls, because the American people are tired of the wars and theyre tired of spending that money, so I think its a big positive political issue.   and national Republicans wouldn't think he represents the will of voters."  So if he gets the most votes, that wouldn't represent the "will of the voters?"   Drones are joysticked, not flown.   Disclosure foes argue that the need for secrecy is unquestioned in conventional wars. In World War II, they were killing people all over the place, with lots and lots of mis-hits, one official said. The civil liberties community wasnt saying we want to see targeting lists of what youre hitting. **George Washington did not turn over his targeting list of the British**.   There will be no Arab-style revolution. You can see that Kazakhstan is calm, he told Reuters by telephone. Kazakhstans entire multi-national population supports the head of state.    Yes, because as you know, I love socialism.   And those who collaborated with the Americans are also at risk of being targeted by the remnants of the Sunni al-Qaeda fighters, who have been systematically pursuing those who turned against them. Now that he has been stripped of the security that came with his position, Dulaimi said, I might be assassinated by terrorists at any time. He added, Who is going to protect me?   Obama is a warmonger.  Ron Paul is for peace.  How is Ron Paul "Obama on steroids?"   You cant make nice with the mullahs. They hate us, they hate everything about America. **They hate our lifestyle, they hate our faith.** They dislike us to the point that they would use a nuclear device first to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and **they consider Israel to be the little Satan, they consider us to be the big Satan.**   "Last night's debate likely halted his rise," said Tim Albrecht, communications director for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. "It remains to be seen if he'll slip, however, as his supporters remain the most stable and steadfast in terms of their support of Ron Paul."  I think this is wishful thinking on the GOP establishment's part.   So we have Mark Levin, Bill Bennett, Limbaugh, Hannity, Jeffrey Lord, Max Boot, Giuliani, Bill O'Reilly, Dick Morris, Nat'l Review, Commentary, Washington Examiner, and now Kimbery Strassel of the WSJ all launching similar attacks on RP w/in a 24-hour period.  How could this not be a coordinated attack?   Sadjadpour said some White House officials question whether **Iran is trying to provoke an Israeli strike** in order to rally support at home and abroad.   FDR's the dude who put [Mr. Sulu in a concentration camp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrpIFp7EMA), right?   What's a money ball?   According to Mr. Frum, apparently Ron Paul is pro-slavery:  Theres much to dislike about Ron Pauls politics, and I dislike every bit of it. (Its maybe remote from current concerns, but at a minimum, **I have no patience for a professed libertarian who openly prefers the slaveholding cause in the U.S. Civil War.**)   **Iraqi civilians were being killed all the time.** Maj. Gen. Steve Johnson, the commander of American forces in Anbar, in his own testimony, described it as **a cost of doing business.**   I think a proper follow-up question from Greta might be: Why do you think Ron Paul couldn't beat Obama?   There's another new NH poll that totally contradicts this poll: http://americanresearchgroup.com/pres2012/primary/rep/nh/   The war that began with the bang of shock and awe ended with the whimper of withdrawal with few of the issues solved. Many Americans are saying "good", while most Iraqis are saying good riddance.   This has to be a coordinated attack.  Hannity plays the racist newsletter card and then Bennett follows up with the 9/11 conspiracy lie used by Nat'l Review yesterday.   "We haven't gained anything from the country. They destroyed the country and now they are leaving."   [We're still there](http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-pursuing-legal-protections-for-contractors-still-in-iraq-1.163465), so your point is he lied?   This piece is actually pretty good w/ the exception of Max Boot and one of the callers calling RP a racist.   At a defense contracting company here this morning, Mr. Ginrich was asked by reporters about the events. **I have a very consistent record of opposing tax increases, and I dont think that people should break their word to raise taxes**, he said   No, not really.   Gingrich spoke at a crowded town hall at Insight Technologies, **a weapons maker** in Londonderry.   [Here are some gems of wisdom from the author in a blog post](http://hnn.us/node/139495): "These voters believe not only that unbridled capitalism will fix the debt/ deficit crisis, create jobs, and protect American freedoms, it will also fix our schools and hospitals, too. They believe the government should "get out of the way," deregulate the marketplace, slash taxes and spending, and let independent market forces do their job."   Paul presents himself as a man of principle and as an intellectual devoted to liberty, and his legions of fans love him for it. **While his personal integrity is beyond reproach, his intellectual views on liberty are pretty amateur.** He writes books on liberty, but they are little more than trite panegyrics to the nature of freedom, which he defines simply as the absence of government.   Of course the obligatory:  Nobody thinks Paul is going to win the Republican nomination. His antiwar, anti-interventionist views on foreign policy put him well out of the Republican mainstream. Some of his libertarian views  on the legalization of drugs, for example  led him into embarrassing statements in an early debate.   In recent days, the Republican presidential hopefuls have gone out of their way to express support for Israel. **The one exception has been Ron Paul**, who says he would zero out all US foreign aid, including Israels.   I'm trying to stir up anti-war sentiment.  It doesn't have much to do w/ Obama per se.   I wasn't implying that Obama was the first to take part in illegal interventions.  That goes back to at least the War of 1812, if not before.   The escalations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Uganda.  	199

I particularly liked "What, do you want to sing Kumbaya? This is business...get to it!" from the 10/4 episode.   Is it greedy for Fox to take a cut of American Idol record sales they helped generate? I don't think so. These shows make people famous/millionaires overnight. Not too much to ask  to take some profits back to pay bills.  I understand Cuban's point, though. Some entrepreneurs might not be in a position to give up additional equity, and the sharing clause deters them from being on the show.   Coming in unprepared.   Daymond is worse, in my opinion. He rarely invests and frequently talks down to entrepreneurs as if he's the king of everything.   More like 2.5 hours, according to Cuban.   Not necessarily. Viewers may like/buy the product, regardless of what the sharks say.   2% profit or 5% equity. Either way, being on the show increases sales sometimes 10-fold, so might be worth it.

 Look at Portland, OR. No fluoride, beautiful, friendly city.   Take a guess.   Games are my passion. I love games because they are a powerful way to give someone an EXPERIENCE.  The encompass everything that movies have, charactors, story, visual effects, audio, music, lighting, etc.  AND they allow the person experiencing them to interact with the game world as if they are part of it.  The are the best outlet for my creativity short of dreaming (which unfortunately I can't share (yet =P ) ).   Like skipping? Try spicking! A combination of skipping and spinning, it is over twice as fun as normal skipping and still 63% as efficient as normal walking!   Let's take skipping back!   So invoking your rights gives cause to assume you are a criminal?!   My dog is terrified! I found her hiding under the stereo system when I got home.   Organized atheism is just another religion! I don't care how much you down vote me, it's still true!   Y tu Mamma tambien.   Atheism is just another religion.   Why do you think it is more difficult now?   We need to simply dissolve the system by no longer participating in it.  Reorganize in hyper-local and online communities.  Do not pay taxes.  Reduce your reliance on currency.  Produce yourself everything that you can.   I will never understand the supposed correlation of liking bright colors and liking dick up the a..   I took a course on Unity3D a few months ago and I'm now employed as a game programmer.  Note, I do have about 3 years professional coding experience.   You are definitely on the right track.  Learning to program IS the most important thing if you want to program games.  C# is good next move.  I recommend downloading Unity3D now and start C# programming with that.  This will get you creating games right away!  Have fun and good luck!   What a beautiful human being.   just did a ctrl+F "club" and downvoted all matches.   Education should be free and available to everyone, regardless of wealth or test scores.  All that's should be required is a desire to learn.  If we spent a tiny fraction on the amount we do on war, we could accomplish this.  We also need to remove the corrupt influence of business and self-serving politicians from the education system.  This would lift our society up more than anything we've ever tried.   Are you seriously arguing that we shouldn't increase the accessibly of education because some people still might not be able to afford it?!  So we should perhaps make it more difficult for "the 50%" to even things out? The more educated our society is the better off we will be, and indeed the more equality will ultimately see.   Why do atheists need billboards to proclaim their nonbelief? To somehow even things out?  It is absurd.  It is everyone's right to choose what they believe or don't believe. You DO NOT have to act all butthurt because your belief is not the most popular one.   That's some original thought you've got there.   Christians sometimes DO deride people for not believing what they believe. As do some atheists.    Your comment makes me reflect my own thought process, and for that you have an upvote.

If I'm watching Weeds I really want to watch the opening because a different band covers the opening theme in each episode.  Also there NEEDS to be an option to turn off auto play so you can watch an ep while you fall asleep.   What I don't understand about /atheism is why there seems to be a false dichotomy between Christians and Atheists, as if those are the only two options and that the Christian view of God is the only possible one.  Many people have belief in something they call "God" which bears no resemblance to the spiteful, meddling Man in the sky.  It seems like a straw-man argument to me.   uh.. you're thinking of Israel?   Annyong.   Saying "Guns don't kill people, people kill people." is like saying"Toasters don't toast toast. Toast toasts toast."   Did they just show the ending of the movie in the trailer?   Other ways to make your life not suck so much: 1. Live with other people and split up the division of labor so you don't have to shop, cook, and clean as often 2. Shop at a food co-op where the people are friendlier and less dead 3. Better yet, start a garden and grow your own food 4. Bike to work 5. Don't work a mind-numbing job for 50 hours a week 6. Weed   Think of the buttloads of debt you are not getting yourself into!

I had a phone stolen while I was dancing a show.  When I got home, I got on my computer logged into Lookout and saw the phone was about 45 minutes away in a park.  I drove there and then it showed up as being in a house. I decided to come back in the morning and the phone registered as being in between two houses, so I went to each of them and rang the bell.  The first one was a Mom of two teenagers who swore her kids were no where near a club the night before.  The second one was an older lady.  I persuaded her to let me borrow her computer so I could show her where the phone was located.  Finally, she gave me her phone and I called my phone. We heard it ringing in the neighbor's yard next door! (The Mom of the teenagers).  I went back there and the Dad went around to the backyard and retrieved my phone.  The screen was cracked but it was still functional.  It had been locked out from too many pattern lock attempts.  I think someone tried to get it and got fed up so they threw it over the fence into these people's yard.  Amazing that I got it back, and it served me well for another year until I dropped it in my dog's water bowl.   Thanks for your reply!

Actually I have met indigenous people in Ecuador and I have been to rain forests and seen first hand how the last bastions of a way of life are being destroyed in the face of a self-replicating system gone mad.  Thinking about more ecosystem destruction, more death and more extinction, more displaced people breaks my heart.  "What's the problem?" Are you seriously asking that question?   It is a not a criticism of Ecuador or even of China, but a criticism of a system in crisis.  Yes, Western nations have built up their wealth through the decimation of natural resources, [edit] both [/edit] domestic and abroad.  But this does not mean we should simply sit back and allow the rest of our planet's resources to be destroyed because "they did it first."  This is like raiding a store with the justification that other people have shoplifted.  We need to start thinking GLOBALLY and LONG-TERM if we are to have a future on this planet.   Pretty trees? How about life-sustaining oxygen and ecosystems?! Do you realize that 50% of the worlds plant and animal species live in rain forests?  Your perspective is severely misinformed.   How can we stop this?!   No. This is actually about 1/3 of the Ecuadorian rain forest.  Not all of Ecuador is covered in rain forest.   I was contesting the claim that intuition is a "dangerous idea".  My position is that intuition is real and can point people in the right direction when pursuing truth.  Intuition is the acquisition of information through unconscious sources. I qualify this by saying that although (or "but") it is a legitimate way of moving towards truth, it is not sufficient to serve as evidence in a legal context.  Accepting that hunches can contain truth, they still do not make good evidence because a person could simply be lying about their hunch.  The data which leads to the hunch is not readily available for the public scrutiny because it is very much a personal experience.   Intuition is a real and scientifically-studied phenomenon, but obviously it alone shouldn't serve as evidence.    lmao. keep trying there are a few good apples.

Our society seems to have some sort of obsession with distilling and removing natural medicines from nature, often with unintended consequences.

How can you benefit from the effects of a drug without actually experiencing the effects of the drug?   No new drugs need to be developed.  It is already here and has been for thousands of years.

The effects should be mostly beneficial however. =) Also be aware that you may develop a tolerance, and the "specialness" of the experience may subside.  I suggest limiting yourself to monthly for now, since you are a new psychonaut.  Your psyche needs time to adjust to things you will find out about yourself and the universe.  Have fun and peace!   That's pretty much exactly what I was trying to express.  I wonder when this pattern was first conceived of by human beings.   Wikipedia is tertiary source (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_source).  It's useful for getting a brief overview of a topic, but you can't use it to back up claims. You can however follow the links in wikipedia to the primary and secondary sources that ARE legitimate.  Notice my nuanced position.   I love Omegle!         Where did he write this? I would like to read it.   bout 5. still pretty dirt cheap if you've got the hookup.  but i think our shit is way weaker and you probably need at least 3 or 4 hits to get what you had.  hippies were the spiritual successors of the Burner/new agers. keeping the fire alive.   Music = vibrations = life. I'll just say that sexual pleasure and spiritual fulfillment are not mutually exclusive. I support your aspiration of spreading peace and goodness through music!   i'm really curious to read the trip report but also am not going to create an account on drugs-forum.  please copy and paste the text here.         nice, you're a meme  	100
 Is this true?  If yes, one of the most horrifying images I've ever seen.   I'll be interested in informed responses to this question, but I've read that Oscar Wilde could read two pages at a time, one with each eye.    Thank you for your comment and sincere apologies if I am incorrect.    Please read the artist's statement:  "With "Tears of Nanjing" I want to show my deepest sympathy and love for all those totally innocent people who were perished so unjustifiably and with outmost cruelty, but also I want to remind the Japanese leaders that as long as they do not want to face the history, humanity cannot and will not possibly forgive and forget". (Gene Emerson)      Pavel Lisitsian.   One of my favorite operas, Ariadne auf Naxos by Strauss! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VugbX5UgrLY   In fact, R-K's opera fueled the "Salieri poisoned Mozart" rumor, inspiring Shaffer's play.   Aloe gel, let it dry. Then try some coconut oil or olive oil and let it soak in.   The first performance of the 4 Last Songs occurred after Strauss' death.  He wrote these most beautiful songs with Kirsten Flagstad's voice in mind, and she premiered the songs with Furtwngler in 1952. Many critics consider their live collaboration to be the finest of all recorded performances of these songs.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is wretched, but one can hear the magnificent interpretation in spite of the poor sound.   Thank you brocket66 for this post.  4 Last Songs are the ultimate, final flowering of the German Romantic tradition.   Abendempfindung by Mozart (try Schwarkopf).  Too many to count by Schubert, but try Gretchen am Spinnrade, Erlknig, An Sylvia, Die Taubenpost, Litanei aus dem Fest, Nacht und Trume, and so many more (he wrote over 600.) Many Russian romances by Tchaikovsky, including Amid the din of the ball, None but the lonely hearts, Why, The fires in the room were dying out.  Richard Strauss' Four last songs.        	12

I started using them recently and no longer have this problem!   There was minimal brake fade, I applied the brakes for a few seconds at a time to give them time to cool off in between.

 You can see at 1:22 he did the same trick but the camera was lower. Coin or ring, or whatever it was, was on the back of the hand the whole time.   At 3:20 they kept the camera low so you couldn't see that he had already put the ring on top of her hand. At 1:22 the camera was higher so you can see the ring was up there all along. Good sleight of hand though that he can drop a ring on the back of someone's hand while moving it without them noticing it.   I doubled yours, but LabVIEW crashed when I tried to add an indicator on the end.   Oh. My. God.   You look awesome. That is such a huge change. I dropped just under a hundred total a few years ago and have done pretty good at keeping it off, but keeping the momentum is toughest during stressful parts of your life. Keep the before pictures as reminders of why you're doing what you're doing, and keep up the amazing work.   Casey really looks like he wants to shoot Brad Pitt.   I have a cool picture I got of my dad when he passed away four years ago. I still haven't put it on Reddit.   I wonder the same thing. Maybe I just see the problem because I'm the problem, or maybe I'm playing the blame game with myself. I don't know. I can tell you that her ambivalence to the issue isn't going to assuage my remorse. I'm as dedicated to it today as I was four days ago. It was a petty way to spend a likely cumulative two or three hours a day, and I can be so much better than that.     Wow. What an open and compassionate group. Replace masturbating with working out and that's okay, but if I, someone with a career who pays his bills, takes care of his wife, plays with his kid, get's her to bed on time and than has two hours between her bed time and the time when my wife get's home, decides to spend those two hours playing Minecraft (after doing my push-up, sit-up, pull-up, dips, squats regimen, mind you) I'm a teenager who's replacing one addiction with another. Jesus, where does it stop? What hobby is it okay to have as a hobby that doesn't require me join an anonymous club so I stop doing it?    Are you implying I'm a teenager? I don't see the point of your comment.   Add me.  Edit: I'm still playing Madden 25, just for the record.   I did. It was awkward. She said she doesn't see a problem that's affecting us since we're still having regular sex when we can, given our schedules and the baby. But she told me I can do whatever, if I want to quit, she's not going to stop me.   Fairly underwhelming considering the stress I had built up worrying about telling her.   For coming out on the XBox One on day two of no fapping. This'll be a breeze.   Oh my god, that background color. I read the whole thing now every page I look at looks blue.   Holy shit. I promise not to make this sub my daily journal, but wow. 26 hours in. I did great yesterday during the day and evening. But once the kid was asleep and my wife was still at work (she's a second shifter) things got tough. I'll spare you the grimy details, but I'll just say, my arms are tired. From push-ups. From dips. From preacher curls (more left than right, gotta even these forearms back out.) I also did a shit ton of sit-ups and squats, pretty much anything I could do in the apartment that involved not fapping. I also got a ton of work done. Worked on the decorations for the first b-day party that's coming up, got some code written for a project at work that's a little stagnant, some other stuff. But absolutely no fapping. The toughest part was that porn used to be a reward for myself. Oh look, I finished this, better look at some porn and take care of business. Now I have to figure out other rewards to take the place of it. Working out is kind of a reward, I guess. To keep this up I'll need to find other things.   I really respect the people on here that have 100 or 200 days. It can't be easy. Hell, I respect the people that have 3 or 4 days.    Not claiming quality. As a cert'd welder running a team of guys I'd never allow it. But, the comment said it couldn't be done, not that it couldn't be done well.    I've been paying alot of attention to porn. Like, alot. Masturbation is a four or five times a day thing for me. It got much worse after my wife got pregnant, but my daughter is almost one. That means for more than a year and a half I've been masturbating daily, numerous times. Instead of getting work done (I'm a software engineer), instead of playing with my daughter, instead of making sure my wife knows how beautiful and sexy she is. Today it ends. The half hour bathroom sessions with my computer on my lap, done. Long morning showers, no more. Staying up late after everyone else is asleep and doing it in the living room, never again.   I'm anxious for sure. I've been up for an hour and this is a usual fap time for me. I used to rub one out before heading off to work while everyone else was sleeping. This morning I left the blinds open when I came out to the living room. We're in a first floor apartment, so yanking it out with them open would lead to a quick phone call to the police. My plan is that hopefully the threat of that keeps me from making the decision to just do it.   I'm in ladies and gentlemen. And holy shit is this difficult.    In, no porn, no masturbation. Goal: Quit excessive pornography and start paying attention to my wife. I'm starting two days late, and I've only been up for a half an hour and I'm already jonesing a little.    Awww, we feel super bad about it. Oh wait, it's the internet, we don't care.  (Also, I upvoted you for spite.)   If you took a piece of non-ferrous metal and using a super-hot ray gun and a chunk of filler material join it to a piece of ferrous metal you'd be arrested and tossed in jail for blowing /u/ross340's mind.   Educate yourself.  [Re-think your welding knowledge](http://youtu.be/YEQ0dL4R-rQ)   Congratulations. You have hit the nail on the head of why so many text-based programmers hate LabVIEW. Enforcing dataflow doesn't come naturally to people learned in text-based lanuages. Sometimes neither does handling errors. Hence they use what looks like the easiest way to enforce a sequence. VIOLA!!! A nasty sequence structure is born. Tens or hundreds (yes, I've seen it) of sequences, all thrown together when a simple error terminal would've done the trick.   Consider yourself past the hard part.    Lorenzo gets his shoulder down too.   Q-Tips and rubbing alcohol.   Needs more Sail   Like a NES cartridge, right?   Yep, another one of LabVIEWs secret .vis that you'll only ever discover reading white paper, or browsing vi.lib.   Try mine. It works just fine. Why wouldn't you just put the whole array in as a variant? The first .vi I call there "VariantType.lvlib:Get Array Info.vi" gets the array info from out of a variant. You can get the number of dimensions, the datatype of the array, and the dimension lengths.   [Well, you could do this...](http://i.imgur.com/HP2hHQm)  Variants will let you pass in whatever type you want and cast the variant to that type. You have to be careful though and handle errors, in case someone passes in an unsupported type (i.e., if it's not an array of something, this will throw an error. In essence, you're hiding the typecast.   [Here is how it would be called.](http://i.imgur.com/TLyO09T)  Edit: And also, in essence, you're still duplicating the code, just within the case structure. Someone else might have a way to do it without so much duplication, I don't, it's 6AM.   Can you give us a screenshot or post the code? I'm not quite sure I understand what you're getting at.   I'm sorry, but what are you going to do with 10-30 seconds of notice? It would take you that long to figure out what was going.   It's base-10 logarithmic. A 7 has 10 times as much ground movement at the epicenter, than a 6. If you're talking about the energy released though it is 31.62 times more energy than a 6. But yes, I understand that there have been (much) more powerful earthquakes than this. However, when placed in retrospect with the two tornadoes I've lived through I would much prefer this to that.   25 of them so far, 2.4 or lower. I think we're safe.   Glad it's just your shit and not you.   I'm excited that I got my cherry popped. so there's that.   Note to self. Buy a desk.   But, seems to be the worst since the 'worst'. At least in the Bay area.    My Kansas safety mode was to hold tight in bed. If I didn't hear tornado alarms, I don't know what to do apparently.   I feel your pain. Wife and baby are happily snoring. I'm /r/nosleep for the rest of the night.    Shit. All IKEA here, I'm fucked.   Can confirm, didn't knock my bike over in Novato.   Yeah, good to hear lifetime Californians at least woke up from it. I'm from Kansas and I guarantee I'm done sleeping tonight.    Nope, never felt THAT before. I'd think I'd remember it.    Not afraid, just full of adrenaline. Pretty shitty way to wake up.   Can confirm. KS transplant for 3 years now. Fuck is all scared out.   Although, if that's the worst, I'll take that over dodging tornados.   Can confirm. 20 seconds of WTF in Novato. I'm from KS since 3 years ago, so yeah, /r/nosleep for me now. At least with tornado's there'd be a storm I was sleeping through or something.   Honestly, if that's the worst you can throw at us, I'll take that over the tornado's I was dodging three years ago in Kansas any day.   Yeah, moved from Kansas 3 years ago. That was my first. I'm in Novato and ain't no chance in sleeping now. Edit: USGS has it centered in American Canyon at a 6.0.   Yeah, moved from Kansas 3 years ago. That was my first. I'm in Novato and ain't no chance in sleeping now. Edit: USGS has it centered in American Canyon at a 6.0.   Yeah, moved from Kansas 3 years ago. That was my first.

I'm in Novato and ain't no chance in sleeping now.  Edit: USGS has it centered in American Canyon at a 6.0.   Uninstall and reinstall it. I had this problem and that fixed it.   My wife donated her breast milk to a baby (Riley) in my daughters playgroup for the last four months because Riley was both allergic to everything (dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, and corn) and to her own mother's milk. She was also diagnosed with failure to thrive. She has slowly made gains, but she is almost 14 months now and still only in the 3rd percentile for development. I know you're probably going through some tough stuff right now, but make sure you remember to focus on what's really important, your family's love, and not on the issues that you're working through. One thing I noticed with Riley was that she has made the most significant leaps forward when her family life was relaxed and unstressed and the biggest steps backwards when the stress and panic levels start to rise. If you need anything at all man, we're here for you.   Ain't that the truth. There are lots of days where I'm having just as much fun playing as she is. Good on you for showing him what really matters in this part of his life, good fun and good family time.    Immediately thought of the same thing. Like, I haven't heard the song in years, but I can't hear the name Craig without going, oh, Craig Christ?    To be more clear, the Nintendo Entertainment System (an 8-bit system) had an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors could be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette was NTSC rather than RGB with a resolution of 256x240. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen, although many devs tried to push that number with various levels of success.    So, I had a USB drive in my XBox which I loaded games and apps onto from the One. I downloaded the app, unplugged that USB and plugged it into my computer, it's not recognized. Do I need two pieces of removable media? Can't I put it all on the same thing?   Yep, almost 1 year old here. Rocking in the rocking chair for night-time bottle and story. Backs of the heels, meet my nuts. Thanks dear, no sister for you.   Hope he went a few blocks over and got some Arthur Bryant's.    And than Arthur Bryants.   Keep your head up. Be there for her and the rest of your family. Keep being an awesome dad.      Read some stuff. Start with the horrible movie books so you can see that his books are so much better than pop culture has portrayed them. Starship Troopers is a good intro to how he weaves his political views into great sci-fi stories.   Or Heinlein?   Right. I missed the 25 year thing and kept wondering, why are there no Heinlein books on here?   Thank you. My life was about to be forever parenthetical.    No need to be kind, just be honest. Looking good and noticeably on your way to looking smoking hot.   Don't get down on yourself for the loose skin right now. You look amazing and are on your way to being a healthy version of yourself.    I'm not against the free-market or people succeeding in life. But how the hell do we live in a society where this is a necessary invention? When did we get to a point where remembering your phone takes a higher priority than remembering your baby/infant/toddler?   I heard about the deaths and it stunned me when people on FB started talking about steps to take to help not forget your child. One person suggested leaving something in the backseat that you'd never forget, like, your phone or your shoe. I read that and thought, hmm... what's something I could put in the backseat that I'd never forget... OH, yeah, my child. Are you kidding me? The only thing I can think is that these people intentionally left their children in the backseat thinking it was okay and than when confronted, came up with the 'I forgot' story, because I don't think I could live in a world where I truly thought that this many people could actually forget they had a baby in the backseat.   Snow Day. I don't know why. I'm 36 years old, still love it.   Replace Crazy, Stupid, Love with A Place Beyond The Pines for the tragedy version.   Pick nose...  You delicately insert your lockpick into your nose until your brain begins hemorrhaging, instantly killing you.   How many times are you going to say that in this thread? As many days as Bill Murray re-lived?   I thought you were asking why everyone says "Goodfellas" when you see a steady-cam shot. Yes, it was used well in Goodfellas, but's it's been used well in other movies. I think my most enjoyable steady-cam shot is in "Swingers" when they're making fun of "Reservoir Dogs" ripping off the "Goodfellas" steady-cam shot while doing the exact same thing.    Ahhh, old Fronty Backsies. I love that place.   It's not. They're just assholes. There's no carpool lane there for another 8 miles or so.   One of the company's that does this is named Ocean Sound. How do I know? Yes, I used to sell shitty speakers out of the back of white vans. When I was 18, it was great money. We paid 25 bucks a set and sold them for whatever we could get. One or two sales a day was all you needed. Get five big ones in a day, take a week off. But my morals got the better of me after 3 or 4 months. Still, yeah, don't buy them unless you talk them down to under 50 bucks a piece.    WH:SM for the One?   Was that when you started running your air conditioner for the summer? I found that re-calibrating with the A/C and a fan running at the same time really helped.   I stand directly in front of the XBox saying it. I finally break down and reach the last six inches to press the 'X' with my finger.   Yeah, when I fought him I was teamed up with a couple of Titans and I was a Hunter. They handled the ground crew while I disassembled the Prime with my sniper.    I'm really surprised that you got all of those timelapses done without a single other person coming to dip their balls in it.   I like the second guy that runs after the car once he realizes that he's way faster than the first guy running after the car.   Good idea shopping the 1 out of the speedometer.    It was a fight with our nine-month old when she was five months old. But things are great now. The solution. The dreaded cry it out. Sorry, I know it's not what you wanted to hear. My daughter was an angel during the day but when bed or nap time came she turned into a terror. One night we decided to just do it. It was midnight before we were all asleep after starting at her normal bedtime of 6:30. But she finally did it. After a few weeks or so it was second nature, bottle, jammies, bed, sleep. We also had to play the cry it out game when she wouldn't take a bottle too, and went ten hours without eating before she acquiesced.    I wonder if it feels any different.    Check out the pumping bra. You'll forget about every ounce of sexiness in preggo gear ever again.   Invite a friend over, have him park the same distance behind his van.    I wish I had more than one upvote to give you. Teaching yourself to brake properly (a.k.a. using both front and rear brakes) is much safer, and that is the proper procedure for braking on any motorcycle on asphalt.   Yeah, its getting so hard to find good charities these days. Good luck, and good on you for helping her be a good human being. Your doing a great job as a dad right now.   That's awesome, so good to see people helping their children learn  to be a good human being.  On that note, please research the foundation your donating to. Locks of love does not (last I looked) do anything with the hair except make wigs and sell them (not to people who need them) and than gives a small percentage to cancer research. Wigsforkids.org or Pantene's Beautiful Lengths are both good organizations.   The watermelone and grape soda? Yeah, I was thinking the same thing...   The throwing knife is awesome. With the right armor I can melee one enemy, almost immediately throw the knife to kill the next guy, and than pop a third guy in the head with the sniper I have equipped. Great when you're doing some camping and get snuck up on from behind.   Got the second one, first one seems used already too. Thanks America, Fuck Yeah.   As the title says, I've had a few clients now that I've taken to my own and stopped working for the man. But I'm new to website development, and I've found myself asking similar questions to these clients each time, or I'm missing vital information that I don't realize I'm missing until I'm a third of the way into the project. Was just wondering if any of you had any boilerplate solutions for the new client situation that you'd be willing to share that have helped ensure you're getting most of the neccesary details right up front.   Obviously, there's no one size fits all case here. I'm just looking for something that fits 90% of all of my applications.   I like Neal Stephenson (Diamond Age, Zodiac, etc...) William Gibson (Neuromancer, Idoru,) Sean McMullen (Greatwinter Trilogy,) and Storm Constantine (Wraeththu Chronicles.)   Recommend me something new that'll keep me entertained. I like series of books or books that keep me busy for a while.   Thanks in advance.      Is there a thread (or sub) for this already? I've started making some custom tracks and I'd love to get some peoples opinions of them.    A friend of mine and I have been trying to motivate each other to get into shape and over lunch we both go for a jog together. She wasn't at work today and instead of sitting at my desk and eating a donut (which is what I would've done not too long ago) I got up and went for a jog at lunch anyway.   I had a customer that needed a search algorithm that fit well for the golden search algorithm. Here's my implementation of it; [SNIPPET](http://i.imgur.com/uKrYlch.png?1)   The basic idea is that we change 'N' until an analog measurement is within a specific range. The poly equation is representative of the type of output we can expect in respect to 'N'. The equation isn't guaranteed though, or I'd just reverse poly to find 'N'. Feel free to comment on implementation or things I could have done better or differently.       Played a bunch of matches tonight with Endless, Oberon, Pilot, Taurotragus, and Inkarnatax21. Good times were had.   I probably played the worst three attrition matches of my life, but still had fun, leveled up a few times, tried out some new stuff, found a few good runs from the other guys, and got a few pointers. I also really enjoyed finally playing with a team that would talk. Knowing what was going on and who was where made LTS, CTF, and Hardpoint all that much more fun to play and easier to win.   Thanks for the good times guys, see ya this weekend.   They already have the animation from the campaign so why not?   Admittedly. Not much. I've played through both sides and missed 90-95% of the story. If it wasn't missing the talking during the match, than I was missing the storyline stuff while fiddling with loadout/burn cards, etc...  But, as I was re-playing as the IMC, I did notice once thing. It's looking like most new players are jumping right into the campaign. This slots them into the Militia (I'm assuming everyone plays Militia first). By the time they've finished the Militia campaign, they've leveled up, gotten a bit more comfortable with the controls, learned the maps a bit, maybe went out and played the standard modes some, and than come back and joined the IMC. It's almost like training for the side that would have some sort of training regimen in place. Granted, it's a small detail, but it made me go, "Huh." when I realized it.  Thoughts?  EDIT: Seems like I was wrong and it randomly places you as Militia or IMC. So much for my thinking, it just always seemed like the IMC pilots were all level 10 or above and I was seeing lots of single digit level Militia pilots during the campaign.   Well, it was bound to happen. I was kicked by a Spectre, that's what I get for trying to get close enough to hack me an army of robots.   I've been playing pretty much non-stop since they opened the beta and saw slow-down once when there were 5 titans on screen at the same time. Other than that, I haven't seen any buggy glitches or crazy server wait times or weird problems.   Anyone seen anything, or does anyone know if they've been going crazy behind the scenes?      So, I thought I'd put this here instead of anywhere else on here so it would get some real answers, but, how do you handle something like what Richard Sherman did after the championship game tonight? Here's the link in case you missed it. [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7UPXzHShpc)   I want my daughter to be able to watch sports, but as I sat there watching the game with my 9 and 7 year old nephews I wondered to myself, what do I tell them about how much of an ass this guy is? From their point of view they thought it was cool the way he acted and than of course, having it re-played a hundred times only made it seem cooler each time.   So, dads of reddit. What do you do about the sore losers and how do you explain to your sons or daughters that even though it may look cool, it isn't?      So my wife went back to work last Monday after her three months off, post-birth. My mom is flying in this Sunday to be a nanny for us while we figure out daycare stuff. That meant these last two weeks I've got to spend plenty of quality time with my daughter. The only downside was she's not been too keen on the bottle. Other than that she's got a fairly structured schedule now, is working on her push-ups and rollovers, can sit up now, and I feel fairly confident that I'm getting a 'Daddy' out of her tomorrow.  Not sure how often the men get this much bonding time this early on, but I gotta say, it's been awesome. Anyone else get to experience this and how did it go for you?  	106
 that is cognitive dissonance right there.   unless someone else is around to toast them for me.   how about estate sales?   how about you make tacos? one side for the filling and the other for the tortillas.  	4
    He must be writing the trombone part    Well..... welcome to reddit i guess.      Zoids. It was a really underrated show on cartoon network and a lot of people I know have never even heard of it. Probably because it was on at like 5:30 in the morning. Maybe it could get some sort of following after being on Netflix.   	5

 BARK BARK POW! Agent Dog has shot me straight through the heart. I am in love. Also, possibly dying.   I want a Gun Dog Series. Might I suggest some titles?  Agent Gun Dog- A Hero's Path. Agent Gun Dog- To Protect and Serve. Agent Gun Dog- Sentinel Against The Unknown.    It seems like Latin, but I get "I will cut you?" I see others translating it as "I will kill you" and that makes far more sense. Lets go with that.   Succubus maybe? Bit of advice, never give a ghost permission to touch your naughties.   I don't think there's much I can do- I have work and responsibilities just like everyone else...I'm sure it's just some subconscious thing. I hope so. I've never actually thought much of it, until it started getting close to the date. Your idea of it marking an event is really intriguing.      	5
    We still have this at uni, slaves get sold and in the following days (or weeks) they work to earn back their own cost. Drink a bucket of beer and you're in the club!   Always stayed in Wenduine  De Haan as a kid, an I loved the dunes! Usually a lot less windy than the beach and great for picnics... There's a little pancake house in the dunes in the middle between Wenduine and De haan, if you just keep following the coastline you can't miss it!   Very definitely a boy   His owner is brother Kenny so he must have some kind of ranking ;)         We regularly started getting these really boring guest lectures from the same woman all the time... Our professor ditched his wife for her a couple months after. Mystery solved!   'I've got an itch' Not something i'm gonna help you with mate   Maybe she just has a wide-set vagina and a heavy flow. She can't help it.   If I cook the same meal for all of us, or just leave one ingredient out for him, it's fine. But when I make goulash (for example) which is completely based on the beef stewing in the brew, I have to make him a completely separate meal...   That's what I usually do, but then sometimes I feel like having a steak or a beef stew and I don't know what to give him apart from our sides for example...  Thanks for te recipes though, i'll definitely try the fajitas! :-)   My dad recently became a vegetarian again after 10 years of eating meat. This is all very well and I support him, but the man can't cook a meal to save his life. I go to uni full time and take on the cooking at home - prefer to make everything from scratch.   My dad being a vegetarian adds 15-20 minutes of cooking every day. I try to make vegetarian dishes we all enjoy as much as possible, but my sister, mother and I do enjoy our meat. Meat and three veg for my dad often comes down to a fried egg and three veg.   He won't eat tofu, seitan or quorn and I'm honestly getting a little desperate here! Any tips are welcome :-)   Get her a nice designer watch or a pair of shades, usually around 300-400$ , leaves you some money for flowers!(and a little baby bottle of laurent perrier!) If you wanna spend that money on your girlfriend, go for it!   Add butter. That's it.   To be honest, the easiest thing is to determine during the school year which of your classmates has the bulkiest handwriting and sit diagonally behind them. There's 100-300 people in my university class and not that many supervisors...   Or holding waitstaff to a standard of a michelin star restaurant when you're at a diner... Newsflash: these people are probably not looking for a career in waiting, shut up and eat your pancakes   Had this on bread at the christmas market in germany, maybe for the ease of eating without sitting down?   Staff being rude, be it to me or to a total stranger at a different table   smoking pot can have terrible side effects like not being able to shut the fuck up about smoking pot  	20
    Not soapboxing! Honestly curious how we are able to have zoos ethically                        But I love the Bucks...  Idk why but they are my East coast team.  They play with amazing style.  I have made alot betting on them because the critics give the spread so high against the Bucks...  Have pride in your team because I give you 2 years to be a contender.                   I like things like free grand slams on your bday at Dennys... What are some other tricks we should know?  Redbox promo codes, free food,  etc?       What are some of his most important works to read?                   What exactly are numbers?  My professor and I were in discussion about them and he implied that numbers are entities separate from physics,  math,  and science.  We *use* them and apply them but math in itself doesn't imply truth...  Have you heard this and can someone explain his logic?       I heard that we need to reorganize our theory of gravity.  Is this true?  If so,  what does this mean and why?                I can't seem to get back into the school groove.  What are some study tips and habits?    It seems as if the US just said fuck that crisis over there as Russia continues to wage war when at the beginning,  the US was threatening action.  The timing of ISIS seems to perfect.  Could Russia have helped the start this secretly?    Serious question. I want to know if someone passes away in law enforcement, it looks like everyone that's a  cop attends.  Who is patrolling or working? Wouldn't this be the time to do a crime?       I have thought for the last couple years that Westbrook deserves his own team like the Celtics and then build around him. I just don't like how Westbrook is a 2nd option. Do you think that he should have him own team?    Hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed losing to this.  kt is incredible.    I pointed this out a few weeks ago.  ruby just collected his 7th technical of the season.  For a guy with a usually quiet demeanor,  this has been a big sign of him changing.  What do you think has happened?  We can't afford both our stars collecting 20+ techs a season. Ruby never got techs like this before this season.                IMO Jason Thompson gets a lot of crap as a starting PF.  He has been a staple on our defense and has improved throughout the years.  He has been the longest standing King on the team and is amazing in the community. Relatively humble and hasn't had attitude problems.   There is not one person on the that we have tried to replace more then him.  He has outplayed numerous candidates like T-rob,  Landry,  Patterson, Evans and Acy. Always been a fan but I believe he deserves more credit.        Literally that.             Link right here         Jus for kix      Ayyyyyyyy                  I want to help out the community and environment .  I am interested in planting trees,  feeding the homeless, etc.  I have checked out habitat for humanity but got no response. If anyone knows of anything,  please let me know.    I have started growing in my meditation and knowledge and continue to grow.  my SO is interested in meditating and Buddhism with me but I feel uncomfortable with it.  I feel like it is my thing for myself and a mental release.  I also feel I have only been learning for a few months.  I feel it would make us closer but still hesitant. How do you guys deal with this? Any advice?       These crackahs wanna here a story.    I am having issues adjusting to bar chord transitions and barring the strings.  Any good websites,  videos or tips!?    Source.    He is rich and I am on Reddit circlejerk.    On the Kings and why?                      Let us put this in perspective..  Elevator is broken...  That is why you are trapped..      I understand how they go out of business..  Lack of revenue.  But I don't really understand how you have cities like Atlantic city going under and whole companies like Caesars Entertainment going under. Are people not gambling?  Why the sudden crash when the economy is on the come up?      I love your guys posts here and everyone is so informing. There is a new sub /r/sharingreligion that is curious about people's testimonies and stories. It is an awesome way to spread the word. Just wanted to thank you guys!

Just wanted to thank you guys!    Growing up I had a family of 5 including myself.  My mother and father were divorced and very bitter people.  My mother was a Irish Catholic who drank often and suffered from emotional issues.  My father was a military Protestant who was semi abusive.  I was very rebellious growing up but fairly intelligent.  I read frequently and often pondered about philosophy and science. I was not forced into church except Easter of course for the grandma.  I was involved with partying and fighting in high school while being involved with the wrong crowd.  I eventually met a girl who introduced me to a christian church. I loved the fellowship and was engulfed with positive emotion.  I eventually did mission trips and became proactive in the church. My relationship with this girl seized and I focused on Jesus.  I eventually met a girl who I just loved.  Only issue was she was very immersed deep into the ranks at the church.  We started dating and this caused a mini uproar.  I was reprimanded, chastised,  tormented and disrespected by church officials for this relationship. Hypocrisy oozed out faster than I could have imagined.  Eventually I left my position as a youth group leader,  Bible study leader and Sunday school teacher because of this. I turned my back on religion because I realized that religion is made by people for people.  Dogma is just that... dogma. I eventually went back to reading my philosophy.  Nietzsche, Kafka,  Kant,  Schopenhauer and Hume all played a huge impact on my life.  I studied life as I am now finishing my BA in Philosophy.  My focus is religious studies. I was still left with a void until about a year ago I discovered Buddhism. I study and practice meditation,  Buddhism and Taoism.  I study the lifestyle...  Not the religion.  I believe that each person's life is for them to explore.  I realized Christianity is a very corrupt religion when it comes to their church but has taught me numerous things.  I believe one should explore all facets of their lives. This journey isn't over for me but just beginning.       I wanted to share with you guys that I had the best Meditation session to date.  Not that I am grading them or one better than the other, this one was just very different.  I was sitting there in breathe for a few minutes when I began doing some chants as usual.  Maybe it was just one of those busy weeks but everything seemed to slow down.  I was very aware of my surroundings and very focused.  I returned to breathe easily and felt very content.  Sorry just wanted to share with you guys.    I was driving on a very busy freeway when I saw the usual crazy motorcyclist weaving through traffic. I then thought how efficient it would be to have a motorcycle lane. A small lane like the bike lane to the right of the fast lane. Prevent deaths, injuries, and vehicle damage. More people would be inclined to take advantage of this safe benefit and now we have a green solution to car emission and less money on gas.          Why?

How does it differ than how it is taught in America?      I enjoyed his play and I think he can be developed. I think he would be a good pick up now that the Wizards released him.   I get that they are above pain and suffering and that death is the easing of suffering but isn't killing yourself killing a living being? What is the point of this?      How has nobody done anything to them?         Are you more willing to date a guy/girl who normally wouldn't seem attractive superficially but has an incredible talent?  Ed Sheeran effect..   Please... I beg you guys to stop whining about the FO. It hasnt even been a month without Malone.. Shit happens and we move on. OUR OWNERSHIP GAVE YOU A TEAM!!! Why are we questioning them so soon? You all thought a 6-1 start was our championship debut and you are expecting Corbin to jump right in and take us to the championship?  Same people wanting Malone back were crying about his rotations earlier. Have faith please and enjoy. This is the calming before the storm.      We were 6-1 leading the league in RPG. Our plays have (I am assuming) the same ones Ty Corbin has been running with Malone since he got here. We have lost our fire and the team is off rhythm... sobbing up and down the floor and losing within winning margins by losing teams. Our TO are HORRIBLE!!  Why get rid of Malone? When we were winning...? Makes no sense unless you wanted to lose perhaps?  Falling bottom ten secures our 1st round pick (which we dont have for a few years), allows newbies developmental time (as we have seen with Nik and Ray. We got Rudy to sign and now we blame Corbin for our failure.. We polish up next year with George Karl. Otherwise I can't make sense of this...   Simply up to this point... Whether it will later or not isn't relevant..   Can it happen? Will it happen?   Which period in time was most memorable to you and why?      What is your view on hunting? For or against it? Why?  Edit: I ask because I am at my SO house and her family are all really huge hunters. I have nothing against guns but we were watching hunting shows and they were shooting bucks... they went into the Bucks home and baited them in the illusion of mating and in turn shot them with a bow. Just doesn't sit right..      I am a salesman and I love one liners.. what do you guys got!   They don't hold any biological benefit at all. So why do men have them?   What chants do you use and why?      I have researched them a good amount and realized what I was practicing was Mahyana I believe... as I look at the other two they all seemed to mesh into what I believed was a singular belief but I guess they are different.. what makes them different . What is Tibetan Buddhism?   I love this band and want to see them but I only have seen them at Coachella... when do they tour Cali?      I came to the realization that I have requested not to have a service when I die. It costs a lot of money and I do not want to be mourned. If people would like to remember me, then I request they do it individually. How do you guys feel?   I wanna start by thanking the wonderful souls of /r/buddhism for being such amazing colleagues in my spiritual growth. I have made some self realizations and now I am eager to learn more!  I ran into a gentleman awhile back who dressed like a Tibetan Monk trying to sell me prayer beads... I realized he was a Hare Krishna follower... what exactly is that? What is the difference between them and Buddhists?   I was pretty amazed at the Bucks history of 3-Point shooters. Michael Redd, J.J. Reddick and Ray Allen. Am I missing any? Why do they develop such good shooters?      Just wondering if Buddhists have a deity that they worship. I don't believe Siddartha is one.   [SERIOUS]      Every time he talks I wanna vomit but im curious about what you guys think.   If you tend to "party" a lot... what do you drink to not put on the lbs.? I am a huge Corona drinker but that is counter productive...   Should we go for it? Would you trade our 1st rnd pick?   I am getting really red, bad looking stretch marks by my armpit area. (Bicep and chest-ish area) Why is this occuring and has anyone experienced it?   Is there a treatment for it? Its kinda ugly.               Is he not an amazing player?          I want to try my best to follow the path to enlightenment.  What do you guys use to help with this?  Wow guys! What awesome feed back! Everyone had some good imput! I wrote a lot of them down and will keep a link to this thread. Keep up the good response s.            I am trying to cut down but cant seem to shake bad eating habits... what are some tips to shaking the habit.  Wow guys... there's a lot of good info here thanks!    I believed that it was a huge mistake bring him back to our team.. but he reminds me of how Jackson and Thomas used to light up the floor when the bench comes out. Great hustle and energy.            I read a lot of German Philosophy and was curious on your opinions on which country you feel was the most impact.  Clarify: which area in the world do you feel has produced the highest quality of philosophers and why?     I am transferring to UCSC and if it is cheaper I would live off campus... something look to good to be true and I hear alot of stories of scams... what are some tips and warnings reddit?  I have a girlfriend who would be with me... split rent   I am now making plans on transferring for fall 2015. How is the job market? What is the best option for living... renting apartment or on campus housing?      	147
             Does anyone have recipe recommendations for chicken thighs in a crock pot?   Thanks.                Is it just me, or are there episodes missing from the Mythbusters line up?          So I've been messing around with the Roku Android app for smart phones for the last few days, and have to say, I'm impressed with some of it and disappointed by other parts.  **The Good**  It works really well. Reaction time actually seems to be faster than the Roku remote.  The app has a neat feature that allows you to view pictures or videos taken with your phone on your TV.  The app lets you stream music on your phone to the TV.  It's free!  **The Bad**  I can't use my phone's keyboard to run a search. To my thinking, this is the biggest and worst limitation of the app. It's ridiculous that I can't use my phone's keyboard to type in a title/director/etc. to run a search, rather having to peck the characters in one-by-one just like with the stock remote.  **The ugly**  When streaming video from my phone to the Roku, the app appears to compress the video quite heavily resulting in a lot of artifacting. This isn't too big of a deal if you're just wanting to show some videos to friends family.  Ocassionally the video will stop to buffer.   Overall, the app is a lot like the Roku itself, in that it does some things very well, but the interface isn't the best and sometimes it goes a bit wonky. That said, I think it's worth installing.                                                                                                            Ok. Every time I buy a pair of dress shoes, I end up with pain/blisters on my heels.  Brand, cost, style, it doesn't seem to matter, no matter what I do, I end up with pain.  So, what am I doing wrong? How can I quickly break in a new pair of dress shoes?  Thanks.                                                                                                               Now that Morse and Giron have been recalled, the Colorado Democratic party is probably in momentary internal chaos.  If the Republicans really want to win points, now is the time for them to push through pro-rights legislation, and, frankly, I think they ought to put forth the following proposals:  1.) A repeal of the magazine ban in full. 2.) Repeal the universal background check law, as well as the requirements for background checks to be conducted at gun shows. 3.) Tax incentives designed to bring gun and gun-related companies to the state of Colorado in order to generate jobs and tax revenue, as well as establishing a group of businesses in Colorado with a vested interest in ensuring that gun control cannot get a foot hold in this state. (Magpul was invaluable in their actions to help to reduce the damage of these laws.) 4.) Other proposals that would just simply cause the Democrats to flip out. Not sure what those would be. Maybe legalize hunting with sound suppressors, paying for maintenance and range safety officers at public ranges, or something else I haven't thought of.  Right now the Democrats fundamentally believe that Morse and Giron were recalled because of their stance on guns. It's time for the Republicans to step up, propose some pro-gun laws, and force the rest of the state Democratic party to either back the Republican play or face the consequences.                                                                        Several months ago, I randomly stumbled across a blog post where the author tackled the media claims that gun ownership was falling, while at the same time pointing out that the number of NICS checks conducted were at record highs.  The article basically showed that while the percentage of households that owned guns was smaller compared to years past, this was due to the fact that the rate of gun owning households growing at a slower rate than the rate of household growth overall.  The upshot of the article was that, even though fewer households have a gun as an overall percentage in years past, there are still record numbers of gun owners overall.  It was a very insightful analysis, and now, for the life of me, I can't find it again. If anyone else remembers what I'm talking about, or could dig it up for me, I'd be truly grateful.  Thanks.                                                                                                                     So, my kid's 1-1/2 years old. I can tell he's developing and doing some cool things, but I have honestly no idea what kind of activities we should be doing for fun and learning.  Any suggestions/links/articles/success stories are appreciated.  Bottom line:  I'm sick of being the parent who just turns on the tv because I'm bored. I have a little person here in my life, and I'm thinking that there should be all kinds of fun and exciting things he and I can do.         Just what it says.  Every time we put the kid on the changing table to change his diaper, he flips out.  The only way to keep it from happening is to give him a bottle or distract him with a toy.  What's going on here? How can I get him to be calm when we're changing a diaper or outfit?      The following images have been circulating among various Colorado citizens, and have reached a critical mass in popularity.  Consider these  to be a pretty clear indicator of just how upset people are over the currently proposed gun control laws.  http://imgur.com/FQbPjvi  http://imgur.com/lLP9Kc5  http://imgur.com/LcWkjoO  http://imgur.com/uYwHKLo  http://imgur.com/pjJo3E6        So, I've just been reading through the proposed universal background check law here in Colorado.  The law outlines a number of exceptions where a transfer can be legally done without having to go through a background check.  Here's the list of exempted transfers straight from the bill:  [QUOTE]3 (b)  EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY SECTION 18-12-111, A TRANSFER 4 THAT IS A BONA FIDE GIFT BETWEEN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHICH 5 ARE LIMITED TO SPOUSES, PARENTS, CHILDREN, SIBLINGS, GRANDPARENTS, 6 AND GRANDCHILDREN;[/QUOTE]  So, reading through that list of exemptions, it would be legal for me to transfer a gun to my wife for self protection while I'm out of town on a business trip.  However, if a gay man or lesbian were to transfer a gun to his/her partner under the exact same set of circumstances, it would be an illegal transfer without conducting a background check.  Given that the Democratic party has consistently positioned itself as the champion of LGBT issues, I find it highly instructive that they're willing to draw a line of demarcation that essentially says "gay people don't have the same gun right to self defense as straight people."  No matter where you stand on LGBT political issues, no reasonable person would think that such unequal treatment under the law could possibly be fair or just, and regardless of where you personally stand on this issue, the Colorado Democratic party should be called to account for their clearly discriminatory attitude regarding gays and guns.    Please feel free to spread these far and wide in service of the fight against the proposed gun control laws in Colorado.  http://demigodllc.com/hickenlooper_magban4.jpg  http://demigodllc.com/candles.jpg  http://demigodllc.com/15_rounds.jpg                 So, I recently smoked a fairly massive pork loin at a friend's house. This thing is perfectly done. Smokey, tender, and delicious.  I would happily just eat the thing by cutting hunks of it off with a knife, but that somehow doesn't seem civilized, especially since this enormous hunk of delicious meat is going to be my work day lunch for the next week or two.  So, hit me with your best suggestions for fancying this up. I'm already thinking in terms of doing some pulled pork, but also would like ideas about making pork medallions with some kind of paleo sauce.  Or any other suggestions you guys might have. Wrap it in bacon and garnish with an avocado? Served with a side of shrimp and slathered in a coconut and red pepper sauce? Something else I haven't even thought of?  Lay it on me!                        In the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, I've been going back and doing some reading on previous spree shootings. One of the documents I'm working my way through is the Virginia Tech Review Panel's Report on the Mass Shootings at Virginia Tech. (You can download the report here: http://www.governor.virginia.gov/tempcontent/techpanelreport.cfm )   The report is quite comprehensive, covering a history of Seung Hui Cho, his mental problems, Virginia Tech's security protocols at the time of the shooting, a timeline of the shooting, and how Cho acquired his guns.   As you might recall, Cho committed his crimes with a Glock 19 and a Walther P22. He purchased and subsequently used numerous magazines for both guns, including several 15-round magazines for the Glock 19.   On page 87 of the PDF I came across the following bombshell:    The panel also considered whether the previous federal Assault Weapons Act of 1994 that banned 15-round magazines would have made a difference inthe April 16 incidents. The law lapsed after 10 years, in October 2004, and had banned clips or magazines with over 10 rounds. ***The panel concluded that 10-round magazines that were legal would have not made much difference in the incident.*** Even pistols with rapid loaders *(ed. I think they are referring to revolver speed loaders here)* could have been about as deadly in this situation.    So there it is.   In an official 260 page review conducted jointly between the Virginia Governor's office and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the official stance is that a magazine ban would have made little to no difference in the outcome of the shooting.      In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, there have been calls for reinstating a federal ban on magazines that hold more than ten rounds.  Arguing for the right to own these magazines is something that can be problematic, as even many gun owners see no issue with restricting access to them.  Furthermore, I've seen a lot of pro-gun folks try to make a case for these magazines, and come off as either insensitive, buffoonish, or just downright stupid, and it makes me cringe every time I watch it happen.  So, in the interest of preserving our second amendment rights, here are my thoughts on arguing against bans on 10 round magazines.  **Know Who You're Debating**  Most of the people reacting to Sandy Hook (and other rampage shootings) are not gun people. For the most part, they aren't anti-gun people, either. They are, however, completely ignorant about guns and how they work, and have a general level of fear associated with guns and people who own them.  What they're looking for is an answer to the question of "how do we stop rampage shootings" and they're grabbing at the first straw, gun control, that seems like a good idea. You have to convince them that gun control is not the answer.  **Arguments That Don't Work, and Why**  * It's my right to own them because 2nd Amendment.* -This argument is true, however it makes you look stupid and selfish. After all, to the people you're speaking to, you come off sounding like you put your right to own a dangerous product above the safety of their kids.  *I own them because I can.* -Again, this is a stupidly weak argument, and a tautology on top.  *I own them because I may need them for self-defense.* -Remember, the people you're talking to have not spent any time at all studying personal defense, much less defense with a firearm. By and large, most people assume that a more traditional style of gun, like a revolver, would be perfectly adequate. Furthermore, statistically speaking, for the vast, vast majority of defensive encounters, they're right. The number of self-defense incidents where capacity of the defender's gun was what won the day are, in truth,  vanishingly small. As a result, most people, who've spent no time reading up on the current state of self-defense will dismiss you as a paranoid lunatic with delusions of having to fend off an army.  *I own them because we may need them in case of invasion/the US government turns on its own people/The Revolution/Wolverines!* -Most people in this country live comfortable lives, and they rarely pay attention to historical precedent. As a result, they don't believe that things could come down to a situation where things go all Warsaw Ghetto, and even if they *do* entertain the notion that such a thing could happen here, they cannot and will not consider the idea of actually picking up a gun and fighting against an existential threat. Any argument that follows the revolutionary line of reasoning will be dismissed out of hand as paranoid fantasizing. You will be painted as a lunatic preparing for an event that will never happen. The assumption is that you're so delusional that you are putting your right to a revolution that will never come up against the protection of children.  *I own them because it makes it easier for me at the shooting range or because having them reduces amount of time I have to waste loading magazines.* -Again, this argument makes you look completely unsympathetic. After all, if a ban on magazines would reduce these shootings, then who cares if it means you're slightly inconvenienced during a range trip?  *I own them because I compete in USPSA/3 Gun/some other form of competition.* -This argument can help to counter the "you don't need a high capacity magazine to hunt" or "why would anyone have these things?" and pointing out that you're involved in a competitive sport may confer some legitimacy, but it's still a weak argument, because you sound like you're putting the enjoyment of a game above the safety of kids.  **Arguments That Should Work, With Explanation**  The best way to voice your opposition to a magazine ban isn't by asserting your rights. Regardless of how strongly you feel about the 2nd Amendment, rights-based or possession-based arguments are not going to sway someone who is on the fence about the 2nd Amendment, and/or already believes that no reasonable person owns such an item.  The best way to make the case in favor of 10 round magazines is from a policy perspective. As gun owners we should all be actively engaging in the public discussion over these items, and offering our unique knowledge to help guide policy in a direction that will actually be effective at stopping these sorts of shootings from happening in the future.  ***The best arguments against a ban on these magazines is to point out that such a ban SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK.*** It's thoroughly terrible policy that will absolutely not stop the next rampage killer from taking out as many victims as his tortured mental state demands.  Here's a breakdown of the arguments that are bound to be the most effective, at least with people who aren't being completely emotional about the situation.  *The 1994-2004 Assault Weapon Ban* -The US had a ban on these magazines that lasted for ten years, and during that time, there was not one trustworthy study that showed the ban had any effect whatsoever on rates of violent crime, regardless of the type.  *The technology is already "in the wild."* -With the exception of the ten years during the federal assault weapon ban 10 round magazines have been sold with hundreds of millions of new guns, and available on the market to anyone who cares to purchase them. These magazines are mechanically simple (about as complex as a well-constructed travel mug), small, and completely untraceable. Any attempt to regulate these magazines will essentially be DOA because there are already so many of them in private hands.  *Consider the implications of enforcing a ban* -Everyone wants to get behind the idea of a ban without putting any thought into actual enforcement costs. Ask them to explain how they would enforce a ban. Would they be willing to ok warrantless searches to find these magazines? Would they be willing to arrest, try, convict, and imprison for ten years anyone found to possess one? How much would it cost to imprison all of these millions of people? Would we have to construct new prisons for them? Would it really be worth it?  (The nice thing about this line of reasoning is that it's an extremely easy litmus test to see if you're dealing with someone who's halfway rational or not. No rational person would actually agree that locking up tens of millions of people who've harmed no one would be a good idea. And if the person says they're ok with it, you know they're a nut. This argument also has the potential to work well if you're talking to people in favor of legalizing pot, as the comparisons between marijuana users and magazine owners are actually pretty clear-cut.)  *How to enforce a ban?* -How would you keep people from importing unmarked magazines from outside of the US, or squirting them out of a 3D printer?  *Point out that other mass shootings have taken place without 10 round magazines* -3 of the 4 guns used by the Columbine shooters did not use high capacity magazines. Specifically, Eric Harris had to reload his Hi-Point Carbine ten times, and the double-barreled shotgun used was reloaded over twenty times. [Source]http://acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html The Walther used by Seung-Hui Cho could not hold more than ten rounds. The Beltway "snipers" never fired more than one shot at any given murder attempt. Charles Whitman used no high capacity magazines.  -Changing magazines is an action that even an amateur can easily complete in under four seconds. Even if the killer is limited to ten round magazines, it won't matter. They will simply carry more magazines and reload more often. Furthermore, there is not one instance where that extra reload time made a difference in the outcome of a shooting. (Some may try to claim that it did in the case of the Giffords shooting, but Loughner's gun jammed, which is what provided the time to others around him to react.)   Finally, if you're a parent and a gun owner, voice this fact. Having a kid means you've got skin in the game, and gives you additional legitimacy. Remember, at the end of the day, everyone wants the same thing: to stop or reduce the number of rampage killings, especially those targeting children. As gun owners, we have not only a unique perspective and specialist knowledge on the subject, but we've also got the most to lose. Therefore it is extremely important for all of us to present the best arguments we can.  I hope that this post is useful. I've been making a number of these arguments on public news forums with some success. I'd appreciate any feedback.  Thanks.         Might be too hipster for some, but I really like this tune.   So, awhile back, I installed an App on my Kindle Fire called [Peekaboo Barn](http://www.nightanddaystudios.com/app/peekaboo-barn).  My kid goes nuts for this thing, and this got me to wondering if there were other decent apps out there that an infant would like, or would help them to learn something new.  Thanks.  	176

My only concern is Nolan tends to overshadow his actors from time to time with spectacle.   He'll never have mine. A big part of my childhood is watching this movie over and over. This and Grease.

You'll always have kickass   Norman bates wears what would be considered small town casual attire. However, in the climactic scene, it is revealed that he dresses as his mother. He NEEDS to feel her clothes on his skin to become her. In the final scenes the psychologist or detective(look it up) says that now Norma bates has completely taken over. We see him dressed as Norman but talking as his mother. He no longer needs to wear his mother's clothes to be her.   As for Marion, she basically wears the same clothes throughout the 30 minutes she's on film. Any suggestions I make would be far fetched.

I prefer to interpret this video as many people either trying to reach out to him to get him to stop fighting everyone or fighters sent by the government to knock him out to contain him.

Don't know how to vote on this one.   Stewart!!!   Signs.   For those of you not aware, this movie is heavily criticized for it's lapses in logic and plot redundancies. Folks argue that suspension of disbelief is too difficult to maintain especially considering the "water" issue. However, I can easily look past those issues and simply enjoy, what is, in my opinion, one of Mel Gibson's best performances. His struggle post grieving/ now athiest on top of raising two children is only compounded by these strange lights and their farm's crop circles. You can see the emotion on his face as he is trying to be stable for his family and eventually admits that he doesn't know what to do. Such a strong performance as well as some genuine scares.

       [Escalated Quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7tgX_Uaqs)         https://imgur.com/OJETX    I still love Lombardi's on Spring Street.   I really like your picture. Where's it taken from?   The benefit of these being your 1L grades is that you have 2 years to improve before you take the bar exam and start practicing. Your grades are not as terrible as I expected by reading your title but they are also not great. If you are not going to be able to raise them in the upcoming years I recommend getting involved in other activities at your school. Average grades can be offset by moot court participation, clinics, student organizations, etc. Also, depending on which activity or activities you choose, you may get real world experience that your peers won't have.   The video is better with the sound off.   I agree with you that cops are often dicks but generally for violations arrests you do not spend the night in jail but rather are given a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT) and told to appear in court a month later. As RuleLawyer said passing drugs is considered sale in NY but marijuana is specifically excluded from the definition of a narcotic or a controlled substance. It is charged differently. Also having weed or any other drug in a baggie is not intent to sell in itself. Police can always find a way to cause people problems but this makes it more difficult for them.   There seems to be a lot of confusion here. As of right now if you are found with a small amount of marijuana not in public view it is only a violation. If it is in public view it is a B Misdemeanor. For those of you that think this won't effect the NYPD's policing behavior you may be right but what is important is that it will lessen the effects. For example cops often claim they saw marijuana in public view after they illegally searched someone and found it in their pockets. A common lie is that they saw it in the person's hand and then they put it in their pocket or they threw it on the ground. They also do this when they illegally search cars, the officer will say it was clearly visible in the center console. Now these lies will not benefit them because whether or not it was public view the charge will only be a violation. For those of you that do not know NY law, a violation is not a crime and is sealed from your record after 1 year.   He's more than a jerk. He filed false police reports when he faked his own kidnapping and said that transit police were the ones who kidnapped him. He created multiple fake crimes and events to gain publicity. He's a media whore.   You do not have a right to withheld convictions or even arrests that were sealed, expunged, dismissed, etc. Most states have an exception that allows the bar access to those cases. And probably the worse thing that can happen is that the bar finds you lied to them on an application for admission. That being said it is very unlikely that something as minor as this, especially considering the low punishment and the rest of your circumstances, will prevent you from going to law school or practicing law.      I sympathize with criminal defense attorneys but as a criminal defense attorney I have an obvious bias.   The best part of that is when you try to organize it for them and then you get a phone call about how they can't find anything and that you broke their computer.  	17

It relinquishes the dependency on the fetal impressions of the mother and the world at time of conception, pregnancy and delivery (the first causes of all subsequent causal reactions and responses) as well as memory dependence on negative and adverse surroundings, coincidences and influences. This establishment of the master rhythm was accomplished in a variety of elementary procedures in the ancient schools, be they Hebrew baptism, the Babylonian-Dravidian heat tests, the Egyptian endurance tests, or even the somewhat less known tradition of live burial for purposes of feeling the earth itself in full exposure to the earth itself, vaguely popular amongst certain lesser known mystery cults.  Only those who can read this and already understand the value of it without having to do it will be sufficiently advanced to proceed with deeper lessons. Atavistic remonstrance is worth it's weight in immediate experience. Don't re-invent the wheel itself.  In the Great Work of Mastery, the main and the only object is to attain communion with the harmonious creative power of the world and consciously joining the forces for solving the destinies of the Evolution towards Immortal Oneness.  The first steps along this infinite journey involve a mastery of thoughts and through the thoughts a mastering of the body; the dynamic so established releases hidden potentials through the energetic activation of previously energy-starved processes.  Many definitions of mastery exist: to overpower, to subdue, to rule, to possess dominion, superiority and victory of beings conscious of it.  Consider further that man is generally in a state of slavery of one sort or another. Everywhere you look you see people in one state of involuntary bondage after another, and all of them creating more chains to bind those who are not bound like themselves.  This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.  Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.  This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.  And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.  Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.  Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.  Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.  Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities. In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.  The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.  The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.  Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.  Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.  Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.                               {:'-D                                             Does anyone know if this subreddit /r/f04cb41f154db2f05a4a is part of the A585 mystery or is it something else?                                                   This page named "page 14" seems like the start of a series, which has interesting content. It's a series, because if you click the **right arrow** at the top of the page, you will proceed to page 14a, page 14b, page 14c, and so on. The content actually seems to make some sense, and it's a lot of content.  http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/first%20button/1.htm   Here is yet another spinning ying-yang found in the website. This one however, is very hidden. It is found by going to Index 5, then clicking on **The Act of Creation 2**, which leads you to the page below with the ying-yang.  http://973-eht-namuh-973.com/Magick/actofcreation2.htm  This ying-yang is bigger than the 1st one. However, the mystery is that it's purpose is unknown. When you click it, it just zooms in, disappears, then reappears again. This page in general is mysterious.... all there is is 3 objects, but it is unknown what is the purpose of this page. Any ideas as to what it's purpose may be? Feel free to share.   This page seems to be like some sort of main menu for the website. In the middle is also a glowing and spinning ying-yang; if you click it, it sometimes leads you to Index 5, and sometimes to the Advent Index.... why this happens? I'm not sure. Some links in the website just lead to two different places for some strange reason. You can check it out on the link below.  http://973-eht-namuh-973.com/coloured%20site/start/evokation/the_evokation.htm          I couldn't get to class on time because there was a **TRIANGLE** :'(      Yo, on friday I saw a man on the bus and he was dressed up as a woman!!! Why??? It's not right!! He was Indian, about 35-45 years old, wearing a long woman's jacket, skinny jeans, women's boots with high heels, he was holding a purse, sitting with his legs crossed like a woman, and he even had his hair in a little bun like many girls like to make their hair!! I promise i'm not lying, I really did see this unbelievable sight on the bus on friday february 13, 2015!!!!!  I was laughing my head off for the whole ride, and there were only about 5 other people on the bus, so I was the only one who noticed it since I was sitting at the back! Then the man-woman noticed I was laughing so it turned its head around, and smiled a dreamy smile!!! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! {:'-D   Here is the grand gallery, which houses much of the artwork and pictures which can be found throughout the website. An easy discovery, yet cool artwork! Take a look at this rather amazing art by clicking on a number at the bottom of the page. Each number contains different art!  http://www.973-eht-namuh-973.com/gallery%20button/galleries/0.htm   This appears to be the main page of the website, and also the longest. What could The Evokation mean? What is this the purpose of this page?

Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D  	161
 I had an ArmaLite AR-10 pattern .308 gas gun and let me just say the aftermarket parts seemed a lot more geared toward SR-25/LR308 pattern rifles. I was very impressed with the overall quality of the AR-10 but it seems to me the LR-308 pattern may have been the way to go. RRA is, as I understand it, different mags and, through my adventures on the web, the least popular option.      Shot placement. Shot placement. Shot placement.   Doesn't the accuwedge push the receivers apart basically? I know a little play isn't that big a deal but it seems kinda counterproductive   I recently picked up a Core-15 M-4 that I'm slowly building into a coyote rifle, I posted a picture of it somewhat recently should you be interested. Currently the core has a 20" fluted bushmaster varminter barrel that I got a screamin' deal on, but I think that additional heft on the front end is exaggerating the slop between upper and lower. JP tension pin or deal with it? I would appreciate input from people that have used the tension pin or found a similar solution that doesn't involve foam earplugs...   when i purchased an almost identical troy rail for my AR-10, it came with a section (maybe two, I can't remember correctly) of rail about 4" in length. I used it way out front for a bipod. Not sure if a company would include it if you didn't purchase the rail separately, though.     	7

 I haven't BASHED anyone. The cast, crew, and actors all brought the show to life too. Writers are just one part of it. And also, ratings have continually plummeted and writers have more say then you think. So regardless of what the network thinks fans want, less and less fans are watching, so something is going wrong with the formula.  Also if you look at series similar to this that have mysteries, they've handled the plot better and catered to a young audience. Look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Veronica Mars, just to name a few. The plot was not soooooooooo drawn out. You can have fillers, that's understandable, but have fillers that connect and progress the main plot. That's all we ask for. It just feels like the plot moves from one point, and then jumps to the end without any middle area to explain things. It feels disjointed.   Here is the artist: http://www.deviantart.com/art/Car-Wash-547180494   *solidarity   I wuv you :*( and I miss my granma!!!!   EXACTLY and aww you're so awesome (Grandmas rule)   I agree, but as you can see by declining ratings, people are fed up. I"m fed up. I don't think I will watch until 6x10 if I know it will all be just filler.   Why have you made this show so annoyingly hard to like?   If it were not for the amazing cast and crew, your continually frustrating red herrings and lackluster reveals would have cancelled the show ages ago.  I'm not saying Marlene lacks in talent. She is an excellent writer.  I'm just saying: COME ON NOW.  You're not even giving us any way to make sense of who Charles is, even 6 episodes in.  I just think if you want less frustrated fans and more viewers for the last season, you have to give something throughout the season. Let it be a gradual buildup not filler...filler...filler...then the last episode BAM half hearted answers.   Hey I think you're awesome for directing such a cool show and I like Finding Carter too. I'm sorry I'm late but, was wondering why the design of Pretty Little Liars was split into A and B, is that to enable more viewership?  	8
  Americans don't vote for welfare programs,  Not really. The vast majority of those programs were created long ago. How many have been created in the past decade or two?  However, Clinton in the 1990s did *repeal* Americans' right to cash payments for poor people (welfare), a right that was in place since the Great Depression.  It's pretty clear why we continue to have food stamps and other programs to assist the poor today. It's not because of our two corrupt ruling political parties -- and certainly not because of American voters -- it's simply because if the rich people who control/fund both of our political parties removed those programs the poor would literally rebel.   they don't give to charity,  We certainly do. We have millions of caring and moral people. But that has little to do with global warming.   they don't help their neighbors?  Sure we do. But one could easily argue there is an element of self-interest in helping your immediate neighbor. Either way, your points are on more of a micro scale, whereas global warming issues deal with macro economics and an international scale.  On the issue of global warming, it's clear we -- our *government* as a whole -- are greedy, heartless bastards. One only has to listen to VP Gore's blunt talk about the US being the country which seeks to *undermine* international treaties/actions to deal with global warming to understand that.   Considering that I named several wars in that reply, I cannot differentiate what 2 you're referring to.  But guessing, I'll just point out that both the war on Iraq and the war on Afghanistan were *both* immoral wars of aggression.    but again required that the U.S. "prove" bin Laden's involvement first.  Isn't that only logical? Isn't that the basis on which international extradition treaties work?  Considering that the US had no diplomatic recognition of Afghanistan, the Afghans were just using common sense in dealing with a treacherous government that routinely lies through its teeth, and lies to its own people to start wars.   "The great moral American people would rather believe government lies than to acknowledge the government's crimes and to hold the government accountable." -- Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration and Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal Paul Craig Roberts.    If it's so easy to "get people to stop being greedy,"   Who said it was easy? I said it was the "real trick" -- you're misrepresenting what I said and building a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) argument to highlight that Americans live unsustainable lifestyles, far richer than the vast majority of the rest of the planet.  And then you use that straw man to argue that capitalism is the solution, a point thoroughly refuted and destroyed by many, for example Naomi Klein in her [recent book](http://www.amazon.com/This-Changes-Everything-Capitalism-Climate/dp/1451697384/).   Once global climate change impacts the ledgers of the wealthy, then the world will turn against it.  Again, it already is doing that. The point you are missing is that modern capitalism is very skilled at turning a profit, even turning a profit on tragedies of a massive scale (e.g. Hurricane Katrina).  What is costly for the insurance industry, for example, is a profitable boon for other industries (e.g. construction). Again, the core of the problem is our lack of empathy towards others, and the greed-based, anti-social, short-sighted me-first attitudes that capitalism indoctrinates us with.    I want my government to defend me from Muslim Terrorism.  You're in luck then -- because despite what our lying government says, there is no serious or legitimate "threat" to Americans from the Muslim fundamentalists/terrorists that the US government has been working with, supporting and allying with for decades.  For example, you're far more likely to be murdered by right-wing domestic terrorists in the US than you are by some Muslim fundamentalist.    If the most powerful countries break their treaties, then how can we expect anyone to keep them?  We logically cannot.  As a veteran, this is the real crime of Bush adopting outright torture as a US national policy (and of Obama refusing to prosecute Bush and his torturers) -- in every future war, if someone tortures US soldiers, we have no logical or moral right to complain.  The US holds no moral high ground. We are just another war-loving empire operating on the moral basis of "might makes right". That may make us feel good since we're militarily strong, but eventually there will be hell to pay. We can only hope that others are more compassionate than we are as our nation's economy erodes and we become weaker.  Since many Americans do operate with a core set of values of logic, justice and morality, this also means that our immoral government has to resort to more and more propaganda and lies to con the American people into supporting our wars and international aggressions. We're on a downward spiral towards barbarism.   "If certain acts of violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us." -- Justice Robert Jackson, Chief of Counsel for the United States at the post-WWII Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, and later US Supreme Court justice.    Bush screwed up invading Iraq, Obama screwed up leaving too early.  Two points:  * Obama is wrongly credited for leaving Iraq. Obama actually left Iraq on a timetable and agreement negotiated and agreed to in 2008 by Bush. That agreement called on US forces to leave by 31 December 2011.  * Before leaving Iraq, Obama worked the entire summer and fall of 2011 trying to bribe and arm-twist the Iraqis into keeping some US troops in Iraq. The Iraqis, who actually hate us for destroying their country and society, used the issue of legal immunity of US troops in a status of forces agreement to force the US to leave according to Bush's timetable. The Iraqis played their hand brilliantly and forced us to leave. Thus, Obama had no choice but to leave by 31 Dec. 2011 or to "reinvade Iraq" (a ludicrous idea).    The War on Terror is far fom over.   The war on terror is a sham.  We've used Muslim fundamentalists for decades, starting when Jimmy Carter used them in a diabolical strategy to deliberately provoke the USSR into sending troops to aid a progressive Afghan government that was under attack.  We've allied with Muslim fundamentalists in Bosnia, Chechnya, Libya and other places -- we've used those gullible fools as our proxy soldiers.  Today we're arming/training Muslim fundamentalists in Syria to attack the secular (but independent!) Syrian dictator, and when those same Muslim fundamentalists cross over into Iraq we rename them and declare that they're the core of evil in the world.  That declaration is laughable. It's the US government and our immoral, unprincipled policies of war and aggression that is the core of evil in the world.  Wake up and smell the coffee. You're being conned by both parties of a lying government.   "Let's replace the word 'democratic' by 'with us' and the word 'terrorist' by 'against us'." -- Michael Collon.   Shhh! If you point out things like that people may learn that it's the US that refuses to end the Korean War.  And we may learn that the North Koreans have offered to swap their entire nuclear program (with North Korea rejoining the NPT, which they withdrew from after we attacked Iraq and labeled NK a member of the "Axis of Evil", and accepting IAEA inspectors) in return for the US agreeing to end the Korean War and assurances of not attacking North Korea, but that we rejected that offer.  After all, keeping tensions sky-high on the Korean peninsula not only gives us troops and bases near China, but it also functions as a way to keep US influence and control over the economic powerhouse of South Korea. Without those bases, tensions and the fear created by North Korea, South Korea may start thinking it's actually independent and adopting policies that the US government doesn't like.    We got saddam, he didn't have any wmd. I count that as a success   Propaganda alert! Let's bring in some *facts* -- some "inconvenient truths" -- into this discussion. The entire WMD claim was a *deliberate* lie to attack Iraq with our goal being to control Iraqs oil!  The US Congress openly talked about using Iraq's oil money to pay for the US war of aggression. Bush's former Secretary of the Treasury went on TV's "60 Minutes" showing secret maps of Iraq divided up amongst western oil companies and Bush floated the idea of prosecuting him for revealing the secret maps. The war was about oil -- not WMD -- plain and simple.  We knew in the 1990s when the head of Iraq's WMD military-industrial complex defected to the US and reported to the Clinton administration that Saddam Hussein had ordered him to destroy the entire military-industrial complex, a task that he stated he did, that Iraq had no WMD. (Saddam Hussein later had him executed when he was stupid enough to return to Iraq.)  In 2002 the Downing Street memo clearly stated the British government's views that they knew the US was inventing the WMD claim as propaganda and was using it as the moralistic rationale to wage a war of aggression on Iraq.  In 2003 we had UN weapons inspectors operating inside of Iraq for *months,* operating unhindered, directed by the US, and those weapons inspectors found nothing!  Those weapons inspectors were ordered out of Iraq by Bush, who then gave his famous "get out of Dodge" speech and gave Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or the US would attack. We then *treacherously* attacked before the 48 hours was even up.  Again, the entire WMD claim was *not* some sort of "mistake" of "bad intelligence" -- it was *war* *propaganda* which was deliberately created to con a gullible American population into supporting an evil, immoral war of aggression.   "To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole." -- The chief American prosecutor, and later US Supreme Court justice, Robert H. Jackson at the post-WWII International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg which tried Nazi war criminals. What did the US do to Iraq?   We've known the solution if we bother to objectively and critically examine our own history.  Did we think that Teddy Roosevelt was joking when he said, "There can be no effective control of corporations while their political activity remains. To put an end to it will be neither a short nor an easy task, but it can be done."?  Controlling corporations and stopping the privatization/corporatization of the US military, making the US military *public* again and disbanding the vast majority of our standing military, eliminating hundreds and hundreds of our overseas military bases is what needs to be done. (In short, ending the American empire and working to restore the republic.)  But with the 2 corrupt, corporate-funded political parties that rule the US as effectively and as completely as any dictatorship in power, it's going to take something along the lines of a revolution to accomplish those common-sense goals.   "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor.     It was doomed to fail the moment it started.  Exactly. Countries who start wars of aggression *should* lose them. Countries who commit torture on a mass scale -- unapologetically -- are inherently illegitimate.  Afghanistan is a war of aggression. Our lying government claims it was fought over Bin Laden but Afghans offered to turn over Bin Laden both before and after 9/11.  Every day that goes on with our evil military waging war in Afghanistan is just another day with more needless deaths. The majority of Afghans have wanted all foreign troops out of their country for years.  It's long past time our corrupt, war-loving government "declared victory" and we leave that country that we destroyed.  Sadly, just like after we destroyed Vietnam or Iraq, our greedy, immoral government will probably not apologize and will refuse to pay reparations to the nation that we destroyed.   "To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole." -- The chief American prosecutor, and later US Supreme Court justice, Robert H. Jackson at the post-WWII International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg which tried Nazi war criminals.   It was. And it was reported (though wildly under-reported).  Back in about 2004-5 the US Army's War College (the military academy where generals and higher ranking officers go to get an equivalent to a PhD in military studies) did a study and reported that *both* Iraq and Afghanistan were "strategic defeats" for the US. Thus, the War College called the wars very early.  But remember, that is *good.* Countries who wage wars of aggression and who unapologetically torture and commit war crimes *should* lose.   "To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole." -- The chief American prosecutor, and later US Supreme Court justice, Robert H. Jackson at the post-WWII International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg which tried Nazi war criminals.   Good point, but that only scratches the surface.  How many TV/radio/mass media programs honestly talk about Afghanistan?  How many of them *consistently* talk about the waste of US money, the corruption of the puppet Afghan government we installed? How many of them honestly talk about the fact that the Taliban have controlled the *vast* *majority* of the country for years and years? How many of them talk about the US effort to pacify the south (Obama's big move early in his first term) was a complete and utter failure?  And how many of them say that the *majority* of the Afghan people want *all* foreign troops to leave the country?  The militarists of the US claim that we "lost" Vietnam because of the mass media's reporting. In Iraq and Afghanistan our mass media has been exactly what the government wants -- cheerleaders who parrot US government talking points and who barely offer up one word of opposition.  But instead of this causing "victory", we instead just believe the lies. The problem is that the lies have no relationship to *reality* and *reality* trumps all.   "Propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship." -- Noam Chomsky.   True, but remember, this impacting people around the globe *already.* (Bangladesh flooding, Pacific islands/nations already being evacuated, etc.)  We live in a capitalist country. American culture teaches us to worship money and greed.  I would argue that the real trick is getting people to stop being greedy, to abandon capitalism and to start caring about the welfare of other people.   We don't have to wonder about who's getting paid -- anyone with a clue knows that.  Back in the 60s and 70s state colleges/universities were essentially free -- between Pell Grants (now those grants are much reduced and eroded by inflation) and a part-time job just about anyone could afford to go to college. The state higher ed systems of CA and TX were stellar (and cheap), and those systems greatly benefited their states.  Capitalists and bankers worked long and hard to change the system -- much lobbying money (legalized bribery) was spent over many, many election cycles to create the system of [debt peonage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage) that we have today.  *Both* of our plutocratic political parties that are funded by the rich and their corporations would fight tooth and nail against going back to the old system, no matter how fair it was nor how well it worked. The reason they would oppose this is just what you said -- it's all about who is getting paid/profiting from student loans/debt.   Between 2000 and 2009, earnings for grads with just a bachelors degree fell by 15 percent. Yet public college tuitions rose 63 percent. -- Paul Solman (2010) Malemployed College Graduates Cope with Discouragement. PBS Newshour, December 6.   Wouldn't you say just about anything to distance yourself from that plutocratic nut case?   Like many dailykos articles, this one takes a valid point and spins it into a he-said/she-said debate about Republicans and Democrats.  The point that the Republican Party relies on the support of racists has been clear for decades. Nixon's "Southern Strategy" to garner the southern white opposition to Civil Rights was a diabolically brilliant example of realpolitik. Since that time the Republicans have worked hard to keep the support of white racists and have constantly struggled to pretend not to be racist -- it's a tricky move but they've been successful if you look at the electoral map of the south.  In many ways it is exactly the same as the Democrats' fake support for labor. The Democrats pretend to support labor and to "talk union" but then in office they carry on an anti-union, neo-liberal agenda that makes capitalists thrilled (see Obama's broken promise to support the EFCA for one recent example).  The dailykos article ignores that in some ways racism a moot or evaporating point. With whites in the US fast becoming a minority and "minorities" becoming a larger and larger percentage of the US population, even the subtle, coded racism of the Republicans is doomed to fail in the long term (unless they want to openly advocate some sort of white supremacist apartheid system).   The fact that South Carolina lawmakers finally united in a vote to help end that festering wound could have been a triumphant moment for Republicans and Democrats alike, not to mention the nation.  This is absurd. The flag was a symbol. Removing a symbol is nice, but it does very, very little to actually address the *systemic* problems and centuries of racism in the US -- in spite of the spin that NPR and our corporate mass media puts on the flag issue.  This still leaves us with the reality of the 2 political parties that rules the US as effectively and as completely as any dictatorship: *Both* of the parties are corrupt to the bone, one is center-right and the other far-right, and *both* are capitalist parties whose primary interest is in representing the rich capitalists that bankroll the respective parties. And we have centuries of experience that capitalists *love* to use race as one of their core divide-and-conquer strategies.   Were the victims at the event paid actors?   At least the military is clear that they don't give a rat's ass about the Geneva Conventions, international law, and the "rules of war" -- you have to give them a little credit for at least being honest.   It is the militarys position that the shift to jacketed hollowpoint (JHP) ammunition, which more efficiently transfers energy to the target and which presents much less of a risk of over-penetration, is more humane and less of a risk to innocent civilians downrange in modern combat where there are often no clear front lines.  This is just mind-boggling. The dishonorable bastards will say anything to do what they want.   Additional reporting/details: [here](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/8/california-legislative-panel-approves-minimum-wage/) or [there](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-10/california-governor-s-fiscal-adviser-opposes-11-minimum-wage).      The article is a very good read -- independence and a refusal to bow to the US is what the US opposes, be it in Iran, China, Russia or anywhere else.  The title could be a bit better though. Conquer implies a complete takeover. The US does allow its vassals a *little* freedom of action on minor issues just to placate the natives and to allow our quislings to claim they're in charge of their countries.  Of course, conquer also implies complete destruction -- see Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, etc. -- which is the primary thing that the US is *really* good at.   Why the focus on Cheney? Why isn't the focus on "the Decider" -- Bush?  Would the focus on Bush indict our entire, corrupt, war-loving government and *both* of the political parties that support our criminal wars?     but air strength is a serious factor that drives global power and military trends,  I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but I do know that US air power has not meant the US wins most of its wars.  Did all the jets and techie toys help the US to win our wars on Iraq or Afghanistan?  Even bombing the hell out of Libya for 6 months did not do much until our Muslim fundamentalist proxy ground troops managed to murder Gaddafi.   Coincidence or Corruption?  Easy answer: Corruption.  The hard part is that this corruption is *systemic* to the 2 political parties -- *both* of them! -- that rule the US as effectively and as completely as any dictator. *That* is the issue we have to deal with!   Does anyone else appreciate the irony (hypocrisy?) of the NYT reporting that psychologists functioned as de facto promoters of literal war crimes? Pot calling the kettle black?       The fact that everyone is biased does not make everything said untrue.  I never said that they reported untrue things -- you're putting words in my mouth.  Like all skilled propaganda organs, NPR typically lies by omission and spin. Only crude propaganda outlets lie by outright lies which can be proven untrue. And only fools use strongly worded, overt propaganda that raises red flags of its target audience. The best propaganda is subtle, so subtle that it slips by the defenses of its target audience. This is what NPR does -- subtle and with many omissions.  As a disabled vet, I thought your two examples of NPR's "good" reporting about the mustard gas and the VA hospitals were comical and a classic illustration of what I said above.  NPR says with faux shock that the VA broke its promise to the mustard gas victims. But do they reference the years of denial by the VA of the claims of Vietnam-era Agent Orange victims? Of course not. Does NPR state the *fact* that the VA medical system has been used by the US government to conduct medical experiments on unwitting veterans in *every* *decade* since the 1920s? Would such a fact be in NPR's background to a story? Of course not! Such context likely would cause Americans to be outraged and to know that we have *systemic* problems, that our government is simply *brutal* and that it doesn't really care about veterans (other than rhetorical lip service, of course).  In the story about veterans returning to a "broken" VA system, the entire story focuses on "wait times". But does NPR cover the issue that the entire goal of the VA is to "heal" veterans so they can be pushed out onto the for-profit corporate medical system that Obama shoved down the nation's throat? That the VA's mission is in many ways *not* to give care, or to give care in such a way as to pressure people not to use the VA? Of course not. NPR actually spins the crimes committed against Agent Orange vets that I mentioned above into a slight positive in this article, and they did it in the typical NPR fashion by using a selective quote from a non-NPR source (thus maintaining distance and so-called objectivity) -- utterly *brilliant* propaganda! (I never said these people were not highly skilled at what they do -- they are.)  These types of *systemic* issues are not dealt with by "all things considered", nor is the conspiratorial angle that those "decades-old problem" of wait times may indeed be a *deliberate* *strategy* to accomplish the goal of pushing people out of the VA system and to reduce the massive costs (literally *trillions* of dollars) of the VA's promise to veterans resulting from our many wars of aggression. Again, spin and deception by omission.  But hey, if you believe in NPR and all of its rhetoric, just keep believing in the organization.  NPR will lull you to sleep and eventually you may come to believe things like NPR saying that the deliberate *torture* that we inflicted on countless people in our wars was really just "abuse" or "enhanced interrogation" -- lies by euphemism that NPR repeats endlessly day after day even after Obama admitted that we tortured "some folks". As the old saying goes, "It is not possible to awaken those who only pretend to sleep."   "The chief problem in historical honesty is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important data. The definition of 'important', of course, depends on one's values." -- Historian Howard Zinn.    What president does that quote belong to?  This is why I downvoted the post -- while loosely on the same topic, the cartoon is different from the post's headline. I was commenting on the headline.   The Greek people have already spoken twice -- they elected Syriza to fight the EU's austerity, and again when the Greek people voted in the recent referendum.  Tsipras needs to man-up and do what the Greek people are telling him. Either that or he should resign.  If Greek defaults and leaves the EU capitalists in both the US and Europe will work to make the Greek people pay dearly. Iceland was an aberration -- a tiny country who surprised everyone by resisting the economic orthodoxy of neo-liberalism. Iceland got away with resisting austerity and the rule of foreign banks, and suffered only briefly before bouncing back strong.  The capitalists of the west will work hard to make sure Greece does not enjoy the same soft ride -- such renegade countries set a dangerous precedent for the capitalists who advocate neo-liberalism.    Do you listen to much NPR?  Sadly, yes. For actual news there are not any alternatives where I live.   Because they routinely do what you're talking about. They do have hard-hitting investigative journalism.  We clearly have a difference of opinion. I see NPR as merely supporting the status quo and position of the government and big business. FAIR and others have reported that NPR and PBS have more current and former government officials than many other sources, sometimes even those clearly on the political right.  When it comes to militarism and foreign policy, NPR is just as gung-ho as the rest of the US mass media.  On domestic issues they offer some criticism, but they never deal with systemic corruption nor offer any coherent criticism of the corruption inherent to capitalism.  For issues like this oil disaster, NPR has or will quibble over the lies about the amount of spillage, they'll offer up emotional stories about dead birds and such to mindlessly pull on our heartstrings, and they'll celebrate government legal victories or cash payments as some sort of systemic change which solves the problem.  But NPR will rarely deal with BP's long history of murder and their shoddy environmental record, nor will they ponder how to address those issues. And they will *never,* *ever* deal with the fact that our corrupt government works hand-in-glove with corporations to cover these things up and to quickly exit them from the news cycle.   Their funding structure is markedly different from what you suggest, as well  The fact that roughly a third of their budget comes from gullible people who believe in NPR doesn't mean much to me.  I liken it to Obama's bragging about how much money he collected from individuals during his campaign: When it comes down to actual *policy* who gets listened to and who calls the tune, who is going to have their concerns heard and addressed -- the many individual people contributing a $50 or $1500 pittance, or the government who can regulate them out of existence and/or the corporations/foundations who write the big, fat checks? One only has to critically examine NPR's coverage to see/hear the answer.   "The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum." -- Noam Chomsky.    This is in contrast to what I heard on NPR, that they are taking new precautions.  Two thoughts come to mind:  The first is the government papering over the issues that caused the 2008/9 financial crisis. We passed a law or two to placate the public, and the entire unregulated derivatives market chugs on waiting for the next disaster.  The second is to consider the source: NPR. While NPR offers soft, objectively-spun criticism from a liberal perspective, we should never forget that NPR is funded by the US government and corporations (and a few people who contribute to their never-ending fund drives); thus NPR will *never* tackle our deep-seated issues of systemic corruption or question the fundamental growth-based mindset or morality of capitalism.   To answer your question, no, I don't think so. (On the topic of this sub-reddit, I would be more concerned with some of the anti-Jewish rhetoric featured here. That goes well beyond anti-Israeli government issues and well into raw anti-Semitism.)  In the case of this post, you have a president of the US stating bluntly what he thinks.  And is it really different 100 years later? Did we forget quotes like:   "You mean to tell me that the success of the economic program and my re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?" -- President-elect Bill Clinton, upon being briefed that Wall Street runs the US economy and that he was powerless; 1993.  or   "And the banks - hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created - are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place." -- Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, May 8, 2009.  Sure, we do not have the proverbial "smoking gun". But conspiracies -- literally more than 1 person breaking the law or carrying out their agenda -- very rarely have smoking guns.  Do you think these guys were just joking? Or is more likely, that we simply refuse to accept the truth because that would force us into a hard decision, a choice of:  * Shutting up about capitalism and its corruption, and just accepting things as they are.  * Or organizing with others and starting the *massive* task of fixing things, knowing fully well that the changes that have to be made are not mere "reforms" but are systemic or revolutionary in nature.  As the [old Navajo proverb](http://dissidentvoice.org/2015/07/those-who-pretend-to-sleep/) goes, "It is not possible to awaken those who only pretend to sleep." This begs the question of whether we are asleep or are merely pretending to be asleep.   You have to love the background to this. In their zeal to be "first" and to go on to the "next story",  the mainstream mass media almost always ignores details of such new stories and focuses only on the sensationalistic and jingoistic elements of the story.  After all, that sensationalism and jingoism is what sells, right?  This dynamic is what caused Thomas Jefferson to rightly observe that "The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers."    It reminds me of when they started taking lead out of everything in the US and the crime rate plummeted.  Could that be possibly related to the fact that Reagan went on a *massive* incarceration kick that continues to this day, Clinton's campaign to put a 100,000 new cops on the streets, and similar campaigns -- all leading to the fact that today the US leads the world by far in the percentage of people in prison? (The US incarceration rate was much lower in the days of leaded gasoline.)  If the claim of the link between lead and the crime rate is indeed true, then we should have seen large drops in the crime rates of other countries that worked to eliminate lead, and non-drops in countries that still use large amounts of lead today.  Correlation does not equal causation.   Corporations spend billions of dollars on advertising, employing countless PhDs and using large quantities of focus groups and studies to determine the best gimmicks to deceive and/or to manipulate customers/consumers.  Do you think this double entendre is an accident?  Nope, it's just a clever ruse to generate sales and corporate profits.  	37
 wow thanks so much! Yup that sounds about right.    I know : / For my own modest personal use I can get away with a 5g for most small to medium beers. (Or so I've read) My friend who brews with me has a 15 G rectangular cooler that we can use if needed.    Yes but I will have an 8 gallon kettle soon. Never thought I'd be this pumped to get any kitchen equipment    Awesome! You would use 6.5 gallon carboy or bucket for that?  Also- if my mash tun only holds 5 gallons, can I sparge again to reach a proper boil volume? Or fly sparge ? Thanks!   These look great. Noob question:  Batch size is the amount of beer at the end of fermentation?     Yea of course! Since I have limited volume for boiling, mash, fermenting etc anything that will yield roughly 4ish gallons once transferred f primary would be great. 5 gallon everything. For my birthday I am asking the brew fairy for a 7+ gallon kettle.  :D     Hey all. New AG brewer and I would love some ideas for recipes you have tried with success. I am into any style of beer but my favorites are dry-Irish Stout's and virtually any English Blonde or Brown Ale. Would love to keep it noob friendly for all those who only have limited resources and experience like myself. I have a 5 gallon mashtun and a 5 gallon brew pot along with everything that came with Brewers Best base starter kit + a second 5 Gallon Fermenter. The more detail in your instructions would really help myself (as well as others looking to start or have just started AGB) out. Thanks a lot and look forward to reading!   Oh I definitely will get myself and iodine test. I didnt know I could get it at a CVS.   As I get more familiar with all grain, I will try out some irish moss. I have heard good things.   As for the carboy, I usually cover it with a towel to prevent light exposure. I removed it for the pics. Should I be wetting this towel? Does it really have a large impact on temperature?  Wondering how I can be sure I used enough water per pound of grain in y mash so for next time I want to be sure. I used http://www.brewersfriend.com/mash/ If I wish to build a recipe giving me 3 gallons at the end, what is the best way of going about that? Love the help so thanks a lot for that!   Thanks a lot! You know it   Thanks! I will invest in my own hydrometer. I left it at my buddies place from our last brew. Rookie move. I will also see how an iodine test can help if they are not expensive. Will need to research refractors and buy a hose for my barb on my mash tun.     Here are some pic updates. http://imgur.com/IqJ7AhG http://imgur.com/l6cj9J6 http://imgur.com/DASikMM   Looks like its fermenting nicely. Some observations:  The color in ambient light is a nice dark Guinness like brown/light black. Shined a light to get a good look at the inside (to see what the hop situation is like) hops seem to floating around and appear to chillin on the krausen. What perplexed me was the color under this little light. It was more of a unattractive brown (see pics for an idea)  Cause for concern? I referred to my other beer for reference.   My Irish red looks and smells amazing especially in ambient light. I then shined a light on it briefly and it too had a weird brownish hue. I am thinking the light doesn't help any appearances.   I am gathering I extracted enough sugars from the malt and pitched enough yeast as it's a pretty active fermentation. Let me know if anyone has some advice as to how to clear up the beer, colors in early stages of fermentation etc. Would love to hear back. Thanks !    Here are some pics Wort http://imgur.com/sbqwzvg,aalmpgT First Runnings http://imgur.com/sbqwzvg,aalmpgT#1   I have a few extract batches under my belt and I was really excited about trying an all grain recipe! I made my mash tun and I was ready to go. (I thought) So I went to my local homebrew shop and asked for enough ingredients for a 3 gallon batch. He hooked me up with assorted grains and hops for a porter. 2 row pale, chocolate, crystal, black and hops. I preheated my mash tun and then I started the process.   I mashed for an hour at 151 degrees and vorlaufted until the wort was clear. It looked really good actually! Fly sparged but not sure if I did it well enough. Over time I expect I will understand more of how that works... The boil really looked great. Barely anything floating in there, the foam looked like a barista at a coffee shop took his time making a cappuccino but instead of coffee it was my wort. I was pumped.  So the boil when on for an hour and the guy who gave me the ingredients said to just hop at flame out. I was like hmmm maybe I will add some at 30 minutes. So I did. I also added some at the very end of my boil. Thats when I was like hmmm. I see too many hops hopping around in this thing. Not sure if thats ok. I said dont focus on it...   After cooling the wort to 70 degrees there seemed to be a lot of gook at the bottom of my boil pot. It gave the wort an interesting hoppy aroma, naturally. Not that it was bad, just something I was not expecting. Then I siphoned into the carboy. I aerated the wort in the 3 gal carboy for 2 minutes and pitched my yeast. Sealed it and now I am wondering wtf I did will be ok or if it will kill me.  Long story (sorry) short, I have no idea what to expect and I was wondering if anyone out there has just said 'hey Im going to see what happens today" and what the results were. Not sure how efficient the brew was as it was my first all grain but its all a learning process. (I am a novice homebrewer and I would appreciate any feedback. I really do enjoy the craft ----) Thanks for reading! :)   huge help! Thank you   Wow this site is incredible. Thank you! I ordered a kit that comes with a 3 piece ball valve, coupling, SS mesh filter etc. Cooler on Amazon. Looks like I have everything I need coming my way minus ingredients!   Ah thanks! I worry about the rules. Slowly noticing people take the trial and error approach with building these (and other things) I guess. As long as you have a seal, something to filter out grains on the inside, food safe parts and a way to transfer into a kettle, one would assume everything will work out, no?   I also feel like this has many of the components to help jump start the project. Ball Valve coupling gasket etc http://www.homebrewstuff.com/1-2-weldless-bulkhead-w-deluxe-valve.html      Thanks, Chino_Brews! I understand now. I will look into this more as I get familiar with homebrewing.    Ah. Thank you for that clarification. Thats what I thought. Very informative. This is a new hobby for me and I am excited to take it further. Even more pumped to drink this brew :D   Thanks! When you say 'not that great', how do you mean? I am not too worried but just was wondering what the community thinks. I didnt hydrate the yeast before pitching. What are the benefits of that?   I brewed a 1 gal batch of Irish Red the other day. Wondering if adding too much yeast affects clarity of the beer. They said to add roughly half but I may have added 55-60% of the packet at most to the fermenter. The fermentation was "happy" to say the last. Very active and I needed a blow off. When I exchanged the blow off for the air lock the aroma was very pleasant! Looking forward to drinking this one in a few weeks. Any thoughts  ??      If you could join a fellowship with any character from The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, who would it be and why?

 I think I only watched or liked season 1 and 2 also.  When I think back, I don't know if it was comic gold, or if I was just a stupid teenager.   I remember that shit!  Fuck I liked Mad tv...   Once read that deja v could be connected to tumors in your temporal lobe.  http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/brain-tumour/about/brain-tumour-symptoms   Sinatra!   That's what I thought!  Then I found it on my computer and shit my fuckin' pants!    It's nothing compared to the other things mentioned here.  It's gross though.   There's a movie named Angus, from the 90's, that guy was a cool kid in the movie :)  that's what I think of anyway, I actually like the name because of that movie.   She is so pretty!   I didn't downvote you.  Dick.  And I didn't say nag them during their haircut.    If someone were to really come to me and want me to make their hair look nice and feel healthy, but only wanted 1/8 of an inch off, I would definitely try to convince them to do the least I thought was necessary.  But I wouldn't start til we were on the same page, and I definitely wouldn't do anything they wouldn't want me to.

The only way you'll get a decent part, is if you part it when it's very wet and let it dry like that.  Sometimes the hair is naturally forced in a certain direction, and it may be difficult to change directions.  But it should.  I wish I had more advice.   That's a good one!   My husband does this.  I ask him why, he says, to show its authenticity.  But he insists there's other ways to prove its authentic.  With his own argument,  he proves the sticker isn't necessary.   :'D how exciting!   This is a lot more complicated than you would think.   First off, if you have any artificial hair color already on your hair, a lighter color will not do anything. Hair color is a lot more gentle than bleach, so it won't break through artificial hair dye to lighten it.  Sometimes when you dilute hair color, it inhibits it from depositing a nice tone and you may be left with more of an unwanted warmer tone.    There are factors that need to be considered,  just be sure to talk to a professional in great detail before you waste your time.   I have to say, I thought the first Saw was pretty enjoyable;  while the next 20 were insanely unnecessary.    Insanely cruel!  Call them!

Thank you    O man, you have the best taste in products, I agree 100%.   Correct this if it's wrong, but once you deny the holy spirit, isn't that blasphemy?  Isn't blasphemy the only unforgivable sin?  Unforgivable, as in, no chance you will get to heaven?   This has nothing to do with christianity or atheism, this is one person's opinion on his personal experience with inappropriate behavior from an adult.  The fact that it makes you so angry is scary.    Meanwhile there's small fundamentalist religious groups that marry 12 year old girls with old men, and you're here complaining about this guy.

This was his explanation:  "Should I have lied and said it was the worst thing that ever happened to me? Should I have mendaciously sought the sympathy due to a victim who had truly been damaged for the rest of his life? Should I have named the offending teacher and called down posthumous disgrace upon his head?   No, no and no. To have done so would have been to belittle and insult those many people whose lives really were blighted and cursed, perhaps by year-upon-year of abuse by a father or other person who was deeply important in their life. To have done so would have invited the justifiably indignant response: How dare you make a fuss about the mere half minute of gagging unpleasantness that happened to you only once, and where the perpetrator was not your own father but a teacher who meant nothing special to you in your life. Stop playing the victim. Stop trying to upstage those who really were tragic victims in their own situations. Dont cry wolf about your own bad experience, because it undermines those whose experience was  and remains  so much worse."   -Richard Dawkins   "Should I have lied and said it was the worst thing that ever happened to me?

Eulogy for a Dog, by George Vest    Gentlemen of the jury:   The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy.   His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful.   Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith.   The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most.   A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action.   The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads.   The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.   Gentlemen of the jury:  A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness.   He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side.   He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world.   He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince.   When all other friends desert, he remains.   When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.  If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.   Her response is more like she's letting him know he won't be judged.   I need to learn how to do that.  That would be a fun skill.      Well you helped me!   The cutest idea ever!    There's another one called Fall From Grace.   Yay!  See, everything's fine :D    How unfortunate.

Some color removing systems contain bleach, you have to be careful what you buy.  Even with color removers, you can't expect the best case scenario, the results *can* be minimal depending on how much color has been deposited on your hair in the past.  But at least they are safe and you can do them multiple times.   Artificial color doesn't lift artificial color.  It will only change the virgin growth.  That's why the process is more pricey,  it's a process.  You have to use professional color removers or bleach to lift out artificial color.

Well this is Las Vegas, NV.  Nothing is grown or bred here.     I disagree.   Gouda cheese alone would be like $8.  We might get deals in the US, but this is insanely cheap.   http://www.imgur.com/Dr6uVJd.jpeg  That is a blended haircut, and your pics are not.  See how the sides graduate into the top length?  In your pictures, the top is disconnected.  Please tell me you notice the difference.   Amazing haircut!  He looks like this guy...! http://www.imgur.com/A59Vymt.png   It looks like a 1 1/2.  I think an important detail is that in the pictures you're showing, the sides aren't blended to the top,  there's a very clean disconnect.    You have to show the stylist those pictures and tell them you want it disconnected like the pictures.  If someone were to walk in and tell me they wanted a 1 1/2 on the sides, it would be my natural reaction to blend it, which creates a very different look from these pictures.   More like what I say to men like you.   Does silver or gold compliment your skin better?  If gold, you should have your hair a warm shade, if silver, it should be a cooler tone.  Most colors have a warmer or cooler version.  Say red, warm red would be more copper, a cool red would be violet.                                     	103
 Oh, you were apart of those clowns.  Nice job removing shit pots, the quality becoming awful.  You're sitting here bragging sub count and all these cute accomplishments, it wasn't enough.  You did "your best" but it clearly didn't do the job.  The hating was becoming really mundane and of the generic variety, so no you weren't keeping up the quality.  It was that drop in quality that led to FPH's doom.  Don't blame the admins, everyone knows they're asshats, but you Mods sure did a clowny ass job, yet still you sit around reddit still patting yourselves on the back.  All huff and no puff.  If you had done your job, you'd have seen the direction of FPH ...of course you all thought you were doing a good job...ignorance.  There was a time FPH was safe, then the mods just lost vision.  In the name of censorship/fuck those admins, FPH should still be here, but not for one second would it be right with you degenerates running that ship.  Please leave it to capable hands.     There you go again, believing the mods had it within themselves to understand how to police something like FPH.  Just from your comments, you clearly couldn't.  FPH seemed pretty important to you, and for me it's survival means something a bit different, but look at the sub as a whole for a minute, it was pure and unabashed hate as you say, but it wasn't always pitched as such, so when you have a community that remains ignorant about what it is, while also having mods that can't control it; holy fuck it's a mess.  Too many loose ends that that whole team of mods was never going to get under control.  You really think that crew could get it done?  They did a good job kicking and screaming for a day on reddit, but what next?  What was plan b or c?  You think fatties have plan b or c?  It's cake and icecream.   FPH Mods were incapable, that bunch of clowns had zero foresight.  It sure paid off for them to be arrogant while ignorant.  This is going to be a neat case study one day, those mods will be immortalized.   Then the mods should have not pretended like it was for helping fat people.  If the mods did their job, and kept the users from hating on actual people rather than fatty ways/habits; maybe FPH would still be around and maybe we could still have fun.  But they had to just allow random blatant misplaced hate to run wild.  That was very smart, smart way to get kicked to the curb.  Maybe an attempt at discretion or subtelty would have gotten the mod's a lot further than just "pretending like they weren't promising to be a help subreddit."  It's a childish tactic, one that would not slip past those fatty admins.     holy fuck, so happening.   Sorry, it'll be more like months before you move to DotA then.  Those clever fuckers porting over League aren't done yet, they've done amazing work though.   where to make buy?   Nothing, it's perfectly usable.  Source 2 gives DotA2 an updated UI design and engine, it's going to help my eyes and my crappy computer so much.  Wait a few months, League will be ported by some clever fucker over to DotA, so you can still enjoy League.  Design language moves forward with time though, and you gotta admit, the new Source 2 UI speaks to the new language in design.   Fph would still be around if it didn't draw in so many dankmeme posters.  The jokes/hate quality really took a dive.  FPH was once quality entertainment.  	8
 [Now everyone smile!](http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2011/12/men-in-black-3.jpg)   Been doing this since I turned 21!   Little bit of Halo and some CoD with the friends then go out and make ass's of ourselves!     I do snowboard in the winter.  I love it!  Had the same board for some years now.   Rome Graft w/ Burton custom bindings.   It's been good to me.   I tried it and it didn't turn out to well.  I get the speed-wobbles bad on fast inclines.   I can't control my breaking.   I actually played poker since 10nth grade high school.  I did local matches around my last area and it was a blast!   You need that money to make money tho.   I'll have to check if there is any close casinos.   I just started mountain biking.      I have terrible shoulders, here is a few of my accidents that led me to the ER.  1. Thanksgiving playing Wii tennis with the gf  (dislocated shoulder) 2. Driving down the road and I sneeze   (dislocated shoulder) 3.  Climbing out of the lake using a ladder to get on the dock (dislocated shoulder) 4. Eating a girl out and she moves her leg to quick (dislocated shoulder) 5.  Reaching to the top cabinet at my apartment (dislocated shoulder)  There is a lot more and always explaining to the ER nurses always comes with laughs and tears (from me)         Thanks for the replies!  When we first moved in it was not bubbling, but after awhile bother apartments started bubbling in both spots.  I pointed it out to my landlord awhile ago on a mid term inspection.   I would fix it myself even since it would cost about $50.00 and my labor.   Which is better then $400.00.  I will call them again or the mangement team for complex.     I just didn't know if there was any loop holes to this.   I live in an apartment complex.  It has 7 total apartments.  4 of them were redone including mine and a friends that lived next door.  The friend actually moved out last week and while we were moving a tv stand it clipped this linoleum flooring and tore it.   It's only in the entry way.  Anyway where it caught the flooring was because the flooring was actually bubbling up.  They barely put glue down it seems like.  Underneath is another linoleum flooring, but seems to be glued down a lot better.  It's just really beat up.    The flooring in my apartment is also bubbling like it was in my friends apartment.  I contacted the landlord a couple times but no response.    Am I screwed on the damage deposit?  I can upload pics for a better idea too.       ^^**PENIS!**     I dare you to do it one more time      Or if you read [here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Torch) the human torch dies in the comics and Spiderman joins.  So, maybe it could work?        It's like a mini golden retriever or lab.     I had no interest in watches.  I started reading the details and looking at the pictures.  I find it fascinating having a little running machine that does something that we find so simple, yet huge in our lives.  It's amazing.  Thank you for this!   It's not actually Tosh just a friend that looks like him      Just watching some Caturday cattoons.        they can't!  Didn't you look at the pic?

Maybe it's a her, they never really disclose during the show.  The character was introduced in the late early/mid 2000's.  The producer of show the felt they needed a character that the more "special kids" could feel apart of the show.  This was the last ditch effort the big wigs would try to save the show.   So far, the ratings of the show have increased enough to keep it aired.  They should pull through for more seasons.  The real news is who plays the character "Flip", none other than the infamous graffiti artist, Banksy.   Plus, who the fuck is gonna tell someone over the internet not to adopt a pet.

If there is a game already like this or in the making, please let me know!    Note:  I'll expand more on this once I know this already doesn't exist.               I have two habits, one I do more frequently than the other, whenever I am under those stages. The one I do the most is I put my backhand up to my face, so my knuckles are barely touching my lips. I than proceed to move my hand up and down so my lips hit each knuckle. I have no idea why I do this, but I been doing it since toddler I guess. The second, is that I take my thumb and pointer finger and gently rub my earlobe with my thumbnail ( --that could be wrong ) while applying pressure with my pointer.   Both of these habits really soothes me I guess? I become relaxed and feel focused while doing one or another. What about you reddit?   Do you have any strange habits?                  I need to find a bottom steering column plastic for a 2006 rav4 and I am in a time crunch, but the interwebs isn't showing anything.   Anyone on Reddit got any places to order from?

The routing of my IPv4 traffic is different from my IPv4.   My IPv4 traffic is routed through the DS-LITE Gateway of my ISP and not directly.  Because of this I don't have a dedicated IPv4 address myself, I'm sharing my IPv4 address with a lot of other users.   This in turn means that at evening, were more people are using the internet connection, the connection to the DS-LITE Gateway is a little bit jammed, but my IPv6 isnt at all (because it would directly connect to Smite).   Hi!  Does smite natively support IPv6? I'm asking, because I wont get no real IPv4 address anymore from my ISP. He only gives out IPv4 via DS-LITE (Carrier Grade NAT). The main disadvantage is that every evening my IPv4 ping raises to about 150ms, but my  IPv6 ping is steady at about 20 to 30 ms.   * **Camera:** Nikon D3200 * **Lens:** Tamron 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II * **Aperture:** f / 6.3 * **Shutter Speed:** 1/640 sec * **ISO:** 400     	10

I didn't hear about Tusk until Clerks 3 was canned for the time being and that was 2-3 months ago. You'd think somebody would of thought to at least release a trailer or plug it someplace other than his podcast. Have a feeling that this is turning into Jersey Girls 2.0.   MY EARS!!! OH GOD MY EARS!!!   27, born   raised in the Midwest, and 95% of the people I know have kids and are or were married.   Just turned 27 Wednesday and this fits me perfectly.   These latest ones give me a chance to "practice" before the big one. Can't wait for the big one.   Tough - Justin McBride  Big Boot   Can your SS see what subs you are subscribed to or is it based all on your comments and post?   This makes me want to put batteries in the GPS and get back out there.      If soft scrub and a green pad isn't cutting it then it sounds like somebody shouldn't be touching the pans.   Thanks to the network the PPVs have turned into Sunday Night Raw unfortunately.   Love this song but hard to believe it's 23 years old. I feel old now.   Like I mentioned on FB for anyone who saw it, but signed up for Postcards and Trick R' Treat for my first EVER exchanges. So excited I can't wait.   I must find this store.      I usually cross the Lewis and Clark, take a left at 100, and take the river road through Grafton usually making Pierre Marquette the turn around point.   Can remember it like yesterday. Was listening to the scanner at the time they put a call out for a construction accident with person trapped. Next thing I know they disregarded the ambulance meaning he was already gone. Have to say Bob was one of a kind. Never got the chance to meet him but just by looking at what he has done you can see it.   Where was this when I was in meat class in Culinary School? Would have saved me a ton of wrong test answers.   Nope just saying he better look again because she's not only topless.   Topless huh? Yeeeeah ok. Hey OP you see that area below the tan line? Yeah that's where you came out. Sweet dreams!   Have had both and would take t-mobile over Sprint any day. Granted I did find some deadspots with T-Mobile.   Lived here all my life and have never heard this story so fill me in.   Only misdemeanors!?!? SMDH   Not the one I was thinking of but this works so much better.   Need that Picard pic STAT.   We had two of "that guy" in my neighborhood. One moved away 2-3 months ago and he was the street drunk. Everyday his wife would leave for work and he'd go up get himself a bottle and get shitface wasted. Had to call the cops on him a couple times because he'd want to fight after getting drunk.  Other one still lives next door and is a good guy in all but he's out there. When he's outside his voice carries where I'm sure you can hear him blocks away.      TL;DR if this was already posted:  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/20/quiet-neighborhood-shaken-by-small-plane-crash/15977361/   Funny part of this is you'd get the ticket and he'd drive away Scott free.   It's no different than what it is now. I mean someone can still raise a shitton of money, withdraw it, and go live it up.   Same   Would love to see these typed up and published. I'd buy on release day.   Basically a box to hide something. Back in the day they used to have bootleg cars that had secret compartments to hold moonshine. That way if the cops were to stop ya they wouldn't find it. This box here though could have been in a house where if it was raided by the police nothing will be found.   Looks like a bootleggers box made to look like an old radio.   I remember about 20 years ago when a local grocery chain added computer screens with gps to their carts. Now this was mid-90s so that was advanced for us.   Old Town Donuts?  Yeah the DD didn't last long at all. Went once and had such bad service I never went back.   Dave is that you?      Mine happened earlier this year, and it doesn't sound like that big of a thing but it was to me. I connected with a girl I know on a personal level. Basically we sat up and talked all night.   Oh god this screams PsBattle material.   What's scary about it? If you don't want the work done and know that it's BS just throw it away.   Yeah I don't think it's low blood sugar because after I sleep I wake up feeling just fine, and plus I can still function when this happens.   I like it. You have anymore you could post?      We need an AMA with your Aunt.  Edit: Just saw where one is being planned.   Pedobear Approves!   Wood chipper and pig farm nuff said.      This great news calls for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye8mB6VsUHw   Got one in my wallet right now. Had to ax over the app along with a copy of my culinary school idea. If you're not in school they require a business card.   Ahh let's present the evidence shall we: http://fox2now.com/2014/09/08/two-jefferson-county-construction-workers-describe-michael-brown-shooting/  "The two unidentified men, who were working for a Jefferson County construction company, watched Michael Brown die from half a football field away."  "The Fox 2 witness immediately wrote down what he saw.  He also drew a diagram showing him and his co-worker about 50 yards away."  Oh and here the unreliable witness kicker: "Both witnesses said they did not see the reported altercation at the police car, but looked up after hearing a shot or shots."  Also I've noticed that before the incident occurred your last post was 2 years ago but let this happen aka something that could build karma you're back and posting about it like crazy. All I can say to that is the bandwagon has left the station Bye Felicia.   You should cross post this in r/nottheonion.   Why post a link when you won't believe it. In a way you're just like me. What I mean is you believe what you believe is right and won't be turned any other way.   You do know that distance changed right? When it was first reported they said 50 yards away yet the next day it went down to 50 feet. Anyway I'm done talking about this because i got better shit to worry about than a black kid getting shot by a cop. It turns into the same old song and dance and the song keeps skipping.   Explain to me how in the hell the construction workers saw what happened when they stated themselves they were a half a football field away and only looked up after hearing the first shot.   That's Matt Foley's wife. She left the van down by the RIVER!   Looks like a test tube holder.   Because it took some of those 6 weeks or months to come forward. Enough time to make up something based on what the others are saying.   Sauce?   This IS a jury looking at every piece of evidence laid out before them in order to consider an indictment or not. This is not a fly by not thing that is going to be done in one day just because they have 6 wow 6! eyewitnesses that are not all that reliable.   That is no where enough evidence to indict somebody because it is not reliable and not the only evidence they have. They have to look at the actual autopsy reports not only the one the family ordered which IMO is unreliable because the Dr. performing it didn't have the x-rays or the clothing. Also they have to look at the self defense claim thoroughly and make sure it was actually self defense which looks to be the case. Like has been said before unless Ofc. Wilson is hung by the balls none of the protesters are going to be happy.   Loved your character in Waiting. Was that the role you tried out for to begin with or what they thought fit you best?   Well if that's enough evidence which it's not last time I checked toss everybody up and throw away the key cause I'm sure we've all done something where there were 6 and more eyewitnesses. It's why when I was going to school for Criminal Justice they taught me to separate the witnesses so they can't feed off of each other which seems to be what is happening here.   Yeah there might be 6 eyewitnesses BUT are they 6 reliable eyewitnesses? I could saw I was an eyewitness too by going by what others are saying. Doesn't necessarily mean that I was there.   Special Agent Orach Red here with Special Agent Sun Daisy   Comedy Forum in St. Charles still around or is that all Electric Cowboy?   Mainly depends on what area you're in. Since certain parts on St. Louis have unique delivery options.   Probably going to come up with another sob story just that in this one the grandmother died and they want to spread the ashes.   After reading the article and the comments here I just have to say this: The problem here in not McCullough it is the fact that the protestors want Ofc. Wilson hung by the balls to put it simply, and the protestors are feeling that with McCullough prosecuting the case he won't do that. I mean the Pope, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, or Your own mother could be the prosecutor on this case and unless the balls are hung the people asking for McCullough's resignation still won't be happy.   Chef here too and the only thing I'd use that for is decoration.   I see Wayne Brady skinned Blue.   I'm saying with fall coming early we're going to get hit with winter early as well.   Well no wonder it's hard  read and at the bottom where if people found what they wanted higher up they're not going down that far.         Ahh the fat coconut eater. He has had some good matches in the past but the last year or two its been ehh.         LET HIM OUT!   Hooters   Where did you find that at?   Until you get rid of the people running that town i.e. the Mayor and Police Chief it's going turn into that saying You can polish a turd and it's still a turd.   Ditto. Birthday is a week from Wednesday and was thinking Fast Eddies for lunch but this place needs the business.   Give that server the middle finger from me for even taking that order.   Sauce?   It's not in the tread. Not in the tread? Not in the tread they said. So brush your teeth and go to bed. If your Mother find you, you'll end up dead. Cause it's not in the tread they saaaaaid.   Oh come on just roll with it.                                 Does anyone know of a bar here in St. Louis that'll be showing the PPV season opener?  	108
 I had a great dane when I was little and my Dad got rid of him. As soon as I had my own house, I took my first bonus and bought an Akita against my wife's wishes. Like your wife, they were inseparable until he died at 13.   My coworker sent flowers to the dental hygienist who was nice to him and got the same response   We don't always get it and I wonder if it's when we make it too strong and add water to it. That may allow the solids to have more liquid to saturate or suspend in as it cools   I almost saw it like the movie Rob Roy and his clan, but Bilbo wasn't really the clan leader as far as I remember. More like a direct member of the clan family, the Tooks.    Tolkien pretty much avoided any references to social divisions with the Hobbits in his books. Other than a mayor and sheriff, I can't remember any other references to government or social structure. How Bilbo even lived was pretty ambiguous. Other than Sam being a Gardener, the other hobbits were of unknown skill and vocation.   As for their relationship, we see guys walking down the street holding hands or arms around each other and many people think gay. In other places it's not that unusual. I see it a lot in India. To them it is like women doing that in the US. It is not that unusual and doesn't draw certain conclusions.   I also don't think the traveling companions saw Bilbo or Frodo as masters. They were more the reason they were on the adventure, than a master they were following. There was no indication in the book that Sam was protective of Frodo before he was given the task of protecting the ring bearer. I think they became best friends on their journey. I agree that Sam was likely the stronger of the 2, but we have no way of knowing what the effect would have been if Sam had to carry the ring as long as either Bilbo or Frodo did. I don't recall Sam showing any hesitation giving back the ring in the book, like they made it seem in the movie.   Tea has a lot more solids in it than filtered coffee. It's just the solids coming out as it cools down and the solution(water) cannot contain as much solid (tea particles) My wife drinks cappuccino and it has a lot of solids too and it does the same thing but much quicker.   We also drink a lot of ice tea during the summer and put it in a glass jug. Some teas seem to cloud up more than others. It seems to have something to do with the natural strength and the amount of powder in the tea. Weaker teas that I have to steep longer or with more leaves, and tea bags or powdery teas like a breakfast tea seem to cloud faster for me.   Aren't most Ceylon teas chopped leaves and not whole leaf? Almost like a good Darjeeling or Assam?   Check out our history in South American in general and Venezuela in specific and you will see why the US talking about human rights is taken with a grain of salt there.   Our actions in South American over the last 100+ years make me doubt our vow to spread democracy and human rights throughout the world. We supported some of the most vicious dictators in the world in Central and South America as well as many other areas in the world. Perfect example: Saudi Arabia. Where are our actions against them to stop the beheadings, lashings, cutting off limbs, preventing women from having any rights at all, etc, etc.   The issues between Venezuela and the US have little or nothing to do with their human rights and everything to do with their oil.   In Daytona Beach you are able to drive on the beach. One of my buddies was driving and we were all scoping some cute girls in their bikini's. Apparently the guys in the car in front of us were scoping the same girls and slowed way down. When we hit him our bumpers locked. Everyone except the 2 drivers were amused.   I had about 30% movement in my shoulder prior to surgery. I went to a therapist 3 times per week for 6 weeks. They also gave me a chair that passively manipulated my shoulder, which I used for 6 weeks as well.    I've had both shoulders done and this Dr was not as involved in my therapy so it was a little slower going. It helped but not as much as when the Dr was involved after the first surgery. People I know who had a similar problem and did not have surgery or did not follow through on their therapy, are still suffering from severe lack of movement.   I go to Planet Fitness so I did 1/2 the leg machines on 1 day and the other 1/2 on the other day. Mostly top and bottom thigh and calf on one day and inside and outside thigh and stomach on the other day. Bike is my cool down so I always do that. I avoided all free weights until I was completely done with therapy.   All sorts of nations cleared out the natives when they moved in. Step back a bit further and see what the colonists did to the Caribbean natives.    I have a good friend who's Armenian. They were also killed in large numbers by the Turks and they have never acknowledged what they did and still refuse to admit to genocide.   I think it about the ability to make others aware that makes a difference.  How many newspapers or radio and tv stations are owned or were owned by the native Americans? Their voices were never heard.   The Sound of Music   Followed closely by Mary Poppins   I had my labrum repaired last summer and I did the same thing. As long as I stretched my shoulder before, during and after, it was ok. I still have to be careful with working the upper body.   I did something similar, but I had a ring on and it shattered the glass in my hand. I am still getting slivers coming through my skin 30+ years later.   I have a BS in Computer Science. We have people on our team who do not have degrees though. For controller configuration it would probably be something like computer certifications, but for different hardware manufacturers. Allen Bradley is a good example of someone who does this type of work.   I had 10 years of manufacturing plant experience before I got hired into my current company. I was brought in to do technical installations and configuration of the software, but they needed someone to train the end users so they asked if I would be willing to try it. I have been doing it ever since.   Travel can be a pain in the bottom too. Most companies fly you out and in on weekends so you may only be home 1 day before you are leaving again. The working hours when you are out of the country can be monstrous too. 12 hour days is not unusual.   I do not get to see much of the local tourist stuff, but I do get to meet and learn about the people who live there.   A lot of people started on our team by coming up through the support center where they learned the applications and how to communicate with customers. Personally, I spent 10 years in sales working with the same industries I now do training for. At that time I was just a computer geek on the side.   Quite a while ago I read a similar story.   A guy got a hand job when he was on a trip to China and when he got back to the states started having some problems. The first Dr. had no idea what it was. The 2nd Dr asked him if he got a hand job when he was in China. Turns out there is some virus and he was told they had to amputate. The 3rd and 4th Dr's said the same thing.   He went back to China to get another opinion from a Dr with experience in his problem and was told; "In the US they always want to cut stuff off. If you wait a couple more weeks it will fall off on its own."    sorry, sw=software.   There are lots of applications that are used all over the world. I work with industrial applications mostly. There's also lots of work on the configuration side. Those jobs are usually extended stays; 3 months to a year. They need people to configure the robots and other automated systems. They usually work for the automation companies. Training requires less specific knowledge and a lot more general knowledge.   I have anywhere from 5 to 50 people in my classes or I could be directly on the floor of the plant working with individual users. My trips last for as little as one day for regional manufacturing sites or up to 2 weeks for international sites.   Examples to support this?   My guess what you are seeing is countries like China and the USSR were more concerned with everyone having a job. In capitalist countries it is all about profit and productivity. The owner will fire you if they think they can make more profit without you.   Tai Chi would fill a lot of your requirements and offer a lot of other benefits   Thank you very much for the link. I will try to find at least the 1st one when I am there. I brought about 1/2 a kilo home with me from Taiwan when I was there in October. I expect to do the same thing in Vietnam.   Thanks. My favorite teas come from Yunnan, China. Vietnam shares the same mountain range there and the tea can be very simiar. I am looking forward to trying a nice variety of Vietnamese teas while I am there.   That is the story. Thanks for sharing. :-)   I train sw applications around the world. I joined the military when I was 20 to see the world. That didn't work out so well because I got jacked around with the contract I had and the school I was guaranteed. Seeing it as a corporate trainer is even better because I travel first class most places and stay in 4 star hotels.   There is lots of travel involved, but that is a bonus as well.   Fat? He didn't look fat to me. He was a big guy though like he once could have played football as something like a linebacker. He made enough to eat and fill his basic needs.   Public transportation in Detroit sucks and there are no jobs in Detroit. He could not afford a vehicle but he was motivated enough to do what he had to to put money on the table. He has done this for well over a decade.   And as for the money he got through crowdfunding was because people liked that he worked so hard when so many are willing to sit back and take. They chose to give him 5 or 10 bucks to help him get on his feet. They felt the effort he has put into keeping his job showed that given the chance, he would make good decisions.   And here is something else for you to chew on; a dealership gave him a car too.   There was someone who named their daughter La-A and got upset with the teacher who called her Laa. The mother said, don't you see the dash, it's La dash A. Face palm   I appreciate all the helpful information   It's been a while, but here are the rolls imo:   Rogue: sneak roll   Victim: perception roll   Rogue: I assume the other hand is using victims throat to control their head so there is a roll to choke   Victim: reaction roll   Rogue: -2 on attack to get knife in position   Victim: reaction   Act plays out  Both: reaction roll    Rogue: +2 to attack, +4 to crit Also -4 to defense during encounter due to both hands being used.   I'll be in the old French quarter in Hanoi for a week on business with a Sunday to explore.I'd like to find some nice teas if possible. Are there tea stores like in Taiwan? Also, any suggestions for things to do or be aware of? Thanks   When I was in Taiwan the tea store made a 12 year old pu-erh. His method was to boil the tea for about 5 minutes and then put it in the gai wan and pour fresh hot water over it and steep as you said. He said he did that to wake the tea up.   With the cups, it was noticeable in the store. The gai wan did not show its crackling until it had been used a few times. Customs opened it and when they put it back together, they didn't secure it so it got a little chip too. I'm heading back in a month and may get another one. The cups were cheap, like 3 US. The gai wan was about 50 US. It's made from a nice clay.   A local tea shop has 3 grades of it and I actually like the medium grade more than the top. It's $6 for 50 grams. The top grade one is $9 per 50g, bottom is $4.50 per 50g.   Like others have said, I like to switch things up. I love Yunnan black teas. They age like red wine but they are so good fresh, it makes them hard to save for later.  On the other hand a really nice Oriental Beauty oolong from Taiwan is tough to beat. I recently fell in love with old tree black tea from Taiwan. A lot of the black tea harvested in Taiwan is a strain developed when the Japanese controlled the island in WWII. It is a lot more like an Assam tea. The tea from the original tree plants is a bit more rare. I found it incredibly flowery like an oolong but more hearty like a black tea. My favorite though - TWG Yunnan Gold Needle. It's too expensive to make it a regular tea so it is always appreciated.   Here is a gai wan and one of the teacups I bought while I was in Taiwan. It's hard to notice the crackling in the glaze in the picture but it really stands out nicely on both the cups and gai wan.  http://imgur.com/gallery/BRg3jhY/new   http://www.yunnansourcing.us/store/index.php?id_product=461 controller=product Traditional Process Dian Hong Black tea of Feng Qing  It's a really nice fresh tasting tea that compliments the little honey I put in my tea. One of the things I like about Dian Hong's is even if you over brew them, they do not get bitter or overly tannic. They also have a nice malty, slightly smokey taste with lots of floral notes.   No, but I will be in Taiwan again at the end of the month and I am looking forward to trying some new teas again. I did just order 7 strains from your Chinese site. They have the 2015 spring teas in. I think one of my problems with trying to find the flavors from T2Tea or TWG is I am trying to hit a moving target. By that I mean that since Yunnan black teas age so nice, I am likely getting much older leaves than I do when I order from you because as multi location retail stores, I am sure they are buying in bulk and sell what they have before they place a new order. For all I know the T2Tea Grand Yunnan that I fell in love with was from a 2007 crop or something and they had it sitting on their shelves and in their warehouse for 2 years. I do absolutely love the freshness of the teas I get from you. I cannot touch your tea quality in any retail store in the area.   If you like the Bond movies at all I'd recommend Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise books. He has 13 books and years of comics. The books are excellent because you get a lot more substance, but his stories are very good whether in comic or book form. The books have 2 main characters; Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin. They are ex criminals who now help the Brit's intelligence service. The bad guys are even better than Bond's bad guys.   Have you tried any Jo Nesbo? His books deal with serial killers and a cop who chases them. I've found his books to be very well written and his stories are tight.   Anything by Pratchett or even Vonnegut. I am a sucker for good satire and they are both excellent satirists.   **From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler** is an excellent book for boys and girls around that age.   These are for light reading, but the Modesty Blaise books are excellent. They are similar to Fleming's Bond books, but I find O'Donnell's stories a bit more interesting and realistic. And Modesty is a far more interesting character than James Bond.   Kafka's The Castle as an example of the futility of life. Howard Zinn's A People's History of the US as an example of how the little people get stepped on. Huxley's Brave New World or Orwell's 1984 to show the future and change the framework we view some of society's actions through. Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment as an example of how we distort our world both to the positive and negative, and it is just a downright depressing book.   Also, I use a gaiwan about 20% of the time but typically just use a strainer and place that in a travel cup for 1.5-3 min depending on the tea.   70% of the tea I drink is from Yunnan, about 20-25% is from Taiwan and the remaining 5-10% is from India. I get my Yunnan teas from Yunnan Sourcing (Both the US and Chinese sites) and my Taiwanese teas from Dragon Tea House. I still need to try some of their Yunnan's to see how they compare. The 2 best Yunnan's I have had were Grand Yunnan from T2Tea in Australia and TWG's Golden Needle. They both have a scent and flavor I have not found elsewhere. They are both expensive teas to get delivered to the states. Thanks for sharing the info. I will try to look at the video later.   1984 2400 baud modems. Lots of BBS and finding information was harder than finding some subreddits. There was also a lot of sketchy stuff going on. In some ways, it was a lot easier to find the sketchy info on the web than it is now. There was a site called Long John or Pirate something that had all sorts of info on making drugs, explosives, scams to pull, ways to hide from the system, etc. Back then no one thought, who is watching me do this. Now that would be my first thought.   I was wondering the same thing. When I switched from Prince of Wales bag to loose, the change was significant. I liked the change, but I had to brew it different. Less tea and less time brewing was what worked for me.   10-20sec infusion? Maybe for English Breakfast tea but oolongs and most other teas need more time and even most people who drink breakfast teas want the bite you get from a decent brew time. I just carry a plastic cup to put my strainer in. Even a ziplock works in a pinch.   I have bought some tea online that also had a sea water flavor. I didn't drink it after the first try. I assume it had been waterlogged somewhere along the line. You could try different brew methods, gaiwan, strainer, pouring over leaves, putting leaves in hot water, etc. I found tea tastes a lot different depending on how you brew it.   Yes I have. I really enjoy that tea. It reminds me of the wild black tea from Taiwan.   I think you're right. I was in Taiwan recently and it seemed like it was mostly small farm products that were sold in just one or two stores. I can't find any of them online.  Feng Qing is a county in Yunnan province. I've tried a few of those and they are nice. I do not know what Jin Ya is. I think Dian Hong is just the bud and top leaf or 2 leaves.   a fairly hot milf is my guess   I had the same problem. Lent out my original, got a different translation and wondered how I could have liked it. It did not flow at all and it was a chore to read. I found the Penguin translation again and loved it again. I think it is challenging to maintain the flow or poetry of a book when it is translated. I can't even imagine how challenging it is with poetry where the number of syllables is maybe more important than it is in other literature.   vegetarian chili. But make a lot because everyone will eat it. I use 7 beans, red,green and yellow peppers. a couple of habanero's a couple jalapenos and 1 hot cherry pepper. I use both fresh tomatoes and canned and some paste to thicken it up.   My son started out with sauces and worked to perfect a couple at a time. He then started to learn Indian flavor profiles. Unfortunately his girlfriend is getting all the benefits of his skills now. It was like having a 4 star chef in the house. He was very good at building flavors.   Dosadi experiment by Frank Herbert. It's a much better first book to get into Frank Herbert than Dune imo. It should be easy to find used.   There are so many variables. Some strains, especially pure indica's, are known for couch lock. If someone cuts their plants down too late, the chemicals change and you get more of the one that makes you relaxed or tired too.  There are strains in the dispensaries around here that people call house cleaning bud because you cannot sit around really when you smoke it. It really lights a fire under you. But like all strains, the names mean little. The strain I am talking about is Bubba Kush but not all of them do that. Maybe because of crappy growing, genes or even cutting it down too late.   The names we get for Dian Hong's are funny. Yunnan Gold Needle, Grand Yunnan, Yunnan gold tips and now I see your White gold. It looks like a nice dian hong though.   I love your teas. I am still searching for a replacement for T2Tea's Grand Yunnan, but I am enjoying trying your Yunnan varieties. Some of them are very close to the taste of the Grand Yunnan. So far I have tried about 10 varieties of your Dian Hong's and the Red Alio (I may be getting the spelling wrong) is incredible.  	57
       I was losing the ethernet link. Damn.                     Yeah. Share with other friends.   Try to download the app from Apple AppStore.                     Also you can use the HBO app for iPhone or iPad.            Means an iMac Touch?         yeah, about 15 minutes.   agree. plus apple tv is not so expensive that you cant upgrade after 2 or 3 years.         "there is no easy way to get that content to consumers" makes some kind of sense.            April fools for me... :)            Awesome!   April fools?

Thank you.      If the CPU is not an ARM I believe that the size is normal.         And this is not the only wait. Also need to wait compatibility with tweaks.          short and clean jokes are not for fathers?   Yes, but there are inexpensive models from nVidia   Jarcoke   I installed successfully an Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite in my Dell Optiplex 780 with GeForce GT 430 through Clover. Only using loadvbios option.   Just uninstall beta and remove rpetri.ch repo. The 1.9.1 version of Activator will show in search.   At the 1.9.2 beta 1 (reading the changelog) seems that the Touch ID force was disabled by the dev Ryan Petrich... It means that is not possible use it without an event. I dont understand why (possibly battery drain).   Nobody fucks with the Jesus.   Its a bug with Activator within the new update (1.8.4~rc1 at Ryan Petrich repo)... I think it will be corrected after new update in a few days.   Moranguinho desastrado.    kkk   nope. any conflicts and I use Jellylock7 togheter on lockscreen. I just remove the Forecast option "Show Current Weather" cause IntelliscreenX shows at the top screen.   IntelliScreenX, Forecast, Touchy and Ad Blocker.    Pwntunes   Thank you! Good tip!   Natively only Air Print ready printers are supported in iOS. TruPrint was a tweak that make possible send to a big number of network printers, but its devs didnt update since iOS6.  The PDF printer for Safari (never was natively, only inside apps) at Cydia dont work with iOS 7, wait for an update too.   Well, it would be so much usefull, the tweaks that support those functionality are not compatible with ios 7.   It could be nice! air print ready printers are so few...  	68

 Do you mean job shadow now? Is there even such a thing as job shadowing at 16? This program allows me automatic acceptance to UCF but I really want to go to MIT or Stanford and I feel that UCF is a considerable step down from those goals. Plus I heard top tier schools like that won't take an AS.   Yah it says computer programming and analysis. I know it's pretty obscure. That's why I said it doesn't matter if it transfers. By the time I would finish I would be 18, would anyone even give an 18 year old an internship or higher paying job because I have a degree in computer science vs. math?   That's really the problem, I don't know what I want to do. I just want to do something with engineering but I have no idea what type because they are all interesting to me.   No, it's to also to do dual enrollment but wouldn't get me a as in programming. My hs only offers up to Calc 2.   I'm 16 and about to enter my junior year. My area has a local community college that offers a dual enrollment program. I've already been accepted and had a plan that involved me finishing linear algebra before I graduate (just finished Calc 1 this year) and being done with physics. Then I realized I could get my AS in programming and now I have no idea what to do. Just to let you know, I don't care what is more transferable for when I go to a four year college.  	5
 That's why u sleep when you want your quarter, so you won't be traumatised when she arrives.   Na, were main characters in every bodies story. Everything we do effect one another.    CREATOR OF THIS POST, know that you have saved lives with this thread, thus saving many worlds. I thank you.  Also, I like to say that this reminds me of the theory: every thing you see is an illusion, a vision inside your head that you can not prove 100% to be real.  If this theory is true that means that, with the power of your mind,  you can change the world anyway you want.   Pls tell me vid I need to know    We should ask this to gold member   It's like that movie where the evil oil monster is defeated by the wood chipper and he gets trap into the tree. Ferngully I believe the name of the movie   Remind me of old video" my anus is bleeding."  	7
 Added!! please add back, i need mankey haha :)   Added, please add back?  	2
 i have been using recreationally for about 10 years now and i am still relatively young at 30.  I have been really good with not getting out of control in the amount i take as well.  i have only done pills like vicodin, percocet, norco, etc. never smoked, snorted or iv anything.  i'd say the most i've taken at once was only around 30mgs and when i use its around 20mg so yeah i would like to think that i am pretty responsible with my habit. I have had morphine in the hospital and it was great but i couldn't function whatsoever and have never tried seeking it out otherwise.  getting to your question:  Man, that's a hard one.  I'd really like to hope things never get that bad where I would feel the need to shoot heroin.  I enjoy life and need to be a functioning member of society or at least try to be lol and i feel that if i was shooting up heroin then that wouldn't be possible.  I just feel like if life is so bad where you are using heroin and I have rarely heard of a heroin user who cannot go a day without using, then your fucked basically.  Who knows, I might end up one day going that route but i'd really not want to at this point in my life. hope this makes some sense.      haha yeah but this was exactly what i was going to put as a comment til i saw someone already posted it so i just copied and pasted it in agreement lol   MFDdayshiftOld Head 1 point 3 hours ago  6 x 5 = 30 no matter how you slice it, youre in for the same night as normal.  beat me to it!   pill crusher than chase it with tonic water   jesus christ are you gonna be getting sawed in half or something!?! lol   THIS   verichrome 19 points 3 hours ago  Dude, stop thinking about it and don't look back. Your life can only improve without opiates.    definately do not do it!! i drank a bottle of expired codiene once and fuck.......... long story short, lets just say it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  oh and the stuff i drank was maybe 2 years overdue.  but 1991?!?! LOL holy shit!!!   i would say shoegaze type music. think my bloody valentine or lush.   i'm not denying that you can score there. probably the easiest spot in the city actually but assuming this person is a white upper middle class looking dude who is walking thru the TL paints a funny picture to me haha.  anyways if he wants it that bad he'll find it.   damn your straight up telling this guy to go to the tenderloin hahaha.  i guess if you are that desperate.  i am from SF all my life and its common knowledge to stay clear of this area but hey i am sure he will find what he needs there.   wow be careful with that haha. hopefully she isn't driving while taking that pic too lol!   have you been on a large dose for a long time? i have been on 10/325 for about 8 months and never any issues. seems like a nosey person. even if you were on a large dose for a long time it shouldn't matter i don't thinks its really their business as the pharmichist is really just a middle man.   i thought trainspotting was really good. it seems unbiased.   i got a killer hang nail. need a morphine drip stat   yeah my buddy is trying to talk me into driving cross country to go there after seeing oxycontin express.  i said naw i'm cool off driving that far for a possibility of getting pills lol.  i tried to explain to him that as far as what i have heard things have tightened up quite a bit there.   yep florida in its heyday was amazing i bet........   if you can somehow prove the nerve is exposed i bet you'll do ok.  i've had about 5 root canals. knocked a couple out and a couple due to grinding my teeth when i slept. i was given a small amount of 5/500s. 20 pills with 3 refills i believe.  this was all done in sf bay area so i dunno but thats my experience with that.   I think you might have to jump thru some hoops and stuff a bit but if you have around 300 bucks you probably will get something.  I was about to go this route but needed a referral plus xrays from an immediate care place and it was getting too pricey so i didn't even do it.  I wasn't too into dropping that much $$ for potentially ending up with nothing.     i do tonic water sometimes. seems to help but i think its just a placebo effect.    ive tried grapefruit juice for potentiation. didn't seem to do shit for me.     yeah i know. i'm not looking for opanas anyways haha    never tried opana.  actually never really even heard of it til about a year ago.  anytime i'd get anything good for pain it was always just generic vicodin 5/500s and now finally norcos but it was never even discussed with my doc about percs, opana or other opiates. maybe because i have kaiser and they don't do business with the makers of opana and percocet?  because aren't those just the brand names?  like norco is the brand name of 10/325 hydrocodones too right?!!??  when kaiser prescribed me them they are generics and made by mallikondrit or whatever company that is.  i suppose if i wanted to i could ask for the brand name but it'd be way more expensive. sorry for all the noobish questions haha!!    is that the ingredient in percocet? if so i have hads percs before. really weak 2.5's tho haha. they were white with blue speckles.   i'd say you are lucky to even have a dealer!! haha its pretty much impossible for me to find anything on the streets where i am.  plus the fact that he seems to lag is a characteristic seen in almost every drug dealer its like instilled in them to be flaky/late.  you'd think that dealers would be capable of being on time if all they have to do is hand over some pills and make a grip of money all in under a few mins but for some reason at least for the people i have dealt with almost don't want to make the easiest money ever.   yeah but if you say that you might run the risk of the doctor running you thru a buncha shit like xrays/ct scans etc thinking he will need to re operate or something.  i have been thru a similar experience is why i say this. in the end i didnt get any more meds but ended up spending a couple hundred bucks and wasting a lot of time.     yeah i can def see that happening.  i am usually best when i'm alone since a few times people have kinda killed my buzz when they have tried to have conversations with me haha.  sounds kinda selfish but yeah.  its kinda like i gotta focus on my high and not do anything that requires a lot of thinking lol.  I only use 20mg hydrocodone to just buzz so i'm obviously not nodding out.     yeah either that or the acetominophen.  i mean how much would there be if you really ingested 100mg of actual hydrocodone?  a lot, that's all i know haha.  i think it is just shitty reporting/wrong facts/reporters don't know shit about medicine.      yeah i can see how that happens like when i drink sometimes i get overly emotional but luckily for me never happens on opiates. always a good mood.     my point exactly!?!? i dunno man. some people pointed out opi rage which i have never encountered.   ive never taken near 100mg of vicodin haha.     ahh ok.  i have never experienced that. opposite effect on me.     noob question, but what is opi rage?  i have heard the term used before but can only speculate as to what it means.   good luck mine were impacted needed to be cut out and i got darvocet woohoo!!!   i'd think taking 100mg of vicodin would make him mellow out and not want to shoot anyone if having any effect at all on how he acted.  always makes me feel way more peaceful and less angry/agitated. just my 2cents.   why the fuck would you post this disclaimer or not.     i've taken them before. they were weird shaped but had that cursive v on them like the 5/500 vics i'm used to. anyways they weren't that great it felt like i had to take a lot to get anywhere but i did feel it a bit.      yeah i'm basically in the same boat. i just kinda went through the motions and graduated high school.  then at least when i went to college i was able to have a lot more control of the type of classes i could take so it was a bit easier but i still hate sitting in a classroom for x amount of hours. i know a lot of people that use add/adhd as an excuse for a lot of their shortcomings and it's just annoying.   never tried adderall but i was on dexedrine which is similar to ritalin i believe.  i dunno, i was in middle school when i was prescribed it for "adhd"  i quote that because i seriously can't say if i have it or not.  its kinda a crutch a lot of people use for being dumb shits imo haha. anyways, that shit didn't really do much other than make me loose my appetite and not want to eat much.  I only took them for a few years.  I have noticed that when i take opiates i am a lot more easy going and just in a better mood all together than when i'm not on them.     i have done the raid the medication drawer thing many a time before.  i felt/ feel really shitty about doing it but it was impossible for me not to grab a few pills when they are right there in front of me. most of the time it was just 5/500 vicodins that were leftovers (i checked the dates on the bottles if i had enough time).  that doesn't justify what i did though i know.  this was before i was able to get a legit script and i haven't done it since.    sorry to say but you are an alcoholic.  I went thru something similar for a few years straight.  Just try to go 24 hours without any booze.  Once you get that first day, it get way easier after that.   10 bucks for 60 10/325's a month from my doc.  I think I can afford that!!   i've actually never tried tramadol. heard it was not gonna do anything and i don't want to take any more pills than I need to so yeah i just chucked the script i had for like 20 of them.  i have had darvocet if it is like that.   to add onto what i just posted the last time i got tramadol i just threw it out. i thought it wouldn't do anything for me and i'm a lightweight (20mgs hydrocodone and i'm good)  is tramadol even comparable to say 5/500's?    all this over tramadol?!?!     and yeah i always knew it was spelled contin not cotton. duh. haha.   i did?? i dunno, it wasn't intentional.  i guess i am not good at using this thing haha.   ah i thought you opiate users were supposed to me mellowwww broooo!!     i believe that is how mr wyte spells it!   the link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMLtj6qSsc      yeah they do the job for me!   lol i know this. read the comments i already posted!!   thanks man. only a couple a day work for me i'm not trying to get too crazy here haha   i know that and i'm not snorting them haha wtf.  i don't like swallowing pills so i usually just crush em.  this is a lot better than what i use to have to take- 5/500s.  i don't use a lot anyways i take like 2 a day   why wouldn't you? but you know best so tell me why not   you mean physically big?? they aren't when you crush em!!      Interesting. I now have a new bookmark and that kinda means a lot because I rarely bookmark shit hahaha   i had some prescribed to me and didnt want to take them cause I knew they wouldnt do shit and nobody would buy them off me so i threw em out.  i'd say they are useless.   if you have 1 or 2 beers you should be fine.  at least you arent taking 500's. I'd be worried most of the apap but i still wouldnt pop 6 10/325s and drink any alcohol at the same time though.  I will admit in the past i have drank and taken pills at the same time but i'm talking a few beers and 1 norco.  Its a good mellow feeling and intensifies both the beer buzz and the opiate high but I don't mix pills/alcohol anymore.   thats tough. i just turned 30 and look a lot younger so its been really hard for me to get docs to even to give me anything even though i have quiet a file at my hospital for surgeries/ dumb accidents. but yeah hopefully you feel better with that medicine and you are able to be functional!!    damn thats gnarly and you are only in your 20's!?!  i'm sorry to hear that- back injuries suck!  good luck with your pain management.     not trying to be a dick but how do you get these prescribed to you then turn around and be able to flaunt it to the net?!? shouldnt you be keeled over in pain right now!?!?!  (jealous)    btw what state are you in?? i am in california, bay area.   thats total bullshit. i am in the same boat as you i believe.  young, in actual real pain yet I do like to take pills and I will admit i love the way they make me feel.  I have quite an extensive file for injuries/surgeries for my young age so that is to my advantage but yeah its still fucking stupid how dumb it is to legally get anything. even 5mg vics. so what else is there for people like us to do?!?! i'm not gonna start going on the streets to find heroin, i know that much.....  right now i got my doc to scribe me 10/325 norcos. i only take 2 a day so i am barely scraping the surface of most of the peoples use on this reddit but i feel guilty already with that. it sucks cause i had to even build up to that with my doc!!  anyways that was really lame of her to judge you, i've had docs do that to me before.   that sucks, that doc sounds like a fucking dick.  were you really pressing him or trying to get some really strong shit that he would obviously know you were just going to abuse!?!?     they work a ton faster and are much safer than a razor blade imo!!   i've had that one but the clear and blue pod looking one works better for me.   I have owned that exact same one as in the pic.  I have a bit different styled one now that i believe works better. I think i got it at wallgreens   I always notice it kills my buzz when i start eating that is why i usually ingest on an empty stomach.   i usually only get presealed bottles made by qualitest via kaiser so i assume that they are going to be accurate.   non existent    For me its having a longtime doctor that trusts me to responsible with what she prescribes me (lortab 10's).  I have been good about not burning thru them quickly so i always get my refills.      yeah muscle relaxers. i have a shitload of samples of them for some reason. never taken any though.  they are probably expired now.   thats about when i had mine taken out.  I hadnt discovered opiates yet so i didn't even both to ask the surgeon but i shouln't of had to- its his job to prescribe what is needed for pain and trust me i was in pain for about a week after with only ibu 800s woohoo!!!   You got so damn lucky.  I didnt get any narcotics for mine and my wisdoms were impacted!!!   never used it but have been to it.  seems too risky and most people on there seem like scammers.  not taking a risk sending cash to someone i don't know without any knowing that i will ever receive my product.   ok i wasnt sure as I have never messed with any pill like that but they work great on regular pills.   for several things but mainly because I have been getting my whole mouth filled with dental implants due to grinding them away when i sleep.  also had to have about 5 pulled and have gum surgery on my upper gums.  Other than that I have had about 5 surgeries for broken bones just from dumb luck.  I am relatively young too (30 y/o) so my doc is really sympathetic to my condition haha!!   $10 for my prescription of lortab 10's.  i get 60 of them about every month.  I'm not a heavy user so i think I can afford 10 bucks about every month or so haha.   get a pill crusher from wallgreens or somewhere like that. i do it with norcos and take them orally and it hits me harder than if i just popped it.  I never have had your kinda pills so not positive it would work with them but it def. does with a regular pill.   i doubt you'll get anything. i've had about 5 done and never get anything. the point of a root canal is to end the pain you have been having.     near chico ca and its dry as fuck out here.....   how do you guys get so much strong shit prescribed to you?!?!?!     I am near chico and you would think it'd be easy to find something but I havent had any luck!!!    	85
 Hi Reddit,  My boyfriend has been taking Citalopram (celexa) for his depression for a month now but he has admitted that he has no desire to have sex. I asked if I could make him want to and he said 'please don't do that', I asked if he thought we would any time soon and he said he didn't know.  I was wondering if anyone with experience of this could give me some advice on what to do? We have been together three years so it's not the end of the relationship if we don't have sex for a while, but I already really miss feeling intimate with him like that, and it's upsetting me thinking we might not get that back any time in the foreseeable future. Especially as we're so young.  Every time anyone mentions sex I get sad.  He won't want to change his medication as it seems to be working for him so far, and at the moment I don't think sex is very important to him at the moment.   I would really like some help with how to handle this, what I can do, and how over people have handled a relationship without sex?  	1
 Thanks, appreciate it    Yea I've learned that now, being from the northeast I thought it was always sunny and nice there, learned my lesson on that trip    Yea I realized after I submitted it that messed it up but didn't feel like changing it, my bad    Yea, the cat is always the master in the relationship       It was taken on Atlantic, it had been raining my whole trip and then the clouds broke while I was going to lunch    Yea we did, it was an awesome place and nobody was around, we couldn't believe it       Yep, my girlfriend and I were playing cards up on the lookout when I took this    Lexington Park here, just joined Reddit and found this, I've been here a little over a year            	13
 I am the brother and I can vouch for this. It was a strange few moments of conversation when everyone discovered that we were back-to-front wipers. However I feel like we stood our ground enough that we put a shadow of doubt in their heads concerning their current wiping methods. I'm confident they tried it our way.   Righties laughing when I tell them that Lefties are the people most discriminated against ever in the world.  Also nobody makes a quality tape measure that Lefties can read. They only offer a "read from any angle" tape which uses print so small and chaotically set you'd be better off guessing how much tape got pulled out.  	2
 as far as I can tell, winter, summer (which it is currently and he drove past just recently)   the guy who drives the icecream truck around my area does seem pretty happy.    Ha, could create some awkward situations.   So these are now on my list. Thanks!  My list is growing, and I'm really focusing on these few words/ sounds. *thumbs up*  Edit: kinda reads like I want to create awkward situations. I didn't mean it like that.     I know, and I admire your guts and bravery.    I accidentally de-scabbed a cat once, no pus involved,  but I couldn't eat anything for a few days after. So gross. So very very gro...*retch*   I feel so awful for you, what a shitty thing to happen. I hope it works out and those horrid people don't get anything from you.   Don't blame yourself too much, I know people who have eloped after a short amount of time and have been happily married for years with no signs of trouble. You trusted someone, that's not a bad thing.    I think you fuck up is picking your cats scab. I'm going to vomit now.  But good on you for caring about your pets, but gross still. gross.   this.  I'm vegetarian, but if I had to eat meat it would be hunted, wild, free range (legally killed). I will never ever eat any commercially, mass produced meat, that is barbaric and something we don't need to do.  Use this as as opportunity to educate your wife.   hahahaha.  Thanks, I had a good giggle at that.  I am adding them to my list.    thanks for the links: checking them out now.  and taking note of schwul and schwl    noted, thank you.    I'm not really worried, just curious, also I think knowing small things like this will probably help with learning pronunciation generally- give me an area to focus on and perfect, while avoiding embarrassing situations.    I've been laughing at this out loud for a long while.    I was 21, would definitely take it back, it was awful. It was about 5 in the morning and as soon as he was done, I got dressed an ran all the way home through the rain, freezing cold, crying, it was terrible.    This reminded me of when a stranger said to me "you have a black and white cat, do you miss him?"  I do have a black and white cat and he lives at my parents so I rarely see him, I do miss him.  Once the man walked away I checked myself all over for cat hairs...none...He was just magic.    When I travelled over to the US, I got very drunk, had a super bad hangover, so my friends left me at the house of one of their sisters to sleep while they went out.  I woke up after a nice nap and realised I had absolutely no idea where I was or how to get to my friends. fortunately the friends sisters housemate was home and gave me some water, offered me a bread roll, let me pat his dog and gave me directions.   He was nice.    Saw a lady had twin daughters one called something like Kate- normal, not at all wtf...  Her twin: Twinae. like Twin-A, like the doctor labelled her that on the scan and the parents thought "lovely, perfect name for our child"   Also know a lady called Gay Crack.   also: Anytime a parent chooses "Nevaeh" a part of me dies.    If my parents truly loved me, they would have named me this.    I was just doing some reading on language for uni, one example in the reading was about how people who speak English as a second language will avoid saying certain words (example was 'sheet') because they worry about pronouncing it wrong (example:sheet becomes shit), and asking "Where can I buy shits?" is a bit embarrassing, I guess.  I'm currently an Australian learning German, are there any words that I might have this problem with? I'm finding German pronunciation to be quite difficult, particularly 'ch'    Have you watched Louis Therouxs "A Place for Paedophiles"? Because if no, you should, it's pretty depressing.    When I was in school (year 9 maybe) I got in some trouble after a teacher found stuff I'd written about modern medicine and how it's counter-productive to the continuation of a healthy human species.   But, if I had a serious life-threatening condition I would not hesitate to seek medical help, even if it's natures way of saying "you're weak, we don't need you"  I was an angry teenager, my views have relaxed a lot since then   100% yes,  When I was a kid I got really upset when I learned I couldn't freely travel the world. Why? This is my world, I want to be a part of it all.     anarchy all the way   But then when the elderly inevitably die, the world loses them anyway, and hopefully if they have anything valuable to contribute to society, they already have in someway and recorder or passed on their knowledge.  The young are full of unknown potential (many of them may be completely useless) but losing them is potentially worse than losing an elderly person who's value we are already aware of.    I've never thought about this, but it kinda makes sense, even if I feel bad for saying it.    There should be a one child policy in all/ most countries, the population of earth is already at unsustainable levels in some places, and it's only getting worse.   thanks, I'll check it out.  I sometimes play youtube videos for them, like 'count the trains' kind of thing. they get into it, but their counting goes something like "two two two eight eight eight eight ten!" But they are enthusiastic about it, it's cute.     In case some talented women wish to grow a nice mo, Manuary is exclusive, Movember is inclusive.   yep, and they are improving, but slowly.    got confused by  Blacks and whites vs African American and proper terminology     I have never heard of sensory vests, sounds interesting.  They do have visual schedules, but the boys don't really pay too much attention to it.    of course, I wont think of them any differently if they have ASD :) I have worked with autistic (and other disabilities) children before, and adored them all.  unfortunately, even with that experience, I struggle with the twins. My sister (their mother) told me yesterday that she had to wrap one twin in a blanket and hug him for a while to calm him down because he was trying to destroy the house... I think having to resort to things like that makes her question her parenting.  we have tried time out, other calming techniques with them, but they don't really work. but i think preventing the tantrums with fun activities is the way to go.   so I will check out r/autism, might find many more ideas and advice. good suggestion, thank you.   I have been trying to figure out how to get bean bag supplies and make them before thursday (when i see them next), but maybe I will just get them to throw their teddies instead haha. might be an inside game...   and thanks for talking, it really is helping, and making me feel a lot more positive about things   no official diagnosis, although Autism Spectrum has been mentioned.  They are great kids, I feel bad watching them struggle when their other siblings are doing so well, watching their sister who is 2 years younger than them doing better in a lot of areas than they are is really heartbreaking, and they are at the age now where they are aware of this. It doesn't take much for them to lash out and turn violent from frustration.  I really like the bean bag idea, it's so simple but seems like something they will enjoy, and I think I could even make the things myself, so that's this weeks project.    Hello and thank you!  Yes, they see a speech and physical therapist, so I think they cover a lot in their sessions, speech, enunciation, posture and eating/swallowing etc.   Thanks for the suggestions, I'm heading off to google to do some research, they really seem like excellent ideas, and I truly appreciate it.   I just worry about their development, and I know their parents do too, they also go to kindy one day a week which they are benefiting from, but I think more home activities will be really good for them.   thanks again   Don't wear clothes, your body needs to 'breathe', you'll feel much happier and healthier that way.    Gosh yes, my family doesnt approve, but since cutting my sister and her boyfriend out of my life, I feel far less stressed.    makes my head hurt too, what memories, thoughts, dreams, hates and loves are in that brain?    Hi parents,  I'm an aunty to four year old twin boys (and their 6 year old brother and 2 year old sister)  I babysit them 1-4 days a week while their mother is studying.   The twins have severe speech delay, they talk at about a 2yo level, although they are intellectually normal, their speech affects their behaviour I believe, they get frustrated very easily and it doesnt take them long to go from quietly playing nicely, to throwing bricks at each other.   I have no idea how to entertain them, they wont sit still for long, they wont read books with me, they like to throw things, so its hard to play organised games with them, they don't really follow instructions very well.  They spend most of their time digging in dirt in their backyard and playing with trucks or cars.   Outside play is good for children, i know, but I feel like for their development they need a variety of activities but I'm just stuck for ideas.   their parents also have no idea how to entertain them.   thanks    has it been useful? good quality? worth using?   Use realeastate.com.au or domain.com.au to look up rental places, lots of share houses listed regularly or units, you can search by map too which is helpful   Uh, excuse me,  but South Australia was founded my people of good character only.     not interested because she's crazy. go with that.    this- plus I'd recommend stopping the drunken sexy times with her- if you are looking for a serious relationship with her. You need to back off a little because I don't think its a healthy way to start a relationship.    the egg that made me began inside my mums mum, which just weirds me out   why is it bad for children to have sex when they will grow up to have sex anyway?   some things are wrong   I havent played murder in the dark for so many years. Next time I'm with a group of friends....    I would have closed the door and found a new toilet to use, I admire your efforts and determination.    reminds me of the first time I got really really drunk, I tried catching fireworks, nearly vomited on a sleeping friend (missed by cm's), sang a few childrens songs, begged for my mum... While I thought I'd just got a bit drunk then went to bed quietly.   Put me off raspberry and coconut flavoured things for a long long time, 5 years later and it's still iffy.    looks challenging, I prefer the simple, already coloured books.    I agree, it's not a good scenario, but that poor guy is desperate to help is child, its a lose- lose situation.    TIL if you hold the mouse under a foot while waiting at the door, then meow normally, the humans will let you and the mouse inside.    naw, I get regular hugs from a red kangaroo and regular bites from the greys.    once an elderly couple ignored those signs and tried to overtake my dad (truck driver here in aus), the car got stuck under the front of his truck and he pushed them a few 100 metres down a busy main road because he didn't see them there, he wasnt aware until he stopped at lights.  He pretty much covered the front of his truck in mirrors after that.    Dying is bad for her, the smoke is nothing in comparison to a serious illness.    the sounds they are making are just...blergh, so gross.    And it does take so long. A long boring repetitive task.    "blatantly stupid" might do it   are you sure you aren't being lied to and you are actually in some kind of 'home' ?   well, it was released... but not necessarily unharmed, fear and stress can easily be fatal for kangaroos.    yep, kangaroos growl and hiss and cluck and tsk and bark.    As a female, I have one shaved leg, one hairy leg because I got bored.    my life is a series of half-arsed attempts   There's a good lookout spot in vista, just up from cyress crescent I believe.      My dad once asked if I wanted to go surfing with him, I told him "No, I don't want to get eaten by a shark" He replied with "Live until you die"   I still didn't go surfing though, but I try to not miss out on fun things due to fear. Living a good life and dying young must be better than living a dull life and dying old.    So this is a little old,  but thought I'd add... try a darker hair colour, brown would be safest by dark red could work too, grow your hair a little longer and try a wavy style, go to a stylist to get this done and get your eyebrows waxed and tinted.   Braces probably too, if it's possible,  it did so much for my appearance.   Good luck   I like the beard too,  but I think you should grow your hair out a bit,  then wait for the braces to come off and you'll be fine.     Agree.  Although, as a beard lover,  continue to grow that stubble out, not too long,  just enough to define your jaw area. Ace.   Then punch your 'friend' again.    I love it! A plot I wouldn't have even imagined, it's great! It was positive and depressing all at the same time.    Hey look, there's me.   My head is hurting trying to understand how I am 'in' this photo.  The worlds so big and I'm a puny human      Recently my friend was grieving the death of one of her rescued kangaroos,  the other kangaroos all came and put their hands on her and stayed with her as she cried,  even though they aren't really cuddly animals most of the time   This warms my heart, what a lovely dog   A few years ago I was walking my two dogs,  ones a mix breed (monti) and the other a dalmatian (maisie) who was very intelligent and a lovely dog.   Anyway,  as we were walking monti was a little further ahead of me and maisie, Maisie starts slowly creeping up on monti,  obviously planning to pounce on him.  As she was getting closer, mont turned around to look at her and she instantly switched to a casual jog, looked away from monti and acted like nothing was going on.  As soon as monti looks away maisie starts her sneaking again.   This repeated a few more times until maisie got close enough to jump on monti.   It was hilarious to watch,  I think it really showed a sense of humour and planning beyond what dogs at usually given credit for.  And another: My parents had two galahs (parrot), both unable to fly that lived in their backyard,  every morning (that I observed) they would sit up on the roof of their cage and watch the sunrise together. Like really just stare out at it and occasionally groom one another.  So romantic.     Peter III of Russia caught a rat that had chewed at his toy soldiers.  After a trial, the rat was sentenced to hanging,  on the gallows Peter III built himself.   Although I think this is more a wtf-you   I wanted to be a teacher and now I'm studying to be a teacher but it's not my dream job anymore.     I think a lot of things that are or could be labeled as supernatural could potentially be just othernatural, the universe in infinite and if we consider the possibility of other dimensions, then it will likely be impossible for us to really know or theorise about everything that may exist.  eg- ghosts, I don't really believe in ghosts as they are described in horror/ popular stories, but I can accept that the chance of them existing in some form is possible.  We don't really understand conciousness as it is, it might be that our conciousness continues on in some form after we die. maybe then we find out what living in a 2D world is like or something.   I think I am more supernatural agnostic rather than believe though.    i guess that if you spent x number of years expecting and believing God will be there for you, you will not easily break that habit.  I have never believed in Gods, I have never felt the need for external higher power assistance in my life because I know that any help I need will come from the physical world around me, or from me.   I have always believed that prayers are simply positive thinking, and positive thinking is benefitial, so I don't see anything wrong with you still praying, even if there is no God to answer you.    I feel like having a colour one would give me the ability to paint like van Gogh...right?  I associate colours with numbers,  but it is pretty mild and sometimes vague so it could basically not happen and I wouldn't notice.    Are they boring personalities?   As someone said,  a suicide hotline, or a hospital,  police,  teachers if you are at school, there should be a lot of people able to help your friend.  In my town (in Australia) there is a number you can call to speak to a psychiatrist,  and they do house visits also. You might have something similar in your area.    Realising how cruel your own brain can be to you in a terrible thing   I'm Australian but for whatever reason assume everyone else is American.      Life is short   Put a pasty in the oven today for the crispy pastry, gave up waiting after a minute and microwaved it and had to deal with the soggy pastry. Life is hard   My boyfriend has very few memories of his childhood and is amazed when I recall various things from mine. I remember my first easter when I was 11mo. That's probably my earliest memory.  Chocolate.     Don't deal with it alone, contact his family or friends and remove yourself from the situation.  Your friend is not responsible for him or his life, do what you need to to get him help and then leave and don't feel guilty if the worst happens.    Agree with this, take some time, talk to your boyfriend, talk to your family. Don't let those awful disgusting people dictate your life.    I have felt like this a few times, like I have completely messed up everything beyond repair.  But I never really did, after a few days or weeks or months things would improve, because I wanted them to, not because I was lucky or whatever, I worked really hard to get my life back on track.    Oh gosh,  mine seems quite alright compared to that.  I love monopoly,  life without it must be hard.     1. Grapheme-colour and Sound-motion 2. When I was young, 7-10 maybe, my sister gets some versions of synesthesia also, we were discussing once what colours various numbers were and our other sister didn't know what we were talking about as she doesn't have synesthesia, but it was a few years later in my teens when I learned about synesthesia. 4. It's sort of neutral, doesn't help or hinder most of the time. But the Sound-motion makes me dizzy sometimes and I would gladly do without it.  5. I sometimes will choose things based on their number, or avoid them for the same reason. eg. I have an appointment for the 20th and not the 21st because 20 is a nicer colour (pastel purple/pink)  than 21 (brown/ green, kinda camo)   Hi everyone,  I'm just wondering if anyone else has a negative experience with synesthesia, as I mainly read about it as a positive thing.   I have mild grapheme-colour synesthesia, which doesn't bother me at all, but I get sound-motion synesthesia really bad sometimes and it makes me feel really dizzy.   basically, it just sucks, and with all fun forms of synesthesia, I get this one.

I don't know what a jackdaw is   You got me.  Years of practice.     http://i.imgur.com/IfdCJB3.gifv not the best quality but its a real, annoying bird   Sometimes a fake one would be preferable. But she is 100% real.    I've pretended to be religious, or at least pretend to not be atheist...which I guess is the same thing... in lesser situations.  The thing with religious people is they fear losing something (eternal life or whatever) if they renounce their religion, so they would rather die than risk losing that.  For me, there is no after life, there is only this life, why would I give that up?       "No!" Replied the mother,  "just flush like everyone else"   TIFU (a few years ago) when I went to do some shopping, a very frail looking old man came up to me and asked if I could help him with his suspenders- One strap at the back had come undone. Being the super helpful member of the community that I am,  I said 'of course!' and clipped the strap back into place.   The old man turned to look at me with his gentle, sweet old man face,  held my hand and said 'thank you, dear', in his quiet and quivering voice, turned back around and walked off.   Then I noticed I'd clipped the strap of his suspenders onto his underwear instead of his pants.  Gave the poor man a wedgie.     	103
 Frank Zappa.   He should be in every music list, because genius.   (I'll show myself out :-D )   HAH! That is so much epic... My bedside alarm only has a cradle for an iPhone.    /me kicks my alarm clock   I think I have found a new item to start prowling ebay for :-)   Agreed.. This.. So much this! I learned about Gong fu style 'brewing' during my first business trip to China. Never would have otherwise found out that the second, and third infusions on most good teas are actually sweeter (and in my opinion superior) to the first infusion. If the idea of navigating around tea leaves while sipping doesnt appeal to you, a Gaiwan is a good choice as a brewing vessel for ease of use, and cleaning, and you can pour the tea off the leaves for each infusion. My favorite tea for Gong Fu service, is a good grade Long Jing tea (Dragonwell).. It really changes from infusion to infusion. Always enjoyable.   Wow.. I'm in the Napa Valley, and our local seller of any quality (Drink The Leaf) shut his doors last year.. I have a lb of vacuum packed Tung Ting, and Bi Lo Chun.. Really need to pick up a tray tho. Might have to roadtrip down to Richmond!   I have a couple 450nM blues I built a couple years ago. The highest power one is about 2,700mW. It will burn skin within a second, up to about 5 meters away. But, the dot is so bright,  it's painful to look at without attenuating  safety glasses. Not to mention that an inadvertent reflected beam strike to your eyes will deliver permanent damage before your blink reflex kicks in... be safe, take care of your eyes.. that said, I can 'feel' a 450nM laser on my skin (less than an inch away) @ about 65mW, but it takes a few seconds. A couple hundred mW will hurt within a second or so.. a couple thousand mW  will scar your skin from close range.   You can touch a 7W night - light bulb after its been on for a while.. it's warm, but not uncomfortable to handle. A 25W  bulb is kinda hot to touch, but not bad. A 200W bulb will burn you, if you try to grab it. Same basic idea with laser powers..   ...Yarn   I've seen a sign like this in a park in the Napa Valley, CA (Skyline Park)  I'm still scratching my head :-)   Those that can extrapolate from an incomplete statement,    Dude, I totally have that same fly swatter!  :-D  Excellent costume, very well executed, and a great story to boot. No half-measures taken!  Have a fun (and safe) Halloween.    Heh, Mine too.. Had it about 1.5 years. The Boil and 190F are completely rubbed off.. No issues with failures tho, and I use mine daily. Pricey for a boil kettle, but really nice to use.   A 6 ft long piece of rope walks into the bar, and sits down.. The bartender says "We don't serve ropes in here.."  Annoyed, the rope takes off, quietly complaining under his breath.  After a week, the rope tries to get into the same bar (hoping a different bartender will be on duty).. The rope sits down, and the bartender says (yet again) "Hey, I told you, we don't serve ropes in here.. Get out!"  Now,. the rope is really ticked off. He leaves, but is so angry as he stews over the bars no-rope policy, he begins to twist himself into coils and tangles. Needless to say, his 'hair' gets mussed up, and disheveled, and he's worked himself into a ball of twists, and coils.  He decides to give the bar one more try, now that he's a little more "incognito"  ...The rope sits down at the bar, and the bartender turns to him and says "Hey.. Aren't you a rope?"  The rope replies: " No, I'm a frayed knot.."  	11

 Jeff--I don't recall if you've ever mentioned Pandante on the show before (I don't think so), but I know you are a fan of David Sirlin's games. If you'd be willing to plug an ongoing Kickstarter campaign on the show, the new KS for Pandante could really use some love.   I don't think Nintendo really sets out with a determination to be underpowered. But, it would be nice if the company put more emphasis on hardware power.   As for third party support, I'm not sure Nintendo sees it as an issue. In Iwata's comments during this presentation, he spoke very proudly about the fact that Nintendo is the only console where the hardware manufacturer is also the biggest software contributor. It sounds like the company sees it as a strength.   I don't really mind the HotS segment, but I would prefer to see any new segments have broader appeal. It's interesting to hear Jeff talk about strategy, but I've been listening to strategy discussions and descriptions of MOBAs on podcasts for years now... and I still have no idea what a MOBA is or how it works. That means, much as I enjoy Jeff's perspective, it's a long stretch of the show where my mind wanders while I wait for something I understand.  Having said that, if Jeff wants to talk about it, I think he should. His excitement can be infectious and it's nice to hear someone passionate about videogames--even if they're not *my* videogames.   Well, not all Catan games have a modular board. Alternatively, I'm sure Rob Daviau could come up with some cool ideas to apply to a modular board.   Well said. It's totally cool if the gaming press dislikes a game, but it crosses the line when a reviewer is openly hostile or vindictive. It's also bothersome when reviewers tar and feather a game in order to make a point about some perceived failing in the industry as a whole.   As Christian rightly points out, the past year has been rife with games that don't even WORK properly. Bugged, busted and flat-out broken. And somehow those games are afforded the benefit of the doubt and given ratings in the mid-80s. Then, when a high-profile console exclusive comes around... well. It's suddenly vital that the entire 10-point scale be used, and the knives really come out to slice up some faults.   I haven't finished The Order, so I don't really know what I'll think of it by the end. But for now I'm enjoying it, and some of the negative reviews are almost embarrassing to read. It's not even the scores so much as it is the vitriol expressed in the text. I just don't get it.   Your experience with Amnesia was very similar to mine with the original Resident Evil. When that hit the PS1, I brought it to a friends house one night while our wives went for a girls' night out. We played through together, and repeated the experience once a week until we were done with the game. Such a singular experience, and I would definitely say that we both "played" the game.   Legacy of Catan.  That is a phenomenal idea!   Sure. It wasn't intended as a personal attack.   Well, I loved B W and The Movies. I also regard Fable 1 and 2 highly. I don't think I'm alone. You're free to disagree, obviously, but the hyperbole isn't very productive. "Blatant display of incompetence"? Give me a break.   This is not a great analogy, because you can often get an equal or greater experience listening to a book as you can by reading a physical copy. You're right that you give up some aspects of personal interpretation, but you are still getting 100% of the content in a manner consistent with what the author intended. People have been reading to one another for as long as the written word has been around, and authors continue to perform live readings for a very good reason--in some ways, it elevates the writing and makes it more personal.  A bad reader can kill a good book (Wil Wheaton, I'm looking at you), but a great reader (such as Jeff Cannata, reader of Traveling in Space by Steven Paul Leiva) is a wonderful thing. In some cases, it can even be an incredibly unique experience--try listening to Gone Girl, which is read by two different readers. It's a wonderful experience.  But, back on-point--watching Twitch is not like reading an audiobook. A Twitch stream lacks all personal involvement and interaction with the game, and it is not what the developer intended. A better analogy would be that watching the Twitch stream for a game is like reading the Cliffs' Notes for a novel. You may get the broad strokes, and you may even be able to predict whether you would like the book/game, but you haven't read the book or played the game. Your opinion is informed, but not enough to offer substantial critique.   Strongly disagree. You're selling him incredibly short. Populous, Powermonger, Dungeon Keeper, Black   White, The Movies, Fable, Fable 2... He has a very strong portfolio, and often produces games that do things no other games are doing. They are both unique *and* innovative.  He may oversell and promise the world, and he may not have made the transition to modern gaming very well, but he is absolutely a great game designer.    I'd say that's not very fair. They talk about games they dislike all the time. Including in this episode (The Last of Us, inexplicably). ;) Obviously, Jeff loves loving things, but they are both critical when it is warranted. You may just be misinterpreting their infectious glee about videogames, in general.  I highly value the integrity on display in this show, and I value both of their opinions. They put it all out there, and it's easy to get a feel for what they like and don't like (and I can adjust my expectations accordingly). Today, for example, I was really excited to listen to the podcast because I've been enjoying The Order, and the amount of hate being directed at the game by popular media has been disheartening. Whether Jeff and Christian liked it or not, I knew they would be fair and have interesting things to say about it. Their positive-but-balanced review was nice to hear, and I hope someone at Ready at Dawn listens to the show.   Fair enough. Words are free, but it's not worth the time to parse the internal motivations of a complete stranger.    I think you're being disingenuous. He said he was worried the game would be praised all over and lead to a push for more cinematic games. That certainly sounds like he was gunning for it to fail ahead of time.  No one would accuse him of being "douchey" for saying that a bad game should get a bad review. Everyone agrees about that. He was worried about his "douchey," pre-emptive desire that the game fail.  	14

You basically have two part-time players instead of a full-time + part-time.                                    Here is my 2 cents about last nights disappointment.    End of the 7th, Scherzer's pitch count was at 108 and he was looking mortal.      Start the 8th with Veras, the unofficial set-up man. Get one out, give up hit bringing up Ellsbury.   Ellsbury has a marked L/R split, so pull Veras for Smyly whom doesn't deliver.      Since Victorino is only batting righty and Smyly's L/R OPSa is .446/.648 pull him for AlAl.    With Alburquerque's tendencies I don't like bringing him in with runners on but he K's Victorino.   Now AlAl gives up a single to Pedroia loading the bases for Big Papi.   Leyland decides to go with his main reliever Benoit.  This is a bad situational match-up, while Benoit had not allowed Ortiz a xBH in 26 PA (.273 SLG), with the bases loaded you don't go with a guy allowing a .385 OBA to the hitter.   Especially when you have an Ortiz killer in the bullpen.       Phil Coke has faced Ortiz 20 times with a triple slash of .150/.167/.317        Why would you activate Coke and not use him in the very situation he was made for?    Edit: Thank you to /u/wjg10 for the link the breakdown over at [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/assigning-responsibility-for-david-ortiz/)      TL;DR It wasn't a fastball down the middle. They call it a splitter (I've seen slider elsewhere) on the outside edge just above the knees. If Benoit missed with the pitch it was not by much.

Yes, their air of superiority annoys me as much as anybody else, but it's earned! I know the horrors of how factory farms treat their animals, and I know it's wrong. I know I could help by ceasing to be a costumer, but being vegan is too difficult an undertaking for me. It's the right thing to do, but even knowing what I know, I can't make that commitment. So Reddit... who's better than you?                                                                                    Because, you know... context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This is sort of a USA question (it's Memorial Day weekend here), but anyone is welcome to join in and represent their own country: if politicians were required by law to have served in the military in order to be eligible for office, do you think there would be more war, or less? Why?  I know in some countries, all men are required to serve.                                                      Here's a pro-Christian story for you. I drained our bank account today to do laundry and go grocery shopping. I was thirty-something dollars short at the register and the nice, old, Christian couple behind me said that Jesus implores them to help me and my daughter. I thanked them about a hundred times and all they said was "bless you" in return. Some of my faith in humanity has been restored :-)  I'm an atheist and I have been most of my life, and believe me, I know all about the evils of religion and the harm it's caused throughout history and today, but we have to be willing to give credit where credit is due.   Yes, I know it would've been better if they'd done it out of their own personal goodness instead of what Jesus would have them do, but regardless, it was a nice thing to do, and I am grateful.  TL;DR - Christian couple pays the balance for my groceries and I, as an atheist, am delighted.                  January 17, 2012           Dear Christopher,     Knowing your concern regarding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on my position regarding this legislation.  I have appreciated having the benefit of your thoughts on this important issue.     H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) on October 26, 2011.  It has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee. The primary purpose of SOPA is to stop the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites.      Although well intentioned, many have raised legitimate concerns regarding the legislation and believe the manner in which SOPA attempts to achieve its goals of stopping the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites is unworkable and includes many unintended and dangerous consequences. I am writing today to inform you that I have severe reservations with the legislation in its current form.  One of the main issues regarding SOPA, is it would force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to websites that have been accused of facilitating copyright infringement.  Blocking access will likely slow down internet connectivity, while eroding the necessary trust the system needs. It would also set a dangerous precedent of allowing our government  and others  to filter domains. Fortunately, all sides have signaled this provision should be dropped.  Furthermore, the legislation would place a tremendous legal burden on websites accused of third-party copyright infringement and would cause them to be removed from search engines.  Even if they made an honest mistake, they would be faced with litigation from the U.S. Attorney General. Fighting the accusations would cost an enormous amount of time and money, and smaller sites would likely go out of business. Private lawsuits could also be brought against the websites. This would open up the potential for massive lawsuit abuse  even though the vast majority of online piracy occurs through a small number of websites.  While the federal government does have a role in protecting intellectual property rights, it should do so in a way that does not weaken internet security, disrupt growth, or restrict free speech and your First Amendment rights.   As the debate on this legislation continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure the needs of copyright protection are balanced with the First Amendment Rights of all Americans. Currently H.R. 3261 remains in the House Judiciary Committee. While I do not serve on this committee, rest assured I will keep your concerns in mind should this legislation, or a similar bill ever come to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote.       It is an honor to represent you in Congress.  Your suggestions are always welcome.  Please feel free to contact either my Washington office at (202) 225-5456 or the district office, (603) 641-9536.  Also visit my website at www.guinta.house.gov  for information on legislative issues and follow me on Facebook at facebook.com/repfrankguinta  and Twitter at @RepFrankGuinta.           Sincerely,   Frank Guinta Member of Congress   My email to Representative Peter G. Palumbo:   You called a teenage girl an "evil little thing" because she's an atheist and got religion out of a public school where it doesn't belong? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Actually, you ought to be dragged out of office. You know what I consider evil? A full grown adult male in a position of power publicly shaming a child who bravely challenged the system and won. You are a coward.  If anyone would like to join in: rep-palumbo@rilin.state.ri.us rep-palumbo@rilin.state.ri.us        	192

It says so right here in your personnel file: "Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall NOT be mourned." That's exactly what it says.

 Of All Time. Those are big, scary words. But when I think of my favorite books, I think about the books that had an emotional impact on me, good or bad. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy always comes to mind when Im thinking about books that match that criteria. At the end of it I kind of just slowly closed the book and stared out the window for a while. It was also one of the rare books that I had to re-read to really get a better grasp on.  Id been writing to try and get published for a while. Then I took a break from writing altogether to pursue a career in law enforcement. Then I decided to write as a sort of stress relief, and to write whatever the hell I wanted to write and not worry about publication. Ive always been interested in survival and post-apocalyptic stories and sobamThe Remaining was born.  Oh man. What character do I identify with? Dont make me say it! Obviously, I identify with Lee in a lot of ways, but if Im being honest with myself, Lee is way more political than I am. Id probably have to say Im most similar to LaRouchefriendly most of the time, but with a tendency towards self-sabotage and kind of coarse. I really do have a warm caramel centerit just takes a little whiskey to get it out.  Haven't read it, so couldn't speak intelligently.   Dammit!

I got started self-publishing The Remaining series in 2012, got picked up by a publisher in 2014 (Orbit), and recently made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. The Remaining series is set to wrap up with the sixth book, Extinction, this month. Im currently neck-deep in my next writing projects, and loving it. Ill be answering your questions starting at 7pm EST, so have at it!  Proof of me being me: https://www.facebook.com/train_subject7670  Edit: That's it for me tonight, folks.

 I have 1 friend I met trough gaming wich i still have contact with but we have met irl and have different stuff to talk about besides gaming, so that is no problem. And yes, some of my friends game and I have no problem with them gaming when I'm around, however, I will always stay on the background instead of joining in (In a FIFA competition on ps3 by example)   These are actually really good questions to ask yourself if you're afraid you might have a computer problem, thank you!   I never said that drugs and gaming are the same thing, drugs are bad, very bad, they destroy people's life so often while gaming is entertainment, so many people enjoy it. How could it be the same? Well, it can destroy lives aswell, believe me. Not in the way drugs do but in more subtile forms, you start to ignore the ones you love, they get frustrated.. You become unhealthy, hardly see people.. This of course will not happen when you are a casual gamer and there is nothing wrong with that, I cannot stress that enough. But there are times where it goes way beyond that, where you really need professional help in order to get way from it's grip.  This seems very weird to alot of people because they assume you can just 'stop gaming' and it's 'lack of self control'. Well, you can just 'stop drinking' too right? No.. Gaming does not indeed reward you in a fysical or material way like drug or alcohol do but sometimes, with certrain people, the rush of winning, the feeling that it gives, can be just as addicting as gambling I am sure. I'm not the worst case by far, I've seen people in the clinic go bonkers because they were denied internet access.   I understand that all this must seems really weird for outsiders, incomprehensable even, but let me assure you, it can be really bad and it is in fact, considered a legitimate addiction by authoroties and such.   I would say that before anything, just like with every other addiction, you have to realise yourself that you spend way too much time on computers and need to stop. If not, nothing or nobody can help. Once you realised this it's best to seek professional advice, they will explain everything to you and then it's up to you wether to decide if you want help or not. Just one more thing, don't think 'I'm going to calm down on gaming, going to game less.' No. Just, NO. That doesn't work, you have to quit everything, cold turkey and try to last as long as possible. Because if you play 'a bit' you'll fall back into old patters before you know.   The irony of me doing this IAmA did not escape me either :)   There are alot of people who think the same as you, so did I actually. But it had been proven that you can actually be addicted to internet usage or gaming in the same way that you're addicted to by example drugs or alcohol. I went to a clinic in Holland (there aren't any (good) ones in Belgium who are specialised in this matter) where they only treat this kind of addiction, there they diagnosed me and offered to treat me but i didn't want to be internated, I wanted to get over it on my own, with the help of my doctor and parents. So far, it seems to have worked.   I'de have to say i was the most addicted to CoD:MW2 the most, the hours I played on that.. It was really bad. Sc2 and War of Legend (a short period, but really heavy) have been bad for me aswell.   Because I was going to start in Computer Science that year and I needed a good laptop to run all the software smoothly. Turns out it ran all the games smoothly aswell, not good.. And I played random so: 1/3rd For the Overmind!! I guess..:p   In what way do you want me to provide proof?   I know the feeling all too well. I think something along those lines would have applied to me aswell. Luckely, I liked sleep too much to actually get up early to game wich kept me atleast a bit healthy but still, it was pretty bad from time to time. There were weeks in the winter where I realised I haven't seen the sun in days, I was basically living during nightime and blocked out the little sun there was.   Yes I have, and I actually did. This was on my old laptop, instead of removing everything I bough a new one (an Alienware, stupid me) and told myself I wouln't install games anymore. This lasted for maybe 3 days and made me realise afterwards that I indeed have a problem.  No, I never got to GM but I've been Top-8 Masters frequently, I think I played too much CoD to actually get promoted (I was #1 5v5 in the esl for almost a year, this made me some money in online tournaments but this was more bad then good, since I used it as an excuse to keep playign since 'I made money with it')   Yes, it really is. This is the longest I've been on it in weeks just because I force myself to leave after 15 minutes each session. I love this site but it's so big and there's an endless flow of interesting stuff to find and peers to discuss with that if I wouldn't force myself to get off the PC, I would fall right back into my old lifestyle. But I really wanted to do this IAmA so I cut myself some slack :)   I don't exactly how or what made me realise I was addicted but suddently I started seeing that the people around me were right and I was actually spending way too much time gaming and on the internet and I decided that this is not the life I wanted to live. So I packed my bags and went to France for the entire summer with a few mates, spent our days surfing and such but I tried to refrain myself form any form of internet usage. When I got back I forced myself to stay away from the PC as much as possible and that's a battle with myself I still have to fight every day. And like I said, I started working, travel as much as possible, mostly for surfing. And the biggest thing probably, I found a girlfriend who lives a simular lifestyle, alot of travelling and such and that keeps me away from falling back into old habits.   Nee, Knokke :)   It's hard to tell to what degree since I always refused any kind of treatment or professional help. In the beginning because I tough I wasn't addicted at all, afterwards because I wanted to stop on my own. But it was pretty bad, I would wake up and start gaming just about untill I went to bed, the only thing I would do besides that was go out with friends or see my girlfriend, no classes, nothing. So I don't really know, pretty bad but not bad enough for me not to want personal contact anymore, or see my friend.  For the 2nd part of the question, yes, I have experienced pain in my wrists (CoD and Sc2 aren't the most kind games for them) but they seem to have dissapeared now, thank God.   I didn't downvote you, it was a legitimate question, hence why I answered it.   Good question, this was hard at first, because every free moment I got, I felt that urge to play again. But I started working this year and have found some salvation if you like in surfing, I surf quite alot now, also got my coaching diploma. Basically, I try to occupy myself as much as possible with just about everything and it seems to work out.   Actually no, I have had a few good, stable relationships. I don't think I'm bad looking and have gotten quite good ad hiding my internet usage over the years.      yeah, I really didn't think this post trough I believe.

See the link for more info :)  http://www.ssa.gov/survivorplan/survivors.htm   It depends on your diet but if you're on a ketogenic diet,  I find that hunger is not a huge issue.   The ketogenic diet trades out your dependency on carbs and forces your body to use fats for energy.  I eat foods high in fat and stay away from carbs. I find that hunger strikes less often and I can go longer between meals.    Social worker here. You and your siblings may be entitled to survivor's benefits from the government.

I assume you're talking about your computer not WIRELESSLY connecting to your router. I'm going to state the obvious, but have you checked to see that you didn't accidentally turn off the WiFi on your laptop?   If that's not the case then I suggest connecting the computer directly to your router using the LAN cable (in order to access the internet) and downloading the wireless driver from the hp website and try reinstalling it.

I clicked a link on reddit and it logged it into my system as porn. Which it was not btw :(   I'm just guessing but I think it has to do with your saliva breaking down the structural bonds of the gum.   Agree, I just got done reading about black holes and quantum physics.    Well at least you're spending that quality time with your father that you've always been missing.   Communication is key. I just come to an agreement that works for both parties. It's nice to talk to each other sometimes.   When I was old enough to realize that the teachings I was receiving in bible class were hard to believe. Upon questioning them I was only given circular arguments which basically boiled down to, "we are adults and we know more than you, so listen to us."  In my middle school years I learned more about history. I learned about how past civilizations had gods for things in nature that they didn't understand and couldn't explain (Roman god of the sun, etc.) We look back on it now and think they were silly for having a god if the sun or god of the sea, yet we (organized religion) have a god that created the universe, since we can't explain that (yet).     Well, anything that breaks the ice, leading to conversation is always a good start.  I wouldn't say it was the most effective way to pick up girls; that's entirely up to how well the resulting conversation goes combined with her actual interest in you.  They were a good ice breaker is what you meant.   Gotcha :)   The article states that he was not in the same town at the time she claimed the rape occurred. She blatantly told a lie.    If it's already been proven that he is not guilty then why isn't the accuser instantly punished? You get punished for falsely screaming "fire" in a crowded building.   Masturbate furiously. Or alternatively, I listen to music.   I clicked on a reddit link and got flagged for porn. Now it's logged into the browsing history.   Bed full of lesbians.   I would say the latter, since it is widely accepted that the light that we see from stars occurred eons ago. Therefore, the present is not observable while it is happening.   I'd rather not be famous and dead.    Yeah, but he got killed.   Would you wish for a lawyer?   Do we ever really live in the present? Everything we see, feel, hear or sense has to go to our brains and then be processed. Even though it takes milliseconds to process, we are never truly experiencing "the present."

Why were you thinking about penises in the shower?   /end thread   Indeed, signing a check does increase the paper that it's on.   Neelix doesn't look like he enjoys performing as a DJ and his style of music is very progressive. It's great for listening to at a desk but at a festival it's boring, for lack of a better word   It really depends on the crowd and what he "thinks" the crowd is receptive to. I was at a private show he did in Hollywood last weekend and he stated that he was playing a Perfecto Dark set but the crowd was a bunch of hipsters who barely even knew who he was.   Only about 3 tracks in, he started to progressively get more mainstream with a more "pop" sound. The last song, all the hipsters jumped up and sang along to. I had no idea what song it was. So as a DJ he completed his job to get the party going, but I can't say I enjoyed his set much.  TL;DR He will play what the crowd is receptive to, whether it be pop or more underground.   You might try looking into minimal techno or minimal trance. Although when you mention "slow, darker" trance in your title, I'm inclined to think progressive psytrance, but that's just me haha   Obviously drinking more. Also I like to DJ.   Make myself owner of Earth.    At speeling correctly   I try not to associate with people who cannot keep commitments. Either that or very harshly ridicule them.

I hate it when they put artists who play radically different styles back to back at a festival. It really breaks up the musical flow of the night.   What record pool and what genre is most prominent in it?   Wait, hold on. "Forced to fuck?" That's the definition of rape. lol  	66
 Not old enough yet? I'm raving about the knife set we got over a year ago   I thought the line was "who hurt you?" Referring to Lionel Richie   Being stuck in traffic isn't driving.  That is commuting. You don't like commuting.   Pse COULD have a deposit.  It could not, also.  Only on approved credit will they not take one   *on approved credit*   The thought is "I don't like driving so I'm not going to learn enough about it to do it well"   Just because you have a license doesn't mean you know how to drive.  It just means you demonstrated understanding of the rules of the road and basic operation of a vehicle.    Driving takes a lot more knowledge about what the car is doing at any given moment.  What is the contact patch of the tires during this turn?  When I apply the brakes, how does the transfer of weight affect the balance of the car? Etc...   They said there could be a deposit, gave them my ssn and said there wouldn't be one for me.   Read: she's a big one   Pse didn't have any deposit for me. But I've had no issues with credit anywhere for a while   Yeah...now. not before the popularity from marketing   [rimshot.com](http://instantrimshot.com/index.php?sound=rimshot play=true)   This pic is older than dirt in Internet years.

Bring it to me, I'll do it for 8%   All the ones I've used have. I bring them a bucket of change and say I want to deposit this.  I give them my account number and they say ok. Then they come back with a slip that shows how much is was and deposit it.  I usually have $50-$100 each time.   Coinstar takes your money, then gives you back only some of it only after it tells you how much there was.  If that's not a waste, I don't know what is.  Most banks will do it for you for free if you have an account with them.   This makes a lot of sense now.  My town had 3-4 of these back when we only had 1-2 subway chains.  I thought they were the best sandwich chain out there.  Carbonara and the prime rib were amazing.

I heard it long before the internet was around, but believe what ever you want to believe.   why can men sleep with lots of women and be praised for it, but women do the same thing and get shamed?   Never heard that one, but it doesn't have the same ring to it.    I never said I believed the idiom.  I just give it a reason for when anyone asks this silly question.   Nope. It's just something that nature has created.  Men want to spread their seed, but if they see that a woman has had too many other men, they become undesirable. Fast forward 100000 years and now we need to change in our current society.     Metaphor.  Master key = stud.  Terrible lock = slut.  When people ask this question, this is one of the better explanations.   Whoosh?    If a key opens many locks, it is a master key.  If a lock is opened by many keys, it is a terrible lock.

I know there is a spot here in Seattle that will do the supercharger when I get it, but all other bolt on stuff I'll do myself   I think you hearing the lifters. Pretty sure it sounds normal to me   Downtown Seattle was the same at noon   It's more trouble than it's worth. A $20 cd player mount is way easier   Ctrl + F Whet = upvote   and didn't even list the first one?   Was right there too, but I don't work there   Very personal issues beyond the depression and after the book was released.  I know what happened, but no idea how she's doing.    Dark things absorb the energy while white tends to reflect a lot of it   We were right down the right side of that pic.      So I ordered the kit on their black friday week specials for $1240 and it arrived today.  It came in 2 separate boxes weighing a total of about 100lbs. It comes in 6 pieces + the hardware.  Tools you need are a 14mm socket, 14mm wrench, 12mm socket, lots of penetrating spray lube, and that's it.    The instructions are pretty basic and not TOO descriptive but it wasn't hard to figure out what they were talking about.  The most difficult part of the whole job is removing the factory exhaust.  I just jacked up the rear my car on jack stands and went to work.  The factory exhaust is 3 pieces.  The muffler, the resonators, and the y-pipe.  It's held on by 10 bolts and 5 rubber hangers.    In my case, the bolts that attached the y-pipe to the resonators were frozen/jammed on there good, I was able to break one loose, but ended up stripping the nut of the 2nd.  Not that big of a deal as you can remove the cross member that is right there and the whole thing came out as one big piece (y-pipe+resonators).  Getting the hangers out of the rubber supports was a bear as well.  They have an arrow tip that makes it really hard for them to go back out after they have been installed. You have to pull on the rubber while at the same time push on the mufflers (and a lot of lube) to finally get them out.  This would have been massively easier if I had it on a lift and not awkwardly squirming on the ground trying to get leverage.  Installing the new parts was super simple.  First put the larger part of the y-pipe on, then the other and secure the bolts finger tight using the factory gasket and bolts.  Then hang the resonators in their spots and bolt it to the y-pipe with the gasket and supplied hardware, again finger tight.  After that, you hang the mufflers in their spots (kinda of a bitch by yourself working from the ground). Last bolt the tubes from the muffler to the resonators with the last 2 gaskets.   From the cats start tightening everything down working your way back checking for clearance of the sway bar and cross member (that you reinstalled if you took it off).  Once the exhaust tips are aligned properly (by sliding the hangers back or forward), you can make sure everything is bolted down tight.  Start the car, check for leaks.  For my car, it was about a 3.5/10 difficulty.  If I had a lift it would have been a 2/10....with a helper and a lift, 1/10.  From unboxing to taking the car off the stands and cleaning up was about 3 hours.  I spent too long on that one bolt and I kept getting work phone calls, so it could have been 2-2.5 hours.  The increase in performance seemed noticeable.  I'm sure I'll use the extra "19 rwhp" claimed by Stillen, but it's the sound that makes it worth all the while.  During initial startup and under load, it sounds mean...but not obnoxious, very similar to the stock sound (which I loved).  On the road, it's actually QUIETER than stock.  Anyone that complains of a "drone" is hallucinating.  I took a trip down the freshly paved freeway near my house last week with the stock exhaust and tonight with the Stillen exhaust.  I also took with me a dB meter.  Stock exhaust was around 67-75db at highway speeds.  Stillen was 63-70db.  I was really surprised.  Perhaps after a few hundred miles it might change as it gets broken in, but we'll just have to wait and see.  I'll post a vid of the exhaust under load compared to stock after it stops this wind/rain shit storm that Seattle has going right now.  **tl;dr  Stillen exhaust is super easy to install, more power, and a mature sound that wont piss off your whole neighborhood.**     I have a GoPro with lots of mounts and will be doing some before/after video's.    What would you like to see?  I'll probably just drive a 1-2 mile route around my neighborhood with the camera stuck just above the exhaust, then again in the cabin.  After the new exhaust is on, repeat it.   I might also do a time lapse of the install process, it doesn't look all that difficult.                http://www.imgur.com/cMWVY0m.jpeg  I've done nothing but baby this thing since I got it a week ago.  Never attempted to replace the band. If it's off my wrist, it's on the charger.    Any suggestions?      That's too bad. I really wanted the metal band to start with.  Now...to get the silver or black trim and wait for the metal bands to come out.  http://gizmodo.com/moto-360-hands-on-the-one-weve-been-waiting-for-proba-1630875506   My wife and I moved to Seattle recently and was looking forward to going to PAX Prime, but missed out getting any tickets.    I thought the face value of these were like $35 each, so I'm not sure why all of them are advertised for $80+ ea.  If someone could explain that to me, that would help.  Unless it's just people taking advantage of others, then...well, people suck.  Anyway, I'd love to go just for a day to see it.  Any day would be ok, but if there are 2 Sat or Sun passes available at a reasonable price so that both my wife and I can go, I'd be forever grateful.    If you are here in the Seattle area, that would be best, otherwise I guess shipping will have to do.                  Fun Fact. If the top 30% of Americans (anyone making ~$47k+ a year) donated just over 25% of their income, the minimum wage could be set at $30000 a year. Now that would be nearly 100% increase in $ for 40% of the people in the country (around 60 MILLION people). What would the economy look like if almost half the people had twice the money they had before?  If you make less that $20k/yr now, what would YOU do with $10K+ more money at the job you currently have? Buy more things than you would right now probably. Perhaps start investing in things? Start owning a home? Trade in that old inefficient unsafe car? Start eating better food and going to the gym? Stop going to the dollar store/Wal-Mart and start spending money at local shops and on things that were made in the USA because now you don't have to save every penny? I would think that far more business ventures would be more successful because more people would have more money to spend on things that aren't necessities.  I know that people will screen "socialism!" and "redistribution of wealth to the lazy!" and what not, but it's just a thought experiment. Since 1% of the people have 40% of the wealth in this country, what would happen if we DID take half of that money that the 1% has and gave it to the bottom 40% (The bottom 80% only have 7% of the wealth currently). Think about it.   A CEO makes ~380x more than the average employee (not the least paid...the average). The average person has 1 car, if that. CEO's don't have 380 cars each, or even a few cars that combined are worth 380x the average. It gets to a point to where you can only buy so much stuff. Sure it can be lavish, expensive and superlative..but if you make 1000 times more that the average person, you wont spend 1000 times more money on things. In 2012, 3000 people made AT LEAST 1000 times more than 60,000,000 people did, with 1000 of those making over 5000 times more.  Forget about if it is "fair" or not. Just what if the rich suddenly decided to willingly give up a decent portion of their immense wealth for the good of the country.   Reddit:  What do you think would happen when 60 Million people have over twice as much to spend each year?                                             I just got an email from best buy where I pre ordered my ps4 that the new release date for it was 11/30/13.  I wonder if they have announced this yet                                             The primary reason I have it is to look at my house to see where I'm losing heat in the winter... But what other fun things do you think I should do? It's not a super high end one, no zoom or anything like that but it does have the ability to save pictures... So I'll post some shots of requests am able to do it. Suggestions?  EDIT: Here is the album of what I've made shot so far. http://imgur.com/a/o7rnE  	106

 "turkey boob"  now inserting into local lexicon.   True Story - go hitup Blue Ribbon Q in Newtown (or Watertown ? Can't remember) Mass right off the turnpike.  Great true q in Massachusets, I swear.  Better than some 'famous' places down south.   Amen Good, real, smoke BBQ is BBQ whether north, south, east or west.  I'd want to qualify that as true q though, cause up here in the Mid Atlantic there's a whole lotta people brainwashed into thinking that if it's meat served with corn syrup glopped all over it then it's q.    Man that looks absolutely fantastic.  Good thing I just ate or I'd really be starving.  I love a good hot pastrami on rye, but never thought about making my own.   I may have to give this a go sometime.    they aren't exclusive ! Believe it or not there are people of both the pastrami and the corned beef persuasions. LoL.    Until the lady at the very end, I was 100% certain this was a parody commercial.   just got this.  Id been looking at wind shirts/jackets all winter, but wasn't about to pay "Big R" prices on them.  Dropped in at a local Sports Authority and found one on clearance for about 20 bucks.   it's basically a windblock layer with a dwr, ultra light and compact, so perfect for running with in winter/shoulder season weather; work up a sweat, then when you stop throw this one to avoid freezing.  or use as a shell on a misty windy day at summit.   only dwr though, not an actual hard shell.     I think I'm going to go pitch a hammock at the school playground until I get thrown out.   True story.  When I was in high school my Dad bought me an EMS book bag.  Years the zipper stitching finally gave, I took it to a store, they sent it in and replaced it.  At the time the bookback was probably somewhere between 15 and 20 years old.   I have absolutely no reservations about EMS standing behind their products.    I picked up a Rippack backpack at my local Eddie Bauer after checking out the Flash 22. Same idea - super light, "perfect size", except cheaper. I think I got mine for half the price of a Flash, and I much prefer the looks of it as well.       That's why you never look at "percent discounted".  It's all bullshit.     I've been really impressed by Dobbin Auto recently.  I took a chance having a new car and having used specialists for my previous car, and I'm glad I took the chance on them.  I actually just had some mail order winters installed by them and was really surprised at how reasonably priced and service oriented they were. The tire co shipped the wrong lug nut key, and Dobbin actually lent me theirs to hold on to until a new one was shipped.     I had a less than good experience with them, including bill padding.    It's just absurd this is even an issue.  I'm ashamed our state politicians are even wasting air on it.     Ah geez, thanks for the reminder.    I can bring way more than I need (like delicious, heavy goodies, beer, burgers  Wow, that's some pretty awesome backpacking !   Yes, sorry about the mix up.   It  just says "Osprey" on the bag and my memory wasn't helping.    Hip belt pockets are handy to hold snacks, camera, sunblock, and various goodies you'll need often.   Ive been thinking about this. If nothing else, having my compass there would be very handy, and my phone as well actually since I typically map and take photos with it (and a big external battery pack).    I usually just carry these things in my pockets, but there HAVE been times when I start  to do a scramble and have to stop and think about where my phone is and whether it's going to fall out.   [What i mean by the exterior water pockets](http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B00AOICPE2-1.jpg)  I think unless a sleeping bag compartment is very waterproofed or has some other really unique thing about it beyond just the zipper, than it's really just a zipper access.  Which, frankly, the more I think about the more I like.  In my "bring the kitchen sink just in case" days I would have so much crap in like my 90l bag that getting to stuff could be a pain.   However, I'm very, very quickly getting out of that mentality, so I'm still going to think about that one.   I use air mattresses.  Really need to.  Did foam pads for a very long time and just can't do them anymore.   thank you !     Lucky.    I have that kind of bag - the ginormous, bombproof super poofy belted bag.  It's awesome, but it weighs a ton compared to newer smaller bags which is why I'm looking.   Thank you /!  Sorry, I was wrong, my existing bag is a Variant 55, not an Atmos.  I had to dig up the original tag with the sticker to figure that out.   I'm really, really enjoying it so far and can't wait to actually go climbing with it !!   I appreciate your rundown on the features you use.  Sounds like I may definitely enjoy a smaller bag for little day trips, and that trekking pole attachment sounds worth while.  By "exterior water pocket" I don't mean a slab/shovel/shove pocket on the rear of the pack. Some backpacks are now featuring the same old large pockets for water bladders, but now instead of putting them inside the main compartment they are putting them outside of the main compartment, in the harness area so that you can more easily get to it.  I sense that it makes refilling a LOT easier, and may also save some  main compartment space, and I like the idea of not carrying water in my main compartment space.  Thank you for your feedback it really helps.      Sorry, my bad.  It's a Variant 55.  I had to go dig up the original hang tag ... definitely a climbing bag, plenty of loops for hardware, and some nice axe straps.      Don't know if subaru's come this way, or if previous owner did this,b but my rear wiper use a roc lock 3 attachment.  Actually looks like a great attachment and really does go on and off easier than a pin/hook type except .... except .... apparently NOBODY carries blades for this retail, and plenty of manufacturers don't even have blades for it.    Should I just replace the arm with a normal one, or is there some reason this would have a roc lock on the back but not the fronts ?    no fucking way.    how are these different from freezer bags ? just stronger or something?    Looks like a ruck glued onto a drag bag.  Wouldn't it make more sense to attach the rifle to outside portion of the bag, so that you could have a more anatomical harness system ? Also wonder if the weight of the bag leveraging into the rifle may cause discomfort, like pressing the rifle into the back of your legs, etc.    NFW. That's amazing.  And a physical security nightmare.    do sleeping bag burritos work ? I've been told they don't ... although oddly the same folk told me to buy a liner ...    So, I'd figure out the real temperature youneed.  There can be a big price difference between a 20 and a zero.  I've done 5 degrees in a non-zero bag (it's a "10" that's actually EN rated 6 for men). If it gets to 20 degrees, I'd use a REAL 20 degree bag (EN rated, no Big Agnes or any other exagerators) and then just carry clothing  (ie a base layer) or a liner to accomodate any freak swings.    The EN ratings are also for sleeping comfort, and their actual "surviving, but not sleeping anymore" temps are way, way lower.  So it's not like if you have a proper 20 and it dips to 10 you're going to die.  It means you put in the liner and continue sleeping in the buff, or perhaps you add a base or thermals.   The key though is only buying an EN rated bag. Anything else is subject to a lot of bullshit, even these days.     -External frame backpack.  The type with the large flap covering.  Steel tube frame, preferrably heavy as hell.  - A steel mess kit. -Big round steel  canteen with a canvas cover and neck strap.   - Items made of leather and canvas duck.  I've seen very stylish, anachronistic "bushcraft" gear like this.  Completely useless in terms of modern performance, but definitely old school cool.   Searching "hiking in the 1950's" on Bing suggests you should also buy a bra.  Google returns less Marilyn focused results though. Odd.   So I took a chance on an Opsrey Variant 52 (climbing optimizied) that was on sale and finally gave it a proper breaking in.  LOVE it.  Now have absolutely no qualms about spending good money on a high end pack.  I get it now.  Thing is, this bag is optimized for climbing.  I do climb, but I do alot more 4 season day hiking, and hope to do more single night backpacks as well, perhaps with the occasional double overnight.   Yesterday I noticed that even with my bag completely tightened up, it was pretty roomy. Another dude had a 33 liter and didn't even seem to fill that and it was a pretty rough hike. So I'm really thinking that while the 65 climber bag was a good way to test the waters, long term I'd be better off with a different bag ?   Like should I swap this one, or perhaps keep it for when I need the size (backpacking, cold winter hikes when I want 40 layers with me, hiking with the kids, actually climbing etc) and maybe get an additional one ?  So I'm wondering:   - Does having say a 24 or 33 for a day hike make anything easier ? Guessing they may be lighter ?  - Has anyone used those trekking pole keepers  on the Osprey - theones that keep them parked under your arm ? I played with them in the store but can't quite get the feel for them.  Do they really let you transition to /from poles without mssing a step ? Or can you just as easily take the pack off, tie in the poles and put it back on ?  - Sleeping bag compartments - a benefit ? My old bag had one, and it was heavier duty material so as to be more water resistant and prevent puncturing if I threw/sat on my pack.  - Exterior water pouch slab.  This actually seems to make a lot of sense to me.  I was never really that jazzed about keeping a 3 liter water ballon inside my pack.  - Pockets on the waist belt.  I have a gut.  I can't really see those pockets anyhow. Some of them seem to be really far back and difficult to access anyhow.  I still can't figure out if these are really nice,or just a gimmick.  I usually have pockets.  - Bed roll straps on the bottom - seems like a nice way to save room by lashing the tent, or even the sleeping bag.  Truly useful ?   thanks people.  EDIT: Sorry, originally I said I had an Atmos 65.  I was wrong.  It's a Variant 52... I had to dig up the original hang tags to figure that out.  I'm sorry for the confusion, thanks for everyone's patience.   That's absurd.  Everyone knows anything from Land's End or LL Bean isn't real technical gear that can be used for any outdoor activity.  You have to go to an outdoors store and spend 4 times as much for the same thing before it's good for outdoors use.   I hope the facetiousness came through that well enough. I have a cheap (ie sub 50 dollar) LL Bean down puffy coat that I've had so long I can't even remember when I got it.... thinking about 8 years now, and it still beats the heck out of these wimpy, ridiculously over priced "light weight sweaters" they're selling in the stores.  And looks like Lands End is dumping their winter gear, making for some stupid good deals on jackets.      THIS.  I'm stunned how  many people don't buy the right clothes because all they see everywhere is the Gucci labels shoved down their throats at ridiculous prices.   Some of the best gear I have has come from Walmart.  Literally.    All the trucker's caps I've seen use plastic for the mesh.  Besides, if you don't get some fancy logo or band name on it, it should be pretty  cheap.   Even good ones ? I haven't toaken my new Nokian's on a rink yet, but I've definitely been on some ice with them.  They have plastic aggregate embedded in them.   yep, I didn't have a problem in the snow untril I tried snow tires and realized how much better it can be.  And these Nokian's didn't cost any more than any other good tire.    Never thought of that.  I'll have to try that technique.    I go to a super cheap gym that everyone makes fun of, and everyone there is  awesome.  everything wiped down in between, even when you're like "don't sweat it I'm good" they're like "it'll only take a second",  weights always put away.  I think the customers of the gym make more difference than the gym itself.    Yep, just did. Giant difference. AWD is completley overhyped ... even my dealership still says on their website "and with all wheel drive your wheels will stay glued to the road !" That's complete bullshit.  With AWD, all wheels will spin, that's all.  The entire rest of the difference is in maintaining traction.   AWD alone just seems to make it easier to mount obstacle and get out of mud/snow pits, etc. But definitely not to stop or turn.   Good winter tires, however, make tracking, cornering and stopping more effective.  I just got some Nokian Hakka R2's puton my Sub right before about 10 inches of snow, and the difference is definite and obvious.  Not PERFECT - it doesn't make driving in snow and ice like driving on dry asphalt, but the first thing I noticed is that I could now STOP.   On my all seasons, driving to the mechanic, I had to slow for a turn into his driveway and slid about 50 feet with traction control bumping the whole time - basically a total loss of traction. With the hakka's, however, I can actually *slam* on the brakes at a low speed, and do a nice controlled longer distance brake at higher speeds with no loss of traction.    So while others have pointed out that perhaps this article doesn't bring the proofs, I'd still generally agree with it's point - that it's the tires that make the difference, not awd or 4wd, when it comes to winter driving.       that helps !    march to april is exactly what I'm thinking. even late march you can get a snap freeze here in central MD.    lol. well, bring an umbrella if you don't want it to rain right?  I was lucky enough to get them just in time for what is probably goingto be our last big snow (unfortunately)   hmm, calling the land mgr is  a good idea. thanks !    I shall call them "Hakka" then :)   Unfortunately where i live we aren't allowed to use studded or spiked tires, so these are the closest I can get.    Yeah, we're already going into full melt here in central Md.  I HATE the melt.  I'd much rather just have freezing cold and snow.... so few people understand this though.      I can't even tell what happened there.   The camera must have been tilted, because it looked like (s)he slid sideways on a flat surface.   I'm guessing those were all season tires, because honestly that snow and terrain didn't look at all challenging ( just got some Nokians and having fun being unstoppable for a bit ;)       I love snow camping, and even snow hiking.  I recently equipped for snow fun, with crampons and some killer tires on the Subie.    I haven't been to MNF in 20 years .... how bad an idea would Spruce Knob or other easy trails on the Monongahela be this weekend for a man and his faithful dog ?   My friends aren't as adventurous as I so I'm stuck solo.   Thinking an overnight backpack or car camp.        Hello,   Getting some winters for my Subie.  I haven't had this car long and this would be my first real shadetree work with it (aside from oil).   Can anyone recommend the best TPMS activation and registration kit for Subaru ? I know with VW's there's a very specific ODB computer software that's highly recommended, but I don't know if there's one for Sub's.  I'll need to activate my sensors to get their serials, and then register them with the system.    OR, will the ECU remember two sets of sensors so I don't have to register with each change of wheels ?  Thanks !    I heard that some Tire shops will let you rent space to keep your seasonal tires when you aren't using them.   I'm guessing this is probably in much cooler states than Maryland ... anyone ever hear of that here ?    I want some R2's for my Subaru, but the closet location on the dealer list is 75 miles away.  Surprisingly they don't list a single dealer in my State.   For those of you driving Nokian's, how did you get them ? Mail order ? Or just lucky enough to have a local dealer ?     Got caught in the snow trying to get out of town last Saturday.  Columbia was a complete mess, took forever to get out of Howard C and never saw a plow.  Every other county the roads were nicely cleared and plenty of plows everywhere.   Still trying to figure that one out.  Did Howard even try or was Columbia hit harder than adjoining towns ?    I see the sidebar recommends PayPal, but I'm not even sure what protections that in particular offers.  What are the accepted best practices for trading here so that the seller and buyer are both protected ?    Me again, the guy with the Subaru Rack.  Here's Part Tow.  Not a typo ;)  Well okay, Part TWO since I didn't ACTUALLY have to tow it, I managed to limp it in, but it was a scary limp.   So, I get the rack replaced by local indie shop.  Great service, they do it same day.   Reasonably priced, I"m super happy to have it in time for a trip.  Life is good.   Drive around town that evening doing some errands.  Next morning load it up, hit the highway, suddenly starts swerving left and right when I get it beyond a certain speed (around 55ish).   If I slow it down, it's okay.    Limped it back to the shopw, we move everything to a buddy's car and go about out trip.  Come Monday, mechanic says he can't reproduce the swerving.  I test drive it with him, sure enough, it's gone.    He does say that they had accidentally put power steering flud in, but the Cardone's take hydraulic fluid so they changed it out.  Today he's replacing the rack witht a "new Cardone one" just in case it was something in the rack like a bad seal.  Apparently the rack's dont have any way of leak down testing the interior seals.   Here's the thing, I KNOW it was swerving.  It happened multiple times, it wasn't snow or wind.  It was obvious, and pronouced and clearly a car problem.   Would changing the oil out have that big a change ?  Or could a rack have an intermittent issue like that ?   Thanks again guys and gals.   Edit: Sorry, forgot this is a 2009 Subaru Outback with 121k.       hating life right now and feel like I can't win at losin, cause of course this issue's been nagging at me for months now, but by the time I made it in, 2,000 miles out of warranty. ... So typical.    So, my 2009 Outback steering rack is leaking. Dealer says 1500 to replace, they can only replace with new parts.  Nothing against this dealer; they actually seem like a good group of folks, but that seems like good money after bad.   The car has 121k on it already ... should I call around and look for someone who's install a reman'd one instead ?  I figure it could be half price.   Still painful, but at least a kick right to the nuts.   your thoughts ? thanks guys.  Edit: Hey guys, thanks for all the help.  I got it fixed today by a new indie (that I was really very, very pleasantly surprised by).   I just need the car for a planned trip on Saturday and also need the wife to be able to use it, so I was in a bit of a bind.   I don't know what brand they used, didn't see those comments until just now, but they were literally half the price of the dealer.  THe car has over 120 on it, so if I get 50k out of it I think I'll be doing pretty well eh.   But yeah, honestly, now that the honeymoon is over I'm pretty meh toward the car.  I used to drive a VW TDI and despite some of the maintenance pains of that (dsg fluid change,ftw ! ) it really drove and handled very nicely even at high mileage.    But hey seriously thanks alot guys, I really appreciate the advice.       I'm experimenting with some bags trying to figure out what's working and what isn't.   Using liners, bags inside a bag etc I can get my core and legs comfortable no problem, but my feet are forever cold.   I'm not aware of having any circulatory, metabolic or neural issues.   Are down booties the solution here, or do I really need to stop messing around with bags that are not EN rated and trying to make them work, and just drop the dime to get a high quality rated bag that really is comfort to zero, or comfort to five etc ?   Edit, forgot to mention, I wore wool socks all last night, but even made a point of putting on large ones that are not particularly elasticy or compressive.  DID have thermal tops and bottoms on, so my core and legs had an advantage, and went to "bed" fully dressed, thermals, pants, thermals, shirt, fleece but on my footsies just the wool socks. REALLY trying to find a winter combination that works. I thought buying this Lost Ranger ("15") was the trick but it isn't.    Going car camping with some friends next week.  I have a propane stove, but nothing for cooking over the campfire.  Like those tripods with the chains that hold a grill.  I've seen pictures of like a coffee pot brewing over the campfire, dutch ovens, etc.   It does look homy, but I've only ever cooked on a propane stove.     Is the "campfire" experience really worth all the added kit ?    REI's having a clothing sale, and there's some midweight Capilene for sale. I was thinking this may be good for the remaining winter.   Right now for a winter base I use some generic Champion brand quick dry leggings.  Does the job, they're thin though.    I also have some old school white cotton waffle thermals.  Other than the obvious issues of cotton, any idea how capilene would compare to them, or the Champion leggings ?     I love my Vomero 9's but I reserve them just for running.     Can anyone recommend a good Nike for  NOT running, just for walking, errands, daily stuff ?  I had previously been running in some 50 dollar "Downshifts" that fell apart, and learned that not all Nike's are quality.   thanks !      Been having an unseasonably warm winter, and decided to buy some new gear in hopes of going out this weekend.  May have picked the wrong weekend, cold snap moving in with lows expected at 12 deg F.   Have a Lost Ranger and a Nemo Cosmo on the way now, and plan on testing it out in the backward before wandering with them. Think that bag/pad combo will suffice if I wear thermals, socks, hat, and a down coat ? Can also add insulated ski pants and insulated boots if need be.    Would be a single overnight, either in an open car camping spot, or in an AT 3 walled/overhead shelter.  Tent is 2 walled.      Baked ziti she said  when I rang her.   No need to pick anything up, it will be ready when I get home.  Except it isn't.  It's some sort of whole grain pasta that tastes like wrong. And low calorie, low fat cheese.     So here I am at /r/food pretending I'm in a Norwegian burger joint.    TLDR: Bought first ever fancy sneakers, paid a ton, 4 months of being pampered across a mere 17 visits to the gym and they're falling apart. Wondering if all  Nike's are this undurable.  The long:   Pretty much like the title says. My whole life I've kept it on the cheap buying clearance sneaks from discounters.  Finally venture out and buy some Nikes since I reason "If I'm going to start running, I should probably get some better quality shoes".   That was exactly 17 trips, guesstimating about 45 miles, 51 total gym hours ago.  The shoes are used for exactly one thing, and one thing only: the gym.  They go to the gym in the gym bag, them come home in the gym bag, and they've never seen a sidewalk or a lawn. I don't even wear them around the house.   One of them has developed frayed stitching on both the medial and lateral sides, and is now separating at a seam.  Are they all this bad  ?    This is essentially my next post in a series of "trying to resume backpacking after years of Dad'ing".   It's amazing how time gets away from you.   All my awesome gear that was so top of the line when I bought it, now it just makes me feel so old...  I found my old filter, a Pur Scout.  You know the one, grey plastic with a gloriously turqoise accents, just like my tent.  Oddly enough also just like my master bathroom before I rebuilt it, so it must have been a 60's thing before it was a 90's thing.     This is a glass fiber filter to .3 micron's.  It USED to be iodine impregnated for an attempt at killing viruses.  Pumps water just fine.  Housing in great shape, the filter itself is physically "to the eye" clean, zero effort pumping, no smells, no slimes, no obvious indications of issue.   Sadly I probably only ever pumped maybe 20 liters through it over the years, it's aging is all shelf life.   Think I can still use it ? Aside from the iodine, I can't find any reference to a shelf life on them.     The new Katadyn's are also glass fiber, also .3 micron's.  They offer a few functional differences (like more easily detached tubes) but the filtering capabilities look identical.    Any advice on whether I can chug away with my existing filter, if I should find a replacement cartridge for it (they DO exist) or if there's really any reason to I haven't identified to upgrade to a new one?     Gracias mi amigos.   I've done my homework.  If I missed this somewhere just point me to it and I'll delete this post.   As you improve your cardio conditioning, will a certain heart rate always feel the same even though you're running faster ?   For instance, I can complete x miles at x speed which keeps my heart in the 160's. That's a challenge, but I can do it.   As I improve, if I increase speed and distance so that I keep my heart rate consistent, will it be the same challenge ?   Does this also mean that if I want to continuously improve my cardio strength, ignoring running for the moment, that I actually need to increase my speed and distance not to become a better runner, but to keep my heart rate the same so that I'm providing the same level of relative excursion ?  As in if you run the same distance, same speed all the time won't you reach an equilibrium where you no longer get the same level of cardio training from it ?   thanks !       Had a bonafide emergency and haven't lifted in 11 days and am going in tonight.   Last session I progressed my weights.  Tonight should I continue with the progressed weights, or go back to my previous weight ?   Edit: Hey, thanks everyone. Man, thanks for the encouragement.  I just had a fantastic workout.  Took 2 minutes off my 2m run, and progressed 5 lbs on all my lifts.  I was worried that I was approaching too long a delay and would never make it back but now I'm back in the swing.  thankx !    Hey guys, me again, skeptical old skool guy transitioning to modern pricey stuff.  I've been hiking in desert boots forever now (when I'm not just wearing sneaks).  I decided to try some new commercial boots and really liked the Asolo Restons.  Spent a long time trying them again other boots, buy them, and with an hour of wearing them at home get alot of pain where my left lateral metatarsal joins the cuboid (basically the bony protrusion below the little toe).   I loosen the lacing, try to accommodate it, but at that point it was too hot already. This morning that area was still red.     Not sure why, because in the store they felt really good.  I like the 'narrow through the arch' fit as my running shoes are  like that.    Does this mean I need wider boots, or is this just a matter or breaking them in? Do synthetic shoes even break in ? Will they conform to my foot like leather does ?   I'm wearing them now and they feel only snug, not painful.  I paid more attention to give the lower laces slack while cranking only the ankle portion.   Back when I played hockey the pro shot was able to heat my skate's boot up and bump out a hotspot for me; can you do that with synthetic hiking boots ?   And if I really just need different boots, how is big R with taking stuff like this back ?  I'm a little sheepish about it because I'm not one to gratuitously return stuff, and I spent forever trying on different boots.    thanks again for your patience and advice.    If anyone has "hiked" in both BDU or ACU pants, as well as dedicated 'hiking pants', could you give me some feedback on why you think the hiking pants are worth it ?    I've spent plenty of time in bdu's or just cheap cotton civie cargo pants, and wondering what I'm missing.   they don't seem to have very good carrying capacity, ie few pockets and not very deep.  They also dont seem designed to tuck in at the boots, but i suppose the threat of ticks and critters isn't as high on a maintained trail as it is when say laying prone for hours on end.    I've decided the first and best use case for us to migrate to newer HA tech is to replace the Hunter remotes in our fans (since we can never find the remotes anyhow, and replacement/additionals are ridiculously priced).   But, in all my searching, it seems there's exactly ONE ceiling fan controller that goes in the canopy and controls the lights and fan ?     Bought a pricey DLINK wireless camera DCS 5222L yesterday and returned it same day.  I was seriously disappointed in the image quality from 5 feet away in a brightly lit room.   Are they all that bad ? Or does PoE offer better images.     I just bought this DCS-5222L and it feels like a blast from the past.  I mean that in a bad way.   For the 160-190 price tag I expect much, much better images than this at much higher resolution.  The MyDlink site and software doesn't exactly wow either.  I mean seriously, it's 2015 and you want me to run an APPLET ? skeptical look on face   Do all wireless cameras suck as cameraing ? Can anyone suggest a better one ?   I just want something I can mount outside that uses PIR to trigger video which I can then view from a mobile device or web app.  Preferrably which dispalys events on a timeline.    I'm willing to pay for something like a Sensr as well, particularly if it employs any advanced imagry analysis techniques beyond just showing me a video.      All I'm planning for winter packing and camping and am trying to figure out how cold rated of a bag I really need.  Does anyone have any beta on low temps in the Maryland portion or surrounding areas please ?  I see bags that seem plenty fine, then people call them 3 season so not really sure what I need. Really only wander around Md AT sections and various state parks around Deep Creek going as far as Ohiopyle, would definitely love to get back to WVa like Dolly Sodds. Thanks!    Question for folks who have transitioned from mummy bags to rect/semi-rect - does the increase in comfort by having more wiggle room outweigh the extra size and weight ?  Or you do you kind of wish you stayed with lighter smaller bags ?   My 15-20 y/o cat's meow just makes me claustrophobic now.     I received a new dock for my M7 and noticed that it occasionally slow charges, and my phone will display the slow charge message.  But not all time, and it does this despite using the same cable and adapter that consistently provide fast-charge.   The dock does say "power and data transfer" on it, but if the dock itself only allowed 500ma through, then I'd get the slow charge message all the time, not intermittently.  It may be a quality issue with the dock pinouts, but in the meantime does the M7 do anything like intentionally switch to slow charge mode as it's nearing topping off ?  I hadn't noticed before, but I honestly don't track when updates are pushed, or what's in the updates.    AND ... is it just me, or is this sub's CSS using white-on-white for stuff ?    My M7 lags horrendously and I have to suspect it was due to enabling encryption.  I swear there are times when it takes 15 seconds to register a touch.  When it's acting up it becomes an infuriatingly useless collection of precious metals.    Anyone else have this issue ? I've already gone through and removed many apps, disabled a bunch of the pointless carrier spam apps, cleared caches, etc.  I'm only using 20 out of 32 gigs storage.     I have at least 5 other Android devices in my household which have never experienced anything like this - and they don't have encryption  - so I can't help but point the finger at encryption.     I'm old enough that I was around for a lot of technologies when they were new, and then things changed. Looks like HA is one of those.   I picked  up some X10 around, I don't know, 6 years ago ? 8 ?  And used it on or two thing than really got into it.  I have their desktop controller, and some keychain fobs as well.  Those things are the best - come home late at night, foyer light automatically on.    I picked up plenty of receptacle controllers for very cheap at RadioShack a couple years ago as well, and actually  still have several new in their packaing. I installed several light switches, the neat kind that work both as addressable but also as regular manual switches as well.   When my outdoor lamp finally gave way, I replaced it with an X10 one a couple years ago, love it and it's still going strong.  Great deal too.   I just read this: http://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/z9a60/insteon_zwave_x10_or_something_else/  that said X10 was basically a dead company, yet their website it still alive (I'm old enough to remember when they ruined the Web with popunders).    I never could figure out how to get a decent interface into it though and really build "automation" into it; always used it more as "remote control".  I remember installing software and buying a home and using what seemed to be their first or second approach at software control and not liking it.   I see alot of discussion against x10 in many cases but it appeared to be related more to having problems with it.  I'm not having any problems with it.  It works on my wiring just fine for whatever reason (old house, built around the time the x10 protocol was, I suppose that's why).   So aside from not being able to (easily) control my stuff from my phone/tablet/phablet/wearable, are there compelling reasons to buy into the new fangled stuff ?    Don't get me wrong - a rock solid, reliable, affordable solution that also gives me great mobile access will get my money for sure, but I"m hesitant to go buy new just because it's new.   As an example I did spend on a Nest last year, and had to return both of them.  They literally wouldn't stfu.  They were still babbling at the Home Depot return desk, which was funny; certainly didn't require much explanation as to why I was returning them.     Hi all,   Not intending this as asking medical advice, really more product advice if that's ok.   But first, I want to thank y'all for what you do for folks.  My PT's were really awesome and I came out with not just a stronger foot but really kind of a whole new lease on life and a renewed focus on fitness, so PT's of the world I thank ya.  They used an OTPT stretch Ez on it and that thing will change your life if you've never *really* stretched before (I thought I knew what stretching was, PT and Yoga taught me I had no clue what stretching was).   I'd like to buy one, but I see there's also generic stretching straps that can be used for more stretches as well like upper body.  I don't want to buy more than I need - does anyone know if a regular stretching strap can provide the same "through the foot" stretch that the stretch ez will, even though they don't have the booty ?  Or perhaps I should really buy both.   Thanks !       hey all,   I'm not on the program, but this seemed like a better sub to ask than /r/running since this program resembles what I've been doing on my own. I started walking routinely about a year and a half ago and getting my legs back.  Recently I started hitting the treadmill and am happily making gains. I started a couple months ago walking around 3-3.5 mph with the occasional run around 6mph for a minute, than back down.  I've been making gains, and my baseline speed is now 4ish, with sprints up to 8.5.    Both are fine.  I mean, I'm sweating like a pig, I'm definitely seriously focusing but I love it, and both feel bio mechanically correct, both feel like I should be doing it. But jogging is the suxor and I can't stand it.  No specific pain, not shin splints (know them), not a sprain, strain or fracture (yup, know them too )  but just an overall lower body rejection of what I'm doing.   Is it normal to have trouble with jogging despite being very comfortable walking and running ? Maybe it's a weight thing (I'm over 200 lbs) or a form thing ( I'm graceful  like an elephant) ?  Or is this just a suck it up and it'll improve thing ?   thx.   Our cars are showing their age so at point last year I started researching polishers and detailing and had different items in a wishlist to compare and keep learning.  My bad, I was really just using it as placeholders and had  3 or 4 polishers in it... but well, awesome wife sees wishlist, sees I'm looking at polishers and knowing the brand decides to get me a Dewalt.  So now I'm the proud owner of a Dewalt DWP849X.   BEAUTIFUL tool.   Clearly exceptional build quality with many useful features.  This is perhaps only the second Dewalt I've ever splurged for, but boy you literally feel the difference except ... I've never used a polisher.  I was doing research to start off.  So now I have this awesome polisher, but it's straight up rotary and I'm trying to decide whether to keep it, or return it and get a DA.  Pros I see, as in leaning to keep:  - Shipping it back would cost me at least something.  - Variable power as low as 600 rpm which seems to be lower than most DA's. Probably not as risky to use as fixed-speed rotary's. - Dewalt.  - Would grow with my skills - Can use it for polishing wordworking as well, although that wouldn't be often at all - Large size means working large panels faster especially on her van. - Able to grow with me should I ever start learning how to correct.  - Have done plenty of work with my hands, learn pretty quickly, not klutzy.  Cons I see:  - Expensive.   - Only working on my own cars. Need to fix up some scratches and chips, other than that just routine beautification.  - Never used one before.  - Larger means not being able to easily work tight spaces - Larger pads seems harder to find, less selection - Different spindle size/threads  than smaller DA's means getting backer more difficult  The car's themselves are pretty well dinged up.  Mine has a bunch of rock chips, and hers has all sorts of fine scratches.  Do any of them really require a rotary or would I be able to address them with a DA ?   Pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/84FmA  This has honestly been a minor dilemna for us.  Wife keeps asking if she should return it and I'm not sure what to tell her.  Appreciate any advice y'all give.     I'm really not finding any dog barriers that thrill me, so I'm considering just making my own out of 1" webbing.    Has anyone ever installed any sort of tiedown/lashing points *inside* their car ?  Any tips, urls, search terms you could point me to ?      Looking for folks to go out and be active with. I've done Meetup in the past, it's great, but it's always fixed schedules, RSVP first, large groups, etc.   I've been making good progress in the gym and want to get more active in the outdoor rec dept. before the monotony of the gym sets in.    I'm into hiking, climbing, backpacking, camping (as in car) and have plenty of gear including kayaks, TR setups, etc.   Looking for cool progressive, educated (self or otherwise) motivated folks, figured Reddit would be a good place to look.  No crime/420 please.     I'm not vegetarian but my daughter is. For Christmas each year I like to make homemade peppermint marshmallows for everyone and as gifts.  They're a big hit, but there's a couple ingredients that are no-no's for strict vegetarians: sugar and gelatine.  My daughter's choice has had a great positive impact on the rest of the family's nutrition.   I for one don't identify vegetarian but literally can't remember the last time I ate meat now.  Out of respect for her I'd really like to make some vegetarian marshmallows.   I already use char-free natural sugar, so no problems there.  The issue comes with gelatine which is an animal product.   Even "kosher" gelatine is animal based.   I managed to track down some agar flakes (agar is basically processed kelp, it's used to make all those super-firm asian gelatine treats), and was very careful about researching conversions from flakes to power, agar to gelatine, etc. I experimented with two different batches, taking notes.  the first batch was just "fluff"and wouldn't aerate at all, despite having slightly overcooked the sugar past soft-ball more towards hard-ball.  I figured they would aerate and set too hard, but the opposite happened.   Second batch aerated better, came out with more of a gelatenous composition, so I poured it to set in the casserole dish... but it never set.  Basically ended up being really smooth, nice frosting. It was tasty, but not a marshmallow.  I really want to perfect this.  I've read and studied plenty of internet recipes but this one particular area of vegetarian cooking seems to be pretty mythical, or I'm doing something very wrong, or I'm doing it right and vegetarian marshmallows will just never come out the same as gelatine based ones.  I do know now not to buy flakes again, as the conversion from flakes to powder is just another area to go wrong with.   Having to boil the agar is another twist that changes the mechanics of "normal" recipes.   If you'd successfully made vege/vegan marshmallows, would you mind sharing some tips with me ?  I can google recipes, did plenty of that, but it's just not working.   I feel bad that my daughter suddenly can't enjoy one of our favorite winter treats and out of respect for her I'd really like to nail this recipe.  I promise if I can nail it I"ll make a full write, with photos, ingredient sources, etc since this seems to be a unicorn of vegetarianism.  thanks !       I've pretty much stopped clicking any Reddit links to YouTube.     I'm amazed at how professionally and positively you guys approach a tough job full of constant asshole customers and just couldn't resist saying something about it.    I'll go back to lurking now.     Shopping for frameless roller-on-header style bypass shower door.   Does anyone have any experience with the CR Laurence Serenity hardware that all the custom manufacturers use, versus say the new Kohler Levity or the Vigo ?    I read about Fannie's homestyle and am interested in the potential for using that to reduce renovation cash outlays on investment property.     If I understand it correctly, I can borrow up to 100% of the completely value based on an appraisal, but I have to put 10% of the reno costs down, plus whatever cash down the mortage lender requires, but then I get to ammortize those reno costs over the life of the loan, drastically reducing cash outlays when buying.  Unfortunately my costs of reno will be increased by their requirements to use contractors and reducing my sweat equity opportunities only their approved tasks (which I can't find).     I'm really having a lot of trouble finding good information though; just a lot of copypasta of their marketing verbiage.  Couldn't even get search hits on Reddit, and you can get search hits on *anything* on Reddit. Is this a brand new product, or a product that just doesn't have a market ? I'm guessing there are few lenders I could get one through, and it probably comes with a higher rate.  I don't see it mentioned on my CU's site either, so I'm guessing they don't offer it :(     Does anyone have any idea where I can find good hard info on it ? I need the deetz ....thank you !

Hello,   Pulled a report today, it was a really odd report - nothing wrong or inaccurate, but it had accounts on there from 20 years ago, all marked OK, paid as agreed, etc, but I had to jog down memory lane to recognize some of it.    Is that normal ? Should I be worried about it ?   There were also some hard pulls and soft pulls I didn't recognize.  I'll have to sort those out a bit and then refute.  But if I'm already in the high 760's, is there any benefit to trying to get my credit higher than that ?  Will I get a better mortgage rate or car loan ?  Thanks           We get reminded of this every year.    I'm a slug who just got off PT, I've been getting into basic shape with a yoga/pilates class (love it)  but I want to add an extra class to build on the momentum and add diversity.   I was wondering if there are branches of bodyweight that aren't quite strictly bodyweight only, but may incorporate some of the toys we used in PT, like elastic bands for doing sideways walking, medicine balls, bosu's, etc.  I realize I could incorporate all this at home myself into traditional bodyweight routines, but I'm really hoping that it exists as a "thing" so I can start googling nearby classes.    thanks !    HI everyone,   I've been using lumbar support pillows them religiously for about 5 years but I still had posture problems and plenty of back pain.  Standing up straight was still an effort that I couldn't maintain long.    Recently I started doing a combination of yoga and pilates with great results.  I  noticed that the instructor continuously emphasizes keeping the back down, not arched up, and suspected maybe my pillow was hurting me by arching my lower back out.  So I removed it from the car, and I've been driving for a week without it.   It felt odd at first, and hurt a bit - my back hadn't felt the unmodified contours of a car seat for half a decade, but now I feel as if my back is getting stronger and my posture is improving.   Could it be that the pillow long term was actually pushing my back into a curve ? I think maybe it was crutching me - pushing my back into a curve but supporting it for me, but then when I'm out of the car/office chair my back wants to stay curved and now with no support.   Sound feasible, or maybe it's just the yoga/pilates only ?    Hey y'all,  I'm new here.  I was poking around /r/bbq for a bit saw this /r/smoking. That confused me a bit, since we *all know* (right?) that barbecue is smokin. If it ain't smoked, it ain't que.   But this sub looks like my people.  So I wanted to ask y'all, I'm sure we've all smoked new/ slightly unusual things (like trying beef ribs for the first time, smoking a turkey) but I was hoping to hear some of the unusual things folks have smoked.     In addition to all the usual stuff like beer, pork, chicken, sausage, stuffed jalapenos, I've smoked a whole salmon (Costco, it was fawesome), filet, crabcakes, lobster tail (that trio is typically reserved for birthday dinners for a special someone), cheese (HOT smoked, made a smoked fondue, highly recommended), and ... I've smoked tandoori chicken, which is definitely a favorite.    What kind of interesting "out of the ordinary" stuff have y'all smoked ?   it will just make your microwave dinner that much more depressing.  Me so hungry, me eat looong time.    Hey hey, I got a Subaru Outback, and I'm really digging it.  I also have some wildling dogs though, and could use some advice on best seat covers and compartment separators if you wouldn't mind.  I love the leather interior and don't want them clawing it up when they're roaming, and one dog is so big and crazy she just needs a little solitary in the back when we're driving.   Do they make neoprene seat covers ?   thanks !    http://imgur.com/JbcsI0u  Profiles are too mis-matched to just butt and caulk, so  I'll be coping it.  Question is - rip the base so that the top edges of the molding are at the same level, or rip is so that the curves are at  the same level ?    I really wanted a shorter base molding that would hit the curb on the flat part only, but wife kept insisting on full height base molding... sure none'ya ever been in that position before right ....   thanks!     tl;dr: I have forgotten how to carpentry and a small task is turning into a comical ordeal. What do you do when a simple project kicks your butt ?    Finishing up a major bath overhaul, and it's time for casing and molding. Did a great job painting, thinking "man, in 2 more days I'll be bathing in this bad boy".  That was a week ago. How little did I know.  The drywall didn't come close to flush anywhere along the jamb.  Sure, I've dealt with that before; just ripped some extensions, putty and finish well and it looks great.  So I rip some extensions. Except on one upright the edge waves back and forth between proud and recessed.  That's a new twist, I start trying to deal with it.  Grab the casing in the garage, case out the door.  Rosettes instead of mitres, looking good, grab the base molding, cut to length, fits great. Except wots this ? the base molding is thicker than the casing ? How did I NOT notice that before installing it ? Seriously ?  Go buy new molding with the wife.  Goes well; we agree on the pieces,, she pulls I cut (by the foot at the shop), get home, perfect lengths, goes with room, great.  Start measuring and cutting, my brain goes numb and I cut my first mitre backwards.  Ok, I have two other sticks.  hmmm, this one's pine, this one's mdf.  And this one is uncorrectably warped; in our hurry neither one of us did a good job picking the sticks. And now it's cut and useless.  For real. I bought millwork from a box store without checking it.  It's like I've never done this before.   go back later, get new molding, carefully culling this time. Get back, study the job some more, there's really no easy way to work the jamb extensions... it's a toughie.  Decide to mash the drywall down a bit instead.  Forget to score it.  So there's a fresh crack running up the wall now. Yup, put down the tools and walk away.  Sir, step away from the nailer.   I am honestly not an incapable person. I've done some great carpentry work around the house, but for this one project- which really should be like an hour max-  I feel like I've stepped into some sort of Twilight Zone and have suddenly forgotten everything I ever knew and am now a bumbling idiot with all thumbs who have never seen a compound mitre saw. You'd laugh watching me fumble with this.   Have any of you ever had to deal with this sort of situation where you're doing a pretty run of the mill project, and for some reason it just kicks your butt ? How do you deal  with it ?  Do I need to just walk away from it for a day, clear my head ?  Or is it time to admit defeat and call someone ?   Edit: Hey thanks everyone.  Glad to know I'm not the only one who's been in this boat.   SO - I just finished casing the door, and it looks good.  Even the mitre's - my first - came out pretty darn good.   I needed to get away from it a bit, and take my time more.  ALSO, brutalzing the drywall turned out to be the right thing to do.  Between pounding it with a block, and shaving off a high spot I actually got a much better fit without jamb extensions than I did with it.  Using lots of clamps to hold all the pieces in place helped me tweaking the mitre,  and definitely using straight lumber was a huge help; one area in particularly where I swore the jamb was swelling was actually just crowning in the stick.  So  a combination better sticks, trying a new technique, and just getting my head out of it for a while really helped.    My day is much better now, thanks.  Now I'm done with the door casing and ready to ~~fuckup~~ start the window casing.  Thanks all, happy Friday !    Up until earlier this year I hadn't really eaten in an "Italian restaurant" for about 20 years. Then earlier this year my son and I make a trip to the city, and we end up on a late night binge in Little Italy.  I have no idea where we ended up ; probably like the only place still open.  Can't remember what he got, but I had risotto for the first time... risottoe con fungi. In February. In the city.   I died and went to heaven.   Fast forward several months, and I finally work up the courage to try eating Italian out back home.  Twice, two different restaurants.  Now I'm sad.  I'm spoiled forever for great Italian.     Is it really that hard to find solid, top quality Italian food outside of NYC ?  Is it a case of stupid consumers who think anything with tomato sauce on it is "good italian food" as long as it's served with bread and oil ?     I jumped on neighborgoods (http://neighborgoods.net/) a couple months ago because I have a ton of tools that don't get used enough.  Seems like a great way to build community; tools are expensive, contractors are expensive, and alot of DIY is having the right tool for the job.    Plenty of folks can afford to buy tools, but it doesn't always make sense if you're only going to use it once.  Some tools can be rented, some cannot, and why rent if you don't have too ? Access to tools and DIY experience can be a powerful economic enabler as well.    Hop on the site though and check it out.  It's free.  We need more Columbia on there.  Other smaller, closer knit communities are really active on it and some towns even have public "Tool Sheds" for folks to use.   Ironically I told a couple neighbors about it and let them know I have stuff on there to lend, and they gave me the "u trying to sell me something" look.  I'm not. It's free.  The sites free, borrowing is free.   I did it to be a little more civic minded and neighborly.   check it out.

Any recommendations of  folks to call in central  Md ?   thanks!  Edit: Wow, I"m impressed.  I only recently joined Reddit and thought it was all about memes and pet photos.

I had originally posted this in /r/painting before I realized that was an artist sub, doh.   title says it all.  Is it working ? Are we getting the education funding and other benefits that we were all sold ?    I'm a new Subie driver, bought mine used around 100k miles.  I came off a VW that had more miles than this on it, and the VW drove really tight; the steering, the cornering, everything on it felt way more put together.   On the Subaru, it all feels kind of loose if that makes sense. Nothing specific, like it's not obviously pulling to one side, or there isn't obvious play when turning the streeting wheel, it just doesn't feel well put together.    I've heard that Subarus have been known to have rattles and just kind of odd stuff, although they have good bones.  Is this just how Subies drive, or should I get my alignment and steering checked ?  I still have a few months left on the warrant, so I'd like to stem off anything major while I still can.    thanks !

I have a Roth @ ScottTrade that isn't doing too hot, and I'd like to put it into a Vanguard index fund.  Can I do buy that from within my ScottTrade account or do I have to create an account at vanguard and somehow transfer it over ?  Is there any disadvantage to just buying it from withing ScottTrade, like will  they charge me an unnecessary fee ?  The actual amount is a mere pittance, like 4k.    	113

After five years of development, the Uralvagonzavod Research and Production Corporation has finalized manufacture of the first batch of Armata tanks and heavy personnel carriers. They have been included in Russias 2015 defense order, TASS said.  The new Armata armored tracked platform has reportedly combined and assimilated all the last decades major developments and innovations in battle vehicle design and construction.  The platforms chief tank (T-14) sports an unmanned remotely controlled turret armed with a brand new 125 mm 2A82-1M smoothbore cannon. Its muzzle energy is greater than one of the worlds previously considered best cannons: the German Leopard-2 Rheinmetall 120 mm gun.  The 125 mm gun has 15-20 percent improved accuracy and its rolling fire angular dispersion has improved 1.7 times.   According to Russian media, the Armata tank might also come with a specially developed 152 mm gun, the most powerful ever cannon to be mounted on a main battle tank.  The tanks turret will also carry a 30 mm sub-caliber ranging gun to deal with various targets, including low-flying aerial targets, such as attack planes and helicopters.  A 12.5 mm turret-mounted heavy machine gun is reportedly capable of taking out incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles. Its capable of neutralizing shells approaching at speeds of up to 3,000 meters per second.  The tanks crew is securely enclosed in a multi-layer armored capsule separated from the ammunition container. The vehicle is fully computerized and only needs two servicemen to operate it. Each can also deploy the tanks weapon systems.  The tanks targeting is reportedly done with an active-phased array antenna and a large variety of other sensors.  The Armata platform allegedly has a fully mechanized electric transmission, powered by a 1,200 HP diesel engine. For greater efficiency, maintenance and repair schedules have been extended.  Within its blueprint, the Armata armored vehicle has the potential to evolve into a fully robotic battle vehicle.  According to preliminary estimates, 2,300 units are required for the Russian army.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsAePLKmBfY   According to a new design specification from the Military-Industrial Commission in Moscow, a transport aircraft, dubbed PAK TA, will fly at supersonic speeds (up to 2,000 km/h) and will boast an impressively high payload of up to 200 tons. It will also have a range of at least 7,000 kilometers.  The PAK TA program envisages 80 new cargo aircraft to be built by 2024. This means in a decade Russias Central Command will be able to place a battle-ready armored army anywhere, Expert Online reports, citing a source in the military who attended the closed meeting.  The PAK TA freighters will be multilevel, with automated cargo loading and have the capability to airdrop hardware and personnel on any terrain.  With the development of a network of military bases in the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia, which is expected to be completed during the same time period (by 2024), its obvious that Russia is preparing for a full-scale military confrontation of transcontinental scale, Expert Online says.   A source who attended the closed meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission told the media outlet on condition of anonymity that he was shocked by the demands of the military.  According to the source, the PAK TA project has been ongoing for several years now and will eventually supplant the currently operating air freighters. But such a global mission statement for national military transport aviation has never been voiced before.  It means for the first time we have the objective of creating an operational capability to airlift a full-fledged army to any desired place on the planet, the source said. This means delivering a task force the size of the former NATO and the US troops in Iraq, in a matter of hours to any continent. In the context of the current military doctrine that defies comprehension, the source said.  The initial PAK TA specification entailed building subsonic air freighters with a conventional 900 km/h cruising speed and a moderate 4,500-kilometer range. The program involves the creation of wide-body freighters, with payloads varying from 80 to 200 tons, to replace all existing Ilyushin and Antonov cargo aircraft. The only operating aircraft with a comparable payload is the Antonov An-225 Mriya (up to 250 tons), but this is a one-off aircraft created specially for the Soviet Buran space shuttle program.  Last year, it was reported that future military air freighters will be developed by the Ilyushin Aviation Complex, with some experts saying the company may base designs on the Il-106 cargo plane (80 tons) project that won a government tender in the late 1980s, but was abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now, with ambitious specifications and objectives, the PAK TA is a truly next-generation transport aircraft.   According to a new design specification from the Military-Industrial Commission in Moscow, a transport aircraft, dubbed PAK TA, will fly at supersonic speeds (up to 2,000 km/h) and will boast an impressively high payload of up to 200 tons. It will also have a range of at least 7,000 kilometers.  The PAK TA program envisages 80 new cargo aircraft to be built by 2024. This means in a decade Russias Central Command will be able to place a battle-ready armored army anywhere, Expert Online reports, citing a source in the military who attended the closed meeting.  The PAK TA freighters will be multilevel, with automated cargo loading and have the capability to airdrop hardware and personnel on any terrain.

The whistle is not a sound that anyone will forget, its very harmonic.  It almost has just as much power as the US dollar in terms of context.  The dollar is just a piece of paper but because people think its worth something that's where the value comes in, same with the whistle.   Maybe it needs a spinoff,  better call Ken Jeong?

She had the least to gain so I don't think it was done on purpose.    I would think one catch rule would've been mentioned definitely agree,  I'm sure you can think of at least two.   It would definitely change the dynamic of the game.    Definitely will keep that in mind thanks for the heads up.   A lot of these rules sound like they would slow the game down quite a bit. Maybe the refs get more calls right and the players are safer, but the fans want to watch Football.    That's one bad picture,  what's next he'll fire's on a Piper Cub?

 True, wondering if they are saving the bigger maps for a BTB DLC playlist?     I played for 9 hours last night... Pitfall popped up the first match (didn't play)   never appeared again all night...    Halo 4 is now half off, but the map packs are still $25 for season pass... if they'd have a sale on DLC, maybe it'd spark some interest in MP?    CoolinAustin Tumblr hasn't been updated since mid May...   Traffic. They need to encourage public transit. If they had more taxis, perhaps the fight for uber wouldn't be so much of a no-brainer... multiple trains seems needed.  Also, multiple toll roads that are almost empty seems to be a waste. Seems like all the taxes from the hundreds of people moving here a day would pay for them...       He would go to downtown Memphis   sit at the counter of the black-only bars (which was illegal for whites to mingle)   would wait for the cops to show up   try to make him leave...   These   other Memphis wrasslin stories are featured in 'Memphis Heat' documentary    the answer (me thinks) is for communities to offer Internet like a utility   the same with cable TV    I'm a 11 year live member. Up until a year ago, I didnt' care either. Then I got bored. My friends are getting older (families   work)   don't play as much. I play tons of MP, but most games the achievements are in the campaign.   I started playing the campaigns since they were collecting dust   started having fun again. I started racking up gamerscore from the achievements popping up. Then, I finished the campaigns. I started chasing the achievements, not for the points but the actual challenge.   It's encouraging me to complete tasks   that's pretty fun...      Edit: Found this: Pt 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT2S3UkieII Pt 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxQ6qFj48Og     I've felt for a long time that Libraries should go ahead   put in coffee shops. They are like a hipster Netflix that's not utilized. You can get books, comic books, DVDs, CDs   etc through Libraries. Go ahead   throw in a post office Kiosk   you got a central hub for communities.   Whenever I get rid of stuff, I just donate them to libraries. Hopefully some kid across the country will be able to check them out   appreciate them.    http://www.w3schools.com/  Online, but...   So, will these skulls be able for use in every game in MCC?   Also, I noticed XBOX Store has preorder with no mention of Skulls (only $10 Card)   EDIT: found out the preorder skulls only applies to H2 Other games have their own skulls...   if they do a Halo themed XB1, they HAVE to make that happen...   Also, I know I will say 'Cortana' accidentally waaaay less than I do 'XBOX' during gaming...   I'll buy all the maps they want... throw in Firefight ODST   Reach too   Best ISP commercial   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ilMx7k7mso    But it's OK for them to pass out your check   ask for payment right at the climax of the movie...   Seriously wish when you buy your ticket, you have a running tab   close it out after the movie. If not, a % tip is added for service.      Wow, I was just posting how I'll miss proximity voice on H2A...  I think it should, but on XBOX ONE there is no voice messaging. There's game chat   party chat... I figure if they can't include audio messages, then it'll be skipped... I hope I'm wrong.      I would love to play Halo 4, but the DLC maps I paid for never ever ever appear.  I usually play Halo 4 mostly, but the multiplayer has become stagnant.   I've been playing Halo 3, Reach,   Anniversary campaign since E3 to get my fix...   I pre-bought the Halo 4 DLC maps  I never get to play them  I ALREADY am discouraged from buying future DLC maps   well no shit...   Seriously, it's treasonous to sell out the US for your or your parties own personal interests.    Over the past year, I have made it a point to use Bing every day. They have 'points' you can trade in for a chance to win rewards... I'm at work   can't install Chrome, so it was worth a try.   I got to say, BING is better than I thought it was. Some things, it's on par with Google, but some things it's actually better.   I'm not going to say BING is better than Google but it's a closer race than most anyone gives credit.   Maybe it's because Google isn't nearly as good as it used to be. They have filters now. Google just doesn't seem to return the same amount of results...     Nope, had a generic HD from Amazon for $30 (VS $130) since slim's launch...   Artist:  Pawel Kuczynski    for those keeping score:  http://majornelson.com/2013/04/08/halo-4-castle-map-pack/  A year ago, they lowered the prices for a sale. It'd be nice if they did something permanently this Summer...  http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Map_Packs  here is a history of the map packs and their prices. Halo 4 map packs are the EXACT same price today as they were brand new ($10).   Halo 4 now sells for $30, which is 50% off the original price.   MSFT   343 has a group of dedicated fans who wants to play their product. Despite all it's shortcomings, seems people are practically begging to be able to play   enjoy it...   When Halo 5 comes out, what incentive do we have to buy the DLC maps? I'm sure I will, but I'll have reservations about doing so. For a game like Halo, it should be a no brainer.     compared with other Halo releases, Halo had the lowest amount of maps available at launch. DLC maps would help remedy that.   If they want to stimulate people into buying Halo 5   it's DLC (  Anniversary edition if true), this'd be a good way. If they'd make them free, it'd definitely be goodwill.   I know a lot of people who never played Halo 4 after the Title Update. This would be great to bring some of them back.       Outside of the Map Pack Playlist (which don't exist anymore):  Do any of you ever get to play the DLC maps in rotation?   I know if you go in with a party who ALL have the maps, then they appear more frequently. What about those who paid for the maps   don't have friends who play Halo 4?  Even when the game was recently released, I never saw the DLC maps other than in the DLC playlist.   Right now, you can DL Halo 4 from xbox store for $30. You can DL map packs for $25. Since Halo 5 is on the horizon, you think the maps should be lowered in price?   If so: think 343 could require DLC maps for certain playlist?   Compared to other Halo releases, Halo 4 had the smallest amount of maps available at launch. Sure, they've got some forge maps, but it'd be great to be able to play the maps we paid for. It'd be great to have some variety.    Chief is gonna work with Dr Halsey cause she's the only one that can save Cortana. Plus, she's onto something bigger than the UNSC...I've said too much.    if they could get all the multiplayer maps for all these games playable in one playlist...    Do you like Titanfall?  Do you want to play more Titanfall maps?  Do you think you will get all the maps?  Can you afford $25?   If you answered YES to all the above questions then you should buy the season pass.   Usually, studios save the best maps for purchase. This is the cheapest season pass for any game I've seen, seems like a bargain.    Right you are Ken   Being able to pull audio / video files on my XBOX One from my PC / Network... Windows Media Center.    our prohibition of marijuana has created the violent criminal subculture of Mexico. much like how our prohibition of alcohol created gangs in Canada.   also, think about how much US dollars have crossed the border because of drug laws...it's drained our economy.   now, think of all the weapons the CIA has planted (sold) to all the countries south of the US   those implications.    Haven't picked up the book yet but: isn't Spider-Man's ID public knowledge after he gave a press conference at the end of Civil War?      I'm gonna wait until the price drops   bugs fixed.  What Spider-Man games would you recommend?  I played Web of Shadows (really liked) I started Shattered Dimensions last week (frustrating webslinging...)    I went to his gallery in ATX yesterday. great.  liked that Gambit   Rogue were facing each other liked that Deadpool is breaking the 4th wall  the Sue Richards portrait was the best...   every other episode of Looney Toons has a reference I pick up now...    i like Titanfall but one of my gripes about the game is that what is on my screen isn't necessarily on my deathscreen.   Example: I'll be on a roof, barely sticking my head over the top to get a shot, I'll be shot,   in my deathscreen I'll be standing fully exposed deserving attention...   Glad I wasn't imagining it...    MSFT is phasing out Media Center. If you notice, the latest 360 versions   Win 8 WMC have less features than before. on the 360, you can't find it in recent items   can't pin it...  MSFT is pushing their Video/Music store product. Also, with their partnerships with studios, they have to show they are trying to combat piracy.   MSFT will get creamed by SONY partially b/c of this. there's no way to pull media files on the XB1 from network/PC. they want you to go through their apps first.    I haven't tried this but:  You tried opening IE   going to the browser version of spotify? https://play.spotify.com/  I know pandora works through IE...    i already use my android as a remote (smartglass) using my youtube app on phone along with it works great    if AC/DC doesn't play halftime at at the SuperBowl at least once...    About ready for Parks   Rec to wrap it up. Beginning to feel like The Office after Carell left.   I watched every episode of The Office week to week but kept asking myself why. It's time could be watching something else. It already felt stretched out at the end before he left.   Parks   Rec (like most shows) is doing over 20 episodes a year. Used to, 13 was a normal season for a sitcom. Think how England usually does 6-8   they hardly ever do more than 2-3 seasons. Normally, they take more than a year between to create content. Just seems like they stretch shows out.   Glad Community is back. Last season, I felt like I was over it, but this season is great. Still, thinking it may have another season before they should walk away.    Go On was great, but haven't liked much else on NBC. Kind of feel like the sitcom it worn out. CBS gets great numbers, buth they're terrible. It's like the Leno of sitcoms. It's just as 'edgy' as the same sitcoms I watched in the 70's. I think CBS only puts up great numbers because their demographic is old people. They all agree CBS is safe enough to watch. CBS is on every TV in every retirement home, every hospital lobby,   they probably fell asleep after wheel of fortune...  Was surprised how good the IT Crowd was yet not much recognition. Of course, they tried to redo it in USA. The pilot was EXACTLY the same. Why not just put up the original? Besides simply being great, community is great because it's not so formulaic. You know, the same thing network execs don't encourage while looking at the numbers.   Nothing created will be great without risk. With large data, companies are taking less   less risk in every market. Everything is so calculated. Poor Heat Vision   Jack, you never had a chance...     why is she not Wonder Woman?   Before the XBOX 360 launch, the AVG price of a game was $50. Then they raised it to $60 saying they needed to because of increase of console life (was AVG 3 years, 360 = 8 years). Fine. Then a couple years later, the Entertainment Software Assoc said the price of games could come back down to $50. Nope, didn't happen. The market determined that buyers were willing to pay $60.   Disc-less, on demand games surely would be cheaper. No packaging, no shipping, no storage,   no middle men. Who cares about retail   Gamestop? Who buys games from mom   pops?  If I could pay $40 (or less) on midnight of launch   DL immediately, I could live without something physical. It's not like there was art in the case. It's not like the argument for Vinyl when .mp3s were taking over CDs.   Surely, the developers / publishers like this model seeing how there's no way I can lend, trade, or sell it off.   MSFT can come up with a model where direct games on demand sold at a lower price, they can still get equal or better profits... Just seems to reason that lower price equals more units sold.   	44

Took them 15 minutes to fix it                  For example, some horror movies have been ranked by which produced the highest heart rate (The Shining increases bpm by 28%) and some comedies are measured in "laughs per minute" (Airplane has 3 laughs per minute).

You should respect your aunt's wishes.  Don't be a dick.   Its unlikely that you'd be assigned a public defender without appearing in court first-at least that seems to be the general process.  You can hire an attorney to appear for you, but in most criminal actions the defendant is required to be present.   It's unlikely you'd find someone to do this for free. Attorneys make their living by charging clients.    Hey hey hey! There are literally dozens of us!!    Can I just ship something to my neighbor and hand him a bill for it  Of course not.  Your neighbor did not order anything from you.  You engaged in business with this third party and through a series of misunderstandings got a free product.  You do not get to keep free products under those circumstances.  That is the law.  Where you read that you do not need to pay for it or send it back, those are *unordered* merchandise.  Like you sending something completely unsolicited to your neighbor.  This is not that situation.   Generalized anxiety and panic disorder. Thank goodness for Paxil.    Yeah that came out of left field.      Obviously he can not afford a lawyer, as he is living in his car, and our public defenders here are notoriously guilty plea factories. Are there any organizations that offer help in these kinds of situations?  Public defenders are no better or worse than paid attorneys.  Public defenders tend to plea out many cases because many of their clients are dead to rights guilty and there is only so much they can do.  If the stop and search was legitimate, it doesn't matter how much you pay for an attorney, your brother is almost certain to be found guilty.  In that circumstance pleading it out would likely get him a better deal.  Not every criminal case benefits from going to trial.  If this is his first offense he's unlikely to get the maximum penalty.  You'd need to find a friend or family member that can take the dog.   Guys like this give lawyers a bad name.   /u/Citicop you are not welcome here!!   I'd be interested to see any case law you might have on this.   I know if I tried that argument with a judge they'd tell me I knew exactly what was meant and shoot my argument down.    The consensus here disagrees with you. Consent is not a two way street. They have consent to record you. You do not have consent to record them.    OOP?   What did you have in your apartment that was worth $28,000?  Keep in mind that you can certainly sue him, and would almost certainly win, but you cannot sue for the value of new items.  You have to sue for the market value of your used items.  If someone steals my car, I can't sue them for the replacement value of a brand new car, but the value of my old used car.    And he enjoys fawning over 15 year old girls  Link?   Why were you in jail for 14 days if you were not charged with anything?   A statement from a cop is neither of those things.    Yes   You can absolutely get a ticket without getting pulled over.    Well here's the thing. If you ask an officer what should I do, and the officer says, do this, that MAY be entrapment. If you ask an officer is it legal for me to do this, and he lies and says yes, that's not entrapment    It's clear that you wanted to do it, that you were inclined to do it, but were waiting for legal advice from a police officer that is permitted to lie to you. Entrapment is when you had no inclination to do the illegal act, info from police or not.    The police are allowed to lie to you. If the cop ordered him to pick up the bag that's different.    New Jersey does not offer a no contest plea.    No that's not entrapment. Police have no duty to tell you the truth and lying to you is not entrapment. It's almost never entrapment.    Legal advice is don't get involved in other peoples business when it will just come back to bite you in the ass, slugger.    What "system?"   "Best of /r/legaladvice" based on the title alone.   Wait, it says he's 182 cm.  Isn't that like 5'11'??   I usually dont like childfree evangelists who like to spout vitriol about crotch fruit and such. That said, this is their wedding, let everyone know ahead of time, and *they paid for a babysitter for family with kids.*  They've gone above and beyond. I love my children but if someone else is going to pay for a sitter so I can eat their food drink their beer and rock out to music fuck yeah I'm all about it.    Or if he's an at will employee just fire him without giving a reason.    You can contact them to let them know about your concerns.  If you so chose you could sue them for any damages to your son, which from what you state here are very minimal.    In many states, like mine, there is no statute of limitations for rape  What state is that?    'm guessing that most Americans didn't have this education  You seriously don't think Americans are taught about ancient Egypt?  That the only info we get about Egypt comes from watching Abbot and Costello meet the Mummy?     Because it isn't breaking a law. This is not a legal issue.    Why did you repost this?    But it isn't my natural response.  I do a lot of stuff during sex that isn't my natural response because it makes my partner happy.  Sex isn't all about you.    The fights are pretty good huh?  Yeah, they were. Even if you want to call them dancing they were awesome looking dances.   Sue him for what you feel he owes you.  Courts normally frown on self help.   She can certainly sue for the costs to replace the pet, as well as any damage to her belongings in her room.  Keep wolf hybrids may be illegal in her area.  In any case she should report the incident to animal control.   Fleas?   Lots of people don't realize that the constitution refers to habeas corpus as a privilege, not a right, and specifically permits it to be suspended "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."   I don't know of any laws that require RAs to keep information confidential.      Bolt VanderHuge  Big McLargeHuge. Blast HardCheese. Blast ThickNeck. Bob Johnson. Bold BigFlank?    I'll be blunt - is this code for "I asked the concierge to send up a hooker?"  My thoughts 100%    That is five miles over the posted speed limit, but going "with the flow of traffic" for the road.  Speeding is speeding.  The "flow of traffic" does not matter.    That's simply not true. 26 states do not require showing ID prior to anything short of an arrest.  Every single state requires you to show your license if you are driving a car.  You are incorrect.   Orders are orders. You cannot make your own adjustments. Take it to court.    Okay bro.   If I refuse to play holiday music in the restaurant I'm an assistant manager at during my shifts, if I were to get reprimanded, could I expect anti discrimination protection as an atheist?  Oh for Christ's sake.   Heh.  Wiener.    Kim has to spend every other weekend at Joe's because of court not wanting to give us full custody, we want Joe out of the picture  Even if you had full custody her father would still get visitation.  It is highly unlikely you will ever be able to eliminate her father from her life.  Tells her Kim won't be going back anytime soon until they get their shit figured out with Dan.  Court ordered child arrangements are *orders* not suggestions that you can change as you wish.  She is required to adhere to the visitation schedule are her mother is required to ensure that she does.  If you are afraid for her safety the proper course of action is to attempt to modify the order.    I have no reason to ever return to that state, and seriously doubt I would be extradited over a misdemeanor that is 15 years old.  They would likely extradite you.  Even if they didn't there would still be an active warrant for your arrest.  Every time you had any interaction with the police you'd be arrested due to that warrant.   Yeah, you tell LocationBot.  I'm tired of it confusing those terms!   Unless she has an employment contract, she can be fired at the end of the 12 weeks of leave if she does not return to work.   There is no law against hanging out with young men.   Yes it does. You appeared to be drunk in public. As a student there there's a good chance you're a minor. You had bottle of liquid in plain view. That's likely probable cause right there. The officer does not need to go get a warrant for the bottle sticking out of your pocket.    He threatened to arrest me if I did not leave immediately.     I was given tramatic brain injury from this, and would like to see justice. What should my next cognitive step legal be?  Speak with a personal injury attorney.   Your bottle was in plain sight.  You were likely acted much drunker than you think you were, which is likely all the probable cause they need.  You were threatened with arrest because you were ordered to leave an area and did not, not because you wanted to file a complaint.   Details.   You gave away someone else's property. The correct course of action would be to take the dog to an animal shelter not give it away to a third party.    The lease will control the pet situation. If she brings a cat in DO NOT take matters into your own hands. That's theft.    You will have no success whatsoever in beating these tickets. It just me not happen.   That said I'd love to see the legal research you did on how the 5th Amendment applies to traffic tickets.    The majority of mainstream feminists do not look down on stay at home moms. They want women to have a choice. If you freely choose to stay home, they think that's awesome.    That is the basic definition of feminism.      I am not a feminist.  You don't think men and women should be equal?   You will almost certainly not get off on a technicality. I've never seen that happen with a speeding ticket.    You didn't get tracked   i respectfully disagree  And the law disagrees with you.  The law wins, btw.   Custody of children comes down to what is best for them. Pets are property and are examined in that light. You can make the argument that since you found them and have spent the most time with them you own them. Be prepared for a judge to give one to you and one to your sister.    A female and I (6'1" male) get in a heated argument over some topic. In a fit of rage, she swings and sucker punches me as hard as she can. In angry retaliation, I strike her back as hard as I can. Due our size difference, I get off with only a chipped tooth/swollen mouth, while she is left with a serious concussion/possible permanent brain injury. How screwed would I be? Would there be significant changes if our injuries were similar, if I swung first, if the other person was male, or if the person they initially sucker punched wasn't me, but rather a friend?  Not nearly enough information to say.   I am carrying an expensive ring and drop it on the ground. As I go to pick it up, someone else quickly scoops it up and begins running away. For all intents and purposes assume there is beyond a doubt no way an officer would make it in time before the thief got away, and no way the thief could be tracked/caught. Believing that the ring would be lost for good otherwise, I sprint after them and tackle them to the ground. In order to escape, they attack me in what is arguably self defense. In the struggle to prevent them from escaping, I injure them in some way (ex: break their arm). Would I be screwed in this case? What if instead of stealing the item, it was some unique heirloom they were threatening to break, so that if I didn't interfere in that moment it would beyond a doubt be destroyed?  You could face repercussions but they are unlikely.  You are not Batman and should call the police if such an issue arises.  Some co-worker keeps eating my lunch I leave in the fridge, but no one fesses up when I ask around. I make it clear, I leave a note by the food, belongs to Noobsauce, please do not take! Eventually I lose my cool and hatch an evil plot- I load my next lunch with a bunch of laxative. Am I technically breaking the law here? What if the person had a serious medical reaction to what I put into the food, whether it be some unintended extreme (allergic to something), something in the middle (x10 the recommended dose of laxatives), or something terrible (I go crazy and add cyanide to my lunch)?  We get this question all the time.  No, this is not legal.  	75
 Islam happened. Again.    Says the guy that most likely never even read anything by Ayn Rand and is just regurgitating what his buddies that also never read anything by Rand say.    Absolutely.    You should sharpen that knife.   Otherwise,  you're a goddamn bad ass with a great psycho murderer vibe about.    He should sharpen that knife.    You should read The Last Ringbearer. It's LOTR written from the perspective of Mordor being the industrial good guys and Gandalf and posse being the religious fanatics.    Oh wow.    Hey look everyone. I found the lazy socialist parasite!    Basic income is pretty much as the Dire Straits put it. Money for nothing. It's a disgusting concept rewarding laziness and freeloading.    Was there last year.  1800 yen beers.    Suddenly "Gay Bar"  by Electric Six got a whole lot more relevant. (the video clip).    Hugged to death by the religion of peace. Lovely....  This is what you get when a nation sleeps and let's these parasites in.    I am so happy this has nothing to do with Islam.   Oh...    Gonna go by a restaurant supply store today to see what they carry.    The best part about this is that the final result is shown for more than a microsecond.    Same in the Netherlands. Then again,  manual transmissions are the norm and automatic transmission are over 3 grand more expensive site even for bottom range cars.    Tastes pretty good! Just not smooth.    I shave my dome with a DE. It's works well. Some small specs of blood once in a while,  but nothing serious.   He pretty much made a razor in a spoonshape. This is not some guy getting a spoon from. His cutlery drawer and sharpening it.    Just tried this. Added a ton more oil. Not smooth.  Not sure what is going on. (replaced sugar with liquid splenda).    Kampers we call em. Type of gypsy. Usually criminal.   Vanilla ice cream. Take a bite,  take a sip. Heaven.    It the prevent accidental wake up feature. Disable it and the problem is gone. It's in the display settings.   Gonna give it a try. Anything to get rid of Good for Enterprise.  Good for Enterprise sure, Good for User: not in a trillion years.   A bit of soft wet cloth and some buffing.  Done.  If it's really stuck, some chrome polish is what I use, but that more of an annual ritual.   I can envision Nathan Explosion grunting this in a "Murmaider" type song.    Was wondering if anyone has a good solution for using Outlook Web Access on Android besides via a browser.   I can only use this form of remote access for this at the moment for my work email. The official Microsoft app only supports 365 OWA and not on site hosted exchange.   OWM for Android is something I tried,  but is very poor in my opinion and not worth the money.    Good point, thanks for clarifying.    T-Mobile. Lied to me. Cost me a ton of money. Refuses to do anything about it. After 8 years with them I dumped them. I will never ever do any business with them again.    Recently my power button seems to have become a bit wonky. It's a hit and miss on its functionality. Sometimes it works great for hour son need. Sometimes it does nothing and mashing it for a while makes it work.   Running AOSiP 8.0 with hellscore 7.   Perhaps this is something one of you has encountered as well.    Interesting. It seems to be hit and miss for he most part. For example I cannot run chroma with Franco.  It never gets past the boot logo.    Caputo is a proper fellow. He is forced into this. Without him someone else,  perhaps or even likely worse. At least like this he can so some good.    "Some people" are mistaking Malachite (Mineral) with Malachite Green (dye). Malachite Green (dye) has nothing to do with Malachite (Mineral).  Then again, it's useless to argue with an idiot. You cannot win, they have much more experience in being clueless.  Even if it was harmful, it's firmly embedded in epoxy and pretty harmless regardless.   Mom or dad being sad. Breaks my heart.    5.1.1 AOSiP v8.0,  hellscore 7 mako, Vodafone (no carrier lock).    Highly illegal in many places. Will give you a piece of mind,  and may hold in court,  but prepare for criminal charges.    Not all mineral oil is safe. But there is food grade mineral oil readily available. Even Ikea has it if needed.    We have this here too. It's still full of sugar. Also in my opinion it tasted poor.   Wonder if we can hack this into a custom rom.   Al Bundy.  He could've had it all. But he sticks around to provide. He often is rude, but never violent to his own family. He's very protective, but gives his kids enough space to do their own thing.    Chrome or Chrome Beta. Depends a bit on my on my mood. No point getting something else, it's all a WebView skin anyway.   I too can pull words out of my ass and write an article.  Most of this shit is thinking "what is the logical next step up from current". So we up the processor gen one, add a tad more ram and pull some bullshit MP number out of our ass.  Done.   Boobs.  Also being able to make it in life by just being pretty.   The quality tier for home mixers is pretty much:  Old school Kitchenaid (Hobart) Kenwood (higher tier)  Kitchenaid  others.  Modern kitchenaid mixers have a high premium on the name. The Kenwood Titan mixers are far superior at the same pricepoint.   Why I cannot go out shop on a Sunday, on a extended note, why weekends even exist. Let me pick my own 2 days.   1. Hire lawyers at at least " Big-Five" partner level. 2. Make lawyers ensure the taxman gets at little as possible, 3. Break up pot into smaller pots (investments, mixed risk). 4. Have a fat spending account to get the urge to spend out of my system (less than 10%).  5. ~~Kill a couple of hobos~~ Enjoy life. 6. edit: Buy enough shares in the company I currently work for that I get some power. 7. Fire my ex-boss.   Searing hot grill. Dry meat on the outside (After smoking).   	47
 Mmmbop - Hanson   You're not really from London, are you?   [This music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQnNH7I07RY)   My tutor told us about a student that got caught plagiarising in her dissertation and in the plagiarism hearing yelled "I paid 300 for that - I should at least get a 2:1".   She did not get a 2:1.         I'm going to have the music stuck in my head for the rest of the day now   People who declare some cool new tech will never work because of some political or cultural quirk that is unique to the US - there are other places in the world!   If something bad happens to me, it is likely to in some way be my fault      It always surprises me that this annoys people so much - it just seems like the polite thing to do.                                        It is, although mainly because you can't forget to take it. I have one and it is really great, although a bit weird to feel in your arm   The article says "will be" - I assume they wrote this from a press release put out ahead of the presentation                                                    [Link to the NPR interview](http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/08/14/nasa-future-bolden) in case anyone is interested   Planetary Resources is [actually hiring](http://www.planetaryresources.com/careers/).                           Please update us after - interested in seeing how this plays out!            The cynic in me wonders if part of it is that robots don't need tips, which I can see being highly popular with some customers.  Plus, novelty value - any hotel staffed by robots is going to attract a lot of interest!            Typical! Thanks for the heads up, I will take this down   Not anymore - Siri no longer recommends locations, possibly because of this case   Wouldn't developing food solutions for space will benefit other missions too? What about when we want to take a journey that is a lot longer than 50 years? Or if we want to develop some form of colony or base?  Surely it would be better to be able to create new food?   Ah I see! Thanks for the explanation   Apologies if I am misunderstanding, but surely the food wouldn't survive in that growing environment?    How exactly would that help anything?   What made you decide to make the transition from computer scientist to futurist, and how did you go about it?   Ten years from now, how different do you expect our daily lives to be from today?   Probably because old people would go on mad spending binges before they died, rendering the whole exercise pointless.     You'd probably feel differently if you or your friends or family were the ones infected   I wish we'd had this class when I was in school   Are you addressing this to me? Or in general?   I shared the article because I thought it was an interesting perspective rather than disliking religion's role. I suspect that religion will recede due to people's lack of need for it, but I don't have a dislike of it in this context   At least he hasn't started blaming the Illuminati.   I'm not so sure - for very large items (for example wind turbines) I can see the benefit, and I do wonder why companies would still be pursuing this if there was no benefit to it at all.  I hope we see a time when airships are used (plus they'd remind me of the Twains from Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter's Long Earth series!)   I would argue that living longer lives isn't a true endgoal because it doesn't have a defined target - once we all feel like 50 when we're 100 we'll only be looking to the next horizon.    I'm not sure myself - does anyone know about this? Although obviously there are a lot of landlocked areas where shipping won't be much help.   It's the title of the article - not my title   They have the machines to buy tickets by a lot of the bus stops on the route too   Interesting to see that [BT is blocking Reddit](https://www.blocked.org.uk/results?url=http://www.reddit.com)   Why would higher speeds not be possible with a hanging rail design?    This is a fascinating story, and a pretty good insight into the practices of early archaeologists - amazing this stuff wasn't found earlier!   No one game - just the fact that every game previewed looked awesome, even the (very few) that wouldn't normally be my thing. I'd been thinking about if for a long time, but that was when I realised I had to go for it.    Thank you for doing the AMA.  What do you think the state of privacy and freedom of information will be a decade from now? Do you think Wikileaks will have an impact on future policy in this area?   Being immune to pathogens and diseases doesn't automatically make you physically attractive - unless there is some element of this that I have missed?   Not if they were a complete dick   I quite agree - I didn't mean that it was a reason not to do this, just that achieving 'perfect' babies was a different thing to making them healthy. I think its an excellent idea, and I hope it becomes a reality as quickly as the article says.    Is there not a difference between 'perfect' and not carrying a disease? I took it to mean aesthetic features such as hair/eye colour etc.   Here in the UK courses like these are starting to popup for various industries, mainly in tech. From what I hear they are doing a far better job of preparing people for employment than traditional degrees.    As a general rule, if an article leads with a question the answer will be no.   What about the cost argument? Meat could get too expensive to eat on a daily basis - would you consider bugs then?   These guys seem to have quite a selection: http://www.thailandunique.com/ I haven't used them myself but I've tried the candy they carry before and was quite impressed.   The two aren't mutually exclusive, surely?   You just blew my mind.    Really can't decide if this would be a good thing or not - it might make football a bit sterile. What do people think?   Fair point, although I live in London and given house prices here are approaching a million quid for anything larger than a shoebox in a lot of boroughs I might end up being in the position where space-saving furniture was a still better option financially   What about being able to quickly rearrange the room for exercise or a party and then putting it back just by pressing a button? I live in a small flat and this would be a big plus for me   perhaps we could even have a robot robo chair technician?   It's called a joke. And you might want to calm down before you pop an artery.  To return to the intellectual side of this, yes I know the sun does it, but I was referring to human-made technology. It's never been achieved by humans, and given that we can't just recreate the sun there is no way yet to be certain it will definitely be achieved, particularly if it gets superseded by another technology that is cheaper to create.    Others may be able to shed more light on this, but I believe in US business this is known as a Chinese Wall, where information is prevented from moving between parts of the business to prevent conflicts of interest. I gather it is very common among big businesses, although how normal it is outside of the US I don't know.    Methinks you may have misunderstood my point. Keep working on that intellectual insight, sweetheart.   What exactly is a grey ceiling tile supposed to contribute to this discussion?   You're putting a lot of faith in a technology that has never actually generated more energy than it takes to run it   a projection is not the same as a projector.   Yeah my bad - missed this when it was first announced   I don't know, they seem to have a lot more information on their website than classic vapourware    This is the shortlist (from the last paragraph of the article): Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hong Kong, Maldives, Montenegro, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Norfolk Islands, Palau, Panama, Senegal, Sierre Leone, Singapore, Suriname and Vanuatu   Thanks for doing the AMA guys, very much appreciated.   My question is, do you see humanity going extinct in the future? If so when and from what cause?   I agree - I heard a rumour they were going into wearable tech, and I cannot see that ending well   My additions to that would be:  1. Make sure people know you've released a new console, not just a new controller 2. Release more games   Judging by the stage the tech mentioned in the article is at, we're likely to be looking at 5 years minimum   Beyond Good and Evil (gamecube, HD version for PS3) uses a camera heavily for gameplay, although you are mainly photographing animals/revolutionary occurrences - it makes for a pretty awesome gameplay mechanic :)   Might be partly to do with the UK bank holiday - I didn't realise this was already out   Report came out today   I want your brother's job!   I think it depends on the size of the community there and what kinds of policies you are talking about - outside organizations and earth-based politicians are only going to affect some issues, so even if they are technically in control, a lot of issues are still going to be decided internally.    My pleasure! There's something so cool about old maps   Interesting technology - if this got going I think there might be an initial tree loss but I guess we'd see more being planted as the technology became commercialised   mmm tasty   Would they not be flying quite a bit lower than commercial jets? I have to admit I'm no expert on airspace, but I assume that if they are able to land on buildings they will be a long way off the airspace jets will be in   What makes you so sure?   I wouldn't regard an obese person to be inherently unhealthy, only if they were sick or their size appeared to be affecting their health (eg their breathing). When my SO has no symptoms I would regard him to be healthier than an obese person, but not so much when he is sick   Medical treatments with stem cells - it will have a radical impact on the way diseases etc are treated   They're good in smoothies   Looks like a video game mirror   Invasive surgery   Yeah exactly that - when he has no symptoms he seems as healthy as the next person despite having a chronic condition   I'm sure there is a more precise medical definition, but I would consider people with disabilities to be healthy on the basis that they are not suffering from something that is affecting their immune system. Similarly, my SO has crohn's disease, which is a chronic autoimmune disease, but I consider him healthy when he has no symptoms.   I agree! Some people I know who say its rubbish haven't even used it.   Might be time to invest in a USB extension cable   Salt, pepper and a decent range of herbs and spices - helps improve cheap food no end!    Fair point.   Mine actually sticks out of my bag (although I do have a small bag) when I take it to work.  I think it could make much larger screens more portable, though, so that would be cool   That actually sounds pretty interesting too   Some very cool stuff here, but wouldn't all of this put farm workers out of business?   Personally I think the optical networks-on-chip for future multicore computer systems one would be the most interesting in terms of potential for cool findings and similar. I was not clear on what the Vellum project was - could you please elaborate?   I have had the same experience, but I don't think it's on the same scale. So many people stuck with XP that they never got to 7 to then respond that way to it.  I think a bigger part of it is that XP is what was out when many people finally got on board with the idea of computers - that OS is literally all they've known and all they are prepared to cope with.     I'd agree with this - my PS3 is a great Netflix machine and doesn't get the audio sync issues that I have with my PC.    I think getting more people online could have a really interesting effect on both the world and the internet. The internet does give you the tools to do an amazing amount - it really does make starting a business easier, so I could see it really benefiting people currently in poverty.  But it will be interesting to see what the impact will be on the internet - will the next mega internet company come from India? Will we see an increase in memes that derived from the pop culture of developing countries? Or will variation in internet speeds lead to region-specific ghettos online?  	137
          It will go negative.   There's no stopping the button.   I'm pretty sure in the TV show i'm not supposed to be purple.            I'm pretty sure this started a while ago when Sethbling did it.   use a bowl of water. usually does the trick for my grandpa. basically fill it up and pour it in the toilet. since it isn't toilet water, it should "flush" it down the toilet or something. when my sister explained it i wasn't really listening   Isn't that the main reason why people don't eat at the chum bucket?   when the servers are pinging, it's a rainbow.         Maybe later   pm me too!   But how did he take a photo of the polaroid when he's taking a photo of his phone?   How did you take that picture?   is that a paper towel?   don't forget eREKTion         nice, looks sweet  heh, see what I did there      I can see dirt on Picture 3  It really bothers me..

Get the ropes, please.   you talking about this? http://i.imgur.com/xm7R50T.png   This is also on a creative server, so sorry for all the other plots in the background.         oh, i've been in 1550 trophies and i was fine :/ I have a pretty good farming base   Looks like I need to push up to gold.

    The piece seems choppy, a haiku and a collection or notes for a more serious piece. I can't tell whether it's lazy, both for the writer and short-attention span readers, or thoughtfully crafted and that may be a strength. The format forces you to tell the story and tell it quickly, and that may be a plus. Is it affecting and moving? Yes, so it works as a piece. It's an experimental art form that is unsatisfying but yet manages to hang around because of its short, descriptive images. But it is not the future of story telling. The writer has real talent; he took a distant memory and gave it real-time urgency.       Drivers will view this as D-Day in the War on Cars.    I wish there was a Italian section. I'm no expert, but my understanding was that one time there was a small Italian neighborhood in DC but it was displaced by highway construction. There were some Italian grocery stores, at least one was left, on Connecticut in Dupont, but gone now. Baltimore has an Italian section with great restaurants and bakeries, but I haven't been there for 10 years. ... being from Connecticut, it's one thing I miss.   But the Vietnamese food in this area is exceptional. The Eden Center in Falls Church is great. (not Metro accessible and no help to your question)   Photo isn't straight.  Crop needs improvement.  Cars are distraction.   But great color, sharpness and detail.   Submit to photosig.com. It's a photo critique site.       @kavorka2  .. is right on the money. My unit doesn't have a front desk or elevator. My condo fee is $160.   .. A place I once lived in that had a front desk, three elevators and a pool, had condo fees in the $400+ plus range.    Actually, that's a really great deal. I live in 356 SF condo studio, and this place is about 15 SF bigger. But it also has a backyard -- which is awesome.   Considering the backyard, and the fact that you own your own place without condo fees, this strikes me as a very good price.   A custom-designed murphy bed unit, will create the illusion of even more space and get rid of the kitchen-bed problem.   Does it have a basement? Can you add to the rear of the house? Another 100 SF and you can almost claim one bedroom, and can you build another story?  This will sell quickly at $248.     In Connecticut, when I'm visiting relatives, there are many auctions that sell low-end stuff. I've picked up old photos, postcards, books, magazines, art prints for as little as $5-20. Furniture can range from $25 to $1,000 or more, but mostly lower. It's been a different story around here.    Iron Man isn't playing at the Smithsonian theaters, unfortunately. But once you do move here, keep an eye on its listings http://www.si.edu/Imax/Showtimes Sometimes it shows first run movies on its Imax screens. Oblivion is playing, but it's at its theater in Chantilly.    It seems like the problem is the last-mile provision. If DC entered into a contract that prohibits it from competing with Verizon, cable and others, then this service is permanently crippled and under utilized. It's great that when I use Mount Pleasant Library or MLK, the wifi is running at 20 MBS plus, but it would be wonderful if DC created area-wide hotspots, especially in under served areas. Good piece by Washington City Paper. This issue needs a lot more light.        I don't know how hidden this is, but the courtyard in the Portrait Gallery is an incredible hangout spot. Lots of seats, free high-speed Net, and refreshments, quiet and peaceful and right in the middle of downtown.  Open till 7 p.m.    Related question: Does anyone know any good auctions that aren't high-end? (i.e., furniture costing $45K) The kind of auctions were you can find relatively inexpensive items?      I'm glad they are using Duct-tape gray. Let's keep the memories alive!   Unless you like nature, history stuff, avoid Harper's Ferry. I wish I had a photo of a sign outside a Harper's Ferry restaurant, that said: "Cheese soup, Cheese sandwich special."   Go to Richmond.   http://www.richmondmagazine.com/articles/25-best-restaurants-04-30-2010.html   Elected officials from *Florida* should keep their mouths shut.  http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/orl-florida-political-scandals-pictures,0,7741735.photogallery   This isn't just about Wal-Mart vs. small stores. It's about big stores, too. Safeway prices can be pretty high, and anything that puts pressure on that chain is really welcomed.   There's a lot I don't like about Wal-Mart. It constantly shifts the hours of its employees (along with other retailers), and keeps them under the threshold for benefits. It doesn't want full-time workers. It wages and benefits are so awful some employees must turn to government assistance, so there's some cost-shifting going on here.   But the savings on some its products are real. For fixed income people, being able to save a dollar on a loaf of bread is a tangible thing. They will shop there.      It's good to have a sense of humor as well       You're kidding me.    Reuters is reporting that some NGOs are blaming market demand for low priced clothing. Margins are so tight that manufacturers are cutting corners on safety: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/25/bangladesh-building-idUSL6N0DC3N220130425  It's a fair point and something to think about, even if the source of this particular structural failure may be -- and I'm guessing here -- the fault of builders and/or inspectors.    I like the fact that the Vegas Lounge building has survived the apartment complex invasion on P at 14th, but the few interesting buildings remaining, it seems, are gradually being removed and replaced with higher density development.   Separately, it's just astonishing to me the amount of development on 14th north and south of U. The entire street is gradually being turned into a glass wall of complexes.  I really miss the old antiques store on 14th.      I like the description, "yet another generic 8-floor development in DC." Generic is probably right. DC needs a Gaudi to infuse some dramatic into buildings that are just blending into one another.    Here's an approach that was recommended to us and it work for me: Go to a condo with a front desk and just ask if any of the units are available for rent. With luck, you may catch an availability before it is listed online or find someone who isn't trying all that hard to rent their place, or learn of someone who is about to have a vacancy.      But populating it with junk content will deter readers as well.    This is a waste of precious natural electronic resources.   "Hey, I found a wallet with an *ID in it*. *Gee, I wonder who this wallet belongs to?*  I should check Reddit to see if anyone is looking for it!"  Memo to Redditors: Vote this plea up for help so more people will see the value of crowdsourcing stupidity.   Check Metro lost and found: http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/lost_found/   This isn't a recommendation, just a report. I've been a member of Bally's now LA Fitness since 1998 at 20th and L. Pay about $20 a month, but new memberships are about $29.00.   Plus: Plenty of weight machines, usually kept in good shape. Plenty of treadmills and there is almost never a wait to use them. Equipment seems well maintained.    Lockers: Blah and ugly. Never quite as clean as you would like it. Most of the showers have limited water flow, but there's usually soap. They don't supply towels.   If you don't mind the ambiance, it's not a bad value.    It's like entering a jewelry store. You feel the hush.   I didn't test the willingness of the clerks to let me play with the equipment. Some nice camera bags as well, although I didn't check them on price.   The other day when I walked by it, I saw a customer standing just outside the door with someone who appeared to be a sales rep. He appeared to be testing out a telephoto lens. I saw that as a good sign for the store.    *Replacing* physical colleges? No. Augmenting? Yes.    Wow --   the programmer makes one direct and one indirect suggestion for combating this   (1) have programmers from both parties review the source code   (2) if election results vary significantly from exit polling data, that polling data may offer a clear reason to investigate election.   Finally, these allegations deserve a major investigation by federal authorities and Congress.     It's just amazing that there are bears in the woods.    It should have been titled "7 Made-Up Reasons Apple is Worse Off Than You Think."   This post makes it appear as if Apple's idea factory is bankrupt, coasting, running on empty. Seriously doubt it.    I live in Adams Morgan and parked off-street until I gave up the car. It wasn't easy and I could spend 20 minutes, routinely, driving around waiting for a space to open up.   RPP fees would make no difference. Zero. Higher RPP fees is a nit in the calculation of whether you can live without a car.   I gave up owning a car only because I didn't need it. Adams Morgan may be awful for parking, but it's well served by buses and the Metro lines aren't a bad walk. My job didn't require a commute mandating a car.   But I know people who need a car to get to their place of work. If you need to jump on a bus, jump on the Metro, and then a bus again, that commute just won't work. A car is easier.   For that matter, there are many neighborhoods in DC were bus service is not as regular as it is in close-in neighborhoods. I rarely have to wait more than 10 min for a bus. But some bus lines may not hit a stop for 30 min, 45 min or longer.   All I can say about parking minimums is that ship has sailed. Many of the apartment complexes in Adams Morgan were built in a time when cars weren't an issue. My building only has a handful of spaces. I see no gain in demanding that newer buildings add more parking because my building was built with very little parking.        I lived in the Jefferson House for about 10 years. Only moved because owner was selling unit. I was on the top floor. Very quite. Never heard neighbors. Solid cement/brick building. Front desk was great for getting packages and the like. The building doesn't allow washer/driers in units but has laundry room. The pool is nice. Elevators are relatively new. Combination long-term residents and grad students, mostly. Never been inside the President.   One thing regarding noise: If you have a unit in the rear, to the right (if you are standing in front of the building), the GW students in the townhouses below and sometimes in the student housing (former hotel building) at K, sometimes hold very loud and noisy parties until 2-3 a.m. Generally, this noise never bothered me, but it could be more of an issue on lower floors.   You can contribute to the museum by taking out a membership. It comes with a great magazine and 10% off purchases. They also have donation boxes near entrances.    I'll endorse that. The NPG is a gem -- and it's open to until 7 p.m.   It's courtyard is awesome. Here, in the middle of a very busy area, is a wonderful place to sit. Free WiFi, too. I think the speeds are around 20 mps.      DC is top tourist attraction. It would not surprise me if some people cross DC off the their list of vacation possibilities because they'll read this stuff and say "the Smithsonian is closed!" --   If this leads to lost tourist dollars, that will really hurt.       It's obviously not spam. I live in DC. I read local blogs. I don't contribute to Reddit but thought I'd give it a try. But look at her blog. It's real and authentic and its about DC. If you are moderator and you have access to email from members, then look at mine and it will tell you who I am.    I submitted the link; who are you and why does it matter? It's not my blog -- I just thought the parking photos were interesting.          Excellent point    It can do basic editing. The native tool on the machine doesn't offer much, but the apps store is loaded with some very good photo editing tools. It adds a step to upload, but generally it's a minor issue.   	45
 This is a terrible argument. Do these 1% own proportionally more houses? More cars than us? Do they use more medicine than us? More food?   My point is that they do not "hoard" physical assets. Their wealth is merely extra zeros on a bank statement. The well being of us bottom dwellers has nothing to do with how many zero are on THEIR Swiss bank accounts. I don't believe taking up pitchforks and hangman's noose's on the rich will effect one ounce of my prosperity. My livelihood is from the roofing business.  If I charge my neighbor $1,800 to re-shingle their roof and I spend it how I choose, how does that have any relationship with Mark Zuckerburg and his wealth?   This is why I like Reddit. A perfectly pointless posting that actually amuses me greatly. Well done.   I thought they had to have a legitimate value added (at least one they could attempt to explain) as part of their business. For example, part of Amway's value is the claimed value of physically distributing product. Another one, an energy drink pyramid company, distributes the energy drink but most, if not all, of their money doesn't come from the drink sales and distribution, but from the big checks just for "sign ups" below them in the pyramid. That is more questionable than Amway in my opinion. But they claim it's the legitimate drink sales.  Then, the total illegal scams are one's with zero product but just get sign-ups (or money) from down the pyramid. Legit MLM have to have an explainable value added and the government and lawsuits become involved in making the determination if these business "value added" claims are legit..    look at that skinny-mini in the white tank top.

 I always thought this was the right explanation. I have doubts about that being Stefan's voice, though.   Sometimes I couldn't even get up from the bed if I hadn't the motivation of playing some Death Grips music. Come up and get me have saved me from some bad times.   You just described perfectly what DG music makes me feel.   Cool. I love riots' aesthetics. They combine very well with this instrumental.   Go there and stick somewhere a flash drive with duct tape, with mp3 files in it, titled as the leaked track list.  I'm not sure I'm writing this properly. I don't know how to english.   I think it can't have the same quality of the original when the bootleg makers don't have the original masters.   But I don't think they are being more secretive with the release of JD than with the previous albums.   Even is the rest of the tracks are shit, Jenny Death will be worth it just because of Innanimate Sensation.   How are they being cryptic about Jenny Death? They are just making us wait, maybe because of technical and production reasons.  The NLDW ARG, that WAS cryptic.   You should be pacient. Medication can take some time to have effect.   Who is MOM?   They look like something out from a Ghibli movie   I think it just means you are in a good mood, or you are having a good day, as simple as it can sound. Maybe your brain is in a chemical balance. You are producing and assimilating the right amount of serotonine or something like that.  Enjoy those days, relax, make plans and clear your mind.   By the way, source?   Yeah, I've seen this titles in /mu/ sometimes but I assumed it was just another fake leaked list. Thanks anyway.   Sixpenceee is a tumblr about paranormal and creepy stuff.   Its black people chest hair   Come up and get me. It reminds me the moment NLDW was released. I had listened to Ex-Military and THe Money Store and finally became a fan. I followed the ARG in /mu/. Everybody was expecting. Then NLDW came out and everybody went crazy. I got ready. I downloaded it. Pressed play. Then that harsh synth started.  WAW WAW WAW WAW WAW WAW  It was a memorable moment for me. The moment when i started enjoying DG as a true fan.   That's one of the most powerful moments in DG discography   I encourage you to note down all the strange, funny, weird, absurd, memorable quotes in your games. It's one of the funniest things I've ever done. You can start every season re-reading them and having a good laughs. Eventually you'll come up with an extent collection and the quotes will be fixated in everybody's memory. Years will pass and now and then you and your group will say "Remember that time when you said...?"   Looks like a lunatic terrorist   Is there already an official track list? I missed that. Or just fake leaks?   I have a similar problem riding my bike. I always imagine a car appears out of nowhere and hits me. I imagine myself falling, breaking my bones and smashing my head in the road. Following to that, I use to imagine my testimony in a trial, explaining how the accident had place and defending myself. Also I use to imagine myself arguing with some drivers that find I'm a nuisance in the road.  (fuck , my english is so poor right now...)  I've had this obsessive thoughts for years, but lately they have decreased in intensity, I got used to them, partially thanks to the help of my therapist. I've learnt to accept this thoughts as a part of me and not get upset  about them.   I suppose not a lot of you can read spanish, but, anyway, I would love to share my project with you all and, maybe, get some feedback about the style.  I've been running it since 2010, so maybe you'll see some evolution. My last strips are focused on some recurrent characters.  Anyway, here it is: [Contado tiene menos gracia](http://contadotienemenosgracia.thecomicseries.com).  Hope you find something you like.      This is from the comic "Megg, Mogg and Owl" by Simon Hanselmann. It was released under the title "Megahex".  http://i.imgur.com/hXdNzKD   I like it. You have potential. It would be better if you didnt cut his arms and forehead. Is this the whole illustration?   I don't know. Maybe I'm used to the fact that here in Spain everybody robes whatever they can.   DOORS AND WINDOWS ON MOTIONS ON    the majority of recent posts on their facebook is "jenny death when" so im sure thats where they picked up on it  Yeah, that's most probably what happened.   You 're wielding a sword in the subway station who pushes who Where the pusher is now what station with his raincoat who will be the next to fall onto the tracks perhaps twelve Japanese schoolgirls at once holding hands What station Keith Haring already marked this territory with colored chalk traced Mickey Mouse Devouring His Children Rehearse your name a thousand times in a black book I trace it dripping in marble with harmful acid in the wagon windows   Didn't they throw them to the crowd during the shows? One could just, you know, grab one and take it home. There are people in possesion of pieces of the fake Zack drums, for instance.   I'd say Guillotine is their most popular song. Maybe I think this just because it's the first one I ever listened.   How exactly does this proof DG are going on tour? I think there are two possibilities:  1. bbpoltergiest are just fans and the got this pills from a live show.  2. bbpoltergiest are really Death Grips and they are just tweeting a pic of the gigantic pills.  I can't see a clue for a tour here.   No. The best one is Runway N.   It's an album by the band loved by everyone: Death Grips   This idea made me smile. Thanks.   Have you seen the movie "Her"?   At first I thought you were refering to typewriters, where some letters are worn-out and you have to push the key several times to really print it. This happens with my machine's "q" key.  Damn, I'm old.   Can you elaborate on the "future primitive digital" concept? I'm not familiar with it, maybe because english is not my first language.  Also, yes, human desire is a big theme on DG music, I believe. The lyrics and the sound speak a lot about releasing your inner beast.   They have claimed their music is about acceleration and about energy.  I think the message they try to send is that being human in the 21st century is fucked up and this is just the beginning. You have to deal with vigilance paranoia, mental issues, drugs and other addictions available, technology, obsolescence and excess of information. And all this make you get noided.   Yes, it has been helpful for me.  First of all, talk helps. You blow off steam and you put your thoughts and feelings in order as you talk.  Very probably, you won't only talk, you'll do therapy, you'll do practical exercises with your doctor that will help you evolve.  I've been through three different therapists in my life and every one of them have helped me solve different problems. I'm not perfectly sane now but I wouldn't be who I am today if not for them.  In the other hand, you need to be lucky and find the right doctor. Some of them are not very motivated or just try to push you on pills. Be careful with pills. They can be helpful if you have real problems, but they have some side effects they don't talk you about. You can get fat, or feel numb or sleepy, or just feel neutral and devoided of any feelings. Pills are not the only answer for everything. I know some people who had some problems and tried going to a therapist, and the first thing he did was prescribing him pills. He declined and later solved his problems himself without medication. But not everybody can do that, of course. Some people really need medication.  Try to make your doctor to inform you about your medication, to tell him what are you gonna take, and why, what the pills do, and what side effects they have. You have the right to be informed. There are some things that your therapist won't tell you if you don't ask.   I'm happy for you. But be careful. If you start to feel bad again, don't be scared. It's something natural. Don't feel it like a failure. Remember that's a state you know well, and it can't get worse than you alreadey has experienced.  I say don't be scared because recently I had an axiety attack after a long period of feeling really great, and it felt terrible. I was terrified about going down again, I felt like I was going crazy. But I didn't.  One of my therapist warned me: I was doing a great progress but I could have bad moments again. She said sometimes your mind is resilient to stay stable and happy because you have been feeling bad for so long, and you are used to it.  Anyway, good luck. Take advantage of this new state and make some plans to organize and improve your life, so you stay happy as long as you can.   Keep doing what you are doing, because you are doing it right -I guess. Try to don't do those things that make you feel bad. Try to follow the path you are in now. Make plans to improve your life, now that you have a lot of energy, but don't make great changes in your life.  These are just things that I try to do when I have a relief of depression. I hope they work for you too.   In general, I just want to play more. Playing has been getting more and more difficult in my circle of friends.  I plan to reunite my usual group and play (at last!) an Unknown Armies adventure I wrote and I'm quite proud of. The PCs will be New Inquisition agents, ready for action, packed with spells, artifacts and guns. I was inspired by Hotline Miami when I wrote this.  I want to create another group and try an Adventure Time game I'm creating with Lady Blackbird system. I think is very appropiate for the setting. I know there is already an Adventure Time game with D D system, but I have no idea about D D.   Or maybe, you know, they are just taking a little more time because they are finishing the last details of the production of the album, like could happen with any other fucking normal band in the world.  Guys, I'm starting to get sick of all this theories. I've made my own theories about Death Grips, like everyone else, but this is too much. You are putting too much meaning in what they do or don't do. If you do this for fun, go on. But, honestly, stop overthinking.   Thanks. Best wishes for your new year!   Meds, therapy, life experience and getting older, mostly. I've been through three different therapist. Every one of them have helped me changing different problems. These changes have reverted in my daily life and my self-perception, making my mind more clear and calm, reducing symptoms like rituals. Also, I think i just grew older and learnt some things that help me have things more clear in life. I still have depression, anxiety and self-steem problems, but much softer since I'm going to the last therapist.  Also I've been under anti-depressants and antipsychotics for many years, and I guess they are in some part the reason of this changes. But mostly, therapy and learning.   I'm much better now, but still have intrusive thoughts. Whenever I'm riding my bike I imagine an accident, a car hitting me, falling to the ground, smashing my head. Or I imagine other drivers complaining about how slow I am or my erratic direction.  The more usual thoughts are negative ones, about how wrong everything is, how badly I do things, all my mistakes and faults. My mind is always looking for reasons to feel bad and guilty. Whenever I do something, there is a voice in my head whispering: "You are doing it wrong. YOU are wrong".  The worst ones are about raping little kids. I know I would never do that nor I'm attracted to that but just having those thoughts popping on your head automatically whenever you see a little kid, damn, it's scary. Luckily this kind of thoughts are not usual anymore.  When I was a teenager I use to have rituals like touching things the same amount of times in the left and in the right. I was obsessed with simmetry. I could spin a jar to the left, then feel obligated to spin it to the right to balance things. Then again to the left, but in a minor angle, again to the right... and so on until the handle stayed in the center.  In hindsight, I think I'm getting better every year, so I still have hope and so you should.   Ok. I just want to keep you chatting. Also, of all the terrible things there are in this life, you only mentioned the gamer gate thing. You can't deny it's quite shocking. It catched my attention.   What are some more things you don't like about this world?   Actually I'm seeing a therapist again (a new one) partially because I was having too many suicidal thoughts and me and a friend were getting worried.  Now I don't think about it so much, I guess I got little better. But not long ago I was thinking again and again about ending it all. About the final solution. I usually thought about it when I felt depressed or useless or anxious or lost, but this thought came also to my mind in some strange moments. I remember one day visiting a friend and his girlfriend. I was playing on his XBox and he was in the kitchen making cheese sandwiches. For a moment I felt so out of place I suddenly thought "You have to kill yourself. You just have to do it. There is nothing else to do. That's the right solution".   I think this is the weirdest moment I had this thought.  But yeah, suicidal thoughts, a lot. Whenever I felt that I couldn't stand this anymore, this state of perpetual sadness and anxiety. That would end the suffering, but I don't want to quit struggling. I want to fight till the end. I want to see it all and feel it all, even if my life ends like a big fail.   FUCK A BITCH WHA FUCK A BITCH FUCK A BITCH WAH ("Fuck a bitch", collaboration with The Bug)   When you are alone in your house, try having a rational monologue. Not a mental one. You have to use your voice. Release energy and frustration. If you have to curse, curse. If you have to yell, yell. But be rational. Rationalize your problem. Give yourself questions and answers. What's the problem? Can I find a solution? If not, what I'm gonna do about it? Try to take out all that is in your mind, so later there will be less things to think about.  I'm not a therapist. I'm talking from my experience. Sometimes talking about an obsession and rationalizing it helps. Later there will be less things to think about because you already have come to some sort of conclussions.  Talking with a friend helps too.  It's possible that the obsession continues, though, but try it at least.   Excuse me if I didn't get it right, but... Are you going to commit suicide because (in part) of feminism?   It means Jenny Death will include collabs with Aphex Twin, Techno Animal, Alec Empire and Lighting Bolt.   Have a sincere talk with your mum. Talking fix things. Don't save your feelings. Depression is a hard enough problem. Guiltyness shouldn't make it worse.  Tell her how you feel and how you are right now. Express yourself and let her express herself. Communicate. Make things clear.   Sometimes if you trust in people or open to them you find that they are deeper than you thought. That they are individual human beings with their own feelings and background.  When you stop fearing and star being true, unexpected things happen.   I kinda like it, except for the low quality background. In some way it fits with the vaporwave aesthetics but it still looks too cheap to me.

It's perfect for games set in dark modern times.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttXuhDuZ4CA  Also, we have used this for Cthulhu games: http://adriananiol.bandcamp.com/album/obscura   The basic concept around Unknown Armies is that you can have power but it has a high price. The more you sacrifice, the more power you get. There are, for example, epideromancers, who must hurt themselves in order to gain magic charges.  There are also "demons". Rumors say if you can summon one, you can make him help you, give you power and information. But: 1. They just want to control you. 2) They are not really what people think they are.   Try to face your triggers and your intrusive thoughts, as long as you can. Don't let them have control on you. I know this is easier to say than to do it. I mean: don't fear your problems, accept them as part of yourself, at least of a temporary self. Expose yourself to your fears, alway as far as you can and under your control. Focus on your intrusive thoughts, don't try to cut them out your mind. If you fight something it becomes your enemy. Try to accept what you feel and think. The problems will not disappear but maybe they will be easier to stand and you'll relax a little.  These are some things that I read in a book my therapist recommended me and worked in my case. I hope they work in yours.   Thanks.  I can say I have pure-o then. I feel better when I can give something a name, I don't know why. It's interesting that all my therapist have always avoided to use terms like these, I wonder why.  But knowing that my problem has a name and there is more people like me out there calms me down.   What is pure-O? Is the first time I've read about this term. Maybe is because I'm from Spain and here we use another terminology or maybe because my therapist have been trying to not use thechnical terms with me so I wouldn't obsess about them.  Is it just a mental obsession? Like something without rituals or compulssion?   You could just tell your parents you feel anxiety and have problems focusing on school, or even maybe that you think you have some kind of OCD symptoms, that you overthink things and have too much "mental noise" to focus on your work and want to improve your marks. You are not obligated to tell them exactly what kind of disgusting thoughts you have. Keep that to yourself and your therapist.  About things being normal again, well, I'll talk from self experience. Is very dificult for a person with mental illness go back to total normality forever. If you go to a therapist and have the appropiate medication you can get really better and have a better life. Your symptoms can weaken a lot, but accept that maybe now and then they can come back for a while and have a bad time. But very probably your thoughts will turn into a minor nuisance.  I've have intrusive and obsessive thoughts for years. I'm going to therapy and taking medication and now I'm much better. I still have the same thoughts about accidents when I'm riding my bike, for example, and imagine how somebody assaults me while I'm walking in the street, but they are weaker now. Sometimes I have an argument with somebody or feel very guilty about something, and that ruins my whole day. I fall in a depressive spiral and spend the rest of the day in the bed. But this happens very ocasionally, now.  What I'm trying to say is you can get better, but maybe you'll still have some symptoms or bad times, now and then. One thing I've learnt going to the therapist is to accept the way I am, to accept my intrusive thoughts as a burden or nuisance, to not obsess about them.  Another thing Ive learn in therapy: exposure therapy. Face your problems. Expose yourself to them. Look, triying to analyze or rationalize your bad thoughts is like trying to turn off a fire with gasoline. You are just feeding the machine. Instead of falling in a rational feedback, fighting thoughts with thoughts, focus on them. Look them to the face. Repeat them in your mind again and again. Surrender, don't fight. "Okay, you want to think about this? Let's think about this". Repeat the bad images in your imagination again and again, this time under your own will and control. The pictures appear because you want. Verbalize them, turn them into a simple sentence and repeat it again and again and again. Your brain soon will get bored of this, the thought will loose control on you and you'll pass to something else.  Problem is, this technique can turn into another obsession. It's effectiveness is temporary.  You are still young. In a pair of years you will feel much better. I'm 34 now. Started with therapy at 24 and I've evolved a lot. I'm not a perfect man but I got much better. Not saying you'll need so many years for your therapy, but be prepared to be pacient with your therapist and yourself.  I hope I helped you in some way with this brick I just wrote. :)  	69
 I was pretty excited until I went to the bottom of the Kickstarter page where they mention you cannot alter the files on the USB drive and it only contains a launch.html file that simply causes a browser redirect to a site of your choosing. It's still pretty cool, but it seems like more work than just giving someone a URL on your business card.   The fact that Europe allows such extremist protests is ridiculous. Rallies like this will not cause ISIS to lose fanatic supporters in Europe, it'll just go to energize those leaning towards extremism. Free speech is one thing... but allowing rallies by supporters of an organization dedicated to wiping out and terrorizing harmless civilians who don't agree with them? Those 'protests' should be met with an iron fist before extremism takes further root.   Pretty crazy. It just goes to show how much of an effect gravity has on the presence of aging.      Why is this such big news? The Chinese government is well known to hide information about government/military failures from civilians (though they seem to be improving).    But how do we know how big the banana is?!?    Yes, in Saudia Arabia and also two cases caught before Spanish volunteers were to travel back to Spain.   The worrisome thing to me is that there are already a handful of potential and confirmed cases showing up in well developed countries... countries that have the means to detect the potential cases, isolate them, and treat them if necessary. But there are so many countries that don't really have those capabilities, so it makes me wonder how many have already slipped by elsewhere.   I hope they are obliterated by our drones, manned aircraft, and missiles without our soldiers on the ground. How satisfying it will be to whoever pulls the trigger on a large group of these savages after they are spotted during one of the mass executions...  The problem is it's like Vietnam, the combatants can easily blend in. Hopefully when they try to blend in the people who have been run out of their homes with threats of death will return to pull the ISIS rats out of of their holes.   They strap you to a rocket and you get to see what everything looks like from 10ft in the air.   They accepted and welcomed the Christians being persecuted elsewhere in Iraq. Since they are willing to accept different religions, I don't think race will be a huge issue, and most of those in the regions of conflict aren't too racially distant anyway.  **Edit:** Fixed a word   They have my complete respect. They welcome the peaceful oppressed with welcoming arms and also don't treat women like dogs. When the rest of Iraq was falling apart the Kurdish region survived well. They seem to have great decency and high morals. Not to mention great discipline.   Lighthouses are really some incredible feats of engineering, especially considering that many of them are very very old.   * That your body's immune system is defeating cancerous cells on a daily basis. Chronic stress has been found to lower and/or screw up immune system responses. So your current stress could be killing you... Same goes for stress's effect on heart function. * For the fame seekers: Statistically you will die without fame, recognition or money. * If food supplies were disrupted for many months or years due to a catastrophic world event, you would likely not survive. * One nation attacking another with a nuclear weapon could trigger global retaliation, and if you live in a major population center of the US your city is likely already targeted, and there is nothing you could do about it... * Mt Rainier is still an active volcano with millions of people within its path of destruction. * You can be arrested for a crime you did not commit and be sent to prison. It happens fairly often for life sentences and murders, so think of how often it must happen for less severe crimes? * 1 in 4 people will die of cancer, and most will not know they have cancer until it is too late to effectively treat. * We're running out of our supply of Helium * A massive solar storm could erupt that could destroy nearly all electronics. Imagine the chaos... and there is nothing we can effectively do to stop it. * Bacteria resistant to antibiotics is becoming much more common. If it continues, in the future, things as simple as dental procedures could become deadly.    He was caught putting a handgun into his waistband at a location that was already being staked out for drug activity. He also has an existing criminal record. I imagine the arrest was in part motivated by his recording and exposing the death at the hands of the NYPD... which is incredibly wrong. But I also believe both parties here have some guilt.   With so much pollution that shows no major signs of letting up, perhaps natural selection will come into play and result in a nation with individuals more adapted to surviving harsh polluted environments. That'd be kind of cool minus all the sadness and death.   I've been programming since I was a teenager, and started out being extremely productive while living with my parents before I transitioned into an adult. At 20 I was hired by a well known and prestigious software company and shipped out from a farm in a rural part of the US to the big city...   The first few years I was insanely productive pretty much anywhere I worked, at home, at the office, or even at a hotel. But over time I began to lose that motivation, that urge for productivity. I found myself easily distracted, and instead of being excited for the work ahead I merely wished to procrastinate through unnecessary and irrelevant actions. I was burned out.  Several more years have passed. I have a remote work arrangement, so I rented an office that I can work out of that rural part of the US again for 2 weeks a month, while I spend the rest at the company headquarters. One thing that I've begun to realize is that "where" you work is less important than "why" you work. If you find yourself heading to your office and you ask yourself whether you'd rather be doing something else, then the location of that office is mostly irrelevant, because you will likely not be productive.  For me my most productive, and thoughtful times have come after or during socialization. If you are isolating yourself, I think the first step is to try to socialize a bit. Talk to and hang out with friends, spend a few hours just hanging out with the family... If you are like me that will give you a sense of calmness and belonging, and you'll find that you actually want to code and be productive, because your mind feels relaxed.     So accurate too... because it's a mess.      "51st Stater" for Canadians is so perfect. It's not even racist. Totally going to use this on those friends that like to bitch about how much America sucks and how great their oh so wonderful but never flawed Canada is...  It's going to drive them nuts.   I bet nobody ever asked her to move to the back of the bus.   Is this a high school event?!? Because if it is they really go all out don't  they? A band, spotlights, packed seating, and people actually cheering and getting into it? Looks like they really know how to have fun.    I will make shit appear within your pants!   * Horses in the city streets (sounds of horseshoes on the street, neighing, etc) * The clangs, clatter and squeaks from coaches * Town-wide noon whistles or bells (still heard in a few towns) * Paperboys on the street reading headlines * Cars not being able to start and sputtering * Steam locomotives blowing off pressure as they sit in the town station * People loudly calling out for one another in towns when separated * True physical bells on business doors that ring when they are opened         Fuck RT.   So that's where Top Ramen comes from!   I think you're failing to give the act of escalation credit. It's escalating, it has in reality been escalating for years (since the Georgia conflict) and it has not shown any signs of deescalation. It'll start with proxy wars, and then when the proxy fighters are depleted the bigger players will start fighting.   I hope it can project all the same information as what is delivered on that screen in the cockpit, or that the screen is very modular. What a bummer it would be to be taking on light damage and have your single screen destroyed.   Why would sanctions be dropped when they have nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Russia is still escalating violent tensions in Eastern Europe...    "Is your approval rating dropping?!? No worries! Just "urge" some people to do something the populous wants, but you know will not actually get done!!!"  I mean for god sakes this dude is the President and he's 'urging' other politicians to close blatant loopholes in tax law? He's the head honcho... if he was really behind the effort fully, he'd do more. Right?   This is bad news for the world. The Russians show no true effort to deescalate the situation, and instead continue to arm and train those perceived to be fighting against Western interests. Meanwhile Western countries are showing no deescalation in their support, training, and potential arming of fighters of Eastern/Russian interests.   Think about, nobody is going to back down. Things have been getting progressively worse since the Georgia war. Every year more players become involved, and with every passing moment the fighting and hatred seems to intensify across Northern Africa, the Middle East, and Western Europe... If any side backed down they would look weak, and are also more vulnerable to violent actions from those that oppose them.  I truly fear this will continue to spiral out of control until world wide war breaks out within the next few years that is split between influence from the West, The East, and the Far East. It's not showing signs of slowing down, and really, how can it?   Because people have jobs and are too afraid of losing those jobs by protesting.    Ah yes, brings back memories of that lovely feeling when a larger chunk flies off and lands on bare skin only to erupt into a beautiful sensation of screaming, pain and finally crying.   It's what people from /r/shitredditsays are probably like in the real world.   Do the Russians really think people will believe that? I wonder how far they'll take this lie. The terrorist/separatist leader himself mentioned on social media his forces shot down a plane... Then he deleted it. If it were hack you'd think he'd deny it profusely. Instead he's just kept quiet because he knows he messed up.   TL; DR: WWII causes USSR / USA to turn themselves into massive war machines to fight Axis. Axis is defeated. USSR   USA still primed to fight, each wary of the other fighter. Too scared to fight each other directly, fight each other's influences instead. Fight to be technically superior. USSR burns out after fighting too hard without rest and recovery... Collapses. First Cold War over.   Exercise is well known to alter-inflammatory responses, and usually for the better. Strenuous exercise can exacerbate inflammation, so if you have a recent injury that isn't fully healed or an old one prone to abrasion you could be seeing an inflammatory response that's related.  How long have you had them, and is it hard or soft? I don't think you have to worry about anything serious.   Cholinergic Urticaria will do this. Up to 10% of younger populations have it, and it's thought to be an allergic reaction to sweat. But if that's the case she'll feel itchy or have a 'pins and needles' sensation across her body.  If it's not itchy it's probably nothing more than an old injury that has become inflamed.    That's usually for generalized swelling, not for localized swelling without a traumatic trigger (like a bee sting, injection, etc).    Did you have an injury there in the past? Do you break out anywhere else?   Is it itchy?      I hope you're not responsible for teaching them English. Or... you know... manners.    I've mentored them and most of them are fucked up  No doubt!   That's easy for someone to say when they are not in the direct position of *caring for them*. Children in Africa don't deserve to starve, but hundreds of thousands do each year. Is it our responsibility to care for them as well? I think a lot of people like using the term "our", but as soon as it becomes "my", then they change their tune.  Also there isn't any direct relevance to that article you posted. You might have as well posted an article about abuse in nursing homes, or sexual abuse of children at the hands of the church.   But is it fair to send your children to another country and expect other people to take care of them because you can't or don't want to?   It's like if you were a couple living on a suburban street with your own child, and you did a great job caring for that child... offering shelter, schooling, health care and great support. Then one day someone from another neighborhood sees you at the park, and later their kids show up at your house.  They don't leave. They say they should stay there because you can provide better for them, and their parents say the same. They are using resources you worked hard for, resources you earned, and yet you are not responsible in any part for there previous life. Would you not kick them out?   Nearly 60% of the people living in LA are Hispanic, and the percentage of LA children who are Hispanic is even higher. In a lot of South Western states Hispanics are primed to become the overwhelming majority in the next generations... This is probably an act to help those he feels he should identify with to get votes, and from my observations the majority of Hispanics support illegal immigration.   I'm pleasantly surprised at the lack of fedoras.    If the people of California approve this and the federal government denies it we know the government is no longer for the people.       Software. I started writing and selling my own around 16, then got picked up by a big software company when I was 20. Without any college debt it allowed me to save a lot quickly, and I put it into investments that have given me good returns over the years.   Not specific luxury goods or services per say, but I've noticed the following perks related to services... and I'm not really super wealthy, though my path is destined for that through my career (currently in my 20s with a respectable 6 figure salary, and loads of savings and investments).   * **Better banking and financial service**. My bank put me into their highest/top-level investment tier and also gave me concierge services, along with customer service most people would dream of...  *  **Discounts at well known hotels, retailers and resorts**. These guys know you have money, and once they get a taste they want to bring you back for more. They want you to bring your wealthy friends back with you too. It may seem counter-intuitive, but they often do this by offering wealthy customers big discounts.  * **More respect across many professional services**. There have been a lot of cases where I'm meeting with someone from a company offering professional services (real estate agencies, insurance companies, auto companies, etc) and they change their behavior from 'standard' treatment to 'excellent' treatment when they find out I'm a wealthy potential or existing client. The things they do to fuck over the normal customers don't really happen to me, because I'm such a 'valued customer'. Escalation is also very simple... If they can't get something done at a local branch (like reversing fees, upgrading service, etc) they'll call their manager and make it a point to mention where I work and what I do (not a lawyer!), and things will get resolved quickly. I've also noticed increased respect from law enforcement. I've gotten out of many tickets simply because the officer wanted to talk about my work and my lifestyle, and also mention their dreams regarding investments etc. If I wasn't wealthy, those discussions wouldn't happen, and I'd likely get a ticket.  * **Better/faster seating at lounges and restaurants**. This doesn't happen too often, but I'm inclined to believe it's simply because there aren't many situations where a waitress/seating manager will learn about my wealth and career. But when such situations do occur such as when they are making small talk and asking what I do for a living, I'll notice a change in the service for the better. They'll start actively 'looking around' for seating, or allow me to sit in their special seating areas. I don't think that would happen if I wasn't wealthy... but I could be wrong.  * **People that will do everything for you**. Not one person covering all aspects by themselves, but rather multiple people that have their own specialties. These are not 'unknown' to most people, but I feel as though they are considered unobtainable to many... I'm talking about having gardeners, maid services, personal trainers, personal finance managers, shopping assistants, etc.    If you ever become very wealthy in relation to the average working man/woman in your country you'll likely see it first hand as the person on the receiving end of those requests... I'm not super rich by and means, but I'm in my 20s with a 6 figure salary and lots of savings. After news spread amongst friends, old 'friends' and 'distant relatives' began to come out of the shadows. They'd tell me their sob stories about how they needed to make car payments, rent, etc... But in what seemed like 99% of the cases it was the people who felt I owed them just because they asked for it. It's really irritating to have people get angry when you tell them no... It's like they assume money falls into your lap without hard work.  I help friends out with small things, but only if they don't ask. The last time someone asked and I gave them cash, it cost me $5000, and more importantly it cost me a normal friendship. Once people get some money they seem to think they are entitled to more, and so do their friends... It makes things so uncomfortable to me that I've had to inactivate my Facebook at times just because so many people are hinting or blatantly asking for money.   It has also made me realize that dating will never be normal for me. The moment a girl finds out you're loaded their behavior completely changes and they'll be trying desperately to get your attention, I have yet to see a case where this isn't true. I'm male and young, so it's a great perk, but I still worry about what I may be losing because of it...    Well it certainly wouldn't be flowing above it now would it? =)   Socially yes. Physically to the environment? No.   Depending on the quality of the paint and the surface, paint can EASILY last 100 years without major chipping if it's not in a harsh environment.   Source: Live on a farm with many buildings from the late 1800s and early 1900s that still have original paint in good condition. Secondary Source: Our town has an 'underground tour' and there is a holding cell below the streets where you can still see 'artwork' scratched into the white paint on the walls.   We should cherish this day! For our Supreme Leader graced us with his presence surrounded by smiles of children and widows in his great contribution to the state of our satirical culturing!     Don't worry, my watch says 2:00PM and my breakfast has yet to begin. But you inspired me Buzz Aldrin. I'm going to take multiple small steps up the stairs and one giant leap to my coffee now.   I've lived at my current place for 4 years and I have one recliner, a card table, and some folding chairs. Hello fellow bachelor.   When did playful become a synonym for possessed?!?   Oh, is that all? How is your friend doing without any sleep?    Both men acted respectably here really. This is actually pretty uplifting. The cop never raised his voice, didn't object to the recording, and may very well change his on-duty driving habits because of the truck drivers actions. And the truck driver was respectful and likely made the road a safer place. Win win.       It's an enemy of the enemy type of thing... But those interviews they mentioned where they were asked about their affiliations, job history, etc. was probably to root out those which could be considered Islamic extremists.    When I rub my skin on my back, neck, or lower abdomen, a waxy/oily substance will roll up into dark little balls. I think it's something called 'sebum' to protect the skin, but I've always wondered if anyone else has the same issue.   They are fasciculations... A lot of people have something called benign fasciculation syndrome, and it definitely gives the illusion of worms under the skin.   Aaaaannnddd.... I shot myself.   We're seeing the same thing during our asset transitions to Real Estate. Another group member recently payed $100k over listing price after a bidding war for a house overlooking Lake Washington... In that case the competitor was another investor from China.  Recently people have just started offering 6% over list price with no escalation, because supply is so low and competition is extremely high.   I have a lot of savings and investments and belong to an investment group  of semi-large transaction traders (with a $250,000 asset minimum). Stocks  were off to a very rocky start earlier this year, but have really become a shining light lately. However the general consensus is that it will not last much longer, and upcoming world events may be a strong factor in a general market drop.  I personally believe this is why the House just announced it will be suing the President. Everyone knows what is coming, and people are trying to shift any blame before the house of cards begins to fall.  What is bizarre to me is why there is not a noticeable drop or leveling in the stock markets. Big investors are moving a lot of money out of the stock markets and putting it into tangible assets such as real estate, myself included. In the Seattle area you can actually see when this started to happen by looking at housing supply. The new money maker is rent and property management, but because of so many assets being moved to real estate we're actually creating a bubble in the process.  My suggestion to those without real estate investments is to ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or other tangible assets. It's wise even when the economy is doing well, but common sense when the economy is beginning to falter.      I don't live in Idaho either. =\  Manufacturing capacity? You mean like all of the big factories the militants in current war zones have? Or all the money they have a hard time finding destination for? Give me a break.   Which is worse? To cause some hardship by removing a few genetically unfit from the gene pool? Or to cause widespread hardship many generations from now after centuries of breeding between individuals who fight only for themselves and not society?   Well by technological standards the same thing could be said about Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya. and Somalia.   Edit: Oh you're a Californian. Probably an illegal immigrant too. Well if violence ever does break out and we're on opposite sides of a conflict, I hope we meet. *I love you*      Idaho and California. Even though they are separated by multiple states, Idaho has some of the highest gun ownership rates (~60%) in the United States and it also has a population that aggressively hates federal and far reaching governments. Idaho is full of militias. Meanwhile California is staunchly liberal and forceful in telling people what to do. They also have rampant illegal immigration problems.  Idaho based militias would attack targets in California, retreat to the mountainous Idaho terrain, and then trigger a war in the region that would end up pulling in Montana and the Dakotas on the side of Idaho.  Good old fashioned guerrilla warfare bitches! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaawwwww. http://imgur.com/sq1S8    To the people saying the graphics/performance won't get better over time because the hardware 'sucks' and because it is already well-known architecture... you should know things aren't so black and white. The x86-64bit processor architecture presents some problems which are being carried over from those who are accustom to developing games for PCs. When developing for PCs you obviously do not know what specific hardware the customers will be running, so you can't really optimize for a specific set of hardware. This is not the case for PS4/XBox One. Over time we will see more and more 'tricks' that will introduce better performance on that specific hardware, but learning those tricks takes time and experience... and it's still early in this generation of consoles.  The second thing is that game engines are of course not perfect. Over iterations they will continually improve (if done right) in terms of efficiency and capability. The Unreal Engine and ID Tech engines are prime examples of this. As this generation of console matures, there will be a natural improvement of the Engines that are at the core of many of the games.... the quality will not remain static just because the hardware is static.  It's also important to remember that drivers can be a huge culprit when it comes to poor performance, and they too will continue to evolve on the consoles to result in better performance.  The graphics/performance of the games is destined to improve over time.     It really depends on the market. If it's a hot market with a low supply of homes it's very unlikely that you'll have your offer accepted if it is below the list price and the home is in good condition.   In my city for example, the homes in the neighborhoods I've been looking at have all been selling around 6% ABOVE list price.  I'd suggest looking around the neighborhood at other recent sales using Zillow, and try to get an idea of how final sale prices are comparing to original list prices. Putting in an offer lower than list price is risky in many markets... It's also common for some people to put an initial offer slightly above market price, just so their offer is accepted over others without a bidding war. If that happens, your offer will likely be thrown out immediately.   If you don't consider the effort it took me to get the money which I invest, the easiest money I have made was without a doubt through the stock market. There are many stocks I sit on for long-term gains, but there are also occasionally some stocks I buy/sell with my personal account for short-term gains. In 2013 I bought $100k of a stock in the morning, and sold it near the market close for a profit of $5000. It was a few clicks, and some pretty passive monitoring... but it netted me enough for a couple months of rent. The total fee excluding taxes was $19. That was pretty damn easy.   Whhhhaaaaaaaaa? It looks like the cancer that is /r/ShitRedditSays is metastasizing into other sub-reddits.    You monster.   http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/mefnirV.gif      OP is a lying re-poster! Grab your pitchforks at the door...     Someone needs to find this man when he is slapped on the wrist and let go. He should be brutally disposed of... Humans like this are not fit to live in a society.    How do you feel knowing your confined to a building for the rest of your life? Knowing that there is plenty of talent out there waiting to put a bullet in your brain to silence you at a moments notice if you leave the premises or your protectors decide it is no longer in their best interest to protect you?   First of all, the title is a bit misleading, as the behaviors returned after the drug wore off...  Secondly, as someone with Aspergers, this is both exciting and terrifying to me. I really hate the social aspects of Aspergers. I'm not good with any form of communication unless there is some sort of directive or goal. Correcting this would be very welcomed. The part that scares me is I wonder what else I might lose... I work in software engineering, and I feel like my autistic-traits give me a huge advantage when it comes to designing complex interacting systems. If I lose the ability to visualize such systems with clarity and focus, treatment becomes a cost to benefit analysis to me... and I'm not sure which outcome would be the most beneficial to me.  Still, this research intrigues me. Any understanding towards potentially correcting flaws is a great step towards the future of health and science.   Thankfully there are still Mexicans in the background glaring at them.   I dislike Russia's actions as much as the next guy, but in fairness even at the doubled rate, it was still being offered to Ukraine at a discounted rate. The other European countries supplied by Russia still have higher rates than the rates for Ukraine proposed by Russia.     	87

 Umm what was that??   GRONK SMASH!!!   Its before the Pepsi halftime show    Who cares it's a year away   Maybe r/CFB should have its own super bowl game thread so that it not overcrowded and full of irrational discussions   Of course they do this after cutting multiple former AirTran routes    Well good luck man. You can message me if you get lonely     it helps for me that I go to a small school (like 2100) so its kinda hard to not make friends over time becauase you know everyone. We don't hang out that much, maybe once or twice a month, and most of my "social" activity is with my roommate (who I actually like which is good). The most activity that I do with my friends is have lunch. So I'm still kinda a "shut in" but I am more active now.    A Republican a hypocrite? NEVER   I'm shocked, SHOCKED. That Jeb Bush was ever a bully considering how nice he was to the Schiavo's   We may be amongst the last now, but when the supreme court rules we hopefully won't have a gay marriage ban. Think of it like the sodomy laws. Georgia's was overturned by the state supreme court about 6 years before the supreme court overturned it nationally (though the Georgia case didn't involve a gay couple). Even though we were amongst the last we weren't THE last.    I'm in my last semester. I didn't really start making until my 5th semester and now I have a small circle of friends.    good for him   Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?   Yes I am, Yes I am, Yes I am!   As a native Georgian I totally understand - I was pissed about Alabama, South Carolina, and Mississippi's laws being declared unconstitutional before us. I just want it to be legal here before the Supreme Court has the final word so that we can say that we weren't among the last    My Freshman year of college every Friday and Saturday evening I would order a pizza (or some other type of takeout food) and take my laptop into the study room in my dorm and just sit there and watch Netflix until about 2am while everyone else in the dorm was either hanging out or throwing parties. It was quite common for me to have to wear headphones just so I could hear because of all of the noise from people having fun. I would always make sure that my roommate was asleep before I went back into the room (he was a stoner and a party animal so this is why I didn't want to be in that room). The way that I would make sure that he was asleep is that I would go outside the building and look to see if the light was on in our room. Once it was out I would finally be able to go get some sleep. This went on my entire freshman year.   How about she loves me unconditionally. No matter what happens she is always there to cheer me up.    The organization I work for advocates fewer environmental regulations and is against a minimum wage increase    That shirts very becoming on you. Of course, if I were on you Id be coming too   because she is awesome!!   I though it said Prague at first    DOZENS !!   Any other American breath a sign of relief once they realized that this was in Canada and not the US. (not to take away the awfulness of the case)    This was better than what I though the link was going to be.    The Big 12 can't stay at 10 forever when 3 of the p5 have 14, and the other has 12. It will have to expand at some point.    This should be [ interesting](http://m.imgur.com/DKJhx9l)   Yeah, go ahead and tell everybody    [Behold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUcBvS0HdsE)   Make sure you go ahead and tell everybody about the apology    I like how at the end the guy says "that's the boner killer right there"    well it is an Atlanta crowd    that's Atlanta fans for you.     Clearly he is still smoking the stuff that caused him to pick her in the first place.    Here's a [video](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=888799191176498 set=vb.100817319974693 type=2 theater)   He is up for adoption    Yes he is real   Hate is a strong word don't you think?    Look at UVA's OOC. It's brutal    My dad convinced me and my brother that the hazard lights button was a "hyper button" that would make the car go faster. When ever he pushed it he would slam on the gas to make us believe that it was the case. I quickly figured it out but my brother would go on believing this for years.    The families of the Chinese victims did.  But some families were upset that the government decided on the fate of their loved ones without any concrete evidence.  In China, some family members refused to accept the official position that the plane was lost. "They have found nothing," said Li Jingxin whose brother is missing. "With nothing found, how can they make any announcement?''  Clearly they are so full of grief that they can't accept reality     Yeah it does seem a little excessive. The idea makes some practical sense but as always the implementation doesn't.    As a result of this coming out in the Israeli press the American Family Associations spokesman Bryan Fischer has been fired http://www.mediaite.com/tv/evangelist-bryan-fischer-has-been-fired-maddow-reports/   That's why he was fired. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer,says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights is funding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow does a great breakdown of the whole affair http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843 (the video in the link wouldn't work for me)    The video in the link wasn't working for me so I'll post the video from the MSNBC website [here](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843), it is worth watching.   TL;DR   He wasn't fired because he was an anti-gay, racist, sexist, bigot. He was fired because the American Family Association is founding a trip to Israel for over 50 GOP members, including the party chair Reince Priebus. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer, says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights founding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says.    The theory is that sense electric cars don't use gas they don't pay the gas tax, which funds roads. Therefore in a sense they are using the roads for "free" while everyone else is contributing to their upkeep through the gas tax. So you just charge them a straight up tax for having an electric car to make up for them not paying the gas tax.    Doesn't Putin want a bunch of far-right parties to be in power sense he is bankrolling most of them.    A little back story  Roy Moore is a big time Christian. Before he was on the Alabama Supreme Court he opened all his cases with a prayer. He called on Alabama to use it's powers to punish "homosexual behavior". He famously put a ten commandments statue in the Alabama Supreme Court building in 2002. He was taken to court by secular groups and they got a federal court to order it's removal. He refused and was subsequently removed from the court by a judicial oversight board. Alabamans reelected him to his former position in 2012   Georgia definitely needs to increase transportation funding and this seems like a good proposal, but I'm skeptical of anything that comes from the state GOP.    take $350 million from the highway fund over 2 1/2 years  So now their roads and schools will be shit    They've always been in the ACC   The reason I want it to bite them in the ass is so that the people who voted for this *cough* tea party republicans *cough* get voted out of office (hopefully with better people replacing them).    /r/romega just discussions about whats going on in town (I go to school here)    You know you're on the wrong side of an issue when you think people who hold your beliefs would kill or injure a newlywed couple.

You missed the part where they called for protections for people's "religious liberty" to be part of the bills. Just like the Catholic church I will not trust anything that they say.    Fuck him   I am so glad I don't live in Cobb county. Is it mean of me to hope that this ends up biting them in the ass as badly as the Marlins new ballpark did to Miami-Dade county?    Well with the mayor of Roswell being Comcast's [bitch](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/26/7878239/comcast-twc-fcc-merger-letters-politicians-ghostwritten) I guess we can't expect it there anytime soon.

Well with the mayor of Roswell being Comcast's [bitch](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/26/7878239/comcast-twc-fcc-merger-letters-politicians-ghostwritten) I guess we can't expect it there anytime soon. Hopefully it comes to my area (Milton) but with Roswell being next door and Alpharetta probably having the same position I won't hold my breath.    I apologize for the video starting half-way through, that was a mistake on my part. Watch the whole video, it is really cute.    I honestly don't know why it did that, maybe when I went to the YouTube link from another website it did that   I didn't notice. That is not what I intended when I posted this but by the time I realized it had already been upvoted over 150 times and I didn't want to delete it   [Ramblin Wreck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6JXKMxRgQ8)   Setting multiple alarms on my phone and placing the phone on the other side of the room. But to be honest what gets me out of bed most morning is having to pee.    As I told the other guy my position is that the money in politics - whether it's from the Kochs, Unions, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, McCutcheon, whoever - is DISGUSTING and TOXIC on our democracy and should be abolished.    Yes because conservatives don't have a hateful bone in their [body](http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/01/okla-career-anti-gay-lawmaker-introduces-3-bills-targeting-lgbt-community/)   Damn, Malaysia Airlines can't catch a break.    He deleted his account. You think we scared him off?    So you are comparing now to 100 years ago? Hmm where have I heard that [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV1VUS3Q2W0). So you want to cut programs that help people like Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and SNAP and prolong their struggle and let them decend into poverty? How nice of you. The only thing that needs to be cut is the DoD, and we need to raise taxes on the rich on close corporate and capital gains tax loopholes.    That makes no fucking sense. How has the "government expanding out of control" (ps it hasn't) led to a system favoring the wealthy. Large government means more protections for individuals - usually low income or middle class. Less government means less regulations which means more money to be made for corporations and their CEOs. AKA the Kochs    Oh you poor thing you're taxed to death!  Seeing as you make only $30,000 a year (as you state in a post here:np.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/2mybbb/an_open_letter_to_reddit_liberals_from_a_reddit/) you already don't pay that much in taxes as you fall into a low tax bracket. I am advocating the abolition of super PACs and a limit on the amount of money you can give campaigns. What I would do first is say that money is not free speech, abolish super PACs, and say that corporations could not donate to candidates campaigns. People could still donate to political parties and candidates but it would only be $500 max. Then what I would do is close corporate tax loopholes and capital gains loopholes and use some (like maybe 6%) available for campaigns to dip into if they want, split evenly of course (by the way those taxes wouldn't affect you).   It's still $300 million less than the Kochs    My narrative is that the money in politics - whether it's from the Kochs, Unions, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, McCutcheon, whoever - is DISGUSTING and TOXIC on our democracy and should be abolished. I still fail to see how you can't agree with this.     Your link proves my point. Outside groups - Koch - spent more on elections than Obama did. The fact that billionaires are trying to buy our elections is disgusting and I don't know why anyone would support them. And I call it the Fox News strategy because they pioneered it.   Seeing how the average voter in this country is incredibly misinformed, if you see an ad repeating the same lie it becomes true over time. It's called the Fox News strategy     Of course he is a Republican    Of course a Republican    What world do you live in. This is NOT democracy. This is a few billionaires buying our elections. Left or Right it doesn't matter it should be illegal. This amount of money in elections is DISGUSTING. And by the way I missed the announcement, since when did greenpeace and unions have $900 million to spend on elections?     ~~Satan~~ Saban  Better yet why don't they ask the people that paid his mortgage      Money is NOT free speech. All is does is buy elections for the wealthy. This is a democracy not an oligarchy. And by the way unions don't spend as much as the Kochs and I don't think they should have the right to spend money on elections either.     you can thank the Supreme Court     What part of money in politics is toxic don't you understand    I think money in politics is toxic no matter the party. However I can't stand republicans acting like George Soros is on equal footing with the Kochs. The Kochs put Soros to shame with the amount of money they spend.    Do you honestly believe that?    Yeah close to that. They probably want to be like the NBA and NHL where  half the league goes to the playoffs.    While I agree with ESPN here that Jan 2 would make more sense for the semifinal games than NYE but they knew this would happen when they signed the contract. You can't sign a contract and then back out. And who knows maybe having the semifinal games on NYE will be a ratings bonanza. You don't know until you try.    Fuck the NFL. They don't need more playoff games.    That's my face when I'm on an airplane with a screaming kid.    I've only been on reddit for 5 months and this is one of my favorite threads. I've done more commenting here than anywhere else. I really love the gameday threads.

You know it's funny, UVA would be my third team (my dad is a huge UVA fan - the poor soul).    The Christian persecution complex knows no bounds    nope   As a gay man I don't get how gay people still want to be Christian, follow the Christian faith, and want their children to grow up in that environment    Something tells me that this won't work.    My Freshman year of college every Friday and Saturday evening I would order a pizza (or some other type of takeout food) and take my laptop into the study room in my dorm and just sit there and watch Netflix until about 2am while everyone else in the dorm was either hanging out or throwing parties.

I guess Vlad either lost his patience or someone insulted his toughness. I wonder if the EU regrets signing that agreement yesterday that allows Russia to selectively ban food from certain EU countries.    Here's a crazy idea, why not just raise the gas tax   My thoughts go out to the Bush family.    your english is fine, it's just something that you don't hear everyday.    Real potato quality video. Still beautiful    UAB hasn't been honest about a lot of things. [Like lying about the fact that a donor was willing to pay for new turf at the practice facility.](http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2015/01/uab_faculty_athletics_rep_says.html#incart_river)     Republicans being hypocrites usual    Criticize the Military, say we need gun control, bring up religion   Ted hasn't owned the team for about 19 years. When he sold Turner Broadcasting to TimeWarner in 1996 they got the Braves as part of the deal. TimeWarner sold the Braves to Liberty Media, a holding company controlled by John C. Malone, in 2006/2007. The Braves signed a TV deal about 5/7 years back with FOX Sports South/SportSouth, two regional sports networks owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (formally News Corp). The deal was for 20 years and pays only $15 million a year. For comparison the San Diego Padres signed a contract 3 years later for $40 million a years and the Texas Rangers signed a contract 2 years later for $80 million a year. Logically if the Braves TV contract were on the open market today it could fetch somewhere between those numbers if not more. So yeah the Braves have a shitty TV contract that they are stuck with until the late 2020s.    the public transportation will still be shit though and traffic will be a NIGHTMARE as its right where 285 and 75 meet.   thats fucking wrong, it hurts business because they don't know if the government is going to shut down one day or if the debt ceiling will be raised because the GOP likes using our economy as a bargaining chip.    Right, totally believable.

Just go to mediamatters.org you'll learn quickly why   I'll give it a chance but keep in mind people said that Colbert was also one dimensional when his show started out.

PSU fans are fucking insane. They ones on here keep claiming that it's only a minority that are JoePa apologists. If that's the fact SPEAK UP and let your voices be heard because if you don't your school is going to forever be associated with child rape and cult apologists. As an added bonus listen to the PSU hockey coach jump through hopes to try and defend the 409 stickers in a radio [interview](http://www.tsn.ca/radio/toronto-1050/gadowski-students-chose-to-wore-decals-1.186437)    Update: Fox News issues TWO formal [apologies] (http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-formally-apologizes-for-claiming-muslims-have-taken-over-european-cities/)    It is late, I'm tired, I have dyslexia, and I was on mobile: sue me.    Color me shocked that they actually apologized TWICE. The first apology seemed well thought out and articulate but the second one was clearly scripted and came off as fake - especially that smile at the end. Changes nothing about Fox though.    will they be in Baylor green?    You put way too much effort into this, you need to start lowering your expectations now.  Edited for grammar and spelling    of course it is /s    the thing is that with cable networks (which is probably what you watched 28 days later on) don't have any rules when it comes to nudity or swearing they do all of the censoring on their own voluntarily. Broadcast networks like ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox do however have rules regarding said stuff.    I don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth   Fox News rule no. 1 is to NEVER admit that you were wrong. There was the infamous incident when one of their anchors made the statement that "santa just is white". After a ton of backlash the next day she said that it was a joke (even though it clearly wasn't) and that people criticizing her were clearly liberals who were scared about how powerful Fox News is.    By the way welcome to reddit seeing as you are very new.    Here is the Fox News [non-apology] (http://video.foxnews.com/v/3994985513001/anna-apologizes-for-error-on-map-of-frances-no-go-zones/?#sp=show-clips)   Includes a non apology from Fox    I give a shit that the wins were restored because Penn St. is acting like they were the victims in this whole debacle, not the KIDS THAT WERE RAPED on their own campus. Is the NCAA a shit show? No doubt about it. But why should Penn St get special treatment after the fact when schools like USC and Miami were not. Especially sense the scandals at USC and Miami weren't nearly as bad as the Penn St scandal.     What is most damning, for me, is that Paterno convinced Schultz, Spanier, and Curley to NOT go to police. After the other 3 resolved to go to Department of Welfare, Paterno convinced them NOT to do that. That is horrible.  "According to CNN in an email dated Feb. 26, 2001, Schultz wrote to Curley about a three-part plan that included talking "with the subject asap regarding the future appropriate use of the University facility,"  "contacting the chair of the charitable organization" and "contacting the Department of Welfare."

If I were Joe I would have gone to the police once the administration did nothing or at the very least told Sandusky that I never wanted to see him around the campus facilities again   no he wasn't almost 60, he was 55. yeah JoePa wasn't close to retiring but he still could have kept coaching. JoePa told the administration what he had heard and once it became clear that the Penn St administration was covering CHILD MOLESTATION ON THEIR OWN FUCKING CAMPUS  up he should have gone to the police like and normal human being with a conscious .    what are you talking about, he's 70 now. he retired in 1999 at the age of 55.   It still doesn't change the fact that if Joe went to police that they would have taken him seriously. This man was a god in central PA, if he had evidence, even circumstantial or hearsay, the police would have done everything they could to investigate. The facts that that you site doesn't change the fact that Joe did nothing to stop what was happening and the Penn St. actively covered it up.    Ah another Paterno apologist. No he knew. Sandusky went from being coach in waiting to randomly retiring. The fact of the matter is that Penn St and Joe Paterno cared more about football than stopping a CHILD MOLESTER.      I was agreeing with you    Southerner here who's actually been to France. I would say that what most people here say is true. The NE is more densely populated and has better flight connections to Europe that the Southern, Midwestern, or Western part of the country. It also helps that NYC is a huge financial center and Washington is the political center of the country. Also like someone else said people out west may have a stronger connection to Asia and people in the southwest have a stronger connection to Latin America.    Cleveland might be NE politically or culturally but from a technical definition Ohio is part of the [midwest](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States)   Personally I would consider Ohio part of the Midwest    Gas taxes are used to fund infrastructure projects like roads   bridges. The federal gas tax hasn't been raised in 20 years and because of that funds are getting harder to come by. With the chances of a federal gas tax increase being almost 0, states are looking at the possibility of raising gas taxes on their own. The low price of gas at the moment makes it more palatable to raise the tax now than it was when oil was $100 a barrel.    I'd feel like I was selling my sole if I worked there   Well I checked the front page and second page and didn't see it there. I can't help it if 2 different websites have the same article and title.    the great conservative freakout about transgendered and bathrooms continues   it has been reported in the past that Shep is gay, if he is that must be a terrible place to work    the great conservative freakout about transgendered and bathrooms continues    Fox never ~~learns~~ cares    Fellow American here and I totally agree with you. Before going to France  all I heard about were how rude the French were. I personally never experienced that. Granted the school group I was with stayed in more of the touristy areas so there were more english speakers (and one could argue that they were putting on happy faces for tourists). However there were a few times that we were not in tourist areas.  The locals may not have spoken much english but we made the effort to speak French when ordering something or asking questions which they seemed to appreciate.     Don't fell bad. It was bought by Rupert Murdoch the guy who owns Fox News.    I would have changed the headline to make it more clear but r/nottheonion is SUPER strict about changing titles    I'll take him on TV over Lou Holtz any day.    I like the Le Pen metaphor    http://imgur.com/7drHiqr   I guess the rumors a month ago about a souring relationship between Whittingham and the AD were either false or resolved    Am I the only one here who think that this is wrong and that Penn St should not have the wins restored. I'm sick and tired of Penn St and Paterno fans acting like they were the victims here. The victims were the KIDS that Sandusky RAPED while Penn St turned a blind eye. Did the NCAA overstep? Possibly but guess what the NCAA makes up the rules as they go along. The NCAA is a dick to everyone (just look at USC) why should Penn St get special treatment when everyone else is punished to the fullest extent.   Did they learn nothing from Jurassic Park   My guess is something by either Fall Out Boy (again), Maroon 5, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, or Drake. Wild card would be Lady Gaga or Lorde (doubtful though)    never trust ANYTHING that the GOP puts forward as a plan/alternative    FUCK THESE ASSHOLES    Of course, introduce bills that have no chance of becoming law so that the GOP can focus all energy on that instead of things like tax and immigration reform    personally I wish for this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiEzKjycxTw list=PLnkEWtFM5LzdVdeMBFjW7p9y9hc-DbFXJ#t=13)   NOT A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE    the sheer stupidity of this country never ceases to amaze me    Wow I'm blind    People are calling us judgmental, but thats judgmental, to say were being judgmental when they dont know us, Booth argued.  -_____-   It's weird seeing the US without sunglasses    excuse my ignorance but can you explain the poster in the background    I assume you mean insects not incest :)   I think insects is self explanatory. I DON'T LIKE BUGS. Orcas..... I don't know why I don't like them. Maybe I'm just more of a fur guy and I have a hard time imagining them as anthros - same with birds probably. (though I did warm up to reptiles so who knows maybe I'll warm up to them as well)    Canines all the way. I'm just a dog person so I guess thats why I chose them (I have 2 fursonas a husky and a beagle). Others that I like are foxes, felines, otters, bears, and horses. Ones I don't really care for are birds, dolphins, pigs, insects, and orcas. I used to have a thing against dragons and reptiles but I'm slowly warming up to them.    I didn't know fish could be such dicks    My first year here as well. I really got into the game threads towards the end of the season and now it's like I can't watch a game without it. It makes watch football (especially bad football) more fun.    I hear a lot of talk coming from FCA, but i doubt that they will be able to achieve what they are claiming.

Conspiracy confirmed    I'm talking about the fact that they put it in the headline. It's fine if they mentioned his party affiliation in the article but no they had to mention he was a Democrat in the headline because they are Fox News. If the head line just said "Politician Wins Special Election From Jail" it would have accomplished the same effect of getting someone to click the article.    you mean geckos    What a bunch of cowards. Even USA Today, a newspaper that avoids controversy like the plague (seriously their editorial board leans loosely left but they let right wingers publish rebuttals all the time to give the appearance of impartiality) and the most vanilla newspaper I can think of, published the cartoons http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/12/hayat-boumeddiene-amedy-couilbaly-paris-terror-attacks/21621219/   http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/russia-is-not-charlie/514369.html   Of course Fox News needs to mention that it's a former Democrat.    I didn't say it was a bad thing. I'm using that as an example as to how USA Today avoids controversy.  I'm just saying that it's sad that the McPaper that is USA Today has more balls than Sky News   	198

 Hey everyone! So, I recently picked up my weber performer, and along with it my wife got me a smokenator 1000, and I grabbed a pitmaster iq110. Because it's a performer, it has ash catching hardware on the bottom, so I have to install the iq110 manifold off to the side somewhere.  Once I have it installed, is there a particular side I should set up the smokenator in relation to it? Should the air intake be below the smokenator, or should it be on the opposite side?   Hey everyone! After 3 years of eyeing it, I finally picked up a Weber performer gold last week, along with a smokinator 1000, an IQ110 temperature controller, a maverick et-733, and a bunch of other toys. We broke it in with some t-bone steaks, burgers, and dogs (totally traditional!). Hands down the best T-Bone I've ever had (brought it slowly up with indirect, and then seared for about 2 minutes one each side to finish and bring to final temp). It was like butter!  I've been using on using royal oak hardwood lump charcoal for grilling, and plan to use stubbs all natural briquettes for long slow stuff.  I am going to be smoking a Boston butt monday for dinner for the week (overnight dryrub sunday into monday early AM, then applewood smoking).  Since I haven't used it yet due to mother nature being uncooperative, I've been watching videos of folks using the smokinator with the same cut. In most, folks are mentioning a smoke of about 8-10 hours, but then in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VdxA5BntFs) he goes almost 16 hours. This is what brought about my question.  How do you know how long to smoke the meat? When it hits the target (190 ish) shouldn't you remove it? The guy making the video says in the beginning he's expecting a 16 hour smoke - how does he come up with that? It's probably a simple question but the times seem to be all over. If it's based on weight, a lot of the cuts seem to be about the same size range (8-10lbs), so why the difference in times? How do you plan for it?   Hey everyone. I am looking to start purchasing some bullion with bitcoin. So far the options seem to be amagi metals, agora commodities, coinabul, and bitgilt (if I don't mind waiting for overseas shipping and feel lucky about customs).  Has anyone dealt with any of these companies? I see lots of negatives posted about coinabul. I also see complaints about Amagi shipping VERY slowly. I can't find out much of anything about Agora, or overseas shipping with bitgilt.  So, does anyone have any others that they use and know to be reliable?   Just checking out the price and it seems to have dropped a good bit over the past day. What gives? Is it a big selloff? Or is it from the bitcoin price going up against the dollar and doge, while doge more or less keeps steady against the dollar?  Not scurrd, I'm still long with doge, just curious what everyone is thinking.   Pretty simple. I have about 30 or so hits which have been sitting as pending for several months (3+ months). What recourse do I have to get the money I earned? Can I report them for non-payment?   Hey everyone (sorry for the periods in the title, automod has a bug up its ass).  Since I can't mine anymore and I refuse to buy asics (single purpose hardware is a waste, and honestly just contributes to trash heaps), I have been investing my coins into several projects to earn a return on my investment. I saw that doge d.i.c.e and just d.i.c.e both allow you to invest in the house, earning a 1% return over time. Have any of you played with it? Have you had success?  Are there any other places where you can earn interest off of your coins that you are using?  The one other place I've been using is a bitcoin arbitrage company which gives about a %1.2 return daily.      Hey everyone. I have a paper wallet which I'd like to cash in. Right now I don't have access to my main litecoin client, so I was hoping I could create an online wallet and import it, or get an android wallet and import that way. Can anyone suggest a method for doing it? Downloading the full client isn't an option at the moment because our workplace doesn't allow much outbound connectivity.   Pretty simple! I would need to get at least 500 made. Most likely the end price would be 15-20k doge including shipping.   Hey everyone. We are currently using an oracle-backed database solution for a product we purchased from a vendor. We received their IOPS estimate based on a spreadsheet and built our SAN to match their estimate. We have 2 2-node RAC clusters, running dataguard between them.  We are looking to perform an augmentation to handle additional customers on this database, but the vendor can't provide additional hard numbers for us to go on. So, what I want to do is look at our current number of customers and the current peak IOPS, and then extrapolate that out to our new number of customers and what we estimate IOPS to be.  The problem I'm running into is that AWR reports don't seem to work right in RAC (awrrpt.sql seems to report back very small numbers). So, for either of those RAC clusters, how can I get real IOPs to/from the SAN? Oracle is the only thing using it.  I hope there's enough info here, I'm still somewhat new with Oracle.  I found this script: http://srivenukadiyala.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/calculate-iops-for-a-rac-database/ but it doesn't seem to work :(   Hey everyone. We have a large oracle database deployed (it's bundled in a vendor's software). The vendor provided storage requirements in terms of IOPs, and I scaled the storage solution appropriately given only that requirement.  We are now preparing to augment our storage in anticpiation of additional workload. According to the vendor, we should be ok. However, to be frank, they're basing every one of their numbers on a spreadsheet, and they can't explain how they arrive to a lot of them. This is a big red flag for me.  What I want to do is look at the current IO utilization of the SAN, compare that to the number of users we have provisioned, and from there hopefully extrapolate approximately what our utilization will look like after the augment.  So, how can I best get an IOPs number for a SAN volume mounted to a system that is currently being used by a database?      Hey everyone! With the halvening come and gone now, remember, even though we may not be showing up in a lot of profitability lists for multipools, they still have significant piles of coins sitting and waiting to be exchanged. So, before you panic buy/sell make sure that you give the market a few days to adjust.   Well, it has been a ton of fun folks, but with this halving I will now be losing about 5$ a day thanks to power. I just want to say it's been a ton of fun, and I've really enjoyed mining doge. I also really want to thank the folks at teamdoge for everything.  At this point I'm either switching to a multipool or going to hop from crapcoin to crapcoin and see what profitability i can find. Given scrypt asics coming out, I don't see myself mining too much longer, and none of the scrypt-n coins seem to be very effective to mine.  So thank you all for the fun, I loved mining. At this point I've got my nice pile of doge that I'll be holding on to until I find something REALLY COOL I want to buy :)  Don't worry though, I'll be sticking around the sub because once a shibe, always a shibe :)   Hey everyone! A few months ago we ended up pulling down an old flourescent tube fixture. I don't have measurements at the moment, it looks to be about 30 inches long but I could be misremembering. I'd like to pull the fixture apart and clean it. Then, I'd like to get some grow lights to help start seedlings. Are there any concerns about doing this? I know you're supposed to keep the light somewhat close to the starting tray to help provide a little warmth. Does light color matter, or can I just use any grow light? Should I use a 24x7 exposure to get them to sprout and then switch to something like 18 on 6 off for initial vegetative growth?  Any help would be awesome.   So, the last halving saw the price skyrocket leading up to the actual day of the halving. Folks were convinced that halving the supply of new coins would lead to fantastical increases in price.  Why the different behavior now? Do you think it's a function of muppet investors getting burnt once so they're staying out?   I haven't been able to find this. I know Kraken has it on the "to do" list, and so far I think the only exchange that features it is BTer. So, does anyone know if it's supported? Is it planned?   Just curious about this one. As I start to near 1m doge, I'm thinking about what to do with them. I don't buy much, and none of the current vendors seem to have things I want. So, I'd like to spend the doge doing things that can actually help spur on our economy, help communities, etc, but earn a profit on investment too.  Are there any groups out there that actively do this?   Let's make some friendly guesses!  I'm thinking we'll top out near 300 satoshi this time around. Just a leeeeeeeeetle bit higher than last time, but not too much. What do you think??      I know I've seen a few services where you send someone a link to an item with shipping information, and they purchase it for you with doge. Has anyone used any of these services? Are they reliable? Can anyone recommend any?            So, if I remember correctly, 1.6 is based on bitcoin .9. Bitcoin has stated that that version of the client was impacted, and has released 0.9.1. Due to the way heartbleed impacts the wallet-qt app, it could allow for coins to be stolen.  Are we going to see a patched version of our wallets anytime soon?  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=562400.0 has more information. Exploiting it requires rpcssl to be enabled. But if it is, you have to consider your wallet to be compromised.   Now that we can see that ASICs are here in force, can we have a serious discussion about merging or changing PoW? Because I'd like my million+ doge to be worth something in 3 weeks.  Yes, that sounds snarky, and yes, I fully intend it to sound that way. For months people have been trying to warn the community that something significant has to be done to make ourselves resistant to both multipools and to ASICs, but usually the cop-out response is "but it's hard!" or "Doge will be mined out before ASICs are a problem!" The latter is patently wrong. The former, well, is it better to avoid something hard, or have our coin be worthless in 3 weeks because one pool will control nearly 60% of our hashrate and no one can verify that any of our transactions are real?  1.6 was a band-aid. Instead of doing something significant, we changed our algo to allow for faster re-targeting of difficulty, to accomodate multipools entering and leaving. It got rid of a symptom, but not the cause. A cause that now controls more than half of our network.  [As of today, wafflepool controls 53% of our network hashrate](https://pools.rapidhash.net/pool/5). That means, if waffle was malevolent, he could start blocking transactions and initiating double spends. He controls this much thanks to sfire, a large chinese GPU farm that is now getting into ASICs, and is only going to have more in the future. Oh, and he's joked about doing a 51% attack against coins before. When we have a halving in 3 weeks, a number of miners, myself included, will be leaving because we're already barely breaking even for our costs. That means that sfire will control significantly more of the network hashrate.  So, can we please start considering the options that people always balk at because "they're hard!" Things like changing PoW so we're not scrypt compatible and most miners/asics aren't compatible with us. Or are we just going to stand by and watch as our coin plummets to 0 because we refuse to do something because it's difficult? We can keep choosing to "see what happens" until our coin dissolves in front of us, or we can actually do something.  I for one would like to do something.   Right now we are essentially getting spammed with repeat threads showing a lot of ignorance, half-truths and FUD. It would be very helpful if we could have a sticky that dispelled that.   So, I've been piling up doge for about 3 months now, but I haven't spent a whole lot. Well, today that changed! http://saltsworldwide.com/buy/fleur-de-sel/  Now if only there was a spice vendor that sold more than salt! :)   Simple question - I see lots of API's for connecting to bitcoind/dogecoin-qt, but I can't find anything that lets you simply generate a public address/private key pair. Does anyone know of a library to do this?    Hey everyone! A few days ago there was a shibe from Belgium who was willing to purchase and ship goods directly (things like chocolate, beer, etc). I was wondering if there were any shibes doing that for the Netherlands??? I'd love to get some beer from Brouwerij 'T Ij!   I'd like to investigate a non-3rdparty escrow system for a site idea I have. I know some systems out there for escrow (especially in darknet markets) are able to do multi-signature transactions.   Basically, you provide a private key to the escrow service, they send back a public address, you send the funds to the public address and the escrow service verifies that the funds are received, the vendor sends the product, the buyer confirms it, and then the funds are released to the seller.  Here's a good writeup: http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions  So, is this supported with dogecoin?   I've been looking at the candlestick for cryptsy since last night, and unlike the other recent spikes, I don't see anything weird going on. It looks organic.  So, what do you think? Is this the kickoff of the price increase before the halving as folks buy in?   Hey everyone! I am looking at writing a program, but one of the things I'd like to do is execute trades. What exchanges support doge, and provide an API that allows you to sell via API calls?  I know cryptsy will let you do it, what about others?? I'm a beginner so a well documented API would be hugely helpful   So, is there anything like ebay/craigslist out there that can be used easily?  Edit: I suppose I should be more specific - I am looking for non-registered businesses. Specifically, I'm looking to purchase gold and silver from folks who aren't looking to report it to the IRS :-P   I just wanted to throw this out there - not all multipools are evil.  Pools such as multipool.us, hashco.ws - they don't automatically convert to BTC unless you tell them to.  The real problem we're seeing is multipools that **auto-exchange** for another coin. This causes prices to consistently drop on exchanges because coins are always being dumped at or below the current market price to ensure a quick sale.   Simple! `use a backtick` to enclose whatever you want to write!  `It` couldn't `be` e`a`s`i`e`r`!   I'm curious about this. Yesterday I posted to find out who else was starting to get records in order in accordance with the IRS reporting requirements. I got downvoted to hell.  This morning I posted a link to the IRS form 8300 with a warning that if a vendor fills out that form (usually it's for transactions over $10k, but it can be submitted for much smaller transactions, and is routinely done so by precious metal dealers) and submits it with your contact information and you don't report capital gains/losses on the sale, you could be in for an audit and potential legal trouble. Again, downvoted to hell.  So, /u/ummjackson states that he welcomes regulation, but yet when the IRS regulates, the overwhelming sentiment from /r/dogecoin seems to be "ignore it! don't pay taxes!"   So, why is that? It seems like actively trying to flout the law is pretty un-shibe. Also, I'm pretty sure that telling people to do things that are illegal, like not paying their taxes, is also against reddit rules.   So, whats up shibes? Why the jump from "embrace regulation!" to "BOO REGULATION! DON'T PAY ANYTHING!"?   It looks like hashco.ws is exploring payouts in other BTC currencies for folks who want to do auto-exchanging. Right now they're only working with Mintcoin, but you may want to send them feedback if you're one of the folks who wants a multipool that pays out in doge.   [Let me introduce IRS form 8300.](http://www.fincen.gov/forms/files/fin8300_cashover10k.pdf)  Basically, this form has to be filed by a business anytime that a monetary instrument (cash, bitcoins, dogecoins, goats, glass beads) is received in an amount larger than $10,000 USD, or in a series of smaller related transactions. It also can be reported if cash transactions are smaller at the vendor's discretion.  So, where you should be concerned is if you're thinking "It's ok! I'm never converting to fiat, I'm just going to buy things and not worry about reporting!" Well, not so much. If the vendor chooses to report the transaction and you *don't*, the IRS now has a very good, clear reason to audit you. And if it shows up that you tried not to show them the earnings? Have fun getting arrested.  If you want you can reach out to vendors who are either overseas, or who won't submit the form, but that's super shady and you could get burnt, but it could work.  So, for all of the folks saying, "don't worry about reporting!" that's really not the case.  For everyone overseas, well, you're lucky ducks! :)   If anything, this may be one of the most important results from the IRS ruling yesterday.   The whole concept of 1 doge = 1 doge requires that dogecoin exist in a vacuum, where no other currencies exist. It assumes that no one will ever convert to other currencies, or should even compare the value to other currencies. The IRS ruling shatters that - the day coins are mined, they must immediately be given a base price in USD.   So, can we please, *PLEASE* stop yammering on about how 1 doge = 1 doge?   Or, is it better that people keep their head in the sand and end up getting audited and arrested because the dumb motto told them they didn't have to worry about the value in USD?  IRS Ruling:  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf   Ugh, this sucks.   I mine both doge and btc. For the most part I hold doge, btc I convert to fiat (a small amount gets squirreled away to an offline wallet).  Right now I'm putting together a spreadsheet of every disbursement I've ever received in btc/dogecoin, every transfer I've made, every transfer fee I've accrued, every time I've cashed out on coinbase, every fee from coinbase, every fee from the bank, etc. Next I have to look at my earnings each day, figure out what the "closing" cost of the coin was each day, figure out the Fair Market Value of that day's earnings, etc.  These requirements are going to be a huge PITA. But, I'm doing what I've got to do to stay legal. I'm hoping I can take this to a financial advisor and find out the feasability of starting an actual business. It would be nice to write off the cost of my mining hardware and my power usage.  Anyone else starting to go through this process?   [Bitcoin-trader.biz](https://bitcoin-trader.biz/?ref=msarro) (yes, that's my ref link, feel free to crop off the =ref part on the URL).  So, I have been looking into this site and I can't seem to find much information. I have an account, and again, the link above is a ref link, but I haven't used it yet.  There are a couple comments about the site on a few forums from seemingly happy users, but that's about all I can find. There are also some videos on youtube talking about earning 10+ bucks a day off of it, but they seem to be folks fishing for referrals.  They seem to emphasize referrals and downlines which has me concerned that part of their sexy payouts is a ponzi scheme. Their daily earnings for the trading pool over the past 20 buziness days average around 1.241%. That would put you at around 29$ for every 20$ invested over the 120 day term. I'm not sure if the mining pool is worth it since it's returning .6% on investment daily right now.  So, has anyone used them? Any success or horror stories? If you want to play around with it, feel free to use the ref link above or just go to bitcoin-trader.biz and check it out.   100000 doge! I'm just testing to see if there are bots that are looking for the [GIVEAWAY] tag. Please don't post if you're a human.      So, I understand that it gets rid of "gaming" block rewards. It also allows difficulty to be rapidly re-targeted.  However, per the owners of several multipools, they're not planning to stop mining doge, it just becomes "another scrypt coin" that can't be gamed. So, it seems like all of these "goodbye multipools!" threads are a bit misguided.  Is there something else in 1.6 which will actively prevent multipools?   I just want to give you all a big virtual high five. After recent constructive criticism about no organized press releases when we meet big goals, I logged in today to see several. A bunch of shibes stepped up to spearhead getting it done, and folks took those releases and put them out to the news. And guess what? We are showing up!  I'm on the board of directors for a nonprofit, and the biggest problem we have is getting people to follow through on good ideas. Folks always have the best intentions, but a lot of times people don't follow through to get things done. You guys give me faith that those folks that can get things done really are out there.  I am so proud to be a part of this community!      Hey everyone. For a long while I've been interested in woodworking, and have been slowly trying to outfit a workshop. So, I think I'm about ready to take the plunge as soon as I can locate a scroll saw.  Are there any good starter kits to cover the basics? I'm familiar with how a lot of the tools work, but I'm by no means an expert, especially when it comes to building jigs and stuff.  As a first real project, I want to build my wife a puzzle box. Specifically, something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWNSXyRO5nE  I can't find plans for it, so I am working with sketchup to build it from the ground up. My wife's dad is a mechanical engineer, so I'll probably have him looking over my shoulder. So, do you think I'm jumping in too deep for a first project? Should I find some woodworking "kits" to work on first before trying to build my own thing?   So, I have a weird issue where aggressive config settings cause sgminer to crash at launch (specifically if I set memclock to 1500).  However, if I launch cgminer with conservative settings (1250) and then modify the memory settings from inside sgminer after it's already started, it runs just fine with the more agressive settings. Does anyone have any idea why?  Here is the config I start with:          "xintensity" : "8",     "load-balance" : true,     "worksize" : "256",     "kernel" : "zuikkis",     "lookup-gap" : "2,2,2",     "thread-concurrency" : "30528",     "gpu-engine" : "1000",     "gpu-fan" : "60-60,60-60,60-60",     "gpu-memclock" : "1250,1250,1250",     "gpu-powertune" : "20",     "temp-cutoff" : "90,90,90",     "temp-overheat" : "85,85,85",     "temp-target" : "75,75,75",     "api-listen" : true,     "api-mcast-port" : "4028",     "api-port" : "4028",     "expiry" : "120",     "gpu-threads" : "2",     "gpu-dyninterval" : "7",     "gpu-platform" : "0",     "log" : "5",     "no-pool-disable" : true,     "queue" : "0",     "scan-time" : "1",     "temp-hysteresis" : "3",     "shares" : "0",     "kernel-path" : "/usr/local/bin",     "api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1"   So, I have a weird issue where most of my config settings cause sgminer to crash at launch (specifically if I set memclock to 1500).  However, if I launch cgminer with conservative settings (1250) and then modify the memory settings from inside sgminer after it's already started, it runs just fine with the more agressive settings. Does anyone have any idea why?  Here is the config I start with:          "xintensity" : "8",     "load-balance" : true,     "worksize" : "256",     "kernel" : "zuikkis",     "lookup-gap" : "2,2,2",     "thread-concurrency" : "30528",     "gpu-engine" : "1000",     "gpu-fan" : "60-60,60-60,60-60",     "gpu-memclock" : "1250,1250,1250",     "gpu-powertune" : "20",     "temp-cutoff" : "90,90,90",     "temp-overheat" : "85,85,85",     "temp-target" : "75,75,75",     "api-listen" : true,     "api-mcast-port" : "4028",     "api-port" : "4028",     "expiry" : "120",     "gpu-threads" : "2",     "gpu-dyninterval" : "7",     "gpu-platform" : "0",     "log" : "5",     "no-pool-disable" : true,     "queue" : "0",     "scan-time" : "1",     "temp-hysteresis" : "3",     "shares" : "0",     "kernel-path" : "/usr/local/bin",     "api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1"   I know you guys are running ragged right now, but you may want to update this (or at least do it when 1.6RC files are available).   I'm switching everything to Kraken, unless someone can tell me if there's another exchange with really good volume and supports metatrader?      Simple question that isn't addressed in the announcement, and my post hasn't gotten any responses there.  If the software is being released in 24 hours, is it ok to install immediately? Does it switch internally at 145k? Or do we have to update at the same time as the pools?         The way I see it, we have a few threats to our currency:  1) Multipools exploiting random rewards.  2) Multipools sending difficulty skyrocketing when they suddenly turn their sites on doge.  3) ASICS. People have been saying that this isn't a real threat. Guess what? They're rolling off production lines. They're here, and they're only going to get better. For you and I it is prohibitively expensive to purchase 10 of them for $2500. However, what about the manufacturer? They've got literally thousands on hand at any given time, and all they need is a few USB controllers to hook them up in a side room of their warehouse. This explains several of the multi-GH whales that have started appearing on some pools.  The feedback from devs so far has been to fix random rewards (which addresses number 1), and implement something like a gravity well (which addresses number 2). Number 3 still doesn't seem to have any solution, we're just relying on time and the hope that "doge will be mined out by then". Hoping isn't a solution.  So, why not look at implementing scrypt-jane (something with adaptive n-factor) instead of vanilla scrypt? This would make our coin largely incompatible with most multipools out of the gate, and it addresses most of the issues with a single monolithic change instead of several smaller ones. For most miners, it would be a fairly trivial change to the kalroth version of cgminer.  It seems like we're fixing several issues with multiple fixes instead of implementing one large fix that can mitigate all of them. I'm not saying that the other issues shouldn't ultimately be resolved, but if we're doing one hard fork, why not address as many issues as possible?   Usually on the pool I use it shows as around 2800-3000KH/s.  As of about 5 minutes ago, it's showing 300KH/s.  I really hope my rig isn't on fire. LOL   Many companies, when they start to grow, will do stock buybacks. This lowers the number of shares on the market for trade, thus increasing their value.  We could donate mined doge/cash, the foundation buys it back to hold, and in exchange there could be some kind of return to investors. I have no idea what it would be, I'm only beginning to think through the idea. But I'd love to hear some feedback.  I have to give credit to /u/CokeRobot for making me think of it with his idea of everyone buying 1800 doge a piece. http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/202ry3/want_to_help_bring_the_price_up_support/cfzdw4r?context=3   Simple! post your favorite thing or memory from the dogecoin community! Let's bring some positive vibes!   There are 70000 shibes registered in this sub. That means if every single one of us donated 1000 doge, we'd blow the roof off of our goal.  So, how does this raise the value of dogecoin? Simple - PR. When we meet the goal, we can send out press releases. A TON of them. Everyone in the community can get in touch with their favorite news website and provide the press release. It's what's called a media or marketing blitz. We push to have as many news articles out at the same time - make it impossible for people to miss it. Good news means more people are interested, more people get into the market, and the price goes up because demand goes up.   Ok folks, how can we get ourselves in the news again? I know right now we're working on doge4water, but what else can we do? How can we pump up search volume? How can we get more vendors interested? How can we inspire shibes sitting on the sidelines to either spend their doge, or open small businesses? How do we keep spreading the love??  We have an awesome opportunity, so how do we move this forward?   Hey everyone. I'm just curious about these settings... I tried it before, and the result was pretty catastrophic. I saw a huge decrease in my hashrates, and I also saw my number of rejects skyrocket compared to normal single-pool usage.  However, I've switched from a single threaded approach to a multithreaded approach, and in general I've seen my number of rejects plummet. Has anyone gotten load balancing working nicely? What pros and cons have you experienced?   So, for the past 3 weeks i'd found a configuration which was "stable" but only on 14.1 drivers in BAMT 1.5. If I tried bamt 1.3 or 1.5.1 (using 13.1 and 13.2 drivers respectively) almost any setting would cause a crash on bootup.  With the 14 drivers, my GPU engine will never go above ~980mhz, despite being a Sapphire TRI-X OC R9 290 which is supposed to have a factory overclocked base speed of 1000 Mhz.  Well, this evening I decided to try things a little differently. I'm still using bamt 1.5 with 14 drivers, but I decided to cut xintensity down to 8, and i configured 2 gpu threads.  Holy cow. Where before a "good" pool was giving me 3% rejects, I am now on what had been the "worst" pool for me, a multipool, and I am hovering at around 0-0.5% rejects. On top of that, my kh/s is hovering around where it had been before.  I think I'm in love! Also, since this is a bit less intensive, I am going to try 1.3 and 1.5.1 again, and see if the different drivers provide an additional boost.  So remember folks, sometimes it's better to finesse your rig than it is to just go balls to the wall with overclocking :)   Just saw this... looks like Helixminer asics are going to be released in the next few days. Based on early reports they're looking significantly more stable than the previous dualminers. They're approximately 300KH/s, consume less than 100w, and cost about $295 (+/- $10)  I'm contemplating picking one up just to tinker with... anyone else checking them out?      Pretty simple, really. Every day I see posts coming in about things "you shouldn't do." Things like:  * Don't day trade * Don't convert doge to other currencies * Don't compare the value of doge to other coins, or fiat currency * Don't mine at large pools * Don't mine at multipools  Well, I'm here to tell you to *ignore them.*   You're an adult. You can make your own decisions. You are also responsible for the *consequences* of your decisions. The whole idea behind cryptos is to free people from bodies that exist solely to tell them what they can and can't do. Do what you want, just make darn sure that you know what you're doing before hand.  Just try not to lose sight of the fact that we're trying to build a community too while you pursue your own interests. Stay active and participate. We need you here, and not just staring at candlesticks. Enjoy your freedom and see where it takes you.      Seems like almost every altcoin is down this morning - it's a good time to buy doge if you have some free BTC on hand since they seem to be getting pumped right now.  Anyone have any insight? Is there some new news I'm missing?      I am looking at their services and am considering trying them out for the tips/doge exchange. Has anyone used them? Are they reliable?   [Link](http://www.amazon.com/USB-N13-Wireless-N-Adapter-802-11b-Wireless/dp/B002UVNW5W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1393557963 sr=8-1 keywords=asus+usb-n13)  Hey everyone, I picked this up for my mining rig, but ultimately ended up not needing it. It is in all original packaging, the only thing missing is the shrink wrap (it was literally used 1 day until I realized my rig was too far from the WAP). It supports windows, osx, and linux.  Because this will involve shipping a physical good, I'm going to ask that you pay first to help cover the cost of shipping.  NOTE: For linux, this is the [B1 revision](https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_USB-N13_rev_B1) of the device with the RTL8192CU chipset. To install it, you just have to go to [realtek website](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1 PNid=21 PFid=48 Level=5 Conn=4 DownTypeID=3 GetDown=false Downloads=true#2772) and download/install the module and it should show up in wicd.   The title pretty much says it all. No matter what setting I put it at, the gpu just hovers there.  I've tried 1.3, 1.5, and 1.5.1 (the unofficial release with 13.12 drivers). In all cases, the GPU-Engine speed hovers around the middle 900's. The annoying thing is, the cards are supposed to be factory overclocked to 1000mhz. They just don't want to run that high. Any ideas what could be going on?   Prove yourself: Pat's vs Geno's  There is only one correct answer.      Some folks have real expenses associated with being part of the community - expenses that can't be covered in doge.   For instance, I know I have to make and sell/trade about $130 worth of dogecoin/btc every month just to cover power for my mining rig. So to me, 1 doge has a real value associated with it.   While the majority of my coins get stored for long term, the stuff on the short term has a very real value beyond 1 doge = 1 doge, it directly translates directly to USD for me. Try to keep that in mind when someone is talking about value changes - they may need the market to cover expenses.   Seriously, do it.  There'd be a few more billionaires this morning if people had done this, and bothered to listen to the thousands of posts, suggestions, and outright warnings about using paper wallets, offline wallets, and never storing their money in exchanges. You can learn more by checking out this post: https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet  Treat your cryptos like they're real money, because they are. I know our community can sometimes come across like a starry-eyed hippie love-in, but we also have to remember that cryptos help increase anonymity, and where people think they can get away with something, they will try to. We also need to remember that businesses will fail. Any time you put your coins in someone else's hands, it's a chance for them to disappear. So make an offline wallet, use it, and take responsibility for your own money.  Good luck everyone.   The way my old investing mentor always put it was like this: "Suppose everyone smells smoke - bad investors scream 'FIRE!' And drop everything to get the hell out. Good investors run into the kitchen to get some BBQ before the bad investors realize it's there."   This is a pretty great discount considering the value of doge has fallen. You send me the doge, I send you the code to import into iTunes. This item was previously listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/1yaa8a/sg_25_itunes_gift_card_code_for_18k_doge/) but the buyer never came back.  I have 1 card to sell.  [SUCCESS]   Hey everyone! This is my first post here, and I'm still very new to android programming. My background is in super-high level stuff (perl, python, mostly massaging data and doing BA). This is my first time really working with an OOP language as such.  So, here's my q... if you have a data structure set up to hold a superclass, can you also put subclasses of that superclass into it? So, say you have a list of Car, could you also put MazdaCar and BMWCar in it too? Or would it only hold objects of Class Car?  The same goes for interfaces... can you make a data structure to hold only objects of Classes which implement a particular interface?  I'm trying to determine whether or not to use an interface or straight inheritance, and this is a big factor for me. Thank you!   So, I've read through how PPNLS works several times, but I can't seem to find what the "target" is. I noticed most PPNLS pools seem to have a value, and it changes somewhat frequently.      So this morning I had dogecoin-qt open and I randomly got a database error. This was with wallet 1.5.1. So, I shut it down, opened it up, and now it refused to open because of database issues. So, I closed it, upgraded to wallet 1.5.2, and still, it refused to open.  So, I backed up my wallet.dat file and deleted the blocks/ database/ and chains/ directories in my dogecoin install and relaunched. About half way through, I started getting errors involving my wallet.dat file and read errors. Awesome.  I have a backup, however the backup is about a month old. Is that going to cause a problem?         Welcome to the official "rate my doge" thread! Where you can share that awesome pic of your fuzzy pal, and maybe get some doge for your doge!  **RULES**  * 1 doge pic per person.  * I can't see everyone's scores (d'oh), so I'll just go by the number of tips each doge gets (no, you can't tip the same doge twice! (well you can, but it will only be counted once)  * Voting will close sunday night at 10pm EST * Any tips to my doge pic (should be the first one) will be added to the pot of 500 doge for the winner. Tips to other doges go to their respective owners :) * Your score needs to be viewable  So gentlemen (and ladies), post your doges!  PS: Imgur works as a file hosting site I think :)  **EDIT**  I had to change voting because a bunch of folks have their scores hidden. We'll now tally based on the number of tips each doge gets. In the case of a tie, winnings will be split between the tied doges!   Hey everyone! I'm a miner who has been mostly focused on doge, and mining on multipools for BTC. I decided I'll throw my hat in tonight to see how well my rig performs mining vertcoin. I'm pretty excited!  Does anyone have a favorite low fee pool that is stable (especially if it's PPNLS - nothing sucks more than a PPNLS pool that goes down every hour, lol)?   Hey everyone! I have a couple trades under my belt now, so you should feel safe. I receive these gift cards occasionally and already have about a $40 balance on itunes I'll probably never use, so, I may as well let someone get the card who can use it! What you'll get: I will scratch off the card and send you the code, which you can then import into iTunes for the $25.  FYI this is a re-list from a few days ago, a gentleman said he was interested but never came back. The original thread is here:http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/1yaa8a/sg_25_itunes_gift_card_code_for_18k_doge/   Just curious - is there anything stopping a 3-letter agency from creating a "vendor," and then creating a bunch of dummy accounts to pump up their ratings?  Is there something that lowers the influence of a review if it's A) a brand new account or B) the account has only dealt with one vendor?  It's something that jumps out at me based on the howto and looking at the site.   So, I am looking into starting a mining pool with some special tweaks that make it extra special.  I am working on the requirements now; I know I'll need server(s) for pushpool (or p2pool, or ecoinpool - i'll probably try each and see what works and what doesn't), front end server(s) running apache which I'm partnering with a developer on to customize, db server(s), and finally the coind software.  I have about 10 years of experience in enterprise network engineering/systems engineering/product engineering, so I am pretty sure I am ok on the technical side. The biggest thing I am missing right now is requirements for the actual boxes.  Is the DB read or write heavy? How much bandwidth can we expect per user? What's the rainy day scenario where you have a 5GH/s whale connect? How much storage is needed per user? What are the IO requirements for everything? What are memory/cpu requirements? I can't seem to find any of this information. I can test it using my laptop for some base info (it kicks out a mean 40KH/s!) but I don't know if it scales linearly or not.   http://invezz.com/news/forex/8924-forex-news-bitcoin-usd-resumption-of-play-at-mtgox-any-time-now  It looks like MtGox is going to be opening back up withdrawals, which should mean the BTC price tag should go up, and along with it, other altcoins (including Doge!). What does everyone think??   Hey everyone! I have a couple trades under my belt now, so you should feel safe. I receive these gift cards occasionally and already have about a $40 balance on itunes I'll probably never use, so, I may as well let someone get the card who can use it!  What you'll get: I will scratch off the card and send you the code, which you can then import into iTunes for the $25.  Here's a picture of the card with proof it's me and real: http://imgur.com/lPzhlqj  Feel free to PM with questions.   Well, this is something that has come up lately when discussing this with other folks, and it's something I personally want to understand.  So, the developers of dogecoin write the software. What exactly did they write? Is it a daemon that generates blocks that are then requested or sent out somewhere? Did they just write the original block which creates something different? How do the pools or users get the blocks? Where do the blocks come from?  The idea of it being decentralized kind of puts the kibosh on a central daemon which generates each block, plus if that was the case, wouldn't it be difficult for the chain to fork?  So, once the blocks have been created by any means, we mine against them. But if solving a block is what provides a reward, how do pools and members of pools get paid if they don't "solve" the block?  Is there any good source on how the whole process of a crypto-currency works that doesn't get too deep into the technical weeds so that your average (or slightly above average) shibe can understand it?   I've noticed that there have a bunch of completely benign, benevolent posts lately that seem to get a bunch of downvotes for what seems like no good reason. Maybe it's because I'm new to reddit, but can anyone explain what the motivation is for that? Just being a jerk for its own sake, or do people actively disagree with community-supporting posts?  For example, this post from the creator of /u/dogetipbot: http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1y8epn/a_few_minor_udogetipbot_announcementsnotices/  Why the heck are there downvotes there?         So, right now I've been piling coins into paper wallets. Should I ever import the paper wallet to an actual wallet.dat file, after doing that, is the paper wallet worthless? Or can it always be used to recreate the wallet.dat file?   Hey everyone. So I am playing with the rotate pool settings in sgminer and currently have it set to rotate every 12 hours through teamdoge, wemineltc, wafflepool, and multipool. Most of these are PPLNS, so I'm curious how long you really should be connected to each to maximize? I know it's set up to discourage pool hopping, but I'm wondering if 12 hours is long enough?   ...do you stick with only one coin? Or do you hop between different pools? I'm trying to diversify, so I've been switching between a few pools (some litecoin, some dogecoin, some like multipool that feed into a cryptsy account, and then hashco.ws). I can't really figure out which is the most profitable (I have to sell off enough to cover the cost of the rig plus power). So, what have you guys found to be the most effective?   Just curious, are you guys related to this redcoin? http://redcoin.pw/  If not, how do you intend to keep your branding from getting confused with theirs?   So, I am following several guides to try and tweak this number. http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemining/wiki/index/radeon_tuning_guide https://raw.github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/v3.7.2/SCRYPT-README  In both cases, it says that thread-concurrency should be a multiple of my number of shaders (I'm using 3x Sapphire Radeon R9 290's, each has 2560 shaders). I have configured the base memory clock for the card according to manufacturer specs (1300Mhz), and the engine speed too (947mhz). I've also put the number of shaders in the config file (2560).  In the guides it says to keep adding on your shader number until your miner won't start. My problem is that sgminer just keeps starting. I have yet to find a value for thread-concurrency where it won't start, and use the value prior to that. I'm up to 48640 now.  Once I have that figured out I can start pushing up the memclock. Any ideas why it isn't behaving per the tuning guides?  When I tried running cgminer/sgminer without any options, it gave me two bin files, one with 30464, one with 30528. Neither one is a multiple of the number of shaders on the cards.   So, I pulled it down from github and compiled it. However when I try to run it, it just pops up a screen saying "Waiting to get work from pools..." where it sits for about 3 minutes, and then closes. I've run it against 2 pools which SGminer can connect to no problem.  I've put it in a script with the options to export the display and set GPU environment variables. It just won't work :(      Just thinking about it - as soon as we past 100,000 and the reward halved, the multipools seem to have gone elsewhere. So, that should mean the difficulty on doge will plummet, won't it?   So, about a week ago I traded ~5000 doge on cryptsy for some bitcoin just to play around with it. However when I look at the blockchain explorer, my address doesn't reflect that the coins were ever traded; so it reflects a different balance than what is shown in my cryptsy account. Why is that?   Hey everyone! So as of yesterday, my rig was finally assembled (3x sapphier R9 290 TRI-X). I started with BAMT, and am averaging about 800KH/S per card. That's great compared to laptop GPU mining, but still not where I wanted to be with them. I'm averaging about 970 watts at the wall, and a 5% reject rate (mostly stale shares, probably because I'm using a wireless adapter?). The cards stick at around 65 degrees C (fan rate set to 68%.  The vast majority of posts I see about them have them stable up into the 900+ KH/s region. If I start to tweak my settings beyond 1000/1350, the system almost immediately locks up, or GPU2 suddenly becomes "sick" in cgminer and the whole system has to be rebooted. For some reason my TC has to say at 40960 or else the system locks up. I've tried lower settings (2560 shaders * 8 + 1= 20481), but the system just freezes almost immediately.  One thing I am noticing about every one of these systems that are pulling 900+ KH/s is that they are *all* running windows. Every single one of them. So, for those of you who have tried both, do you recommend windows over BAMT if you aren't worried about a simple templatized drop-in OS?  Edit:  Other info -  * 4GB DDR3 * Sempron 145 * MSI 970A-G43 MoBo * 3x Sapphire TRI-X radeon R9 290 (with hynix memory)   So.. which one do I hook my dvi cable to? Before when I did this it was for radiology workstations where you had a primary card, and then secondary card(s). So which one do I connect to? The top 16x slot?   LOL Well, that's the second vendor I had tell me they had power supplies in stock, and then tell me they were sorry, and they didn't have them in stock and had to have them sent from the manufacturer, who "was having trouble meeting demand." So, I took the advice of a few shibes on here and picked up 2 850w power supplies at best buy for a lower price and overall more power output. I also picked up a crate, and had EVERYTHING ready to go.  However, why am I posting here instead of working on my sweet new mining rig?  I don't have a DVI cable, and my cards didn't come with DVI/VGA adapters. LOL.  At the very least I have one at work that I can use, so I'll get about 1.5 days of good mining before the halvening happens :)   Hey everyone. One thing that seems to keep coming up is the idea of making cash via trading. I am totally down with that. What is not cool, though, is people doing it without being informed. For instance, can you read a candlestick chart? Do you have a plan to minimize risk? These are some pretty basic things.  The best way to learn them is through looking up online courses and tutorials about foreign exchange trading (FOREX). Basically, forex was traditionally trading dollars for euros, or dollars for yen, and vice versa. Then you'd take advantage and trade back to make money. Sound familiar? It's the exact same thing as trading cryptos, except the tools are a little more rudimentary (they don't have to be, but people haven't built something like metatrader for cryptos yet). Plus, unlike trading traditional fiat currencies, you can actually mine cryptos.  **Here are some small things that are helpful to know:**  * When you make a trade, define a point you want to exit, and commit to that. * Try to never commit more than 2% of your total resources to a particular trade. It sucks to lose 2% on a trade, it sucks way more to lose 100%. * Never trade on news. Seriously. The whole halvening thing? That's news. Stay away from it like it's the plague. Wait for the market to settle back down or you could see yourself getting nasty burnt. Don't believe me? Look at what happens to the candlestick charts of currency pairs like the Eurodollar whenever the Fed gives a statement. Trading on news can be profitable, but most of the time, it will leave you cold and broke. * Keep your emotions in check. Always. They will lie to you. Do your best to use cold logic and numbers. * If the crypto markets ever evolve to the point where you can use stop losses, USE THEM. * Hedge your bets. Keep a variety of things in reserve. A mix of long term investment plus some trading is usually more successful than just exclusively trading.   **Here are some places to learn more about forex and currency trading:**  * http://www.babypips.com/school * http://www.ufxmarkets.com/learn/forex-school  **This is a great guide on learning how to read charts (which are your best friend if you want to be successful in trading):**  * http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_cand  **Another thing to keep in mind**, both IOS and android have free FOREX trading games you can download which use actual historical numbers between currency pairs. You can play with them and start to understand patterns of the market and improve your trading before you ever move a doge out of your wallet. It's invaluable practice. Some of them even have "news" events which can show you how a market moves when news comes out.   This is a pretty basic question. When you use cryptsy's auto-sell feature, what does it sell the coin for? Does it trade it in to "cryptsy points"? Does it trade it for BTC? If you have a bunch of TIPS, does it trade it for LTC and then trade that for BTC (there's no TIPS/BTC pair)? Their documentation doesn't say much, just that it "automatically sells."   Out of curiousity, when you go to sites like: dogeaddress.org liteaddress.org bitaddress.org  Do you have to do anything to add the wallet to the blockchain? Or does simply sending coins to that generated address make it exist? If there's no central addressing point, how are collisions avoided?   http://blog.fiverr.com/fiverr-now-accepting-bitcoins  Interesting article - maybe once they get used to using cryptos they'd be a good place to look at convincing to accept Doge!   So, how do you all do it? Do you keep a ledger? A spreadsheet? I started keeping a notebook, but thanks to multipool I have a ton of other smaller cryptos which I don't really feel a need to track.  It'd be awesome if someone made something like "mint.com" for your cryptos.   YAY! They look beautiful. Now when my power supply shows up I can actually kick off the mining :)     So, I'm waiting for my last few parts to arrive for my mining rig; not just for Dogecoin, but any other altcoin (I'm also really interested in Curecoin when it comes out). I am doing this as part of a side business I own because I thought it would be another revenue stream. I love dogecoin and its community, but I will admit I am here to make profit too. My goal is to use a multipool to mine whatever is most profitable, and convert to USD (either through straight to buyer sales or through exchanges), right now that's doge, but who knows after the halvening. I've done the math. Even if things go south I should be able to make my money back. Plus I've got the hard asset; 3 R9 290's, the RAM (mobo and cpu won't be worth squat, but meh). And by done the math I don't mean just using a calculator, I mean doing a linear regression to figure out the probable difficulty in 1 year based on trends and using that for calculating out profit. I'm in the clear. On the low end, the system should pay for itself in 1 quarter.  The thing is, other folks who thought it was a neat venture are hearing the news about MtGox and are starting to PM me about it that I'm heading into failure. I'm hearing "well aren't all of those coins the same?" constantly. I'm getting tired of explaining it to people. I've always been really good at divorcing myself from emotions when it comes to money things and letting the math guide me, but this time, they're starting to wear me down a bit. My wife especially. I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post, other than just some venting. Any thoughts or inspiring words shibes?   Just curious about this; I know that the satoshi is a fraction of a bitcoin, so we basically track the value of dogecoin against BTC. Is there a reason for that?   Well, I was set to have my rig built this afternoon, but then tigerdirect notified me that they don't actually carry stock anymore; they drop ship everything. Which sucks. They were the company I was going to get my power supply from.  So, I cancelled my order with them, and ordered from another company; rush processing, 2 day shipping. I got a call from them a few minutes ago that their shipment of power supplies never came in, but they expect it to be in on monday. Maybe.  So, as of today I have every single part except a power supply, and given that most places seem to have anywhere from a 2 week to 6 month backlog on 1500w power supplies, I'm annoyed. I was hoping to start mining before the halvening to get at least a few days of peak mining out of it. Boo.  There are no freys or microcenters nearby to check out, so it looks like I am stuck waiting.  I wish vendors would simply state whether or not they have an item. Not list it as available when they "expect a shipment to come in," or when "we think our 3rd party warehouse may have it available, maybe."  Such frustration. Many sad.   Well, how do you go about doing it? Right now I'm looking at both Vault of Satoshi and Coinbase. Coinbase will require me to trade doge for BTC (so there's a fee there at some exchange), and then on top of that they charge a percentage fee, and they tack on a .15 "bank fee." But I can withdraw anytime day or night to my business account.  Vault of Satoshi requires me writing them an email, hoping they respond, but it looks like that would be free if I just get a paper check. However, time could be a factor here since I was hoping to get at least a weekly payout.  I'm looking to mine 24x7, withdraw 98% of each day's take as USD daily, and then send the other remaining coins to cold storage wallets.  So, for those of you who do it, how do you manage to keep fees low? What has been your lowest-cost method of converting doge to USD?   Just curious - for all of you more experienced miners, is there a noticable difference between using Linux and Windows? What about power utilization?  I ask for two reasons:  * because it seems like doing things like tweaking card performance/voltage is significantly easier inside of windows, whereas with linux you're sort of stuck hoping your miner can make the changes which may or may not be possible. * Windows tends to have way more processes running so it would make sense that it would be more power than a minimal linux install.  Any feedback would really be appreciated.   Hey everyone. So, 4 days ago I felt like I hit the lottery when I saw a 1500w power supply for sale at tigerdirect, and in stock! I placed the order, and waited.  Then I got an update: order submitted to drop shipper. WTF? Tigerdirect is drop shipping now? Seriously?  So, I've been waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Still no update. Every time I call tigerdirect they say that the order is being handled by the drop shipper, and the drop shipper has to meet the same shipping timeframe. I paid for 3 day shipping. This is the third day.  I'd cancel my order, but everywhere I look there is a 2 week to SIX MONTH waiting period for power supplies. Does anyone have any idea where to purchase them?      Hey everyone! So, I'm trying to be objective with this post, so I'll do my best to stay away from opinion type things and stick with hard facts.  So, why do I think that dogecoin is here to stay?   * **Transaction volume.** With only being around for 2 months, our community has already dwarfed the number of transactions that bitcoin or any other altcoin sees. The ultimate point of a crypto*currency* is for people to **use it**. The suggestion that bitcoin will be hoarded seems to be true; people don't seem to spend it that much. That's great, but if it doesn't get used, people don't have a reason to accept it for transactions. When is the last time you went into a store and saw someone pay with a gold coin? Still, people stock up on them. So what they've done is turn it into a commodity instead of a currency. There's nothing inherently good or bad about that, but part of what makes a crypto-currency work is people using it as, well, a currency.  * **Our community.** It's awesome. Simple as that. When I first heard about doge in december, I wrote it off as another fad on 4chan that would go away in 2-3 days, especially when I saw people throwing around tens of thousands of coins in a shot. Plus, that was paired with a lot of rhetoric about getting rich from people who didn't really seem to understand how currency exchange, or economics worked in general. But, here we are! And oh man, this community is driving it forward. People are using paper wallets to spread the word. People are getting businesses to accept Dogecoin. People are starting businesses to support the community. People are getting netted in with pervasive tipping. That all points to this digging in for the long haul. Add into that all of the charity, which I'll talk about more in the next point, and I think it all points to good things in the future. Every 10 minutes you see a new reddit thread about a new shibe coming to the community.  * **Our branding.** Originally, I thought it was silly to use a meme as the basis for a currency. The people who were evangelizing dogecoin kept saying that it would succeed because it's cute and appealing. I thought that it ultimately would be shrugged off as unprofessional by most of the world. To be honest, I still think that it may be eventually (maybe a rebrand of an epic Shibe standing on a cliff, a-la-Lion King), but for now I appear to be wrong. See, half of what made things like siri successful is the goofy stuff you can do with it ("do you love me siri?"). We've become like the counterpoint to the way-too-stern bitcoin community. Where they're talking about smashing iPhones and boycotting apple because an app was banned, we're talking about sending people to the Olympics, getting aide dogs for kids, and digging wells. We're raising awareness of ourselves not through advertising, but by being a genuine benevolent force in the world. That's really **REALLY** powerful. Plus, we've had a bunch of fun slogans which reel even more people in. TO THE MOON! It's a rallying cry! But more than anything, we have painted ourselves as a powerful force. *Let's do so much good that the world at large doesn't want us to go away.* We're already seeing newsprint in major sources - when's the last time another alt-coin has done that outside of a tech journal?  * **The developers.** Let's give them their due. They had an idea, and it took off. But they've also been able to make hard decisions when necessary. It took cojones of steel to make the hard decision to become inflationary currency. It took willingness to sacrifice part of the community that they were very aware would jump ship when the news hit. And, you know what? A bunch of folks did jump ship. But that's part of leadership - you have to be able to make hard decisions not just for yourself, but for your entire community. They've also decided that we should continue to be a force for social good, and I totally support that.  So, combine all of these things, and I think we've found the crypto-currency recipe for success. We just have to keep going and run the course... **TO THE MOON**!  TL;DR: I think we're here to stay because people are actively using the currency, our community is awesome, we have great branding, and our developers have cojones.   So, what would be a realistic number of doge mined daily using 3x Radeon R9 290's at around 900KH/s? I'm just curious what I can expect (approximately obviously) once my rig is finished ~monday.   So, I am waiting on 3 of these to arrive: http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-290TR4G  For the life of me though, I can't find any information about whether or not they're unlocked. When i get them, they'll be put in a rig, and run with BAMT. So, where can I go to find out whether they're unlocked? Will something tell me? Is unlocking important?  I'd really appreciate the help!   Simple question, which one is the better choice right now? This will be on a headless mining rig. The only big things I can see in the release notes for 13.10 are that there's additional GUI stuff, which, frankly, I don't really care about. But is there an updated kernel or anything that would make it preferred over the LTS?   Hey everyone. I'm going to be getting this MoBo for my mining rig tomorrow. I've read that a lot of motherboards need the 1x to have a jumper wire installed on the PCI slot to see anything in the 1x slot as a video card. Is that the case with these motherboards?   Just curious; I have had a heck of a time getting anything related to primecoin running on OSX. I finally managed to get a working miner and wallet using brew and the directions here: http://www.reddit.com/r/primecoin/comments/1slc8q/primecoin_wallet_and_xolominer_pool_miner_for_osx/  This installs the primecoin wallet to /usr/local/Cellar/primecoin/0.1.2xpm.  But now I can't get the wallet to sync. Apparently there was an update recently, but you can forgo it if you modify Primecoin.conf. The problem is, from what I'm reading, Primecoin.conf doesn't exist by default. I can't find any documentation around about where it could or should be located on OSX.  So, I guess my question is twofold:  *Why the lack of OSX love? There's a ton of documentation for linux and windows, but there's very little for OSX.  *And where is primecoin.conf supposed to be located when you follow the instructions in that walkthrough?   Oh, and in case anyone wants to say a mac is "not a real computer" or whatever, I'm a telephony engineer for a fortune 500 telecom, and actively help write standards for the IETF. I'm also an RHCE. I know a real computer when I see one, trust me.   Hey! My new rig is using 3 of these GPUs: http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-290TR4G  According to their docs, it has an 8pin and 6pin power connector built into it. I ordered 2 normal 16x-16x PCI risers, and a single powered 1x-16x pci riser.  Since the GPU has its own power connection, can I just forgo connecting the power plug on the riser and use it like it was unpowered? This is the riser I bought: http://www.amazon.com/Qody-PCI-E-Extension-Cable-powered/dp/B00FQJ077Q  Any feedback would be really helpful; I'm just trying to make sure I don't burn anything out.         Simple question; today I have had 4 deposits sent to cryptsy. Nothing seems to be showing up. For Doge, I can see the transactions in block explorer, but there's still no "transactions out." I know scrypt requires a bunch of verifications, but I've still usually received coins to my wallet within 10-15 minutes.   This is my first sale, so sorry about the low rep. I've had this game sitting in my inventory for years and it's time someone got to enjoy it!   Hello! So, I'm trying to figure out dogetipbot. The "answer a lot of repeated questions" post I found doesn't actually answer a lot of my questions... like, how do I start using it? How does it know where to send and receive dogecoins to/from? Is there a silly noob post explaining it?  I'm still kind of new to reddit, so, this may be something really easy that I'm just not getting, lol :)   Eep. Here's hoping it can pay for itself, or I'm going to owe a lot of explaining to the Mrs. So, here are the parts:  **video** 3x [Sapphire TRI-X AMD Radeon R9 290 OC](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?p=AT-290TR4G c=pw hash=510dY3r8l1Wto8S1V8hVdR0jLFvVFgNtVEuY502sas2Zu%2B4yBhuoU3RRMm8Qu3IJXObxWaOMJp56fbOtRGb8pXEHIELDkrlpnAZIpwLfw39CDudlYy00KS1IXH8%2Feg) - Apparently the order includes a free gift of 3x [Sapphire AMD Radeon R7 240 2GB](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-R724BT2) - *$1,805*  **CPU, MEM, MOBO** 1x [AMD Sempron 145](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103888) 1x [Kingston 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 1333](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239309) 1x [MSI 970A-G43 AM3+](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130679) Total: *$167*  **Power** 1x [SilverStone Strider Series 1500w Modular Power Supply](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=6624651) - *$365*  **Misc** 4x Risers (2 1-16x powered, 2 16x-16x), milk crate, kill-a-watt wall meter, ATX power switch,  16GB USB3 stick - *$125*  Original plan was for the 3x 290's, but if I get the free R7's as well, one of those will be going in too. The others will get resold.  Thoughts? Total came to around $2462. Assuming 4 cards, it should put out about 3000KH/s.      Hey everyone; I am looking to purchase a mining rig for mining Scrypt coins, but I'm trying very hard to ensure that I get a return on investment. However, I am very concerned about dumping the cash on several GPUs only to have ASICs suddently become widely available. With things like dualminer coming out, and now gridseed's product, what sort of threat do you think do they present to not just Doge, but all scrypt mining?  I have always read that Scrypt would be nearly impossible to mine with ASICs because memory usage can be increased to make them prohibitively expensive, but yet here they are starting to appear on market.   Hey everyone! Just trying to figure this out; dogecoin-qt has said for the past 8 hours or so that it's at 100% (or at least the little progress bar says so). However the wallet still says it's out of sync. I'm using osx mavericks... just not sure what's going on. Anyone else have experience with the dogecoin client on a mac?   Hey everyone, it's another one of those posts that you all love! This is meant to be a first foray into mining. I'm starting with 2 GPUs and scaling up from there. Ultimately I'd think this could handle up to 4.  * Motherboard: MSI 970A-G43 AM3+ AMD 970 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130679  * CPU: The same CPU everyone else is using :-P http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040BPHJO  * Power: Corsair RM Series 1000 Watt ATX/EPS 80PLUS Gold-Certified PSU http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EB7UIZU  * RAM: Kingston 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333 Desktop Memory http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239309  * GPUs: 2x SAPPHIRE TRI-X OC 100362-2SR Radeon R9 290 4GB 512-bit http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080  * Storage: 16GB USB 3.0 jump drive http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B6YPNO  I'll be running xubuntu off the USB storage. Any suggestions on tweaks? This brings the price to about $1584 with an estimated 1600 KH/s based on the hardware comparisons I've seen. I'm also estimating power should be around 600w at the wall? Should I look into a larger power supply? Any feedback would be appreciated.  This box will be sitting in my basement on my workbench chugging away 24x7x365 (hopefully).   Hey everyone. I am new to litecoin mining, and I'm trying to do the math to see whether or not it is worth it to get started. I am using this calculator: http://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/litecoin-mining-calculator  Assumptions: I'm assuming purchasing 3 HD7990's (I work for a large telecom company and can likely get better deals than the average joe), but I'm assuming a hardware cost of $4k and a hash rate of 3000 KH/s. I'm assuming a 1250 watt power supply, and our power costs $0.11/kWh. I'm assuming a 1% pool fee (I don't have a pool picked out yet). I've kept the default block reward of 50 because I'm too new to figure out quite how this works.  Calculations: For difficulty, I took the chart and history here: http://bitcoinwisdom.com/litecoin/difficulty and did some number crunching. I defined X as the number of days since 8/15/2013, and Y as the difficulty. First, I figured out the slope and intercept based on those numbers. Based on the data listed, the slope comes out to approximately 17.9 difficulty/day, and the intercept is at 306. Then it was just a matter of plugging it into slope-intercept form (y=m*x+b), where x is 535 days (the number of days between february 1, 2015 and 8/15/2013) which gave me a difficulty of 9884 one year from now. I did a linear regression and the math seems to jive.  ROI: So that's what I popped in to the calculator. Using these numbers, it is showing a profit of approximately $1.4k over the year. Since this is basing the entire year off of what the difficulty is estimated at a year from now, it could potentially be much more (current difficulty is around 2500).  So, does this math seem correct? I'm trying to be conservative because I'm showing it to the Mrs to justify why I'd be spending it. Any feedback would be helpful.  Also, this is assuming only litecoin is mined, and no money is sunk into ASIC mining devices if/when they come out.   http://adf.ly/cFobC   http://adf.ly/cFUS7   Hey everyone. As of this morning, thanks to an idiot HIT requestor, my approval rating is down to 98.1%. I took several of their HITs, in which you had to identify "objectionable" images. They included a warning which stated there would be between 20-50 objectionable images in the lot, and if you selected more than 50, you would have your hit rejected.  So I ended up being presented with about 5 hits, each with scores of penis pictures (no joke). Each one had tons of "objectionable" images based on the requestors requirements, so there was no way to supply the required information without exceeding their 50 image threshold. As of this morning, I logged in to find out every single one had been rejected; each one stating "you missed N different images." So, not only would I have had to flag 70+ images on each HIT, but I would have had to go directly against their warning. Since i'm new to HWTF and a lot of the mturk lists, I wasn't familiar with TO until last evening; now I see the requestor has horrible ratings across the board.  So, any advice on how to pump back up my approval rating? Some 1 cent HITS that take a second to do would be the best I suppose?   Exactly what the title says. I am still new to using SB, and I've been looking into ways to get it to run automatically (experience with *nix, so I've had some ideas but was hoping to find something canned). I have seen lots of posts about SB not running correctly in daemon mode on OSX ML, but most of the posts are a year+ old. Is this still an issue? Looking through the changelog didn't have any clues.   Hi everyone. I have been going nuts trying to solve this. I want to use Rosetta stone on a mac mini, which sits in my entertainment center functioning as a HTPC. To do this, I need a wireless sound input device. I don't need sound output - I am using the HDMI port and outputting sound directly to my TV. That all works fine. I just can't find a wireless input solution. I have tried an old pair of Dell BH200 bluetooth headphones which used to work just fine for this purpose 3 years ago, but apparently the bluetooth stack is less versatile now.  I had my job purchase me a plantronics M165 bluetooth headset, and it does pair properly with the mac. But the aggressive power saving that it uses causes the microphone to stop working after 2-3 seconds of silence. So, when rosetta stone attempts to open the sound input channel (repeat the word after me sort of situation), it suddenly sees the device as offline. Approximately half the time, it causes rosetta stone to freeze up, or spit out an error and force close.  I don't know what to do. Apple has been no help whatsoever on this. The only wireless microphones I can find that aren't bluetooth cost well over 150$ and are designed for conferencing.  All I have been getting are suggestions to use a USB mic, or a wired mic. That will be incredibly messy in the living room (the last thing I need is another wire in the entertainment center, especially one that can stretch across the entire room). Is this really such a weird use case?   Hey everyone. I recently purchased a late '12 Mac Mini to serve as a HTPC. So far, it has worked great. However one of the goals was to use it as a hub for family software and distance learning (stuff like Rosetta stone, and some distance language classes). The goal is to remain completely wireless (would you really want to be tethered by a wired microphone 3 inches from a 51" plasma screen? Those things get HOT!). I have an apple magic mouse, a logitech k760 keyboard and they both work great with bluetooth.  The issue is sound IO. I need sound to go out of the mac mini via HDMI to my TV. This works just great. But sound input? That's an issue. I haven't been able to track down a non-bluetooth wireless mic that is less than 150$. If I want to go below that, I have to use bluetooth. That's great, except apparently there are a ton of issues with the bluetooth stack in Lion and Mountain Lion, many of which directly impact bluetooth audio IO. I can pair a wireless headset in stereo mode, but the instant I try to activate the mic in the sound input pref pane, I receive a "your bluetooth device has encountered an error" dialog. This happens in both Mountain Lion and Lion.  Thinking it could be because I am using an older headset (3.5 whole years! a Dell Bh200 stereo headset), I had work order me a new bluetooth earbud - a plantronics a170 headset. This is the same one apple sells. I connect it to my mac and it works great - until I try to activate the mic. As soon as I do, spinning beachball, and then error.  Looking at the apple discussion forums, there are hundreds of threads about bluetooth issues (like this one: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3200456?start=0 tstart=0), but no comprehensive solution, and the overall consensus seems to be that the apple bluetooth stack is a cluster****.   Suggestions from apple geniuses were hilarious - "the bluetooth device is broken!" So I paired it with windows, a blackberry, and an android. "There aren't any known issues with the bluetooth stack in OSX." So I showed them several 20+ page discussions on their own discussion boards. "You aren't using an apple supported bluetooth device!" So I did the same demo with the Plantronics headset and showed them the place where it is sold on their site. "You need to purchase an iSite webcam with a built in mic!" Um, no. Bad fanboy, no skinnyjeans.  So, after much research, one of the suggestions was using an aftermarket bluetooth dongle, which should shut off the internal bluetooth adapter on the mac. Why would you want to do this? The internal bluetooth adapter has several key bluetooth device profiles missing in mountain lion and lion, like handsfree. An external adapter should include support for all of them. If that's true, it may resolve my issues.  The internal adapter is a Broadcom BCM20702. I'd like to use a 4.0 dongle for future-proofing, but the only known mac-compatible one I have found that isn't completely documented in Chinese is from IOGear. The chipset it uses? Broadcom BCM20702A0. So, same chipset, possibly a different firmware update. Most likely it will exhibit the same problems. There is also an iogear bluetooth 2.1+EDR but I can't find any explanation of the chipset. 2.1+EDR should work for the magic mouse, keyboard, and both of the bluetooth headsets, I just need to know that the devices won't have any issues pairing after coming out of sleep (it is a HTPC and needs to be easy for the fiancee to use, that includes devices waking up).  I am left with a ton of questions and almost no answers -  -Can I use a mono bluetooth headset JUST as a mic, while using the normal audio out for sound?  -If not, are there any wireless microphones available for less than 100$ that are known to work?  -Do you think the wireless dongle hardware will exhibit the same issues if I pick up the IOgear 4.0 one?  -Is there any way to add additional bluetooth profiles to the built in bluetooth adapter?  -Is this really THAT weird of a use case? Wireless audio input? Why is it this hard?  	145

 Awesome! thanks for the info!   I am looking for the telescope part for my K101 Mod. Long story short, silly me shredded the inside wall where my RBA screws in. Any ideas on where to get a new piece? Any help at all would be great!   Thank you for calling Lapras Prince Air the Avatar and not fucking Air Jordan. What kind of a damn nickname is Air Jordan. Stupid.   Laughed way too hard at this   AMAZING. Now I have to rewatch some of the old episodes to reminisce, i am so excited   Carolina    You are right it does have 10 legs. Just a bit of background info, I was on my deck smoking a cig and I happened to spy a black spot on the ground. Came across this god forsaken creature.      Could not stop laughing. Bravo   Ah!! crazy bones! i had the jaws ones all the way on the far left!!   I'm late but, fuck me genious  	11

 Then dumb laws should be thrown out. Florida it is illegal to wear a mumu. I know other states have dumb laws that haven't been removed but are not enforced. This is obviously an attack on the Obama administration and political theater. Yes we should enforce laws but cherry picking just marijuana because it is the "hot" topic in the news is a little....... #icouldbewrong #whatdoiknow   So they block a bill that would help veterans because they want to stir up some shit that could potentially send kids to war again. Hmmmmmm...  Not enough blood?   Went to Iraq in 03 and 04. now that the dust has settled, a day doesn't go by that I realize how they used me for something other than what I thought I was fighting for. I was young and naive, I hope the guys out there are at least better informed.       I took a mysticism class in college and my professor made us read the Tao of Pooh. Simple read. I concluded that life really is that easy and our perception of life is one of the most (if not the most) important things. Also as a bonus, we are here to learn and have fun.   	5
 It has embodied the soul of mario.   Possibly dumb question but I've never figured it out: How does one download a fan edit? It doesn't seem like links are openly available.

And I've heard so much about A Brief History of Time, I'll try to grab a copy. Thanks.   Hi guys, I posted this. I've been having some very grown-up thoughts lately. I'm 20 years old, and I've been an atheist as long as I can remember. I, like what seems like most people on the internet, always thought that religion is stupid.   This year, I've been revisiting some of my ideals. I became obsessed with space after watching 2001, the Cosmos, Contact, and Interstellar. The way I viewed the universe started to change. Are the scriptures all just gypsies and fairies, or is there any truth to be found? What is beyond the universe, and why did we come into existence? It's almost like I went full circle with my beliefs. Concepts that always seemed impossible to me now make more sense than ever. Marijuana and the art of film has given me a newfound spirituality. Pi and The Last Temptation of Christ gave me remarkable insight into what religion actually could mean. I thought that believing in God was close-minded. Now I wonder: is being an atheist the real close-mindedness? Shutting out all religious ideas doesn't seem 100% logical to me.   So tell me: ***Does God Exist?*** Has anyone else struggled with their sense of religious identity before? If anyone has any good science to bring to the discussion, that'd be great. Think philosophically, atheists. What lies beyond? Nothing? What could lie beyond? Could our consciousness transcend this dimension into another? Could extraterrestrial life be our biblical "God"?   Thank you! (I love having my mind blown!) :)   Does God Exist? *Could* a God Exist? I'd love mature opinions on the subject.   Hi guys, I asked the question.

       There is post offering a bitcoins and I am dumbfounded. Some think it's good  and some think it's more of an insult to give a starving family 26 cents.  I do not want this subreddit to be a place where  responses to real problems are answered in pennies. But I admit I am totally ignorant to all of this.  What do all think about this? Please help me. I am clueless to all of this. Does this really offer any real assistance or is it just an insult to those in need? I know every penny counts but we are interested in real solutions, not making people beg for scraps.   It may be a solution to a small sector of people who are into this but is it really something for the /r/assistance community?  Please give me your opinions and advice.          After the McDaniel loss last night, I hear all this talk about how pissed the Tea Party is and how they want to split from the party. But as an outside observer,  I'm find myself confused and really can not tell the difference between the two. They have voted the same in all congressional votes. Basically no no and no and yes on Obamcare repeal.  I mean what is really the difference between the two. I just don't see it. One may talk crazier than the other but they both vote for the exact same things.  What is the actual  difference when it comes to how each of them vote or what they stand for?              I mean your really honest and candid comments.      I can't justify paying $16 a month just for these two shows. Is there another way I can still see them.

I just changed my browser to Chrome and now when I click a link to an image here on reddit the picture is huge. I have to shrink it manually to see what it is.  It's obvious one of my settings somewhere is doing this. Can you tell me what setting I need to change to make these pictures appear a normal size without having to shrink it manually each time?            I have a good friend who is losing his sight. I'm looking to get information about devices that will allow him to still use his computer. Any suggestions on which subreddit to post in?            They seem to have made anything and everything Obama does some sort of act of Satan. To me the question is not if they will, but how they will.   How long do you think people are going to continue and fall for this obvious smear campaign?  As of now there hasn't been anything. But I'll bet you I can come here two days from now and that will not be the case.   ----------------------  **EDIT:** (2 hours later)  Well that didn't take long:  http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/06/17/3449917/fox-news-suggests-obama-captured-benghazi-suspect-to-boost-hillarys-presidential-prospects/   Just got Showtime free for three months. So I want to watch all the good shows while I can. But the earlier seasons aren't playing at the moment. I even checked On Demand. Can I watch them in any order?            I want to send out some personal thank yous to folks that contriibuted to the Baes fund raiser. There was a link to click on the first donation that allowed me to do that. Now I can't seem to find it anymore. There are a couple of people I want to thank. How do I do that?            I will pay for your gas, buy you lunch and dinner and drinks if you want 'em.

Please for god's sake, tell me some new and better epileptic jokes.   When I put the key in my 2002 Doge Neon, it just spins and does not lock or unlock the car. I looked at videos online and took off the door panel. The cables going to the lock work perfectly. It's the actual part where you put the key in that isn't working.  I want to get it fixed but fear if I go to the dealer they will way over charge me for a simple job.  How would you smart guys here approach this problem. Or should I say how do you recommend someone like me approach it so I don't get over-charged hundreds of dollars for a simple problem?

But his condition has deteriorated to the point he can barley see the screen anymore. We keep in touch because his wife reads my messages and helps him compose the ones back to me.

Will their name still show up on their old posts and comments or will it say **"deleted"** under the part where it says who made the post or comment?  If they had been banned by the administrators, wouldn't their posts show up in light pink? I know the newer ones will but I'm not sure about the old ones.     It seems like the gay marriage ban is being struck down in one state after another. There is now a pending case in every single state that has a gay marriage ban. Should this trend continue and it eventually goes to the Supreme Court, how do you think the nation would react if they nullified every decision made by federal judge after judge in  making it clear the ban is unconstitutional? Of course it would be the usual 5-4 decision.                  **[T]his bill could prevent continued production of automobiles ...,  and is a threat to the entire American economy and to every person in America.**  Lee Iacocca, executive vice president of Ford Motor Company, in 1970, on why the government shouldnt regulate airborne contaminants that are hazardous to human health         Currently a user can initiate a modmail thread that all mods see and can participate in.   But a mod can only initiate a thread other mods can see. We don't have the ability to include another user in that conversation.   My reasoning behind this is when we have issues with a user, the mod has to send a personal message to them that only he and the user  see. It would be much more useful for all the mods to see and participate in it. That way all mods know what is going and can offer their input as well.   It would really help keep the mod team on the same page and for the user to not be singled out by one mod.  I know it can be done. It is exactly what happens when you ban a user. A message is sent from whoever banned the user to the user and to modmail that all the mods and the user can see and participate in.  I think this would help both the mods and the user. Everyone wins.  Thank you considering it. :D   I want to ask the administrators to add a tool that would help us. Basically a way we can send a mod message to a user that would start a mod thread all the mods could see.  Just like when you ban a user, that thread appears under the mod that sent it, but all the mods can see it and participate in it.  This way when we have an issue we need to communicate to a user, all the mods will see it and can participate in it. Current we can only do that when the user initiates the thread.    When you ban a user, it starts a mod thread that all the mods can see and also the person you banned. You have a mod thread with the user and the mods.  Is there a way to initiate that type of thread from a mod so all the mods will be in on something when we send messages to a user?   -------------  **Edit:** The title should read:   ***Is there a way to send a message...,***                                             I run /r/assistance and currently it is allowing users to submit linked posts. It never used to allow that. It is important to us that only text posts be allowed.  I have the box checked under subreddit settings to **text posts only.**  Yet it still gives users the option to make a linked post. We've been text post only for a long time now. I don't know how or why it is behaving this way.  Any guesses?  -------------------------  **Edit:**  Looks like timotab figured it out. It's only letting the mods do it. Thanks timotab!      I just want to know what I can site as reddit's readership. So about how many subscribers and maybe an estimate of their total readership.   I'm wondering if it's just me. I actually still have the little cog wheel button to change my settings, but all of the RES features have disappeared.   Is it just me or are the rest of you having the same problem?            I did this room addition last year for my brother's boss. It took several months and I developed a very special bond with their dog. I just heard they had to put him to sleep. I'm not super close to these folks but my brother told me his bosses' wife told him to make sure he let me know. I thought I would send something like flowers but I wasn't sure that would be appropriate. What do you think? Have any other ideas?                           I run /r/Assistance and I have a user that needs to communicate with someone right now because they are helping him with an urgent problem.  He made the post with a throwaway account but I have his other account too that he hasn't used for over a year. But now it says he has to wait five hours to sign in to either account. I've never heard of anything like this. Is there a reason they do this and is there anything I can do to help him get around this?                              I've talked with so many other people and no one but U-Verse subscribers in Anaheim (Fullerton) are being deprived of the game. This is the first time in LA sports history that two local teams are meeting head-to-head in a playoff and the most devoted fans are the only ones who don't get to see it.   And the only reason is we made the mistake of having U-Verse. ATT has really screwed us big time. I've called them and can't even get an explanation. They say it's because it's on a local channel which is a lie. It was during the regular season but not for the playoffs.  And it's not like there should be some contract dispute that doesn't allow it. DISH, Direct, Time Warner and everyone else but U-verse people get it.    -------------------------------  **EDIT:**  After spending two days on the phone being given every excuse in the world and finally being told it is just blacked for me, and there were no options for me to get it..., for some reason I am now getting it.

But I am watching the game right now.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpjFjsEdl4      The series of the year is being blacked out on my TV (Fullerton, CA) and ATT says it's because they have not negotiated a contract with NBCSN.

But more times than not, it is the girlfriend who is responsible for the cheating. Unless it's some case of rape, the girl is the one to blame. Why does he take it out on the other guy? Is this a leftover Neanderthal reaction?   Simple question I need answered because I am being harassed by my park manager because some birds I fed pooped in the pool. Do a couple birds pooping in a pool really present a health problem?  Edit: I'm talking about a couple ducks. Is it reason to shut down a pool?                                       I remember this song from long ago. When I google it all I get is a bunch of violent rap songs. This song is nothing like that. I think it's an acoustical guitar piece by a pretty famous artist from the 70s or 80s. And the song is not violent at all.   The lyrics may be "turn on the news o see who's shooting who" or "tune in the news to see who's shooting who."                                 All of a sudden it takes a couple seconds for the keystrokes and mouse clicks to show up on the screen after I enter them.  I have done malware and virus scans. No help there. I have defragemented, and I still have all kinds of space left on my computer. It also doesn't register anything after I get six or seven characters ahead. So I have to type five ore six letters and then sit and wait for it to catch up. And even then some of the words I typed aren't there.   It is extremely irritating.

I need to find her some shows she will like.  She has watched nothing but NCIS   Dateline. Keep in mind how difficult it is to get her to do anything new. So nothing too complicated and/or hard to get into. Got to be something she will like from the get go.         When Arizona was going to pass it, it was the lead story for over a week.

Here is the generic photo of the connection:  http://cloudfront.zorotools.com/product/full/1CNT9_AS01.JPG  It is a 4" to 2"  I would like to fix this without having to replace the piece above. I just need to get that one or two inch piece out of that fitting so I can put a new pipe in there. Someone  told me to chip it out with a screwdriver but I am afraid I will break the female part in the process.  Another person said there might be some kind of drill bit that looks like a spade that I can use to drill it out. I have no idea what it is called or if it even exists.  At this point I'm not sure how to proceed. I was hoping for some suggestions on how to chip or drill it out with more ease and without breaking the female part of the fitting.

Here is the generic photo of the connection:  http://cloudfront.zorotools.com/product/full/1CNT9_AS01.JPG  It is a 4" to 2"  I would like to fix this without having to replace the piece above. I just need to get that one or two inch piece out of that fitting so I put a new pipe in there. Someone  told me to chip it out with a screwdriver but I am afraid I will break the female part in the process. But at this point I'm not sure I have any other alternative. That is unless you folks out might have one. Or maybe have some suggestions how to chip it out with more ease and without breaking the female part of the fitting.   ----------------------------  **EDIT**  Off the advice of a redditor, I used a rubber tee with a clamp and it fit over the female part of the coupling.

 Technically he was already the 44th President. His election was 4 yours ago.   They're raping Indie.      Whats funny is these kids probably use Reddit and will think they are cool for being on the top of the front page.      What you didn't see is he is really jumping over a commoner.    It could...If the neighbours don't open the door to give you sweets then you huff and you puff and you Fus Ro Dah their house down.    On a lighter note, I really enjoyed the graphic artist. Maybe he should further his career then follow a shallow path...oh god i'm going to hell.   That cat loves pot.   "When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold" is one of the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard and probably will be to date.

 I'm a huge fan of the Sennheiser MKH 50, very warm sounding and not a lot of ceiling noise.  But I know the Oktava MK-012 is very good too and much cheaper.  Both are good, but I think the MKH 50 will take you further.    I am a location sound mixer, and Me66 isn't bad, but I will almost always reach for a 416 first.  The 416 is really the industry standard for shotgun mics, so if you are planning on building up a kit it is a far better investment than a Me66.  And absolutely get a 302 or better to use with either mic as the H4n simply will not get you the best audio quality from those mics.  Good luck!        	4

Just woke up and I overslept. :(   Yeah, I live nearby. About a 10 minute drive.  I'm not sure on the history, all I know is that the area used to be a landfill, and the hut he was near was a sewage control   'taters.  Poh-tay-toh.   I get weird shit like this happening to me all the time. Usually, I'm at home when stuff decides to come out and play, but last night, it picked the perfect moment to scare the living bejeezus out of me.  The darker nights are rolling in sooner each night, and last night - it caught me totally off guard.  I'd been walking the dog down a reclaimed landfill site, and up until recently, it had been perfectly light enough to take a nice brisk walk up and down the entire length of the area (a good 3 miles or so.) But last night, the darkness got there before I did.   I'm too stubborn to call it off and go walk on a nice lit pathway with the dog. So I pulled out my torch and set off walking.  This pathway is completely covered by trees. Only letting cracks of light in between the leaves. It gives off a very creepy atmosphere.  It was a very cloudy night, anyway. Not much bright moonlight to go by.  Anyway, I'm going off the point here. I'm walking along this big long dirt path, and I can hear rustling in the trees on either side of me. My dog isn't stopping to check - so I assume it's probably some little squirrels or something. In retrospect, what the hell made me think squirrels would roam at night?   So I'm a little edgy, but the dog doesn't seem to care, so I carry on.  I'm about a mile into the walk, and I approach what I've dubbed "The Creepy Hut."  This creepy looking building is an old sewage control building. The old iron door is still attached, but the doorway behind it is bricked up. the old brickwork a much darker, redder colour than the freshly placed doorblock bricks. During the summer, the plant life around it goes wild and obscures it from view, ivy growing on its old roof- hanging off the edges, and grass almost as tall as me surrounding it.  But it's just starting to get into autumn, and the grass is wilting, and the ivy is getting brown.  The place reeks of rotting stuff all year round, but today the stench seemed awfully stronger than usual.   I covered my face with my coat, shone my torch over the old hut and froze.  There was a person in front of the old iron door. He was slouched, slightly. Looking like he was breathing heavily. Or laughing. I wasn't sure - I was too far away.  My dog had seen this, and he'd also stopped dead in his tracks, staring at the strange man in front of the door. His ears were high, tail curled upwards.  The man slowly started turning around. I aimed the torch at his torso, so that the light would slightly illuminate his face. Don't want to blind him!  Bad idea. His face was lit up sort of like when you used to shine the torch under your chin at camp, telling spooky stories. Except this time the man's face was half rotted. He had the shit-eating grin spread right across his face. He slammed this big iron door shut with his left arm, and I swear it took a brick or two from the bricked up doorway with it.   (Note: This door is heavy as hell. I tried moving it a few months back after taking some pictures of the place, and it was very hard to move, even with all 220lbs of me behind it.)  I just turned back towards the car and ran. Dog had the same idea - He barrelled past me, barking his head off. I didn't want to turn around and see what the man was doing, but curiosity got the better of me. I quickly turned and began backpedalling, and he was just stood where I was - on the pathway. I could see his shape in the limited moonlight, Hunched over.  That was it. I ran the mile back to the car, unlocked it on the run, opened the door, threw myself in and locked it behind me. Turned the engine and lights on, and turned the car to face where I had come from. The high beams on my car headlights weren't enough to pierce all the way through the trees, but I would at least be able to see him coming. Nothing.   The Dog had barrelled into the car right beside me, so I just took off home.  I swear he was stood at the gate to the car park on my way out. Waving. Like he'd hoped I'd come back soon.  No chance, mate.  I have pictures of both outside and inside this place if anyone wants them   "Oop Norf" with the English Flag, if you please!   I can't even comprehend.  WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING   You ain't no Boltoner! :I Everyone I've ever known says Breakfast, Dinner, Tea.   Oi!   That just sounds weird.   It's a barm, you fools!   Indeed. You always hear of "This is the new MMO - it will surely kill WoW this time!"   Rather than attempting to just usurp WoW off the MMO Throne, it'd be cool if the devs could try and concentrate on an original concept for an MMO, rather than the run of the mill 3rd person action-y RPG.  It works, but sometimes you just need something new. And with everyone developing these kind of games, there's not that much difference between the lot of them.   Makes the whole market stale.   Yeah, I dunno either. [](/ppshrug)      Hey.  Sorry if I did anything wrong. Whatever I did - I didn't mean it. Was it the distance?  Wanna grab a beer if I'm ever nearby?   You're getting it!

I crashed my car about a week and a half ago, and I'm currently suffering from whiplash, a sprained wrist, and a bad back.  It's easing off a little bit, and the pain only hits me bad when I lean over, or move my wrist a little too suddenly (That's with my painkillers, though)  Is there any kind of swimming technique I could use to sort of get back in the water, or would you guys advise staying out for a few more weeks? I miss having my after work swim. :(       Little late on the posting, but hey.  There were about 15 of us in Birmingham city centre on saturday. We invaded a pub, talked (quite loudly) and received ponies.   Then we went on a march to somewhere, which involved walking past a big church while playing Pony music through an iPod dock speaker. That was kinda weird.  Then we went through the city shopping centre, waving a flag and singing Winter Wrap Up. That was kinda surreal.  Then we found a shop which sold pony merch, and we acquired more pony.  In short..  [](/soawesome) BEST. DAY. EVER   I don't get it. You're toeing the line as it is by driving with no insurance, yet you drive like a lunatic.  You drove down the wrong side of a road, leading into a junction, then you pull out of said junction (It had Give Way signs!) without looking while I'm coming down the main road. Smashy.  I've got a burn up my left arm, a big-ass cut up my left arm and now I think the whiplash is deciding to make itself known. Shoulders and back are achey, and my neck hurts to turn. I thought I was having a heart attack on scene, the airbag went off right into my chest and the pain wouldn't go for about 5 minutes.  Luckily (unfortunately for the company I work for, though) I was working at the time and I was using a van. My little car wouldn't have stood a chance and I might have been seriously injured now.   This happened last night, so I can remember pretty much everything in vivid detail. I've probably had about 3 hours sleep.  It was a relatively normal day. I'd gotten back from walking the dog a few hours ago. I walk him on the site of an old landfill, now cleaned up and is a popular horse riding trail. I usually head off the path after heading past an old and abandoned sewage control building, as to not disturb any riders with my very excitable Border Collie.  I was walking among the trees, alone, when I heard the fallen branches behind me snapping, like someone was walking on them. I turned around expecting to see someone walking behind me - there was no-one there.   Putting it down to my imagination, I carried on walking along the woods. The sounds continued all the way along the woods, only stopping when the ground cleared up.  I thought nothing of it, until last night.  It didn't start off so bad, just the odd footstep here or there. I live in a old house, creaks are expected. But then 1am happened. My door (which is kinda sturdy) was closed. The handle turned and it flung open, slamming into the desk I was sat at.   Expecting to see my mischievous little sister there, I stood up and poked my head out of the door.   *"What'd you do--"*   There was no-one there.  The floor outside my room is creaky, I'd have heard her running off. I shook my head, closed my door - locked it - and carried on with what I was doing.  about 10 minutes later, I was about to grab my glass and take a drink. It slid along the desk, away from me. I stared at it for a second or two, wondering if my mind is just seriously messing with me.  Then it just fell over.   I'd had it with my room, I was going to go downstairs to watch a bit of TV, and hang out with my dog.  I got downstairs and he was sat right at the door to the stairs, whining quietly. He saw me open the door and wagged his tail furiously. He's normally sleeping on the rug at this time. He must have heard the glass fall over and got spooked.  I eventually ended up asleep on the couch around 3am, BBC news playing quietly in the background, but my dog was still staring at the stairs door.  It was about 5:30am when I woke up. I cursed myself for falling asleep on the couch when there was a perfectly good bed upstairs. I turned around and someone was stood there. At first, I thought it was my mum, coming to check on me, after a few seconds on refocusing it was my Nan.   My still half-asleep brain relaxed a little - then it hit me - my Nan had been dead for 3 months - She died in July. I faced both my phobias in one day to attend the funeral of the woman who had cared for me all my life.  I freaked out. I sat up, and threw myself over the arm of the couch. Running into the kitchen, I heard scrambling right behind me. I opened the knife drawer and pulled one out and switched to a defensive position.    It was just my dog following me frantically into the kitchen whimpering and whining.  I threw some water over my face from the sink and slowly popped my head around the corner, back into the living room. No-one there. I got a torch from the back room and used it to navigate my back up to my bedroom.  (Woah, that was long. That's what happened to me last night.)             Stranger: youjizz  Stranger: ah ah ah  You: wait, what?  Stranger: ......................  Stranger: you jizz  You: .. yes, I can jizz, what of it?  Stranger: me too  Stranger: ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ............ sweet you jizz   I'm going to a funeral in a week, and I have this horrible, overpowering fear of graveyards. This is the first funeral I've ever been to, and I don't want to have a mental breakdown on the graveside.  Apolgies if it's in the wrong subreddit, I tried searching for a phobia/fears sub, but my searches went unsucessful. :(   Edit:[Got one]  Would be much appreciated if you could get me one!            Hey all! This is my second story on here. I have a few more, completely nonrelated to each other. I might post them if I can remember the details. Anyway, here goes;  I was 18, I'd passed my driving test about 6 months ago, and we were in the city, playing video games at the Gamerbase, in Manchester, under the HMV.  It was about 10:30 when we left the place, and started the walk back to the car.   It was an unremarkable walk, nothing to report, just me and my friends talking about whatever came to mind. Mostly video games.  We got to the car, and the place was empty. Of course, it was 11pm on a sunday night, there won't be too many people about. We got in the car and set out.  We must have hit the East Lancs road about 11:15. We're driving down the road, still talking. I was concentrating on the road. I was still a newbie after all.  The exit for Bolton was coming up, I took it and started speeding up on the motorway. I hit 60MPH on the long straight road. I saw a small movement in the distance. A low hanging tree brance, maybe. I carried on.  Suddenly, a young girl dashed out and lept over the safety barrier. I slammed the brakes, but I couldn't stop in time, there wasn't a chance.   Her legs buckled from the bumper hitting her.   Her side hit the bonnet, I saw her body twist, and her face slammed into my windshield. I don't think I've been any closer to losing my mind than I did at that moment. Her face was crushed against the hard glass.   But she had this... Grin which shook my spine like an earthquake. I was so very tempted to just leap out of my car right at that moment. I kept my cool, and got the car to a stop. (albeit, in the middle of the road, but still)  I opened my door and lunged out of the car and took off up the road to help the person I'd just mowed down. My friends scrambled into action, They thought I'd lost it and chased me up to road to stop me. 2 stayed behind to push the car into the hard shoulder.  I was stunned. I only ran a few meters before stopping. There was nothing there. No body, no blood. Only my skid marks in the road.   I was so certain of what I saw. My friends took me back to the car and we sat outside it for a while. My car was clean. No blood, no dents, no cracked windows.   Nothing.    I was certain for days I had gone mad.               [Original!](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/h5rd5/bricked_up_doorway)  [Got an album in here](http://imgur.com/a/Bn6yE#63vOa)  [Picture the album upload seemed to miss](http://i.imgur.com/vF7gD.jpg)   It had absolutely lashed it down with rain last night, so I was lucky I didn't drop my phone (Yeah, my phone has a 12Megapixel camera in it) with the amount of slipping I was doing. On the approach, it absolutely reeked of rotting stuff. I can't pin it, it was just unholy and had to cover my face, otherwise I'd have emptied my lunch all over the wall.  I took two pictures of the interior and started getting the serious heebie-jeebies, and the smell was starting to penetrate of waterproof coat, so I hightailed it outta there.  Enjoy!  (Sorry for the slight confusion. I messed up with my postings.)         I played pretty seriously back in WotLK, and participated in a realm second Lich King Heroic 10 Man.  Since Cataclysm's release, I've stepped back a little bit and not played as seriously. I've had a lot of jip from guild members and been branded as if I'm in for the loot.  This is by no means a description of me. I'm far from it.  I play the game as what it's meant to be. A Game. I don't care for loot, or who goes into raids instead of me - I know what it's like to be a raid leader, it's a pain in the arse to find a right setup.  I like to Roleplay, but by no means is it a requirement for me. I'm willing to transfer to any realm on the EU rack.   [Here's](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/nagrand/zeifer/simple) my main character - a hunter - on the armoury.   I will be transferring my level 43 hunter over, though. I still have a few friends on my current server and I wouldn't like to lose most contact with them. (I'm currently on Nagrand EU)  I will be able to level this up in a week or 2, though.  I would prefer Horde too, so I wouldn't have to cough up for a Faction Transfer also.  I know it's a long shot, but I hope to hear back from interested people. :)      Just shortlisting places I can go for a holiday that's a bit Far-Flung from the UK.  What kind of things is there I can do that a little off the beaten track?  I've had a look around the Canada tourism sites, just wondering if there's much else that could be of interest!  Edit: Derp. Typos.         First nosleep post. I've had a couple of freaky experiences where I live right now, I'm on a lunch break at work atm, so I've only got the time for one, so here goes. :)  It was a warm summer night. Unusually warm for northern england, even in the middle of summer.  I was sleeping with no covers over me, just wearing my boxer shorts.  I must have woke up around 3am, lying on my side, greeted by the sight of my black wallpaper. I sighed heavily, knowing I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep now. Hah! If only I knew!  I slowly turned onto my back, to face the roof. I expected to see my Alchemy Gothic "Devil take the Wyrm" poster right above me. What I saw instead curdled my blood, yet I couldn't bring myself to do anything.  A disembodied head, gnarled features. Missing an eye. His other eye, bright red staring right back at me.  He grinned. His teeth (those which were left, anyway) were a horrible shade of yellow.   The light coming from the side of me illuminated his face with a pale blue glow. I slept that night with the curtains open, I regretted it right at that moment, it made everything so much spookier.  Time seemed to freeze for what felt like an eternity. I couldn't move, it was like he had me pinned down.  And then he vanished.  I heard a car squeal its brakes in the distance, then an engine roar.  I didn't sleep for days afterward, fearing he would visit again when I wasn't expecting him.         Hey Doggit!  Just thought I'd ask, as my dog's been doing this for years and I'm curious as to why he'd be doing it;  Everywhere I walk my dog, he'll stop, sniff and start licking something he finds interesting. Be it a plant, the concrete floor, a wall, tree stump. Anything. He doesn't do it at home though, which is strange.  I find this slightly weird, and all google searches only really come up with dogs licking carpets at home.  If it helps any, he's a Border Collie, about 8 years old now.            Was supposed to arrive at work at 8:30am this morning, but never turned up after setting off at 7:50am.  I recieved a text off him at 8:10 saying one word: Adios. Police have been contacted, and his phone is turned off.  May have gone to the Lincoln area.  If you see him, please contact Greater Manchester Police on 0161 872 5050 quoting the Log number 551, on the 8th March 2011.  About 5'11, medium length hair - brown, has a spidery-like fringe, has a few weeks of beard on him.  May be wearing Barry Bennett Ltd work shirt, but may have changed clothes.  **Edit: Call off the search! We found him. He was wandering the streets looking completely lost.**      When I first talked to one of my friends over there via skype, I heard a little squeal when I said "Hi." It's almost unnerving, would I be violated if I came over and started talking?      I'm 18 stone (252 pounds) and I'm 6 foot 1, I'm 21 and I'm pretty sure I seriously need to start losing weight, fast.  I've taken up Rock Climbing and am doing that once a week, and I'm starting to eat less junk and more healthy stuff.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to exercise that will drop the fat from me in the best way, I'm coming up with Running or Swimming, but I'd thought I'd ask you guys for some help. :)  Edit: Thanks for the tips folks, I gotta dash, break at work is over. I'll read up when I get home!  Edit2: Wow! Thanks for all the replies, I looked through all of them and I appreciate all your advice. :) Thanks a lot! It'll help!   I live up north in England. Ask Me Anything! :D  	109

 Written by Kenneth Kohl (kowale). This is a long read that began as a single short story (Part 1). More parts of the series were provided and it was eventually combined into one large work. The Remover has gathered a considerable fan base since its original posting, and has since been incorporated into a full-length novel of the same name. What follows are the original posts that appeared here on Creepypasta Wiki.   Part 1  When I left my office, I already had a premonition that something awful was going to happen that evening. Im not psychic. I am quite perceptive, though, and the signs were easy to read. I had worked late  nine oclock and already dark  and my ordinarily enjoyable walk to the parking lot struck me as a little bit menacing. I parked in a lot that was about a ten minute walk from my office. In the early evening on a crisp autumn day its a pleasure to stroll there and take in the sights of downtown Indianapolis. Occasionally Id take a detour and walk along the canal, checking out the street art. This was past nightfall, though, and right in the middle of a hot and humid August. There were only two sorts of people in downtown Indy that night  those who had to be, and those who had no place else to go.  My walks always took me past the Wheeler Mission. There was a flashing neon sign reminding me that Jesus Saves every ten seconds. The mission was a magnet for the homeless. A lot of my sort of people ended up there, but some others as well. Addicts, mentals, criminals on the run and looking for a meal and a place to stay. According to the missions rules felons were usually turned in, so the police visited regularly. None of the citys finest sitting outside that night; just a collection of bums waiting to scam some loose change off of whoever happened to be out on this humid night.  One of the panhandlers called out to me. Hey! Can I talk to you sir? Can I ask you a question? Are you afraid of homeless people? He was young, maybe pushing thirty. He was clean-shaven and had a number of tattoos running up his arms and neck and ending just shy of the bottom of his dirty red baseball hat. The design hinted at a former stay in prison.  Every one of them always has a story. Its typically well practiced and smooth. A bum tells his story so many times that he begins to believe it himself. He gets into his character and will debate at length on the subject of why he needs money. The stories can get quite elaborate and sometimes amusing, if you have the time. But unless you want to be followed all the way back to your car or to the door of your office its best to just say No or Sorry. That night, I was feeling antsy and just wanted the conversation to end quickly, so I opted for Fuck you.  Red Hat responded in kind. At first he stopped in his tracks, looking sort of stunned. Then he started following me. You think youre better than me? Dont you walk away from me. Then he grabbed at the back of my shirt. Thats when I knew for sure that things were going to end badly.  I shrugged him off. I could have easily outrun him at that point, but I didnt. I dont know if it was pride or arrogance; or if it was due to the fact that I was tired, irritable and in an excessively bad mood. I did start walking faster, though. I hoped that he would tire of the game and go back to his roost outside the mission. I hoped that the situation wouldnt go any further.  Then I saw a chance to end the game. There were two routes to my car  one being along a well lit, albeit virtually deserted street and the other a slightly shorter route through a small alley behind the Robertson Parks church. I aimed myself toward the alley. I could still hear Red Hat shouting behind me, but I was doing my best to ignore him. Where you going man? Stop! I want to talk to you, he said. I had a pretty good idea that when he saw me heading towards the alley, he thought that he had me beat. How stupid did he think I was? I knew that once we were alone, Id have the upper hand. I could either disappear into the shadows or, if necessary, kick his ass. What I didnt know, however, was that he had a couple of friends waiting for him.  They must have seen us head off and circled around the block. Its like they were expecting me to walk through that alley. For them, it was the perfect place for an ambush. Ill have to admit that I was startled when I first saw them. I had allowed myself to get too distracted. Not only by Red Hat, but by the anxiety that Id been experiencing since leaving my office. The two buddies, dressed similarly and tattooed like Red Hat, stood at the far end of the alley. In addition to seeing their silhouettes I could smell them from where I stood. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw them. Red Hat closed the distance behind me and pushed me further into the alley. Then the other two approached and boxed me in.  One of them pushed me and laughed. What now, Chris?  Now we teach this little shit how to respect people, Red Hat replied.  I had backed up against the wall of the church. Trust me guys. Bad idea, I said.  The one who had previously been quiet came forward and shoved me  hard  back into the wall. I remember feeling the back of my head bounce off the brick. Then he punched me in the stomach. As he drew back his arm to get ready for another swing, my arm flew out and I grabbed his head, palming his face like a basketball. I pushed backward and twisted his head as he fell. Thats when I saw Red Hats knife.  Red Hat had drawn his arm back as if he were going to pitch a softball underhand. He had the point of the knife aimed at me. He lunged, but I managed to grab his wrist and deflect his thrust. At this point I could no longer see the first of his two buddies  the first to punch me - but the other one landed another blow directly to my nose. That diverted my attention long enough for Red Hat to bring his knife around for another attempt. A thousand thoughts were racing through my mind. How could I have let myself get drawn into that situation? Why did they pick me? Why that night? How was it going to end? How was I going to handle the cleanup after it was over?  Between all of the distractions and the surprise punch to the face, I must have missed seeing the knife until the last moment. It sunk deep into me. Low, directly below my ribs and angled upward into the place where a normal man would keep his liver. The guy had been in fights before. He was a pro. I felt pressure, but not any actual pain.  Then I felt myself becoming very hot and my vision faded to white.  *****  When the numbness went away, I surveyed the scene in the alley. One of the guys  the one who managed to land a punch on my face  was running around the corner of the church screaming. Around me, there was blood all over the ground and even sprayed up onto the wall of the church. The guy whose face I had grabbed was lying prone nearby, his head cocked at an unnatural angle. His neck was clearly broken. It was Red Hat who surprised me most. He was lying at my feet eyes open, mouth frozen in a perverse smile, and throat ripped open. He looked like hed had a date gone bad with a table saw.  And all I could think of was how long it had been since Id last eaten. Part 2  Dear R.,  I can no longer trust my own decisions. As you hear my story you will understand why. Right now, it will be enough to say that I cant focus, my thoughts are racing, and my emotions are taking over. Im in no condition to make the sort of decision thats necessary, and so Im asking for your help.  Im putting my unconditional trust in you. In order for that to happen you have to trust me entirely  and the only way that can happen is if you know the truth.  At this point I have no doubt that you believe Im insane and you might be right, to a point I believe that youll hear me out, though; if for no other reason than to find out how far gone I am. I sincerely believe that by the time Ive said what I have to say, youll believe me  if not before then.  Since others are involved, Im putting their lives in your hands, too. You must never repeat this to anyone. Im laying a great burden on your shoulders; but you owe me. I dont need to remind you why.  Just about every form of life begins in an embryonic stage. Interestingly, when we are in our embryonic stage we have two hearts. Two hearts! Can you believe that? This heart primordia, as its called, eventually fuses together into one heart with four chambers. Embryologists at the University of Indiana performed an experiment in the 1930s in which they kept the heart primordia from fusing in embryonic frogs. Amazingly, the frogs grew up with two hearts. They had extensive genetic damage, though, and didnt live very long.  But imagine for a moment that the same thing happened in nature, with greater success. Imagine that the heart primordia never fused in the embryo of an otherwise ordinary man. He could theoretically develop two hearts. Not that farfetched - humans have many redundant organs: two lungs, two kidneys, two eyes.  Are you with me so far?  The body is a system and that system normally runs at full capacity, so the addition of a second heart alone wouldnt make much of a difference. But there is an added potential. Suppose that this new creature (and I call it that because now weve taken a leap of faith and are no longer talking about your unremarkable homo sapiens) also develops a system that can exploit this additional power plant, much in the same way that an athlete can train his body to function at higher levels. It would require larger lungs, or perhaps even a third lung to provide additional oxygen. Other organs might be affected, altered, enhanced or even eliminated. The end result would be a creature possessing unimaginable strength, speed and endurance.  You can see where Im going with this, cant you? Such creatures do exist. This is as much of a fact as the sky is blue. I not only believe it, but I can prove it  will prove it  to you, in due time.  I wish that I was there with you now, so that I can more accurately gauge your reaction. Ill have to rely on your inquisitive nature and assume that youll continue reading. Since Ive told you this much already, I may as well elaborate further.  God, in all his goodness, had gone so far as to create these beings. Then Mother Nature threw in her own cruel little trick. You see, that second heart needs a way to get vital oxygen and nutrients to cells; and that way is through blood. Plasma to carry nutrients and red cells to carry oxygen. Blood is produced in bone marrow and spleen. An average, healthy man is blessed with just enough blood-producing tissue to sustain him. These creatures, however, being approximately the same size dont have the ability to produce any more blood cells than a normal man. Yet their two hearts continue to feed their bodies in overdrive. Left in that state they would literally starve or suffocate.  Nature is also forgiving. Taking advantage of their physical mutation, they have the ability to absorb plasma and red cells from the ingestion of the blood of other living creatures. The mechanism by which this works is too specific to go into. It wouldnt interest you anyway. Not at this point.  And so these pseudo-men have evolved, exploiting their superhuman strength and abilities to become the perfect hunter  after all, other living creatures arent too keen on the idea of donating their own blood to sustain the lives of these things. I call them things because thats what normal men consider them to be. Fiends. Monsters.  Im certain that you know what these creatures are. This fabulous, complex, species; homo sanguineous; no less Gods children than their human brothers; hated; abhorred have come to be called vampires.  But they are real. And I can prove it. Part 3  There comes a time in every vampire's seemingly endless life when he reaches an age at which he begins to question his choices, doubt his past actions, wonder what mistakes he will continue to make in his future. Call it a midlife crisis. At this point one of two things usually happens. A vampire can accept who and what he is, or he can go insane. The latter more often than not ends in some form of suicide.  Vampires are not truly immortal. I think that a more appropriate term would be un-mortal, if there were such a word. Immortal suggests that they live forever, and thats just one of many myths about vampires. They are not graced  or perhaps I should say cursed  with eternal life. But they do live a very, very long time. And that leads to the especially worst aspect of being a vampire. They are almost guaranteed to outlive every one they love  the human ones anyway. Think about it: having to experience the death of all of your friends, making new friends, and seeing them die also over and over and over again.  Its right around the time that they begin to lose their second generation of friends that they realize whats happened, and worse, that it will happen again. Think about that for a moment, and take my word for it that no matter how many funerals youve been to it doesnt ever get any easier. It helps to believe that theres an afterlife.  Having your friends die off is only one of the things that a vampire will think of when he hits this age. He begins to think of all the things hes missed out on. Sometimes hell choose to never enter a relationship with a human because he fears what will eventually happen. Then hell wonder if he made a mistake by deciding on following that path.  And then he thinks about what he is  what he truly is. What his base instinct and purpose in life is. He feels cheated that hes had to hide his true self for all of the years hes been alive and that hell have to continue hiding it. He feels resentful that hell never be able to do what he really craves, what he hungers after  to hunt  without restraint.  Fulfilling ones purpose in life is of ultimate importance to every man: vampire and human alike. A person with no aspirations has no reason to go on living. So what is a vampire to do? His core desire, his meaning of life, is considered morally repulsive. Isnt it? After living amongst humans for most of his life he takes on their values and most vampires agree with acceptable human opinion. How is it that older vampires can hunt so easily with no heaviness on their consciences? Its during this midlife crisis that they begin to sort things out.  Most vampires, like most mortals, can eventually come to grips with whom and what they are. Some turn to religion. Sometimes it takes a good psychiatrist or regular sessions with a therapist to help them out. For most vampires, this means that they must abandon their empathy with mortals ideas of morality. (Not implying that vampires do not have their own set of moral standards.) This greatly increases the contentment with which they can live out the rest of their lives.  The bulk of the remainder can never come to terms with what they are and can never accept what they need to do to achieve peace of mind. All of the inner turmoil eventually takes a toll on them body and soul. It breaks them. There are a lucky few that can recover after a breakdown but the rest end up in institutions or commit suicide. Even among those who are institutionalized some eventually end up killing themselves when they grasp the fact that a natural death and end to the pain is going to come very slowly.  And so the world ends up with a whole bunch of vampires who are either happy or dead. It might sound callous, but the truth is that only elder vampires are happy ones; and while the idea of a bunch of happy vampires living amongst them might not make humans feel completely at ease, its a whole lot better than the alternative.  You see every once in a while, one slips through the cracks. A vampire who goes mad but somehow ends up running loose like a kid in a candy shop. The most dangerous type of vampire that exists  perhaps even more feared than the Nosferatu  is a rogue.  So, how does one deal with a rogue? He must be disposed of. The question is How do you go about hunting the most perfect hunter that nature has ever produced?

I ordered a sample off their website and couldn't make it through more then a few bottles of water before I had a splitting headache. Red 40 will do that to you.    Yup. Some places I've gone to add some mint to the sauce, but I really don't like the taste of mint outside gum and some mixed alcohols.    I have that exact camera :D [http://i.imgur.com/YthFJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YthFJ.jpg)   [Super Shooter - Rip Slyme](http://youtu.be/Ivgva0XdV4E)    Killin' It with Paul Crik. I don't know what it is about him, but the amount of work he puts into his videos for the inexplicably low number of views, I find it really strange. [Link to Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/KillinItwithPaulCrik)   Thanks for pointing that out. I've been using the Spotify app in that shitty emulated phone view for weeks.   I lived in Japan for 15 years before moving to America. This really takes me back. Thanks for making it.   If you're willing to pay about $1 a month, you can download Paper Mache which lets you use Instapaper to download pages for offline viewing.    It's gotten incredibly common lately and should be easily found at any grocery store. But if for some reason you can't find any, you can buy regular plain yogurt and strain it with some cheese cloth and get the same result.      They're referred to as husband and wife. I don't know if there was a marriage ceremony between a real cow and bull, but symobically they are married.       I guess I'll be going with the free option. I've done a lot of the recommendations off HP's support forums to no avail. Was there a specific number you had to call for Touchpad support or was it just the HP support number?   Man. What a pain. I guess I'll just have to deal with having to carry headphones along with me wherever I go. Thanks for the info.   This is really annoying. The left speaker went out the day after I bought it but I just dealt with it since the right speaker was plenty loud enough for what I needed it for. Now my right speaker is out for some inexplicable reason. It had been working earlier in the day, but when I got home from work, the speaker had just stopped putting out sound. The sound works fine if I plug in headphones, but is a pain. Has anyone else had this problem and maybe fixed it themselves, or am I going to have to get in touch with HP Support in the hopes that they can either fix it or send me a replacement.    Tell me about it. I ordered 2 of them for my family and had them send me their money so I could mod and ship it to them. Now I have to keep my eye out for future sales so that I don't feel like I ripped them off. Still salty about the whole thing, but whatever. Good luck on future snagging one in the future though! Hopefully its not a repeat of this debacle.  *edit* Nevermind, apparently OnSale is just a shitty vendor that doesn't know how to limit their sales to their limited inventory.   Interested, but why is it called a FB454UT Smartbuy TouchPad?

 Jesus.   I didn't tell them anything that wasn't public knowledge.   But I won't respond to the idiots anymore.    Thank you.    There are two different types of mod-removal actions.   They are called "Spam" and "Remove".    Your comment [looks like this](http://imgur.com/ADoQdfa) too me.   Submissions have the same removal options.   If I click spam, it removes the comment and the spam filter learns that a moderator dislikes you and remembers that bit of info for future reference.     If I click remove, it just removes your comment but doesn't remember it for future reference.    As to what the spam filter learns in these *spam* cases, is open to question.   Does it key on your username? Or that I removed a comment with the phrase "shed some light on it"?   Not sure if it learns either of those things, both, or something else entirely.   From observations I have made, I think it's the third option. But even that's just a bit of a educated hypothesis.      Defeating Link redirectors is old hat.  The admins have blacked holed more than a few of them via the soft and hard domain ban lists they manage.   Of those that aren't 100% blocked by the admins,  There are some standard Automod rules that block a good number of the remaining redirect domains.    It specifically says "for this page may edit".  So that seems to be how it works.    The standard subreddit settings wiki-settings [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/h1SMc16.png), which says "Only mods, approved wiki contributors, or those on a page's edit list may edit", which is three separate classes.  If the second and third meant the same thing, I don't think they would both be mentioned.     Yes, it's possible to give a wiki-page in your sureddit different permissions than you default permissions.    [See this image](http://i.imgur.com/LhlhuPk.png).   Change the permissions on your page.   Just give some specific mods the rights to "only approved wiki contributors for this page may edit", and don't add any.   Mods will still be able to edit it, and since there is no one else on the access list for that specific page, regular subreddit approved submitters won't be able to edit it.     What if I want to used "Rule #6" for the list in the mod log, and drop a mod comment that says "I'm sorry, but we don't allow [insert domain name here] in /r/example_subreddit".      Rule #6 is meaningless to the user, and the later is too long for the mod log.   Also, sometimes mods don't want to tell the user it was removed at all.  As often we block domains that we view as always spam in all situations.   Since, by definition in this example, the  submitter is a spammer, we don't want to notify them that Automod had stopped them.   Sure, it's easy for people to figure it out if they know what to look for, but most spammers never actually bother to check.     So, if I don't want to communicate the information, I shouldn't be forced to communicate the information.     You aren't the only one excited by that.    Some moderators I'm sure are now feeling *fully functional*.     I was going to look that up.   But thank you, that made my job easier.   I only even thought of it after randoh12 mentioned it.   It's not a normal thing I use in Automod.      I mod several subreddits with extensive Approved Submitter lists.   Some run in the multiple thousands.   I don't think there is a limit.    I should mention that Automod does have the feature to block certain Youtube channels.   Similar to a domain block or a user Automod-ban.  I don't use that feature much, as most Youtube spammers I find use different channels all the time.   That's my experience anyway.     I'm a mod of /r/History.  So, trust me when I say this. But 16th Century Spain had way too many Papists for 1950's Birmingham to be comfortable with.   Really doesn't matter which Birmingham you might be talking about either.      You realize that 1950's Birmingham would have claimed they weren't 16th century Spain.     Yeah, it was a simple ~100 year period when Whites only did business with White owned businesses in the post-Civil War South.   That wasn't a long time at all.   The market will sort everything out.     That would be better directed to the mods of /r/AskReddit.   I don't see why not though.  But I don't use /r/AskReddit a lot either.     In the future, please don't use bot-accounts in /r/Help or similar subreddits.   Thank you.    I still have some down vote bots that follow me around from events from years ago.   Know this:  The bots votes look like the register, but they don't.  The admins have probably already shadow banned the bot.  The bot doesn't know that it's been caught and stopped.     I've discussed this topic with the admins, and they have a lot of counter measures in place when it comes to things like down vote bots.    Contacting The [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to let them know might be helpful for your peace of mind.  But as I already said, I'm sure they have already neutralized the idiot down voting you.   There are other subreddits one could ask questions at too.   /r/AskReddit and /r/Self both come to mind.    I removed it a few minutes ago.  See my other comment in this thread.    It's been removed.    The greater context is important.     For example, the 1952 and 1953 events with the Iranian Coup and Counter Coup are very complex.   Prime Minister Mosaddegh and the Shah were both going at each other hard.   Stalin has only very recently passed away.   Soviet Troops had occupied Northern Iran during WWII and had only pulled out a few years previously.   Also, even good histories often leave out that Ayatollah Khomeini supported the Shah in his show down with Mosaddegh.      Same problems with the later information about Iraq.     These are not unimportant details.   The blogspam glosses over all that.  Dare I say the author of it didn't even know about any of these details.    It's a shit piece and it's removed.       A better link would be [this one](http://www.dancarlin.com/product-category/hardcore-history/current-hardcore-history/).     I'm sorry, but your submission has been removed. This subreddit is specifically for tech support help with Reddit.    Try asking your question in /r/Gaming or a similar subreddit.    http://www.reddit.com/r/mod/about/log/?type=removemoderator mod=AutoModerator  Almost caused a panic attack when I first saw it.    You already told him to do that, Chtorrr.   It makes too much sense.  He wants to believe he's found a loophole.   He's going to get rich via this loophole, don't you know.     You don't want to believe the people who are telling you, fine.  Get banned.  I won't lose any sleep over you at all.    Good bye.    You are playing semitics games.   Sol Invictus and the former top mod of /r/Trees tried to play that game.   They were shoved off of reddit with extreme prejudice by the admins.      any form of compensation  Any form of compensation of any form of compensation.   If you don't like the rules, then don't be on Reddit.    No.    Several Northern Generals, including Winfield Scott, the man who tried to talk Robert E. Lee into leading the Union Army of the Potomac, were also from Virginia.   Scott didn't turn Traitor because he was actually a man of honor.   Can't say the same thing for Lee.      The Constitution of the Confederacy (mostly a cut and paste job from the original US version) banned states from ever banning slavery in the future.  They wanted to limit states rights to even consider removing slavery from their new attempted government.       Yeah, they were so in favor of states rights that they have to limit states rights.  By which I mean states rights was never part of what the Confederacy was about until long after they lost their treasonous war.    Normally it forces updates when you restart your browser too.    Because were not free if we aren't allowed to bully people into suicide.    Obviously.        Yup.   The Confederacy believed in States rights so much that their Constitution (mostly a cut and paste job from the original US version) banned states from ever banning slavery in the future.    Yeah, they were so in favor of states rights that they needed to limit states rights.     I would love to see the admins shadow ban anyone who criticizes Ellen Pao.   Cause those people are totally stupid and if they vanished, the average IQ of the Reddit userbase would increase by at least 40 points.     What I would like to see is the raising tide of Hate-Speech dealt with.   Holocaust Deniers, Neo Nazis, Homophobes, Ethnic and Religious Hate, etc.  Sites like Storm Front are actively trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit with their bullshit.   This is something that the Admin-team should be addressing as well.  As it often leads to groups of people who make throw-away after throw-away accounts to harass people who believe simple facts like in the reality of the Holocaust.     Yes, real users should notice when they are shadow banned.   Then they can message the admins and be told what they did wrong.   I know this works because I was shadow banned for a short time once.   I asked the admins, they told me what I did wrong and asked me to not repeat the mistake.   I made the promise and they unbanned me.    I've known other users who were shadow banned and then restored.   This is not hard.   It was all rather simply.    And Reddit is not the only  site that does shadow bans or some nature.   Some sites call them quiet bans.  Others call them shadow bans.  It's the norm for the internet.     You need to message the mods of the subreddit it was removed from.    It's harassment no matter who it's yelled at.     There is [Karma Decay](http://karmadecay.com/) and [Google Reverse image search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808) too.   Neither is 100%, but both can be helpful.    Imgur.com has a close relationship with Reddit.   But it's still not Reddit.   Not going to remove this post, but people should try the normal trouble shooting things you do when you have trouble with a site.      * Restart your browser  /  try a different browser * Clear your cache * Disable any browser extensions/add-ons you are using.    That said, I just went to imgur.com and everything was working for me.   So maybe it's a network issue with some large ISP or something.      You think mods do it for free.     Everyone knows that mods are highly paid individuals.   For example, /r/Food gets [handsome payoffs](http://s14.postimg.org/hkbso7481/cca350tonnes.jpg) from the propane and propane accessories industry.     Magic Mushrooms induce the euphoria.     So, no space aliens then.   And I was sure Bigfoot was from outer space.   Must be a time traveler instead.     Wow.  You think they would just answer things with catch call application of *that's how magic works*.      Just like Reddit moderators.       As you have discovered, verifying your e-mail address is important.  But some subreddits will have account age and karma-requirements as well.   If you have a problem with a specific submission not going through, you need to contact the moderators of the subreddit you're having trouble in.   They're going to be the only people who can help you.       I don't think /r/engineering has ever trended before.   That's cool.   Maybe we'll see some new subscribers from this.   New users should know we are rather strict in our approach to moderation.     That would be interesting.    I have not talked to the other mods of /r/History, but I think we might be willing to voltmeter allowing other subreddits to import the use of our anti-racist/anti-nazi rules.   We have previously made some of the rules available in places like /r/Modtalk or /r/Defaultmods, but we have several more than what we have already shown.     Myself, but especially /u/Creesch and /u/Cordis_Melum, and others, have developed some very good rules that stop most racists, Nazis, stormfronters, homophobes, ethnic and religious haters, and other associated lunatics and crazies, from having free reign of /r/History's comment section.    So, if you need people willing to help you with stuff like that, please let us know.        The moderators here can confirm.   The admins contacted us about this ahead of time.

The upper class was very well dressed.    In this case, they aren't wearing pants, and that t-shirt hasn't been washed in weeks.     Most of the subreddits I mod have automod rules in place to remove hate speech.    It just makes the comment discussions a little better.   Not a lot better, but a little bit can go a long way sometimes.     I'm sorry, but I have to remove this thread.    This is an issue between you and the admins.    They don't want to allow it,  then.... it's their web site.      There is no  *beginning*  of a subreddit as such.   You will have to use search and just read old threads.      Actually it does stop the down votes.   It doesn't let the down voter know that though.  But after a while it discounts their downvoter crusade into the great /dev/null device in the sky.      So, it's kind of a secret prevention program.   The down voter isn't supposed to catch on and stop.   They are just supposed to waste their time and effort forever or until they stop being jack ass.   Which ever comes first.    You might want to message the mods of /r/photoshopbattles and tell them about it.   They can drop a mod-comment waring people, remove the comment, etc.     How now brown cow?     Man, I don't suppress known truth.  I suppress unknown truths.  For example, I keep Mathematicians from finding out that 2+2 actually equals 6.

He left Europe to get away from Mussolini's fascist government.  But Planck stayed in Germany for the entire war.   And Oppenheimer was an American, born and raised.     As to the German Rocket Scientists, when they were captured by the Allies at the end of the war, they were amazed at being asked all the questions about rockets by the Americans.  Finally asking their American handlers why would the Americans need German Rocket scientists, when it was American Robert Goddard's work they were building on.  They were amazed the the US military didn't really know who Goddard was or why he was important.      Do not repeat phrases from the mod-guidebook to those are who aren't cleared for the information, please.    It looks like a subreddit you are attempting to comment in does not allow news user accounts or those with little comment karma to comment in their subreddit.  It's probably done for spammer and troll prevention.    These are legitimate concerns for that mod team.  You should build some comment karma elsewhere before commenting there  Or alternatively you could try and message the mods of that mod team.   But I would bet that are going to tell you to build up some comment karma elsewhere first.     We have the [CSS banner](http://i.imgur.com/dPC9pAF.png) at the top too.  And the [submission box text area](http://i.imgur.com/PDMkyeV.png) that explains what the subreddit is for too.   People straight up don't pay attention to those, nor to the sidebar.    And they don't look at the content already present before hand either.     People think "I need help with something" and then they can't think of a subreddit is should be submitted too, so they type in "help" as the name of the subreddit.     When the mods find these inappropriate submissions, we remove them.   Normally we give suggestions about where the submission would find a better home too.   Sometimes they are so crazy that we're even at a loss for where they should go.   Where were thinking "why would you even post  that on the internet?"  If you see a submission that shouldn't be here, please report it or [message the mod-team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhelp).    We'll remove it then.    Thank you.    Unsubscribe from it.     Message the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).   There is something wrong with your account.   Your post (This post I am replying too) does not appear on your [user overview](http://www.reddit.com/user/leadguit).   You are not shadow banned.   So, there must be something wrong with your account.    I've seen instances where it doesn't do that if you aren't a mod of the subreddit.     I'm not exactly sure what causes it in those cases.     I'm thinking that the spam filter ate his comment for some reason.  If I'm right, the mods of /r/Minecraft are who he needs to talk too.     Did you old browser settings cache your password?  If so, you should be able to get Firefox or Chrome to tell you want it thinks your Reddit password is.  Then you can use it.     If not, sorry, but since you didn't associate your account with an e-mail address, there is no other way to reset your password in a way where Reddit knows for sure that your account is you.

They should produce the same results, but both are formed a little different.      Glad I could help.   I use the hosts file to block a lot of advertisement-only domains.      Hosts files are an an old way, from pre-DNS days, that computers did IP lookups.    I'm going to assume your running Windows on your machine.  The hosts file is probably located at:  * %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts  Which is probably C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts for you.    If there is an entry for reddit.com in that file, then your system is going to always assume is reddit.com is that IP address, no matter what DNS thinks.    Now a days, the host file is usually used to assign things to localhost so that your system doesn't try to visit them.  This can be used as a way to prevent a system from visiting potentially harmful sites.   They are also something that somebody can use to block users from visiting web sites for other reasons, because most regular users don't know about it's existence.     Browser add-ons, software on the computer, does the localhost file blackhole reddit maybe?     Is it a a work-machine where your workplace computer techs may have blocked Reddit with the use of software that blocks it?    I know that some of my employers have blocked sites like Myspace and Facebook.    Sounds like network problems from whoever is your internet provider.    Your phone would use your cell-phone providers network, which travels a different route to Reddit.    It's allowed.   That said, it is sometimes considered to be against the spirit of [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).   Depends on the subreddit, and the opinions of the mods as to whether they allow it.   When in doubt, message the mods ahead of time.     Because it's going to automatically submit something, you should clear that plan with The [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) before implementing it.   That seems very close to spamming.       That said, there are people who know how to implement bots, such as /u/Deimorz, /u/multi-mod and /u/creesch who all know to make them work.   I'm not sure if any of them have written a how-to guide, but one of them may have.    Those are some bitter nuts.     It's been 9-months, so I am not sure what you can do now.   That said, if you think your account has been compromised, message the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).   I'm sure they will be happy to look into the issue.    I'm sorry, but your submission has been removed.   This subreddit is for tech support help with Reddit.

If it's not Zombie Stalin, he's too much of a sell-out to them.

[See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating_a_subreddit/).  In short, somewhat recent changes to subreddit creation requirements, you need karma to create subreddits.     On your [user preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/), do you have "message options" | "show message conversations in the inbox" enabled?  Make sure it's enabled.   Likewise, check the "mark messages as read when I open my inbox" option as well.    If not that, then check [this old thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/2kn156/constant_orangered_mocking_you_when_you_dont_have/) out and see if maybe that is the issue you are experiencing instead.       This isn't the kind of thing that only happened once or twice 40 years ago.   These are all relatively recent.   * This happened after a surfing competition: http://i.imgur.com/fz9ZLFH.jpg * This happened after a football team lost: http://i.imgur.com/JcvSEUt.jpg * This happened after a baseball team won: http://i.imgur.com/ThQDczy.jpg * This happened after a hockey team lost: http://i.imgur.com/4oD2hNY.jpg * This happened after a pumpkin festival: http://i.imgur.com/c7ArKYi.jpg * This happened because a coach was fired for protecting a child rapist: http://i.imgur.com/1iqPXhl.jpg * This happened after a basketball team won: http://i.imgur.com/ElXyQtD.jpg * This happened after a baseball team won: http://i.imgur.com/g5YWkZs.jpg * This happened after a football team won: http://i.imgur.com/TJ2j2GH.jpg * This happened because of a power outage: http://i.imgur.com/KYfAF2x.jpg * This happened because of a party: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFy1JL1pQwQ * This happened after a basketball team lost: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4_3pGbNGdE * This happened after a football team won: http://i.imgur.com/URCMFBs.jpg * This happened after a basketball team lost: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpCO1oTdqqc  Race has nothing to do with it, except apparently when it involves people with dark skin.     Maybe he just wasn't seeing it earlier.     You sure?   He had config earlier.   He has since gotten the access permissions.   I assume he has access to the stylesheet menu now.     There are stores in my area that have signs that say they card everyone.  It's because the stores want to make it is simple of the teenagers they hire to figure out who they should card.   Just tell them "Card everybody, no matter what".       It's one-size-fits-all management because they don't want to face possible fines or even just hassle from law enforcement.     The page must be changing dynamically based on where my request is coming from.  I don't have the ability to watch it on that page.    I only get the opportunity to purchase it on iTunes for $12.99.   Pages that do that stink.     No, it doesn't.   It says "Watch Clips From the Film".   Those are just snippets from it.  The documentary only aired two days ago.   Not months back.     None of those are to the documentary though.   Trailer and an Info page and a dead link.   The documentary originally aired only two days ago.    That seems to indicate the issue is no longer manifesting then.    Could you provide a link to the original please?    Thank you.      When I reply now does the mail icon light up?     Messages from Shadow banned accounts only show up to moderators in mod mail.   Mods will also see any comments they might make in threads in their own subreddits.   But users won't see the shadow banned accounts PM's.   And users will only see comments from the shadow banned if a mod has approved said comment.    No problem.    On your [user preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/), do you have "message options" | "show message conversations in the inbox" enabled?  Make sure it's enabled.   If not that, then check [this old thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/2kn156/constant_orangered_mocking_you_when_you_dont_have/) out and see if maybe that is the issue you are experiencing instead.    If not, let us know and we'll see if we can think of another possible reason.    I'm sorry, but your submission has been removed.  This subreddit is for tech support with Reddit.   I would suggest asking your question either at /r/Google or /r/techsupport instead.   Thank you.    You are sorting the comments by New.   Change it to either Best or Top.   Also, check your [preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and check what you have "comment options" | "sort comments by" set too.   Again, probably best to choose either Top or Best depending on what you like.   I prefer Top, but the Admins recommend Best for most people.     Why is everyone always horrified of Clippy?   The one I truly fear is [Microsoft Bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob).   Bob was the most diabolical software creation in all history.     Any update on when this issue might be fixed?     It's possible somebody off-reddit shared the link.   On another site, maybe Facebook, Twitter, etc.   Which would then not be something Reddit search would know about.    [Look here](http://i.imgur.com/gY33ELB.png).  Wait, I think I see the problem.  You don't have full permissions on [that subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/spongebobfnaf/about/moderators).   If I recall correctly, you need either the access or wiki rights.  I don't remember which.   As your top-mod for those rights.      I know people on both sides of this one.  I am still confused as to what actually happened.  I know enough about Reddit drama to know that not all the information is out here and generally known.   There is definitely something else at play here that is not known outside of their politics_mod subreddit.    I know Luster and TheRedditPope and mod with them at places.  They are good mods and good people.  I also know noeatnosleep and mod with him as well.   He is also a fine moderator and a good person.   I don't like seeing all the people condemning Luster and Pope when I am sure there is more to this drama.   I really have to think that this is a giant misunderstanding where nobody wanted to back down for some reason or other.   Hopefully everyone makes up soon and they all get back to moderating their subreddit.      That whole job of adding mods there was you and me and a few stray comments from a few others.    But we found a good collection of guys who now do most of the daily work.  I mod /r/Apple mostly from mod mail now and let the newbies (who aren't all that new anymore) run the day to day things like Stricky threads and the like.     It's was a big surprised considering that 1964 Republican Party Platform, which was not written by Nixon's people.   It was written by Goldwater's guys and some of Reagan's future team, who were then working for the Senator from Arizona.    Lets just remember, more than half the Senate (then) Democrats who voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Bill, by 1976 were registered Republicans.   The Republican Party welcomed the likes of Strom Thurmond and a bunch of the others with open arms.   To the point that you guys were celebrating their careers and saying Thurmond should have been elected President in 1948....  because he was against the anti-Lynching law.  He was out and out 100% openly pro-murder and the Republicans welcomed him into their party.   Also, the 1964 Republican Nominee for President (Barry Goldwater) and the 1964 Republican Party Platform was anti-Civil Rights.    Anyone who was welcomed into the Republican Party, who retired from politics as a Republican, should be counted as a Republican in those statistics.  You are just using Statistics to lie to people about Reality.    The Democrats threw those jack asses out of the Democratic Party.  The Republicans welcomed them and celebrated them.     If somebody mentions more than three usernames in a comment, nobody get's a message about the username mention.  That's a measure put in place by the admins to prevent their user as a spam tool.    If you think you have a down voter that is doing it for nefarious purposes, then you should ask the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to look into the situation.   That said, sometimes it's a regular user who is just being weird and dislikes everything for the moment.     Karma is also rather easy to get.   All you need to do is submit a few things on occasion.     This morning I submitted about 10-15 news stories about various topics.    I read the news each morning, and when I found things I thought were a little interesting, I submitted them to /r/News, /r/Politics, /r/Worldnews and a few other subreddits.     If news isn't your think,   /r/Funny, /r/Pics, /r/AdviceAnimals and the SFW-porn subreddits exist for most images, among several other subreddits.    Offbeat weird internet things can submitted to /r/WTF, /r/nottheonion, /r/Offbeat, /r/NewsoftheStupid and /r/NewsoftheWeird.    Those are just  three categories out of the whole of Reddit.   There are 49+2 [default subreddits](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/05/whats-that-lassie-old-defaults-fell.html) out there, plus a lot of sizable non-default subreddits.  The [100-largest subreddits](http://redditmetrics.com/top) are all 300K+ users now.  And there currently are 362 subreddits with more than 100K subscribers.    There is something out there for everyone.   People just need to check it out and submit to those subreddit-communities that interest them.   If they do that, karma will come to them.        Want to mention [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/2yob6r/creating_a_subreddit/), as it addresses this issue a little more in-depth.    [I miss Warren Zevon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0FaVI9ae24).     From [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_why_am_i_being_told_.22you.27re_doing_that_too_much....22) in the /r/Help FAQ:  Karma is stored (internally) on a per-subreddit basis; if you are new to a subreddit, you'll have to be patient. The delay will decrease as your karma in that subreddit increases and it only takes a fairly small amount of positive karma before the timer will turn off. This applies to both posts and comments. You can also get the timer turned back on if you make a lot of negatively voted posts/comments.  So, yes.... it is in there.     Never compare yourself to Jesus.   People who like Jesus get pissed about things like that, and people who don't like Jesus don't like Jesus.       In the future, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fapple) about things like this.  We will remove them.    It's removed now.    Thank you.    If that's happening, I would suspect that you have some browser add-ons that are doing something you don't expect them to do.   For the moment, I would suggest you open parent permalinks via new-tabs rather than just clicking them.   Not sure what else is going on, sorry.    Sorry, but no.   Only the submitter can edit it.   That said, many subreddits create a shared-mod account that they often use for posting mod-announcements.   Anyone who knows the password can log into it and use it, including to edit the older mod-announcements.   In most cases, these kind of shared accounts are used specifically for this ability.     in the Subreddit Settings, look for Content Options.  [See here](http://imgur.com/UMNMDjA).

Just want to point out that this is addressed in the [/r/Help FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq).   It's been that way for 9+ years.   For all that time there have been some people who complain about it.  It's left in place because there isn't a better solution for the issue in many cases.   A bad solution that works 90% of the time is better than no-solution that doesn't stop any spam.     If the parent comment to the one you are clicking is on the page, it just jumps to the #tag location on the page.

Admin /u/xiongchiamiov commented on this issue on this thread:  * http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/344mua/u_comments_sort_by_top_24hrsweekmonthyear_doesnt/  They are working on a fix for it.  Not sure where that is at in he pipe-line though.    But the admins are aware of it.     The rate limit has existed on Reddit since it was founded.   It is a simple way to prevent spam.     One of two issues is at play.   * The mods of that subreddit need to approve it.   You would need to write to them to find out if they are willing to approve it.    * You may be shadow banned on your (other, I assume) account.  In that case, the admins are the only people who can help you.  The number one reason get shadow banned is for spamming.

If you are going to live in a conspiracy-world, that's so much easier than anything else.     And if I was an admin, I would take that deal because nothing of value would be lost.    	150
 tvshack.cc or icefilms.info   This is true. Unfortunately there aren't any real engineering firms in my area and I definitely don't want to work here. I was going to interview one of my civ professors who used to be a practicing engineer, but thought a current engineer would give more prevalent answers.   Haha, thanks for the reply! It's really appreciated.   On a side note, do you like what you do, what DO you do, and any advise for a student about to enter the professional world? I do not plan on getting my masters immediately after my undergrad. Thanks!   Thanks for the quick reply! I'm a civil engineering student taking a professional writing course, and we needed to get someone in our related field to answer to above questions. If you wouldn't mind, I'd really appreciate it. Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student and cant pay the $110/hr fee :-P   These are more or less the questions I need answered. Thanks a bunch!!   how they function day-to-day as writers  how often they write and what their process is  what sorts of documentation they produce  what sorts of problems and conflicts they face in writing situations  what role technology plays in their professional communications  in what ways and how often they collaborate  what sorts of legal and ethical concerns characterize the climate in which they write  what other sorts of communication issues arise in their environment  writing advice they have for a young person entering the field.

Structurally speaking, almost anything that is carbonated is stored in a cylinder because of the internal pressures.

While in high school, I was a teachers aid for an 8th grade summer school program at the local middle school. There was some activity that involved the students labeling the oceans and continents on a black and white Mercator map. As if by high school I hadn't figured out where they were yet, the 20-something teacher I was aiding for kindly made me a key by labeling a map for me. To my initial shock, and eventual amusement, she labeled every single thing incorrectly. North America was the Indian Ocean, Asia was the Pacific, South America was Africa, etc. I immediately gave this to my mother who was a teacher in the district. The teacher was not fired, but I was told given an atlas....    	32
 According to the employee handbook, I should add the following disclaimer: The postings on this site are my won and do not represent Barnes and Noble's positions, strategies, or opinions.   I think I've always had vague knowledge of the holocaust, like my parents probably gave me a toned down summary of it when I was maybe 6/7/8. In fourth grade I started reading tons of books on the holocaust, by fifth grade I had a lot of knowledge about it. Of course, everything that happened in the holocaust was horrifying and maybe not the best subject material for a grade schooler. But I think it was great when I started learning more about it because it's important thing to remember.  My parents are also paranoid about the state of antisemitism around the world and are prepared to move to Israel if things go to shit in the US.   I have been hearing this definition of racism all over tumblr, Twitter, etc, as well as people adding that minorities can't be racist but can be prejucided. I have no idea where these definitions of racism are coming from and frankly they seem made up to add on to the victim complex that many people have. I myself am liberal and a feminist and all that shit, but this stuff really infuriates me, especially since if you challenge it you're automatically labeled as a racist.   Id like advice from current/past cs majors at UT. I'm going this fall but I'd like to get a head start by learning some things on my own. What are some things you wish you had already known how to do, at least somewhat, before you got to UT so you'd have a head start? Or, what did you already know how to do that gave you a head start? Any advice is much appreciated!  	4
 I have this strange desire all of a sudden to eat the stuff my dog finds outside.   They've got danglers the size of Montana.   Too..much...cuteness..brain shutting...dooowwnnnnnn   Nooooooo!!! He just wants kisses!   so cuddly!!!   Don't fuck with the King. You may very well wake up one night surrounded by Pennywise, Leland Gaunt, Kurt Barlow, and Randall Flag. With the creator and puppet master behind them, his endless eyes burrowing into you as he begins to pull the strings.   Thanks for the heads-up. I tried making an account on paypal, but it wouldn't let me because I don't have a debit or credit card. Thanks for the kind words *Internet hug*   **PLEASE READ FIRST:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/30e9bh/request_financial_assistance_i_feel_like_im/   Havre de Grace, Maryland, U.S.A   I posted the above link a few days ago, with the hopes of finding someone to help ease the situation me and my family are in. But today I got some bad news, and its made my situation more dire. My brother has to pay in on his taxes, due to some sort of penalty for not having health insurance last year, and its pushing us to the breaking point.  The special circumstances I mentioned in my title are that I wouldn't be able to repay the loan anytime soon. I'm looking for someone who can understand the situation I'm in and have enough faith in me to trust that I will repay. Even though it may be over a year before I can. I know this goes against the "short term" rules of the sub, but I'm desperate and I'm hoping against hope that you all can take pity for our situation and look the other way.  As far as interest goes, I'm not sure how to go about deciding it. Its something we can discuss if you decide you might be able to help.  I'm not sure on payment methods either. I have a Gofundme account set up, but if their is a quicker method for receiving the payment I'd very much like to use it. The sooner I can get this money to my family, the sooner things will look up for us.  I'm at rock bottom here, and its killing me. Please, if you've ever been in a similar situation and have the means to help me. I'm begging you.  $600  Edit: Someone told me I need a Paypal account to receive help from this sub. I tried creating an account but was unable to because I don't have a debit or credit card. Please, if their are other ways to make this transaction possible, consider them. I can't begin to express how horrifying this whole situation is.   Is something fucky?   An example of the type of person we should all aspire to be.   I don't. I think its terrible that you could believe she "helped" him. He may have been bogged down by personal demons, may have suffered from mental disorders. But were living in a time in history when we finally have some tools to help alleviate those problems.  To think she encouraged him to die, than flips everything and uses his death as a means to make herself look good through charity work is beyond low. That she can talk about how tough life is and how helping others alleviates that pain, when she convinced a man to kill himself. To inhale those noxious fucking chemicals until his heart stopped, is beyond me. How exactly do you think his family feels? I'd bet money they didn't know he was suffering, that he was unhappy. Family is usually the last to know in a situation like this, because the person in question has become so adept at hiding their feelings, and doesn't want them burdened.  I wish you could tell his family your view in person and see first-hand what their going through. What kind of goddamn hell it is to lose someone because they took their own life. To play the last moments you had with them over and over, to wonder while you lay awake if you could've done something. To wish they had reached out to you, because in your heart you know you'd do anything for them.  This has nothing to do with bandwagon mentality, this has to do with people being held responsible for their actions. He wasn't in a proper state of mind when he finally decided to go through with the act. And when that malnourished and defeated voice in his head spoke up and said this isn't right, said get out of the car. That little bitch told him to get back in.   Bowie is love, Bowie is life.   Cat mode: Error 404   This is so cute it has to be fattening.   Oh You Pretty Things, kooks, New Killer Star, The Next Day, Andy Warhol, Magic Dance, Soul Love, Starman, Golden Years.   Too Cute!!!   Done. Happy to help :)   Amazing salad.   He expressed feelings that he didn't want to leave his family, on top of getting out of the vehicle when he first started it. He could have been helped.  Suicide is only an option for those who are terminally ill, people with no quality of life left to live.  Your reply is ignorant and unwanted. what she did is no different than someone who coaxes a mentally ill person to drink antifreeze because the thought crossed their mind. Suicide is almost always a symptom of other problems, something that until today I thought was common knowledge.   Thanks for the help friend. *Internet hug*   She deserves a long jail sentence. She had the life of another human being in her hands, could have done any number of things to help him, and she didn't. She took someone who was confused and in a bad state of mind, and convinced him to take his life.   This piece of garbage isn't human in my eyes. She's a disgusting stain that should face the same fate she pushed that poor guy to.  I've been on both ends of the spectrum of suicide, I've dealt with those thoughts myself and had a close family member take their life. I can't express how angry reading this makes me. I hope they impose the heaviest sentence on her that the law will allow.   I'm actively working with my therapist and psychiatrist to find coping skills and the right medicine regime.   Thanks for the insight into applying for disability. I don't think its something that would pan out for me. I want to get back to work. And the idea of spending all that time and effort for something I may not need when I get it, if I get it at all, doesn't seem worthwhile. On top of that, I really believe I can get to a point where I can work within the next year or two. And I don't want to bog down an already slow system and impede other people who are worse off than myself.   Is that the average wait time?   I get foodstamps for myself, but it only goes so far. I budget it well but the cost of food is outrageous in my opinion. I never thought to check on disability, thought I was too young for it. Thanks for the advice. :)   I appreciate your advice, I really do. But what your suggesting isn't a possibility for me, at least not in the foreseeable future. I bring in no money of my own, so asking my family for the capital to attempt this would be necessary. Things are strained now between us, and asking for money for crafts when our fridge is nearly empty wouldn't go over well.   I'd also face the issue of trying to sell them. I live in a rural area with the closest town 5 1/2 miles away. On top of which I have fairly severe anxiety, and talking to people I don't know is very hard. Trying to sell stuff to strangers makes me anxious just thinking about it.  Please don't misconstrue this as anything negative, that I'm unable to implement your idea. I'm deeply thankful you took the time to read my post and offer your insight. *Internet hug*  P.S. - I wasn't much of a Dickens fan in high school, but maybe I should revisit some of his works. I am a big fan of Orwell, have been since I read Animal Farm.   Thank you :)   Havre de Grace, Maryland   Hello to all. My name's Joshua, Josh for short. I'm here because I need help, my family needs help. I'm not sure what to write, if I deserve to post here, but I need to try something.   I've been unemployed for about a year now, give or take, due to health problems. Since I was young I've suffered from OCD, depression, bipolar disorder, ADD, and chronic insomnia. I never received help for it growing up, which has put me in a very bad spot. I'm 23, and I've worked seven different jobs since I was old enough to work. I've been forced to leave them all because of my mental health issues. The longest was a job as a cook at a fine dining restaurant that I managed to hold down for almost two years. I live with my mother and younger brother, who work to keep us off the streets. We live in my grandfather's house. We used to live with him, but he committed suicide last year on his 88th birthday.  My family works full time. My brother works especially hard, trying to help compensate for my lack of income. I'm on state insurance, and have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for several months. I'm slowly getting better, but its an uphill battle that's getting harder and harder to fight. The weight of the bills, the arguments, the unhappiness. All because of me and my inability to work. The stress and anxiety is killing me inside. I hate showing my face around them, knowing how miserable they are because I was born defective and can't contribute.  Which I guess brings me to the reason for this post. The bad weather has negatively affected both their jobs, and they haven't been getting the hours they were. We have bills that are past due, and their having trouble catching up. If there is anyone reading this who can help me, I'd get on my knees and beg you if I could. A monetary gift to help pay the outstanding bills, get our trash service back, and other small things. Things like cab fare to and from my appointments. My insurance doesn't cover medical transport, so if my mom is working and can't drive me, I have to take a cab. Because if I miss two or more appointments I have to reapply to be seen and it takes months so I can't risk it. Gift wasn't the right word to use, I'm not sure what is. Any help you can give me, I will repay. I promise you that. It may be a year or two from now, but I will reimburse for your kindness. My grandfather taught me to always pay my debts, and I do.  If your not in a position to help in a physical way, I'd love very much for someone to talk to. I don't have any friends and have no one I can talk to here. A kind soul who wouldn't mind talking with me would be an amazing gift in itself.  That's pretty much it, not sure what else to say. My anxiety has been terrible these past few days, and getting all this out has helped ease it.

I'm more inclined to believe in his deviation over Lucas's.   His partner in crime, Otis Toole. Was known to eat people. In an interview he gave while incarcerated. He described disemboweling a young boy, jamming a rod in his ass and through his mouth. Cooking him on a spit fire all while basting him in his secret BBQ sauce he used just for people. At the end of the interview he said anyone interested in trying it could write him and he'd send a copy of the recipe back.   You mean Green Mario.

 A T-800 traveling in a phone booth is on its way to Robert Zemecki's house...   Thanks man, might be a Nimbus by the looks of it. Enjoy your new grip job!    Man, that cat has seen some shit. Looks like a brooding war veteran    The job is a bit too much for my taste but it's all good as long as you had fun with it man!

 White Heat!   Everyone hates on it. But you know what? It's motherfucking Turbo Time, so fuck em.   "Where am I? Am I still in prison?" "You're in the hospital." "Ta-da..."   Jingle All the Way. "That was really a bomb? This is a sick world we're living in with sick people!"   Anne and her rules. No walks, no trips to the groomers. In the end, I just snapped. I screamed at her, Anne! Im dying here! It's like we never leave the house! Thank God, these well-dressed German men heard my barking and broke into the attic. Those brave heroes rescued me.     That is a very odd scene that could be read in a variety of ways. Either way, it seems too ambiguous to be definitive. But I do think you can make a pretty strong case for Nick's bisexuality throughout the book. I'll have to keep that in mind when I re-read Gatsby.   That's an interesting interpretation, but why do you believe it to be definite?  	7
 Haha yeah I know what you mean, thank you.    World peace, where everyone will just be fine.    From the language to the cinematography, Lord of the Rings.    Drop it low girl - ester dean   Dracula Untold (2014), they left it open with the possibility of another one.    Titanic. Why? Because it had such beautiful music during precise moments that just made me swoon over the scenes. It was just beautiful and I fell in love with it.    Lord of the Rings. Any of them.    I respect that. Non believing is on the rise, and who am I to say which is right, just an opinion.    Personal, small (or large) things that happen to you in your life. Someone you run into after not seeing them for years at the right time and right place. Finding the exact perfect dress out of a million others in the store. The music moving with the birds flying over your car at the exact perfect moment in the song. Idk things. Unexplainable things. But I have no clue why bad things happen to good people, gods obviously not taking care of that stuff.    Yes because some things are too powerful to be coincidences.    I bought one of those gold leaf crown things from Urban Outfitters for like 30$ and afterwards I was like when am I ever gonna wear this again? It was for a festival. It's still pretty cool tho.    If only I could have done it this other way.    Coffee..coffee coffee coffee!    Lana Del Rey   Turned in an old iPod to a pawn shop...I miss that fucking iPod every day..   I think that persons me    Not recent, but Stephen Kings, Storm of the Century, is a movie I watch at least 3 times a year. It's very good.    Hypothetically speaking.   Where's Titanic?    They're action packed, full of good versus evil, and usually have romance, what's not to love?    Just curious what people think the disadvantages of transparency are.    Did I do good?   You were always going too fast.   When people are sad or having a bad day. Most people don't want anything to do with them because they're spreading "negative vibes."    Face to face so you can really open up about how you feel. In an email things can get misconstrued.    I don't know. Michael Bay films are usually totally entertaining and fun to watch just like the Fast movies. I think people just like to make fun of Michael Bay because he's made a trademark of blowing shit up and being huge.    The Shawshank Redemption   	27

 Good point, but technically he would still have Stark blood in him.   Yes but he was legitimized as a Stark, which makes him the heir to Winterfell. If anything I think that it would become voided if it were ever to come to light that he was actually Rheagar's son.    Start using the tape deck hookup and then come talk to me.    I have seen a lot of talk on this subreddit about the R+L=J theory. Some people think that this would make him heir to the Iron Throne. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't he still be a bastard but only with a different father? He still would not have any better claim to the throne then he does now. I could be completely wrong here so if I am will somebody please explain what the significance of this theory is?   Yeah, I just watched it last night. Thought it was a pretty good movie.       Just because one person says Fringe is bad, doesn't make it a bad TV show.    I can't believe I missed this. What pages?

Title: House Stark Shield: Stark     I think that is only because you never got a PoV chapter from her until AFFC.   Fuck you Jamie Lannister   You are so right in stating that the above gentleman is correct.    I am laughing just thinking about this, and what my probable reaction to this would be.    People to stand close to me at grocery stores while I am shopping.    Honesty is almost a negative trait right now in the current job market.   I cannot even being to describe how hard that made me laugh....   At least he can re-watch all of his favorite TV shows. The question is...how does he know which one's were his favorite?   I really wish I didn't read as fast as I did. Now that I am finished with all four books I can't sop thinking about A Dance with Dragons!!!   Was just about to post this until I saw yours.    All of these characters have much bigger roles in books 2 and 3, so I would imagine that they will also get more screen time as well.    Should've bought from KMart. They had a really good deal on L.A. Noire.   Well, has she drank from a garden hose and survived?   Cleveland is actually not that bad.

"In summary, laboratory tests and driving studies show that cannabis may acutely impair several driving-related skills in a dose-related fashion, but that the effects between individuals vary more than they do with alcohol because of tolerance, differences in smoking technique, and different absorptions of THC."   That's my text ringtone *LISTEN*   Overall average for WI according to your link. In Ohio, starting wage is $33,671 and averages is $50,314. Regardless, I would have to agree that $38,284 is a very low average salary in WI.  source: http://teacherportal.com/salary/Ohio-teacher-salary   Honestly though...it's a user review for a videogame. I could log on right now and give it a 0/10 just for spite. I would care more if we were talking about a Critic Review.    We are talking about starting wages. A teacher with tenure will end up making much more than $35,000. I would be more concerned about losing benefits, because I would say that is one of the stronger benefits that teachers get once hired.    True, but that is the same boat every kid is in when getting out of college. Even $30,000 is a very livable wage. I am not saying I agree with what is going on, but I don't think teachers are underpaid.    In Ohio, starting wage for a teacher is about $35,000. Take from that what you will, but after becoming tenured teachers can start to earn a very nice wage.    If this is from Youngstown State University I wouldn't be suprised if people just don't show up and email the professor after the exam.   Enslaved: Odyssey to the West    Everyone has the right of police protection. What RP is saying is that one person will end up paying for their education while another doesn't have to pay a dime. Same goes for healthcare.    I think a lot of people here are taking that quote out of context. He is talking about college, not kindergarten.  A better quote is this: "Prices go up on the tuition and then we give them grants and then they get out of the college and they owe $200,000. It makes no sense whatsoever. I don't think how anybody can justify it."    Agreed.    I disagree with this. I think you overestimate the value of our technological advantage. We are an occupying force in Iraq, where someone can bomb a humvee and then go run over to a mosque and hide. Precision air strikes are basically pointless. Both sides are still shooting bullets at each other.   	45

"The bones help," said Melisandre. "The bones remember. The strongest glamors are built of such things. A dead man's boots, a hank of hair, a bag of fingerbones."   After seeing a post on Facebook about organ donation, I was appalled by the sheer number of people who felt that older people do not deserve organs because they have already lived their lives.   I got so mad when these people said things like "that's dumb, why didn't they give the organ to a younger person?"  And while I know not every can know the details of how organs are allocated, it just bothered me that so many people thought so little of the elderly and felt that the young deserved more in life.  Youth really is wasted on the young!      Hi guys.  I was hoping someone could help me find a pattern for an edging that would produce a similar result to [this]( http://i.imgur.com/nVDqJVm.jpg).

I know some of these are general and vague problems that millions of people also deal with.

He has been following them since he was little, despite none of his family having any interest in the game. He just watched them play one day and hasn't stop watching since.  We are travelling to America in October this year and although there are many things on our to-do list, the whole trip will be based around us getting to Boston amd seeing a Pats home game.  Now, hubby will have his bday while we are over there, so I am hoping to find some sort of 'special experience' tickets to surprise him with. I'm thinking VIP box, stadium tour, anything like that. Hell, if I can somehow get him in the same room as Tom Brady, he would probably pass out with joy.  So, can anyone help me? Point me in the direction of a place I can get this? Or even just tell me if it is possible/affordable?  Thanks!   http://i.imgur.com/uEcQCFI.jpg  I bought 7 x 50g balls just because they were on sale for $1.20 but now I don't know what to do with it.  It is gorgeously soft and slippery and feels magic against my skin, so I was hoping to make something like a jumper or shawl. But I haven't found any pattern that would work with the glossy, slippery nature of the yarn.  Suggestions?   Once or twice a week I sit next to a lady on the train who is an avid crocheter, like me. We first spoke when she complimented me on my amugurumi kitty I was working on. Over the weeks we have had great chats, discussing our favourite yarn brands, the best stitches and new patterns we have found. I look forward to my train trips now and enjoy our chats immensely.  This morning, the nice lady delivered on a promise I hadn't really expected her to keep and gave me a bag full of cashmere yarns with the condition that I make another kitty out of it just so she could see how it turned out.  I was very thankful and happy that someone would be so friendly and giving to a complete stranger, without expecting anything in return.   Crocheters really are the nicest people!                           Today I suffered some major embarrassment.

My step brother is interested in signing up for a business opportunity provided by a company called Vemma. The model is based on sales of healthy products supplied by the company as well as membership sign up.   You have to pay to recieve the product and then your sales numbers and how many people you get to join equate to an income.

I am making a 12x12 granny square quilt. I am 56 squares in and still undecided about how I will join them all together.  I have narrowed it down to two techniques:  The [slip stitch]( http://attic24.typepad.com/weblog/joining-granny-sqaures.html) method  Or the [invisible stitch]( http://doyoumindifiknit.typepad.com/do_you_mind_if_i_knit/2010/02/joining-up-with-an-invisible-stitch.html) method.  So I am wondering if there is anyone out there who has used either/both of these methods who can give me some pros and cons. I dont mind that the slip stich is visible from the back but I do mind if i get unsightly ridges or awkward edges at the front.  [Here]( http://imgur.com/Vx1xfsr) is a pic of my progress :)                  You know who I mean. That one celebrity everyone hates that you think is smokin hot. You can't bring yourself to admit your nasty feelings to your friends, so tell Reddit instead. No judgement here, friend.         I am very new to crocheting and after bravely setting out to make a nice throw using 12ply yarn, I quickly discovered I was out of my depth. My throw started as a scarf, but I found it was too stiff with the 12ply so I carried on widening it, making a throw.   I went out and bought heaps of the yarn I was using so I didn't run out, thinking I was a genius for stockpiling it.  But halfway through I realised my throw was just as stiff as my scarf...so I unravelled it.  Now, I am stuck with about 5 HUGE balls of purple 12ply yarn and neither the skills nor the knowledge to turn it into something useful.  So can anyone help me out with suggestions for a basic pattern I can use to get rid of all this yarn? Everything I try seems too intricate for it's thickness, or requires various colours when all I have is the purple...                                 Sure, what she did was hard, no denying that and attention on women's health is usually a good thing. But the media needs to stop glorifying sick celebrities. It portrays them as the benchmarks and 'poster-children' for a disease when, as wealthy and famous individuals with access to almost endless medical resources, they are in the best possible position while sick.   Common people, like struggling single mothers and embattled pensioners have more reason to be called inspirations than celebrities.   Furthermore, the media lauding these famous people as inspirations creates unrealistic expectations for normal people coping with the same situations.        	137
    **My 5 Questions:**  1. Do you feel any remorse for your crimes?  2. How were you treated in prison?   3. Did you ever have a plan to turn Stratton Oakmont into a legitimate brokerage firm?  4.

And if you could specify what political party you align with that'd be great.            AR style rifles or "assault weapons" as they are commonly referred to are the main target of gun control. IMO this is the direct result of sensationalism on behalf of the media. I believe that anyone who thinks that AR style rifles are any worse than any other gun is uneducated on the matter and should have no say. I believe that anyone who uses an AR style rifle as an example of why we need gun control is either A) a politician using fear mongering tactics to further their cause, or B) a voter who is uneducated on the matter and should not have a say. I believe so because AR (Armalite NOT assault rifle) style rifles function exactly the same as any other semi automatic rifle. The difference is that AR style rifles have creature comforts that make them easier to carry around and use for long periods of time (like when you're hunting). CMV.

Where did the band's name come from?  **Public Contact Information:**  https://twitter.com/KenDKM  https://twitter.com/DropkickMurphys            Also how are prices on the street compared to in the dispensaries?   Edit: shit this blew up. Also, TIL Redditors complain about things they can easily avoid.   Edit 2: the amount of you that want condoms banned concerns me.  Edit 3: TIL Redditors hate toilet paper.  Edit 4: TIL Many redditors don't know the definition of the word "product"   Edit 5: OK, based on my inbox it seems like most people have decided on cigarettes, crocs, dildos, cell phones (I'm going to interpret that as smartphones), axe, and toilet paper.  Edit 6: Add soda (particularly coke), alcohol, and social networks to the list      Hermits, coma patients, convicts, travelers of remote parts of Africa,  tell us your story!       They can be difficult to see at times. It would be as simple as having two colors that change for every other line.         It seems like they'd understand their patient's mental problems more than a psychologist.   For the past few months I've had this thought/worry in my head. I know it's not true but I can't get it out of my head. It's this strange thing that I don't want in my head. If it were true then I would be shunned by society and I could be sent to prison. Again, I know it's not true but I still can't get it out of my head.     Recently (past week) I haven't been able to stop thinking about it whereas I can usually push it to the back of my mind. It has caused me to become very depressed and stressed out. The thought that it could be true just pushes me over the edge. I don't know what to do. My research tells me that depression and anxiety can cause strange thoughts. If meds can get this thought out of my head and keep it from controlling my life then I want them.         I've ordered [this](http://www.cigarsinternational.com/samplers/58017/ci-taster-pack-mild-medium/#p-27068) yesterday.  I think I'm going to order [this](http://www.famous-smoke.com/montecristo+premium+cigar+assortment+4+pack+cigars/item+37285) if I end up enjoying cigars.  I'm pretty excited though and I really want to try one today. unfortunately we don't have any "real" smoke shops in my town. We pretty much have a few head shops disguised as smoke shops. Should I just wait or is there something I can pick up at a gas station that's worth trying?   **My 5 Questions:**  1. Did you feel in danger at any time?  2. How cold was the water?   3. How far did you make it?  4. Do they make you act quirky or is that just the way people who want to do that act?  5. Was it fun?  **Public Contact Information:** If Applicable         Keep in mind that I'm not afraid to get dirty. I'm willing to work construction, garbage, etc. Basically I don't have a problem working a blue collar job if it means I can make some cash.      I was out of control. I had a two large big mac combo a day problem. One day as I was driving away from the drive thru with my first big mac of the day I started regretting my choices. I looked down at it and tossed it out the window right then and there, and I haven't touched a big mac since.         http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_One   Hey! So a few of my friends and I discovered an abandoned logging road awhile back. We drove pretty far down it until it became impassible via car. We scouted it on Google maps and it turns out it branches into a system of out of use logging roads, some of which lead to a coastal town that we all like visiting. Using Google's routing tool we discovered the whole trip would take ~8 hours on quads. But that figure could be off. We plan in borrowing a few ATV's, I believe the guy said they were 400cc Yamaha Utility quads.    What we plan on bringing:   Each Quad and rider will have:  *2 gallons of spare gas  *sleeping bag  *Camel Bak and spare water  *Hatchet+manual chainsaw  *Emergency water purification tablets and MREs  *Toilet paper  *Eating utensils  *Lighter  *clothes  *flair gun  *walkie talkie     Split between the three quads:  *tent  *gas powered chainsaw  *fire starters  *cooking stuff  *repair tools      Now I'm debating whether or not we need a collapsing toilet seat. We'll be about 20 miles from a major highway most of the time, but there will be logging camps nearby most of the time. Can you think of anything else we'll need. I think we might be able to do the trip in one day but I'm preparing as if we'll come across obstacles or won't be able to ride as fast as google suggests we can. It also depends on if there's anything we'll want to explore.       Edit: just realized that I fucked up the title            There's obviously still a demand because people are buying foreign cars with M/T's.   Seeing as I won't be able to visit NYC until spring break at the earliest I'd like to know a bit more about the surrounding areas and whatnot.                   I think it may have been a reply to a Q on AskReddit. I also think it may have hit the front page. He later edited in a drawingof it that he made when he was a kid. I'm pretty sure he was located in Colorado at the time and his story was confirmed by another Redditor who saw the same thing and also lived in Colorado.       **My 5 Questions:**  1. Were you in the city or at the base when the battle happened?  2. Did any of you expect to see combat during that deployment?   3. IMO One of the, for lack of a better word, funniest scenes in the movie was when the Delta operator went on his "safari" and got dinner. Did that kind of thing actually happen?   4. What did you do after being discharged?   5. If you could go back in time knowing what you know now, would you still join up?  **Public Contact Information:**   Somebody could ask around in /r/military.   John Marston has a special ability called "Dead Eye". It allows him to seemingly slow time while still retaining normal mobility, target enemies, and increase general combat effectiveness.    In GTA V each character has their own special ability.   Franklin can slow time while driving.   Trevor takes less damage while dealing more.   Michael can slow time while shooting.   All three are watered down variants of "Deadeye". But wait! The plot thickens! In RDR John Marston has three conflicting personalities. He is a family man that just wants to get back to his family. He wants to better his lifestyle at all costs. He is a rough around the edges cowboy.    Franklin has inherited the dreamer personality. All he wants is to get out of the ghetto.   Michael represents the family man. His end game is to be closer to his family.   Trevor represents the rough around the edges cowboy. Sure, he's insane, but he also has a caring personality.   Seriously, I got a medium Pepsi from Arby's today and it was like a big gulp from 10 years ago.   Seriously. Especially in the college hill/friendly area the retaining walls turn so many intersections into dangerous, blind, corners. Anybody know how to get the ball rolling on a fix for this? In the meantime I might put up some of those domed security mirrors.    I'm looking for something that's 50/50 on road/off road. The WRR is always an option, but the KTM 350 EXC-F   XCF-W have me intrigued.                   It was heading south and when I circled around the block to try and find it, I thought I saw it running into an ally that lead to 24th   Jefferson.                  http://i.imgur.com/OMrcxlH.gif   Basically my choice at this point comes down to ROTC. How can I tell the quality of a program?   As a prospective cadet I'd like to know a few things.    What is the PT schedule?  Sorry if this is obvious, but I couldn't find it kn the website.     Does being a cadet prevent you from having a good time and partying?    Is the teacher/CO strict in comparison to other ROTC programs?       I'm looking for a solid college commuter. I've got a car, so it won't be my only mode of transportation. My commute is 4 miles in 25-30 mph residential neighborhoods, and 6 miles on a 45 mph freeway.      Here's what I'm looking at: the Ninja 300 (abs?), the Suzuki Boulevard S40, and the CBR250R, but I just read that they are coming out with a CBR300R, so I might wait for that. I'm also thinking about getting a used H-D Iron 883 sportster. Other suggestions are welcome. My budget is ~5500, although ideally I'm buying a nice used bike in the 3500-4500 range.   Aside from a different   paint scheme and being 3 lbs lighter..         The classic folk song made famous when The Animals [covered](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hRXb7K7k7bQ desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhRXb7K7k7bQ) it has been the subject of speculation forever. Many believe it is in reference to a brothel, a jail, or a gambling house.      Considering we have a much greater area than Germany, yet they have no limit autobahns.   We know from some nifty detective work by users on this subreddit that Brian will return. The question is, how? Stewie has destroyed his time travel tech and has no way to build a new time machine. However, we also know from S4E30 that they have time travel tech in the future, and that future stewie (stu) is in possession of this technology.    My theory is that the Griffin's will make a time capsule for their future selves. Stewie will leave a letter for Stu in the time capsule begging him to come back to the present and help save Brian. We will then have an episode from Stu's perspective as he reads the letter and travels back in time to save Brian.   A month or two ago I changed my Microsoft account email because I had lost access to the old email. Since then every time I log onto xbox.com it tells me something has gone wrong, and every time I try to go to the billing information part of my xbox I get an error code (I'll check to see what it is later) and then I can't change anything. Any idea what's wrong? I want to download some DLC's, but I can't until I add a credit card.   I know you guys are not lawyers but I thought I'd ask.    It seems like online bitcoin gambling is legal, or at least a grey area. Would the same apply to brick   mortar bitcoin gambling? Say you had a system where they sent you a bitcoin payment, and you then gave them an equivalent amount of chips. When it comes time to cash out, you send them a digital bitcoin payment. Since bitcoin is not considered legal tender (yet), would this get around gambling laws? It seems like it would because there is no exchange of cash between parties    Edit: US gambling laws.

Was it hard convincing the Army to let you guys stay/film at OP Restrepo? 2. What was it like reintegrating back into society when you returned from Afghanistan?  3. Are you still in contact with the soldiers?  4. Do you have any advice for someone wanting to film a documentary in a war torn region? 5. What was your favorite thing about filming Restrepo?   **Public Contact Information:**    Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/sebastianjunger               I occasionally attend confession. Not to right myself with a God, but to have a way to get stuff I feel guilty about off my chest. Many would say that by attending confession and reading the Bible I am a Catholic.  Basically where do we draw the line between subscribing to a religion and agnostics, and then agnostics and athiests? Can an athiest believe in any form of higher power (luck, superstition, etc) or would that make them an agnostic?      In the coming months should it still be treated as an investment or is it becoming a true currency? The reason I ask is because I was introduced to bitcoins when the silk road bust happened, and it has become a very intriguing investment option to me.   And do you believe that that's a good or bad thing?   You have to assume major candidates are vetted. If everything they've ever done, even their most illegal and perverse internet history shows up how will anyone ever be elected?   If its a drug what was going through your mind when you decided to shoot up/snort/smoke/swallow it the first time? How long until it became a problem?    Gamblers, did you immediately need to start betting more and more or was it a gradual thing?   Alcoholics,  tell us when you had the realization that you were hooked   Hey all. I have been looking at spec miatas on racing junk and I've found one I like, but I have a few questions. I presume, but I'd like confirmation,  that buying a ready to race spec miata with high miles and putting another motor in is cheaper than making a lower mile miata race ready, correct? I'm pretty heavy, 240 lbs, can I make weight in a 1.6 or should I try to find a 1.8?    Finally,  and this has nothing to do with those questions. Why are SM's with wins more expensive?  In a driver dependent format like SM the car's pedigree doesn't seem like it would matter.   I'm probably not using the correct term to describe them, but I have examples.  --  On an ask reddit thread a few days ago there was a guy who mentioned he's part of a growing group that has decided not to identify as any race. Regardless of their birth race they have decided to mark, or write in, "other" as their race on forms.  --  There was a guy on reddit a few days ago asking how to tell his girlfriend that he wouldn't be getting her an engagement ring because it's an outdated practice.  --  Theres also the people who have decided to give everything a PC name. For example instead of referring to a male as just a man they feel the need to call them a cisgendered man.  --  Finally there was the guy who decided Sir and Mam aren't PC enough and is trying to create a gender neutral version.  --  Now I get these are of varying levels of extremity but I'd like your opinion on these types of people.   It doesn't seem like a religious thing and there is no proof that fapping in moderation is harmful.  I don't get it.   **My 5 Questions:**  1. What's the scariest situation you've ever been in? 2. Is the landing from the movie "flight" possible? 3. Who has been your worst passenger? 4. What is the most annoying thing passengers do on a regular basis?  5. What's the best thing about being a pilot?  **Public Contact Information:** If Applicable      I'm looking to get an autocross. I've got a budget of 10k including any mods. Right now I'm looking at a miata which I would supercharge, a MR2 spyder, and a 240z. I'm looking for suggestions as well. I have a DD so practicality isn't a big issue. Like I said, the car will mainly be used for autocross and tearing up the back roads.      **My 5 Questions:**  1. How much of the show is scripted?  2. Do you ever use stunt drivers?  3. Are Hammond, Jeremy, or May ever reprimanded for the controversies they cause?  4. Did they seriously not know where they were when the plane landed during the Iraq special?  5. What is the most dangerous situation, on or off camera, that has happened while filming the show?         If things like FB, twitter, instagram, google+, myspace, etc had never been created. How would the world be different if we only used the internet to exchange scientific, medical, academic, business, and political information?      How would the world be different if stuff like facebook, twitter, myspace, youtube, instagram, etc had never been created, and to this day the internet was used solely to share scientific, medical, mathematical, and academic type things?    Stuff like wildland firefighting, hay bailing, etc.         Tell us some stories      I made an Italian friend over the summer. He was by no means a smoker, but he would always have a cigarette in hand at parties. After I asked him about It he explained that in Europe, especially Italy   France,  smoking is much more accepted, and that many people there are social smokers. Why is it that in the US we have the mentality that you can either kill youself as a heavy smoker or you don't smoke at all, whereas occasional smoking is commonplace in Europe?   So I woke up a few days ago and my left foot hurt. The pain feels like soreness. It's now a few days later and my foot hurts when I walk. The pain is coming from the top of the foot a little ways behind the big toe. Any ideas as to what is going on? I'm 18, male, overweight but not to the point that I can't play football with my friends, not currently on any medication.   My dream for college has always been to attend a high caliber school, and (don't hate) join a fraternity. Due to certain circumstances I can't get into the types of schools I wan't to go to as a freshman. Is it possible to transfer into a school like USC after your freshman year? I can't do it after my sophomore year because I won't be able to join a frat. I know that the website says I "can" transfer on my timeline, but I would like to know if anyone ever gets accepted on that timeline?            She doesn't have any real power anymore does she? I thought she acted as a sort of figurehead.    Whether it was successful or failed,  a hookup, a relationship,  I want to know! Did you do anything crazy?      Had you known them as a friend for your entire childhood? Or was one of you popular and the other a loser in HS? Any other scenarios?      The boys over at /r/IAMA weren't too receptive to the idea, but if someone wants to get the ball rolling on this that'd be cool!   My questions:   1. Was it weird telling your parents that you were going to be in SI swimsuit?  2. Do you plan to continue modeling swimwear?  3.

So I'm looking at an Evo viii/ix or a WRX right now. But I'm looking for alternatives because those are pushing it in terms of insurance ccosts. Any ideas? Must be fast, built post 2000, able to handle snow, and less than 14k. Manual transmission is a plus. It doesn't need to be a four door but I do need to be able to squeeze four people in. Also why do Evo IX's still cost 20k+   So I'm looking at an Evo viii/ix or a WRX right now. But I'm looking for alternatives because those are pushing it in terms of insurance ccosts. Any ideas? Must be fast, built post 2000, able to handle snow, and less than 14k. Manual transmission is a plus. It doesn't need to be a four door but I do need to be able to squeeze four people in.      I'm in the market for an '08+ WRX. I know I should look for salvage titles, and I assume if it has mods I should checkout the tranny, but what else? Is their a difference in performance between the hatch and the sedan? Finally will they be much cheaper when '14 rolls around? Because I'd love to get an STI, but I can't afford one at the moment.         You always hear about how a man is a scumbag because he took home a chick that is smashed, and how he is having rape charges filed against him. If the man is also smashed why is he the scumbag? Aren't they equally at fault?               Assuming the coke is in it's powder form, and none of the drugs are laced.         Not in the health facts sense, but in the gross storage/preperation sense.   I'm an American and I'm planning on visiting Ireland soon. What should I do? What shouldn't I do? For instance my ancestors were Irish. Do Irish people get annoyed when we talk about that? Is there pub etiquette that we may not know about? etc.   Like what genre?   Mine are:  Hero of war - Rise Against  Where were you (when the world stopped turning) - Alan Jackson  Otherside - Macklemore (I'm not sure if this song is actually that sad. It might be because I was in a bad place because a close family member relapsed when I first heard it, and I associate it with that.)  There are a couple more I just can't think of them now. Will edit if I do.   Are you trying to maximize the human experience? Do you use them to study? Just curious.   A little background, I'm a senior in high school searching for work/paid internships over the summer. My high school diploma is coming with something that basically says I specialized in business   marketing while I was there. I'm not sure if other states do this, but here in Oregon it's called Career Aligned Mastery (CAM). For privacy reasons I will not put my resume up, but I have some questions.  Is it appropriate to list my tutor as a reference? If I'm applying for a summer job online can I say that I have a high school diploma? I have not graduated yet, but I will by the time I've started working there. Finally, do I mention the CAM or will they not care?   Context: you can get as much as you want, whenever you want, totally for free. BUT the drug has not been studied, so there is no way of knowing if it will screw you up in the long run.   NZT-48 is the pill from the movie Limitless.  My answer: Yes I would. A drug that unlocks every scrap of information you have ever heard or seen in your life while simultaneously giving you limitless motivation is too good to pass up.   Did you notice any changes to your senses or your physical abilities? Do you have any stories that you feel like sharing?   It'll be primarily on flat, paved, bike paths. I'm looking at the mercier kilo TT and the Fuji track classic right now. I'd like to get a single speed for ease of use, but I'd consider geared bicycles. Fixies without a flip flop hub are out of the question. On both those bikes I would replace the handlebars, and put a second rear brake lever on the drop bar. Any other suggestions? My budget is $650.   Hey all! In preparation for college next year I've decided to start trying to live on less than $50.00 per week including food, transportation, and entertainment. Today I decided to spend a bit extra on lunch because I've started riding my bike instead of driving. The review will be broken into two parts: The angry whopper, and BK's new satisfries.  Angry Whopper: Initially I was going to get chicken strips, but when I saw the pic of the angry whopper I had to try it. It's your standard sized whopper with pepperjack, bacon, jalapenoes, and a spicy sauce. The picture made it seem like they would put french fries on the burger for you, however mine did not. I sat down in the BK and opened the box. The burger looked similar to the picture. It is pretty messy. It wasn't too spicy it just had enough kick to the point that you could feel it. all in all 7/10 (on the fast food scale).  Satisfries: (medium size) These were the reason I went to BK. I had been wanting to try them. They are crinkle cut, and healthier than the classic BK french fries. I didn't get ketchup so I just a them plain which was fine because they are decently salty. They're not crispy at all. I would compare them in terms of size and texture to steak fries. Despite the mixed reviews I enjoyed them. They have more of the soft potato filler stuff in them than your stereotypical fast food french fry. They tasted like the fries at 5 guys except less greasy. 8/10 just don't expect them to taste like BK's classic fries.  	165
 DO NOT DARE INSULT HER CROWN OF DICK   So...spread it like butta isn't the appropriate response then. Got it.   FOLLOW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD   NOW GO TO HER - EARN YOUR NAME SON   I believe it's: "Why can't sheeple see THE GOVERNMENT IS EVIL!"  Then the next day: "Why can't sheeple see that ONLY GOVERNMENT NEEDS POWERFUL GUNS!"  It's pretty sad, actually.         YOU CLEARLY LACK HIS HOLY NIGGERNESS IN YOUR HEART.

SARAH JESSICA PARKER MADE MY SPACEDICK THROW UP   1,456.   Home Alone did it first.   Retarded people that create retarded children.   Retardation runs deep in this family...   Castrate? I think they meant to sew his vagina shut...   He is gay?   Also, did you know suicide is actually pleasurable according to Faygo University studies?   Jerking it on my couch just got a little bit sexier...   "You sir are clearly a man of less than savory character and I would venture to guess that your parents would not be pleased with these shenanigans were they to hear of them."   Simple, subtle, mild. And very likely true. Got my vote.   There's a 'Psycho' joke in here somewhere but I can't find it. I need coffee.   Gloryholes. Definitely gloryholes.   NOT EVEN TRYING ANYMORE                  I wrote my ex wifes employer and mailed them copies of all the emails she was exchanging with her 20+ year older boss, who she was also having sex with in his office.   My only regret is Facebook didn't exist at the time so I couldn't show them to everybody, they were pretty damn funny. I remember one line "I miss your love box". I am not kidding.   In hindsight, what do you feel now about it? Are you better off? Do you wish you could undo it? Do you wish you could have done more?   'Cardiac arrest' is to 'stroke' what 'Kim Kardashian' is to 'deserves to live'.   Passing through the bricks over the pipe at the end of level 1-2 and walking through the wall in Super Mario Bros takes you to a bullshit never ending water death trap built by masochistic assholes.         The police were laughing at you getting hit. Not you hitting the hood of the car. What you saw: "Decked out in awesome threads". What they saw: "Drugged out metalhead jumped into traffic".   So you found a poster in Germany but decided to post a tiny shit res picture instead....  lrn2 pictures with phones   THIS COLLECTION SUCKS DICK. THIS IS GAYER THAN TWO MEN FUCKING EACHOTHERS ASSHOLES WITH SHIT COVERED DICKS WHILE STREAMING VIDEO OF IT ON LOOKHOWGAYWEARE.COM   I've seen video of victims falling from the burning towers on 9/11 that was funnier than this.         I bet he put it in her butt.   Newsflash: white trash hick can't let go of his past.    Israel opts to keep him. He isn't leading them anywhere they don't want to go.   And they call us 'cattle'....   I don't believe anything can make Somalia worse...   The name is so gay I will never click it.                   Let me guess, you were voted "Most likely to get a joke" in high school, weren't you?  You have a gift, sir. You have a genuine gift.   I like this one. It has a more educated ring to it. "Excuse me gentlemen, while I appreciate the plethora of penii, I must ask you to form a single-file line for the sake of order."   Definitely going with that one.   Responding to a post, I stumbled upon this age-old issue. Penis's, penises, penii? What do you use when you're discussing multiple male genitalia?   LPSG.com.  It's a support group for men suffering from the affliction of large penis's. Penises? Penii?   Large Penis Support Group.   Secret conservative hot gay man/meth sex exposed in the media is honestly the best.            giving US citizens a trial before imprisoning them indefinitely or targeting them in drone strikes is important. Stopping the war against drug users and reducing the burden on our law enforcement and our prison systems is important.       Just like those socialist nurse unions...everyone hates them until they need them.   This story disturbs me. It's like something out of a weird dark comedy...still not sure if serious.      I'm willing to bet every person bitching about Red Cross response has never donated money nor blood to them.      Was that wrong? Should I not have done that? I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to plead ignorance on this thing, because if I had known that sort of thing was frowned upon...      I'd dress her in a Smurfette costume, paint her blue and live out my longest fantasy.      Hey thanks! We are just visiting, our first concert was a musician who is playing there later this month, we're driving in from DC area. Our place took some damage but nothing compared to the people up north. Thanks though!   Ha! That's funny because dead people and flooding, I get it.   Going to the club le poisson rouge in Greenwich Village later this month for our anniversary, would like a hotel in the vicinityof the club. I've never been to this area before and it's my fiancees first time in NYC at all (moved here from Europe a few years ago).  I'd like to give her a great NYC experience for her first time, so looking for smaller non-chain hotel and restaurant suggestions while we're in town (two days).   Any advice welcome, thank you!     Depending on the state, you can actually sue them for this. Alternatively, wait until they leave their place, then force your way in and sit on their couch naked until they get home. Ask them "How does it feel" then walk out.      Yeah, I worked for a government military agency for years and...it was awful. I just pretended. "Yeah guys, can you believe he didn't get that 3 yard down from the field goal line". Then everyone stares, assumes I'm kidding and keeps going.   It's tough lol   Thought others may be interested in the benefit show coming up 11/15 at (le) poisson rouge in NYC for  "the peoples bailout". Hosts include Janeane Garofalo and Lizz Winstead with a great collaborative lineup.   Thought I'd pass it on!      Exactly   This is my take on it currently. I am not sure why anyone would use read receipts dealing with someone 1:1 regularly unless they are being prickish though.   A recent debate between myself and some coworkers got me thinking - is it rude to request a read receipt in Outlook? On one hand, a receipt allows you to be thorough when dealing with a given issue but on the other hand it can convey that you don't trust someone is going to read the email in a timely manner.  Interested in the opinions of others on this.   "Be careful of the curse that falls on your lovers". Rings true every time.   I have no idea how football works. At all.   Poppycock.   Be lucky someone is helping you and stop bitching about it.               There are no keys on my keyboard that can replicate the sound that I just made.   OK, this has potential too. Checking Netflix.   This was on television just a day or two ago. I watched about three minutes of it and have to agree that it was pretty damn bad, but it lacked that "oomph" that made me both awe-struck and sick to my stomach and that's what I'm hoping I can find...   WTF am i reading.jpg   But it really isn't. It's bad, but it isn't even 'Jersey Girl' bad. It just sucks in a mediocre way.   Believe it or not I have, but it was such an old film they had no idea what they were doing - I have to kind of forgive it for its ignorance...   This has potential. I have not seen this but am hunting the DVD right now.   I have seen 'The Room'. I have seen 'Troll 2'. I have even seen a Madea film. I do not believe these are the worst. I am looking for a movie that meets the following criteria: It is awful in acting, production, script and effects but DOES NOT KNOW IT. A movie that actually tries to be good and fails in every way.  Please help me find this holy grail. I know it is out there, waiting for me to hate it.   I bet Mandle was Michael Jacksons user name online.   It's not Fark. That's enough for me.   I hope you get gangraped by Ugandan chimpanzees and catch Michael BAIDS         I have never interviewed someone and considered their major. A BS is a BS. Apply for what you want, just be willing to start low and be prepared to work your way up. Good luck.   I told Michael Jackson that Propofol is pretty cool and told him to think about trying it.   I prefer to call them fondletops. It makes owning one feel dirty and illegal.   I'm going for a Surface, but not suggesting it until I have time to really use it.   It's the PBR tallboys talking. I heard he is a good guy when he's not drunk looking to start a fight at Dave and Busters.   Because Israel tells us to.   I just all over myself.   Jigglypuff. I have insomnia.      Those victims would all be too old for him now, I'd think.      I larfed        	118

Does anyone know how to get stationed here? Also could you give me a break down of how everyday is at this duty station?    Would a website that you could rate your leadership be a good idea? I noticed how sometimes good leaders aren't recognized and toxic leaders fly under the radar. If there were a website that let everyone know how good of a leader they actually were would it help the problem? How would you stop reviews from becoming spammed by grudges or vendettas?      	172

 Most people outline their book first, but for me, simply writing works better. I let my imagination flow as I write and it works better than thinking every detail and scenes before you actually write it.  At the end it depends on what works better for you. Try different approaches, good luck!    Hey Reddit. First of all, sorry for any English mistakes, I live outside the US.  So about 3 months ago I met this incredible girl online, she sounded perfect for me (though that may be troubling as alot of girls I talk to sound perfect to me). I'm pretty good at having a conversation, and we began talking for hours each day.  After about a few weeks, our topics began to change and become more serious, and I told her things that I never told my best friends that I've known since childhood. She was also pretty good looking and I believed she was my next girlfriend.  The problem begins when I ran out of topics. I don't think that this has anything to do with her, she didn't do anything wrong (in fact she seemed to hold a conversation better than other girls that I've previously talked to), but you probably agree that after having such 'heavy topics' going to casual is simply boring and gives a feeling of disappointment.  **TL;DR: So, today, after not talking with her for a week I told her that I have a girlfriend (which I dont), because I felt like I ran out of serious topics, and falling into 'casual/ boring' talks would simply be a disappointment.**  By saying this, our 'relationship' is basically terminated. Do you think I made the right decision? I'm pretty confused because in the past I broke up for silly reasons and I was miserable later.  I'll be happy to hear your guys thoughts. Thanks for reading!   Bad descriptions of a 'beautiful' person.   Unlimited supply of coffee.   Can someone explain why this program is so recommended? What does it offer better than Word or any other writing software?       Look at those 2 images: http://www.wallsave.com/wallpapers/1280x700/creed/990934/creed-movie-assassin-s-ii-select-your-quality-990934.jpg http://s.wallpaperhere.com/wallpapers/1280x720/20110702/assassins-creed-brotherhood-20101017102243981.jpg  What is the name of those red things on the floor? It apperas as red roses leaves, but I'm not sure. Maybe you know?   Sorry for any English mistakes at the title (or here).  For exmample- This picture shows what I mean: http://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Paris-June-2010_660.jpg I mean a word that describes the Eiffel Tower from distance. Thanks (:   For all of you, do you read books naturally? I know that for me, and other people who suffer from ADD/ADHD it's difficult to read long novels.    I've changed its outline more than ten times including everything possible so I don't know if that's considered as one novel. I began last year, and I'm actually writing a few other novels at the same time so it might take a while to finish. I think that it ended up more of a practice than an actual novel that you can publish.   Bravo.  I've Never heard of those methods before, I'll definitely try tomorrow. By the way, how can you write 2,500-4,000 words? How much hours does it take?   So I'm 16 and diagnosed with ADD (Overfocused ADD). It doesnt let me read books or write more than an hour unless I smoke (marijuana), drink (coffee), or take something (Ritalin). So, if anyone else has ADD/ADHD and has ways of overcoming it without these things, reply below.  Thanks (:   Freddie   Madlib did a pretty nice job (;   Don't force yourself to write. It will only make you hate writing, and you don't what that to happen. After you're in the 'mood' for writing, install a Chrome extension called "StayFocused". It helped me to write and not finding myself stuck in Facebook   Twitter. If this is the first time you write, you will most certainly find yourself hating your stories. That's the first step every writer goes through, untill they improve (which is why I said that it comes with experience). Also, put on some music that will help you get into the mood, and drink coffee (if you're serious, google a few tips on how to improve creativity and stay focused).   I heard: Daughter, James (can't remember his full name), and a bunch of other unknown artists, but none of them delivered the same experience as For Emma Forever Ago. Do you guys know anyone? Even famous bands because I might not know them.  Thanks (:      I have an outline, but I found out that writing without a plan works better for me. I just drink a cup of coffee and type without thinking, I let my imagination flow and it usually works great.    I think it comes with experience... Write SOMETHING, and you'll begin to see what works better and what doesn't. There're also many threads about how to to improve writing.  Good luck!    Scenes and descriptions.   I have many parts of my story which seem like clichs. How to deal with those?   If you don't care about imperfections(unfortunately I do), then I don't see much of a problem. If you do, you should probably imagine the entire scenes in your head before writing so you could describe it easier.  Good luck!    I don't know where to begin.. I only told this today to a friend of mine. The feelings about my grandpa came back to me. I tried not to think about him, and whenever I do it's like I came back to that place in my mind which reminds me of that feeling that hit me. I don't know if the memories I have from him are still true, there aren't many left of those at all. I still remember how I came home from school, I was about 11 years old and I saw you at the kitchen, making your famous Grilled Chilcken, which I used to adore and ran around the house from excietment whenever I smelled it. I didn't say anything special, but went to my room and watched TV.  The next day, mamma's crying woke me up and later I understood that you died. It was the first time I felt death, and it sucked. A mix of depression and anger, and I didn't know how to react. I had nothing to do, nothing would bring you back. Nothing. When I went to school I was so depressed and escaped it and though about all the memories I had left from you. I said to myself that I would take a bullet to keep you alive, and it was true. Tears, and more tears.. That's all I remember and they are coming back now. It sucks, it's terrible feeling and I never told to anyone about this. It doesn't matter... You were the closest person to my life, and I never told you that. You gave me unconditional love, protected me whenever mamma and dad blamed me for anything and gave me money for toys, and I never returned it to you. I never explained to you how I freaking loved you, never.  A year later ,I began playing on piano, which is the best thing I do today. Mamma always saying to me how you couldn't hear me play.. You adored Classical Music.  I'm done, I'm about to cry again like crazy and my sister in the other room, so that's it. Rest in Peace, Boris.    It's awesome! Do you have any more silimar?   This one- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bosouX_d8Y    They're all good, but they're different. I'm looking for something with piano, something calm with a pleasent voice to hear. Those pieces are a little bit more 'agressive'. As @madcowbomber said, the Requiem is beutiful but it's a different style than the song I mentioned. Another example of somethig similar (it's without a piano, but it's still good.

                            Fartney 2012   I watched the IGN review of Halo 4, and never have I ever seen such incredible amounts of ass kissing in my life. The reviewer was literally embarrassing to listen to because he acted like he was blown away and was about as bad at acting as the new Master Chief voice actor. I own Halo 4 and aside from graphics, the gameplay is identical to previous iterations. Nothing about it should appeal Halo fans who actually want the series to progress, because sadly, it has not. So, I ask you, do you think these reviewers get paid to say nice things?    We obviously know that our country is fucked and ran by a bunch of rich faggots. Our two party system is the biggest joke in the world and half our population stands by idly and bickers about Obama and Romney. I'm sick of just reading about how screwed up everything is, I'm ready to do something about it. What do we do? How do we give this country back to its people? It's obviously not gonna start at the ballot.                I would hope everyone is aware of this website         Why don't they talk about the 3rd party candidates? They seem more preferable to me than Romney or Obama anyway.      It always seems like they form near Florida, respectively. But Y NO South Cali???   Tonight I met someone who was beautiful, nice, had a good sense of humor and was just generally everything I was looking for. We then somehow got onto the topic of Religion and I expressed my faith in Jesus and she expressed that she is "Spiritual". It didn't end in argument, and it allowed me to share my testimony, etc. Fortunately, it didn't make things weird or anything. I would just like some advice from Christians if this would be wise to pursue if the possibility presented itself. I know what the answers are going to be, so please, help me to understand, because this person seems to be something special that doesn't come along very often. Thank you.   EDIT: apparently she has a boyfriend. sweet.      I find if the kills in a multiplayer game get repetitive, the entire game gets old very fast. What do you guys think of the kills and rag doll thus far? Also, what kinds of things are deal breakers for you and a new game?               With the advent of rag doll, and Euphoria physics used in games like GTA, and Backbreaker, why don't more games shy away from rehashed and reused death animations that make kills in games like Halo and CoD less satisfying and more repetitive?   I play a shooter to have fun killing things, not see the same thing over and over again.          I've always loved the atmosphere Lovecraft creates with his description of entering tombs, down spiral stair cases with no light except a torch. Or the insanity that is instilled through the rising of Cthulu. Anything from his stories would be fantastic. Thank you :)   I'll start.   I remember when the "Passion of the Christ" came out and hearing somebody say, "The Pope came forward today and has declared after viewing 'the Passion' that, 'It is, as it was' ".   That pissed me off because, since when is the Pope the king of God?  Then I realized that a lot of the Catholics viewing this movie would have trusted the Pope's opinion. But that still doesn't make sense to me.       I visit, gmail; facebook; turntable.fm; ign; youtube; youjizz; and a few other lame sites. What are your most common?                                       just curious      After two months since the release of Counter Strike: Global Offensive on Xbox, there is still not a single patch or update that allows you to actually play with your friends. What the fuck is the point of buying the game!? Go fuck yourself Gabe.       Any ideas on how much the part and cost of labor would turn out to be?  I live in PA if that matters.      Please be honest. I think some real life stories of healing, and other amazing experiences through God would bring great joy and increased faith to everyone here :)  EDIT: Thanks for all the stories and experiences, and I pray everyone has been strengthened in their faith through reading them. Keep em' coming! :D   A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.  Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.  "They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.  "Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.  "I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum.                     here's a .gif    EDIT: annnnd....it's gone!   She even munched Mila Kunis' rug pro bono  EDIT: pro boner    Failed it for the second time. Did 100 Questions a day for a month and a half - KAPLAN online resources.  Not sure how to approach it this time around. For those who passed, please explain to me the specific manner in which you went about studying so I can emulate that and also pass. Thanks :) also pray for me if you could.    took it today 8/30/12  0800-1245  -Got 245 Questions -Finished the test on a Multiple Answer Question (not sure if I got it right, also not sure if that's a positive sign) -got quite a few multiple answer questions, probably around 10-15 (still not sure if thats a good thing, but i hear those are higher end questions) -only got 3 dosage calc out of 245 (which I hear the less dosage calc, the better)  Overall the test was really hard, but i feel i knew more than I did the first time (still not much lol). Was just looking for thoughts, ideas and support. :)  Thanks!      Sweden                  I lopped off my dick with less-than-average sharp scissors.  And then I buried my sleeping 3 day old infant underground. I doubt she's woken up yet.   EDIT: don't tell mom   All I see on Reddit is negative statements about Romney, which I understand. But, why nothing about Obama? Why does this site lean so far left that it seems almost to refuse to give any sort of basic criticism to our current president? You would think, even by chance, that at least a few articles would make it to the front page once and a while. Am I the only one who notices this bias?...   EDIT: Since I have you all here, I will now proceed to revealing that Satan runs this world, and dominates both the democratic and republican parties you all hold so dear. He is currently perverting the Jewish Zionists to use their endless stream of finances to rule everything you thought was for you: MEDIA, MILITARY, BANKS, and of course POLITICS.   OBAMA is a shill, no different than BUSH and you all will live to see World War III. 9/11 was an inside job. Get off your knees and fight back   RON PAUL 2012 - or Gary Johnson if we have to...sigh   All I see on Reddit is negative statements about Romney, which I understand. But, why nothing about Obama? Why does this site lean so far left that it seems almost to refuse to give any sort of basic criticism to our current president? You would think, even by chance, that at least a few articles would make it to the front page once and a while. Am I the only one who notices this bias?...                      lately, every game i play i feel bored and as if i've played it already. I was hoping /r/gaming could point me in the direction of a game they've loved oh so much, but maybe not many people played it. Something different, like Shadow of the Colossus. Thanks!   Link; Cost?   I'm just curious to see the differences between history books written at earlier times in the previous century. Thank you Reddit!   What if Ron Paul doesn't win the nomination/presidency? Do we just wait for all the DoomPaul memes to come true and embrace the end of the world or...? What's the plan? Because I don't see much hope without his truth and honesty in office.                The Year: 2064  Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)  "Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion   Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)   Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a  Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"   "Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.   "Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.   "We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices. The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse  divided in half with central a flat surface.   Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"   Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"   "Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"   "Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device, at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.   "Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.   "It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.   As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age, I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly, within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around  in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent  as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.   "Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.   Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson with cheer.   "Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.   "We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.   "What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.   "Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt.    "OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.  "Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be  seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.  Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog.  Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery.   Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his right leg and a grab at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.  "Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction, all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state.  This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing. A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling. Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader. On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.  "God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.  The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!". A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.                                      So i failed my nclex on 7/2/12 in the state of Pennsylvania. I went to the PA dept of state to reapply for the ATT and it said they "You already have a license of this type". And I wasn't sure if I have to wait a period of time before even apply again. They didn't make the whole 45-90 waiting period very clear. Can someone give me a clear explanation on the process I should go through? thanks :)  EDIT: I called. They said if you do a re-exam you need to send in a physical paper application. False alarm, I still failed... :/   So i found out i failed the NCLEX which is the boards or test you need to pass to become a nurse. It sucks, but its obviously not the end of the world. The most frustrating issue was when i broke the news to my father, he was infuriated and continued to make a bunch of outlandish claims like, "things are gonna be changing around here!" and "You can get your own ride down to Harrisburg next time!" (the place of the test) and "This is bullshit!" - as if my failure is more of a detriment to him than it is me. He's not a christian if that's important, and I hate having issues with my dad. He's always been kind of a douche and often makes me feel like an idiot without considering my side of the story. I wanna tell him off but I also want to respect my parents and unfortunately, I still live under his roof until i can pass this stupid test and get a job. Basically, I would really appreciate prayer for passing the NCLEX test and my relationship with my father. Any advice would be cool too. Thanks.     So I took it yesterday, felt like I did horrible. And I mean horrible. Like, I didn't know anything. 230 questions later I was done. I got online the next day and some people said there's a trick you can do where if you try to register again on Pearson-Vue, if you passed, it won't let you go to the credit card screen. Unfortunately, it allowed me to make it to that screen and I feel like that has all but solidified my failure. Which, in turn, makes me feel like a sack of shite. Mainly because, I'll somehow, have to figure out how to change my study habits to pass next time. Which honestly, studying is the bane of my existence. Is there truth to the whole Pearson trick? Encouragement would be nice too ;P   So I took it yesterday, felt like I did horrible. And I mean horrible. Like, I didn't know anything. 230 questions later I was done.

Encouragement would be nice too ;P   Not sure why /r/atheism hates christians so much. Sure, there can be some seriously ignorant followers who piss you off to the fullest extent, but not all christians are advocates of The Crusades. Not all christians molest children and try to tell you what to do. The message promoted by Jesus in the Gospels of the New Testament was that of peace, love and sacrifice. A lot of christians hold true to that and are great members of the community, helping the poor and needy. I know people like the Westboro baptist church are nuts, and a lot of other christians realize it as well. My biggest confusion with /r/atheism is, what's being accomplished by the top upvoted item being Jesus having sex with a goat? Your subreddit is flooded with this stuff. How is that evidence of people who claim to be critical thinkers, and well educated? Most of the time, rather than a legitimate debate, your subreddit is filled with hate. At times I wish the sub was renamed '/r/trolls'. It's not serving anyone. I suggest we take a step back and consider our actions.           What is so simple, any child can understand; Yet, so complex, no wisdom can solve?                         Disclaimer, this is not my own material I simply felt it necessary to share  1694  Bank of England Established  First Central Bank established in the UK. Served as model for most modern central banks.  1744- Mayer Amschel Rothschild, Founder of the Rothschild Banking Empire, is Born in Frankfurt, Germany  Mayer Amschel Rothschild extended his banking empire across Europe by carefully placing his five sons in key positions. They set up banks in Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris. By the mid 1800s they dominated the banking industry, lending to governments around the world and people such as the Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Cecil Rhodes.  1757- Colonial Scrip Issued in US  Debt free, fiat currency was printed in the public interest. As Benjamin Franklin said,  In the colonies we issue our own money. It is called colonial scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay no one.  1776  American Independence  1791  Congress Creates the First US Bank  A Private Company, Partly Owned by Foreigners  to Handle the Financial Needs of the New Central Government  Previously, the 13 states had their own banks, currencies and financial institutions.  1816  The Privately Owned Second Bank of the US was Chartered  It Served as the Main Depository for Government Revenue, Making it a Highly Profitable Bank  1832  Andrew Jackson Campaigns Against the 2nd Bank of the US and Vetoes Bank Charter Renewal  Andrew Jackson was skeptical of the central banking system and believed it gave too few men too much power and caused inflation. He was also a proponent of gold and silver and an outspoken opponent of the 2nd National Bank. The Charter expired in 1836.  1833  President Jackson Issues Executive Order to Stop Depositing Government Funds Into Bank of US  By September 1833, government funds were being deposited into state chartered banks.

Assassin misfired twice.  1833-1837  Manufactured boom created by central bankers  money supply Increases 84%, Spurred by the 2nd Bank of the US  The total money supply rose from $150 million to $267 million.[1]  1837-1843  Terrible Depression  343 of the 850 banks in the US closed entirely as largest banks consolidated wealth and power.[2]  1861  American Civil War  1862-1863 Lincoln Over Rules Debt-Based Money and Issues Greenbacks to Fund the War  Bankers would only lend the government money under certain conditions and at high interest rates, so Lincoln issued his own currency  greenbacks  through the US Treasury, and made them legal tender. His soldiers went on to win the war, followed by great economic expansion.  April 15, 1865  Lincoln Assassinated  1881- President James Garfield, Staunch Proponent of Honest Money Backed by Gold and Silver, was Assassinated  Garfield opposed fiat currency (money that was not backed by any physical object) and was a strong advocate of a bi-metal monetary system. He had the second shortest Presidency in history.  1907- Banking Panic of 1907  The New York Stock Exchange dropped dramatically as everyone tried to get their money out of the banks at the same time across the nation. This banking panic spurred debate for banking reform. JP Morgan and others gathered to create an image of concern and stability in the face of the panic, which eventually led to the formation of the Federal Reserve. The founders of the Federal Reserve pretended like the bankers were opposed to the idea of its formation in order to mislead the public into believing that the Federal Reserve would help to regulate bankers when in fact it really gave even more power to private bankers, but in a less transparent way.  1908  JP Morgan Associate and Rockefeller Relative Nelson Aldrich Heads New National Monetary Commission  Senate Republican leader, Nelson Aldrich, heads the new National Monetary Commission that was created to study the cause of the banking panic. Aldrich had close ties with J.P. Morgan and his daughter married John D. Rockefeller.  1910  Bankers Meet Secretly on Jekyll Island to Draft Federal Reserve Banking Legislation  Over the course of a week, some of the nations most powerful bankers met secretly off the coast of Georgia, drafting a proposal for a private Central Banking system. Those in attendance included Nelson Aldrich, A.P. Andrew (Assistant Secretary of the Treasury), Paul Warburg (Kuhn, Loeb,   Co.), Frank Vanderlip (President of National City Bank of New York), Charles D. Norton (president of the Morgan-dominated First National Bank of New York), Henry Davidson (Senior Partner of JP Morgan Co.), and Benjamin Strong (representing JP Morgan).  Dec 23, 1913  Federal Reserve Act Passed  Two days before Christmas, while many members of Congress were away on vacation, the Federal Reserve Act was passed, creating the Central banking system we have today. It was based on the Aldrich plan drafted on Jekyll Island and gave private bankers supreme authority over the economy. They are now able to create money out of nothing (and loan it out at interest), make decisions without government approval, and control the amount of money in circulation.  1913  Income tax established -16th Amendment Ratified  Taxes ensured that citizens would cover the payment of debt due to the Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, which was also created in 1913.The 16th Amendment stated: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.  1914  JP Morgan and Co. Profits from Financing both sides of War and Purchasing Weapons  J.P. Morgan and Co. made a deal with the Bank of England to give them a monopoly on underwriting war bonds for the UK and France. They also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France.  November 1914  Federal Reserve Banks Open  1921-1929  The Roaring 20s  The Federal Reserve Floods the Economy with Cash and Credit  From 1921 to 1929 the Federal Reserve increased the money supply by $28 billion, almost a 62% increase over an eight-year period.[3] This artificially created another boom.  1929  Federal Reserve Contracts the Money Supply  In 1929, the Federal Reserve began to pull money out of circulation as loans were paid back. They created a bust which was inevitable after issuing so much credit in the years before. The Federal Reserves actions triggered the banking crisis, which led to the Great Depression.  October 24, 1929  Black Thursday, Stock Market Crash  The most devastating stock market crash in history.

CONTINUED IN COMMENTS                                  A lot of crazy youtube sources keep predicting a nuclear and/or biological attack during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Similar to the signs that pointed towards 9/11 occurring. All for the purpose of increased fear and furthered security to unite the world under one totalitarian big brother governing body. Has anyone else heard this? Please, I'm not trying to be crazy with this. I just want to hear peoples' thoughts on this that may have some sort of related information.   source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqGkNslqVxU   I know this is a safe-haven for trolls, but please, no creepy pasta. I'm genuinely interested in real encounters and experiences.                I'm talking about the weirdos and the thespians alike. What's your personal view of someone who openly sings at any given time, without prompt? Even the black dudes who sing to themselves loud as they walk by with their iPhones blaring.       So many people use old testament verses to put down the bible and it's meaning. I personally feel a lot of the crazier stuff of the old testament like Exodus 21 is specifically addressed to the Hebrews of that time and shouldn't be pulled out of context to shut down any biblical argument. What do you think?  EDIT: I don't know, the one thing I've seen for sure is that people with different views need to meet somewhere more personal than the internet. Not to be rude, but this Christianity vs Atheist is the biggest circlejerk on Reddit      I just saw the movie, Prometheus, and even though I can see the events clearly occur before the Alien movie timeline; I'm confused how the movie directly ties in as a prequel. I felt like there were quite a few script holes and plot decisions that didn't make sense. I can't think of many off the top of my head, but the movie left me a bit jaded.   Any ideas my Reddit friends?   My grandmother has cancer that has metastasized (spread) all through her body including her pancreas, liver, spleen, and spinal cord. She is 87 y.o. Her husband, my grandfather, died of cancer 4 years prior and, even though she is cheerful, has never been in good health since. The clear prognosis (likelihood of the disease progression) is terminal (death). Unfortunately, even with that most definite outcome, the physicians (doctors) insist on continuing to perform procedures; of which will be billed to her insurance company.  She suffers from severe back pain, due to the cancer's spinal cord involvement, and the physicians say they want to perform a biopsy (take out a piece of the cancer for examination) to determine the best method of pain control for her palliative care (care for someone who's dying). I, personally, have never heard of a cancer biopsy being necessary to determine specific treatment for pain. Especially palliative.   I know I probably just seem angry and accusative, but I would like my grandmother to spend as much time at home with her family as possible before she passes. I don't want to openly know that the doctors and hospital are just trying to gain a profit from her suffering.   If anyone with personal experience, like someone who encountered a similar situation or someone in the medical field, could shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.  PS - I'm not blood related if anyone wanted to tell me to get early screening etc. :)            I see Michael Ironside (voice of Sam Fisher) is being replaced by a different actor in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. What I don't understand is, if the events takes place after Conviction (where Sam Fisher already seemed like he was getting older), why would they replace him with a young actor with a young voice and it even appears Sam's movement is that of young stud. Why wouldn't they just do a prequel or something, when Sam was just starting to kick ass or something. I donno, I just don't like the taste this is putting in my mouth.    I feel like no one knows what's going on. And don't give me bullshit. You can't tell me that our 21st century minds have any iota of a clue to what the fuck all "THIS" is (the universe etc). All that has come to be is new theories, nothing proven. Life after death is NOT proven or disproven. Although, I've heard a ton more stories of near death/ out of body experiences where people say they've seen something (white light, God, whatever). I mean, holy shit, how can one be so arrogant as to utterly deny something that they have no possible way of understanding. Science is great, and has helped mankind tremendously, but to say it negates a spiritual perspective is outright stupid.  If you believe in atheism so much, why do you come to this subreddit just to be reassured that what you believe is right? Your actions are no different than the religious you shoot down (Culminating in the church of atheism).  Also, its become almost an unsaid duty of atheists to put down religion (that just seems low and also pointless). If what you believe is what you believe and that's the end of it, the need for a community to support your belief is erroneous.  Atheism doesn't help anyone either. At least religion or some sort of discipline gives people hope in something more. All atheism does is spread the word of nothingness and self-service and usually just an underlying way of expressing disgust with religion.  There's also this association with being an atheist and being educated. That's just an outright lie because, education (math, science, history etc) and personal beliefs are almost mutually exclusive and being atheist does not necessitate a higher IQ in any sense.   Take a step back and compare yourself to anyone you know. Your understanding of this world and what's beyond holds no stronger basis than your neighbor. Before you go out of your way to explain to people the lack of an existence of a god/gods, maybe you should step out of your comfort zones and do some searching yourself. Even if that searching is within.  tl;dr - /r/atheism = /r/circlejerk  PS - all those pictures people post of "famous" atheists and their quotes - I've never seen a single one of them smiling 8(            For a male just looking to keep his face clean without using bar soap.   What I've been doing is using dial soap in the shower to clean off the grease and then a moisturizer on my face to keep it from drying out.   I just need something that will clean and moisturize without making me break out.                                                                                                                                                            	199
          Yes he does. The astronomical odds are getting better every day.             I would hope it's a healthy stool with brown coloration.    Just wait until Hillary's people begin the attacks.         like no other old white male    He is and he will. It comes with the territory.             We were pragmatic with favoring Obama over Kucinich. No mas!    I hope they can get something better than a potato to record in the future, but still happy to hear him    awesome, thank you   it's very choppy, is there something better by chance?   Love it. I hope we see this crows get bigger and bigger.   haters gonna hate, ain'ters gonna ain't      I am out of shape and not buff like Ken. If i had him flattened out with both arms around his neck I would have finished him no doubt. I don't care if Ken is over the hill. There is no way he shouldn't have finished that in that position. I don't buy it.   what about old man strength? and the massive  of cycle of steroids Ken just did?    The ease with which Kimbo got up should be convincing enough if Ken's inability to finish was not.    worse! it was fixed   because ken wasn't actually trying to submit him   because it was   I think so.   Ken lost that on purpose! **FIX**   TRT clinic.   Ken is the most fake person in MMA. Kimbo can't even walk, but I am rooting for him to KO Ken.       I honestly think Jimmy might take the job and never give it back, just like Tom did.       for someone who weighs that much? it's short   that's essentially the same question     A very mediocre card.    are you serious? is that why the US wins or is at the top of the medal count every year? you want a list or something?    i don't remember all of those qb's being that good back then, but then again i was a kid   they actually find the guys they are to groom to be Olympians at much younger ages than that  you're right, we do have to incentivize it, both monetarily and with shine   Could crossfit maybe make an impact?    that sounds about right   For the masses, yes it kind of does.    I think you have identified the cause of the problem.   Ilya is only 5'9.   and what happens when all of these guys get old and retire and none of them are around in 2020? :'(   we can't all be andrew luck fans, can we?   Other countries have lifters who are in the olympics at 19 or 20, and our lifters aren't lifting anywhere in the same universe as them. Why are these tiny nobody countries, no offense  I just mean in terms of population and work presence, putting elite lifters up there and we're not? Even North Korea is kicking our butts. North Korea! The country we make fun of all the time and is starving to death.   The rest of the world plays basketball too, right?    *was   I see a lot of black and green lately      I got to see Moon towards the end of his career. He was special.      We have our three major sports and hockey as a 4th major regional sport. Soccer isn't on the radar. We did just beat Germany though, so the future is bright.    thanks, he's been right about so much!   ah, thanks   It bothers me that the Chinese dominate. I respect their athletes, but I wish we'd value weight lifting.    I bet he has had kids play in the NBA and those kids' households looked like [this](http://images.static-bluray.com/reviews/303_1.jpg)   You're rihgt, there could have been many different motives, but cccam's razor = hate crime   how is it unethical? it was a hate crime, it is relevant    Because America is run by corporations and special interests like the NRA (national rifle assocation). They own about 95% of all politicians. They don't serve the interests of the citizenry. Also, our values are defunct. We have mass shootings all the time, but people value extreme gun rights more than they do people's lives. This is why it's a lot easier to purchase a gun than it is to vote.   right now   about what? like which particular bit of his are you referring to? i'm genuinely curious    i'm not caught up on the american lifting scene, hence my question   Not sarcasm. We do though if you consider all the sports.    u want sugar coating?    How is it disgusting? Isn't that exactly what happened?     who?   Thanks. So, we have pretty much nothing? :(   what about the women? anyone there worth keeping an eye on?       P. Manning 39  Brady 38 ^(start of season)  Brees 36  Palmer 35  Romo 35  E. Manning 34         Would we not be hearing about how everyone is violating her? So, why does it seem that nobody realizes James  is being violated?                            Mayweather has already defeated Cotto, Alvarez, and Pacquiao. Amir Khan appears beneath his level.   Why not put Golovkin in front of Mayweather and watch what he can do? Beating an undefeated, soon to be 20 knockouts in a row, and larger fighter would be the most difficult challenge of his apparent options, and if he wins, it would solidify his position as TBE.   **Money** vs **GGG**               HBO does with boxing. It gives more information to the viewer and improves the viewing experience.  The UFC added vegas odds, so why not make this change?          My school offered an unsubsidized loan that covers only half of my tuition. I think I have reached the 57.5k total limit. I have to find the rest of the tuition, a few thousand in nursing school fees, books, etc. I'm male. I have a previous bachelors degree in a social science. 90% of the 57.5k is from nursing school. A $10-15/hr job probably won't cut it.  I could use some realistic ideas. Nothing illegal.                                                         Is it some biological or psychological mechanism? Do people just want to be with themselves? What's going on?                            Fastest 40? Most bench press reps? Best vertical? Best performance at position drills. Etc.         Great engines, horrible name. I get it, they are economical and they give a boost, but could Ford not come up with a more attractive name for their turbocharged engines? "Eco" sounds weak and un-American.                               The Lakers 2015 first round pick of course.  Top 5 protected in 2015, top 3 protected in 2016/7, unprotected in 2018.  Maybe throw in the Suns 2015 first round pick?    Would the sixers be interested in Goran Dragic and or Gerald Green?          Assuming Jose is still the Champ at the time. Would this date be perfect?         	139
 Life expectancy is determined by a variety of factors. If we look at data from info like the CIA Fact book or other popular sources we aim to correlate the expectancy with other variables like GDP, individual household income, growth rate, etc. and surely will come to find that life expectancy surely has increased when looking the basic models of the demographic transitions. Moreover, although we spend a lot of money on health care; health care is still incredibly expensive in the United States. Medicine and other procedures pick the personal pocket more commonly than the pocket of another person in Europe. It's expensive to the person. So we spend a lot of money on health care in order to make it accessible to everyone; however, it is very expensive to the individual and the majority of the wealth in the US goes to the top 1% leaving a reasonable chunk of the population struggling to afford unreasonable medical expenses. In addition, as seen in other comments, our daily habits have a great influence on life expectancy in addition to other factors you can correlate. Ultimately though, we still have a pretty high life expectancy and in terms of population; it's mind blowing to ponder how drastically the world will change if life expectancy increased by let's say... another ten years. All of this is simply crazy. By 2100, the worlds population is predicted to reach 11 billion people. Just some food for thought             Out of everything that's happening in the world this "problem" receives the largest response. Well god damn. Maybe this is the solution to world hunger.   It's "funny" how some will say that the constitution does not explicitly promise our right to privacy. It's even "funnier" that the constitution doesn't promise the rights it explicitly states.    I wonder how all of these comments will change over a period of 100 years.  	7

 Im not a fan of the "waves of zombies from generator being on" but i can see it attracting ones that are already nearby due to noise. Edit: i would also like to add I love the idea of the higher number of people required for progression. A person will always be able to find a group.   Lolwut    Okay i see your point. The only problem for me is if i miss that first shot, im toast.   Often in a group ill choose the sks, because normally someone else has long range, but what would you pick if you were alone?   My goal of this  post is to always have a definitive choice when it comes to these guns. So could you please tell me why the mosin over the sks.   A lot of times thats what i think, but the fact that the mosin is always a one hit kill makes me torn between the two.   Its most likely that same part, but for the Remington 870    Epoch. Best version of dayz out there.   I get that, and there are quite the number Of troll fresh spawns. I wish there was a way to make this work regardless.   Alright, i see where you're coming from. Im just very tired of spawning in, walking for a minute and a half just to get offed by a guy with a mosin on some roof   Just no? No constructive criticism?   	11

 Nice bike!   I was never a big fan of Opinels but I gotta say, that is beautiful.    If you dont mind me asking, what's with the knives on the bottom row 2, 3 and 4 from the left?   I just bought my first Spyderco tenacious about 6 months ago.  They make good stuff.   How big is that blade? I love the knife but seems a little to big for every day carry.   Its tough but I love the challenge.    Down vote this.  I figured it out, I am playing on hardened and I realize I have to press square.   I downloaded the game and played though a part of the prolonge and when I get the the alleyway with tommy he glitches out and won't continue forward.  I can't continue on because the infected guy at the end keeps on killing me.   That lady was right, that homeless man was beaten up by a group of thugs.   Gratuitous.    I always preferred Pepsi.    Watch the movie "under the skin".  You're welcome.   Why orange and green?    Spyderco tenacious.  3.125 inch blade, has a good weight to it feels sturdy and well made just all around a good knife.   3rd base line, section 126, row 3.   Its like an abusive relationship.  They keep on getting socked in the face but always end up crawling back.    I have the same Oliver Winchester knife!!! I have never seen anyone else that has it.  Solid knife.    No, the clip cannot be adjusted.    Its a great knife.  Feels well made and has a good blade on it.   I feel for ya.     The Nobleman, I picked it up in a cutlery store for 25 bucks.      The scene in Hardball where G-baby got shot and they showed his little coffin.  I lost it that that scene.    I have that knife, its a good blade.     Win the player-haters ball.   I have an '82 cb900c.  When I bought it everything worked great.  The only problems I have is that the engine doesn't re-fill the battery and I had to change the tires as well as break pads.     I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker say whore one more God damn time!   This is a good sign.  When the arguement is this extreme you can bet that they're scrambling for a reason to continue on.     I read a short story once where one of the characters was named "fat boy", it was free so I let it slide.     Is this an Xbone exclusive?    Do you know why aspirin are white? Because they work.   that phrase takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to Hannibal.     Does anyone know what she said?   Hannibal.  The entire first season they are winding Will Graham up to become a monster.    That guy has a great pair of tits.   pass on the right = death.   Just assume every time you go out riding the other drivers are blind, deaf and dumb.   Or you can just download them online for free.      Truly fantastic!  There were times I stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning reading that series, really hard to put down those books at times.   	40
 I took him to mean it in that way as well. I see more Akalis carrying than Zeds at the moment though, but that's silver elo. Where I see Akali having an easier play style than Zed (but still damn hard to master) with less fancy mechanics to mess up due to the poor mechanical play from the lower masses.   I don't think WE is useless at the stage in its parts WW works very well with AS and recurve bow and dagger give a lot of AS making his early clears much quicker. At least I always make those two first unless I plan on ganking mid more.   If can vouch for that! Had a game last night went WE first then finished FF went Tabi and SV and RO then BOTRK. Ended a 48 minute game with 10/0/20 the enemy team was ahead for a large amount of the game. Safe to say they flamed me quite hard in post game lobby. I would 100-0 their carries every TF. (Edit for grammar)   A lot of people say to go WE if you are behind when you start ganking and BOTRK if you are ahead. Personally I always start WE then finish FF I usually have enough gold by the time I stack it up to have both. Two tank items depending on team comp and who's fed. Then BOTRK but alas I am a lowly silver player so I'm probably doing it all wrong!   I do agree BOTRK is a stronger item but is a lot more expensive and by hitting the power spike of FF and WE by the 17 minute mark or so I think it helps out a lot more for the early to mid game.   Correct me anyone if you think I'm wrong would like to know if what I'm doing is correct.   Ah ok. I didn't watch the vid because I'm in work just presumed it was for junglers!    I will have to try this, I've lately had great success jungling with ww at silver elo and never once thought that perhaps I should invade solo. High risk high reward I suppose! Although as ww I do always pink my red before going blue at the start anyway so I never get solo countered only by 5 man groups which has happened a fair few times!    I main ww and I use the exact same path and always hit 6 at around the 7 minute mark. I've tried the other routes but find the one you use the most efficient due to his sustain and lack of need to clear both buffs quickly. The only time I will deviate is if I fear being invaded at either buffs.  Also another quick note if you don't already do this is to start with a pink and save your 50 remaining gold for your first back don't waste it on a hp pot at the start its really not needed on ww.  	7
 Thank you. I found pretty much the same job. Looks like my trade is the same as a millwright or industrial machinery mechanic   I was looking for jobs today mostly in the US (I'm from Australia) and couldn't seem to find my trade anywhere. I'm a mechanical fitter tradesman and hold a certificate 3 in mechanical engineering (fitter and machinist) and was wondering if there even is such a trade in the US or anywhere else. Thanks in advance if you reply.    Well I'm glad it's not just me then   Or is it just me?   I was a chewy taco. Thought it was quite good      Looks like Tom from MySpace   the biggest i have in my tool-bag is a 46mm, but I have used a 130mm socket attached to a pneumatic torque multiplier. The smallest one I've undone on it was 1/2 inch but I'd say there is smaller   no sorry, i do regret not taking any, if i get the chance to work on one again i will take some for sure   some days its pretty interesting, when i worked on this machine i had never done so before. But most of the time its fixing the same things   just a bigger bucket really, they are all pretty similar in my eyes   the service trucks we use have a built in 1000L grease storage compartment, pretty much the same method as the one you mentioned though   yes its an open pit iron ore mine in Western Australia   Only 430 hours on the clock, still pretty new   Yeah it was locked out. We had to change a hydraulic line on it (was leaking)   We have service trucks that grease them using compressed air to help deliver the grease      Not sure how much per hour but that machine has a 13,000L diesel fuel tank and only 430 hours   Sorry I'm new to reddit but I shall put it on there. Cheers      no problem. Thanks for asking :)    haha sorry. The bucket can can hold about 35 metric tonne of iron ore. and it's at an open-cut iron ore mine   yeah just to test that it's working properly, and it is as fun as you'd think   I'm a mechanical fitter I had to replace a leaking hydraulic line on it. haha you'd just have to apply for a job and hope for the best         People killed his family... He needs money for karate lessons   Wow seal has really let himself go...   Yolo... Should be banned  	29
                                  The owner just asked me about him just adding Peroni to his mix, which I sort of tut-tutted.  He seems to be genuinely interested in stocking better options than the usual national suspects.  It looks like got cooler space for maybe 24 options.  What do you think?                                                                           If this is an RES thing, please advise and I'll submit there.  I'm stuck with a perpetual -1 next to me.  When I try to upvote or downvote myself, it increases the -1 to -2 and -3, but I can get it back to -1.   I don't know how I did this, but I spent a lot of east coast USA late hours in /r/olympics last week while tipsy.  I think I may have inadvertently tried to upvote a comment I forgot that I had made -- things were moving very fast in say the womens slalom thread.  Maybe I tried upvoting an event thread which were self posts?    Any idea how to set myself back to neutral?                            You have to hand it to NBC.  They suck but sometimes they don't.                              ###**Alpine Skiing - Men's Super-G (16 Feb 11:00)**  ---  11:0 AM MSK 2/16/2014   Venue: Rosa Khutor Alpine Center   Events to be held:  *   [Schedule and results](http://www.sochi2014.com/en/alpine-skiing-men-s-super-g)  ---  [Men's Super-G at Sochi 2014](http://www.sochi2014.com/en/alpine-skiing) | [Men's Super-G on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_2014_Winter_Olympics)  ---    ###**Ice Hockey - Men's Preliminary - USA v Russia (15 Feb 16:30)**  ---  4:30 PM MSK 2/15/2014   Venue:   Events to be held:  *   [Schedule and results](http://www.sochi2014.com/en/ice-hockey-round-preliminary-men)  ---  [Men's Preliminary at Sochi 2014](http://www.sochi2014.com/en/ice-hockey) | [Men's Preliminary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2014_Winter_Olympics)  ---       ###**Alpine Skiing - Women's Super-G (15 Feb 11:00)**  ---  11:0 AM MSK 2/15/2014   Venue: Rosa Khutor Alpine Center   Events to be held:  *   [Schedule and results](http://www.sochi2014.com/en/alpine-skiing-ladies-super-g)  ---  [Women's Super-G at Sochi 2014](http://www.sochi2014.com/en/alpine-skiing) | [Women's Super-G on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_2014_Winter_Olympics)  ---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Could somebody bring me up to date on the locket?

       feels like. sword is moving through my stomach. and then my 5th or 6th trip to the bathroom the last couple of bowel movements that come out they sting, badly. Some of it is just mucus but it stings when it passes through.   fucking awful. I fainted on the toilet for 45 minutes. I woke up on the floor with blood and mucus/poop on my leg. and my head hurt. awful make stop.          I will be answering questions for my cat, Fred who wanted to do an AMA.       No categories. Top 5 of everything.       A family walks into a talent agency. It's a father, mother, son, daughter and dog. The father says to the talent agent, "We have a really amazing act. You should represent us."  The agent says, "Sorry, I don't represent family acts. They're a little too cute."  The mother says, "Sir, if you just see our act, we know you would want to represent us."  The agent says, "OK. OK. I'll take a look."  The father pulls out a watermelon and shoves it in the daughters vagina. The daughter screams in pain from the giant fruit. Then the son takes off his shirt revealing a pink bra and starts fingering himself in the asshole. The mother takes off all of her clothes and starts to finger herself while the father feeds her x-lax pills. The father grabs the daughter and shoves her face right in the mothers butt hole that at that moment exploded with diarrhea all over her face and it filled up her mouth. The the daughter turned to the son and spat the diarrhea all over him. Then the father reaches in the girls vagina and pulls out the now stinky, cum covered watermelon and starts to hump it while the mother begins to shoot her explosive diarrhea in his direction. Then the son begins to rub his cock and cums all over the daughter. Then the father stops humping the watermelon and cums all over her. They continue to cum on her while the mother fills up a plastic kiddie pool with her crap and piss. They all jump in the human excrement and start to fuck each other. Now the pool is filled with cum and shit and piss.   They jump out of the pool covered in cum and shit and piss and say "tada!".   For the longest time, the agent just sits in silence. Finally, he manages, "That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?"  And the father says, **"The Aristocrats!"**           it*                        Keep in mind I'm American and now nothing on European Soccer.                                           I've been in the profession for 3-4 years now. AMA!   I noticed this is a movie a lot of people enjoyed. Is there something I'm missing with this movie? It's seem really highly rated but when I watch it there's no endearing quality about it, it's just a cheesy humor, action flick with not so great montages of a kid training while we watch the villain plot. Is this like a homage or satire?   What am I missing? I feel like there's a joke and I missed it.                         So about 6-7 months ago I told my best friend at the time that his behavior was unacceptable when he got drunk: Example: Overly aggressive, violent, angry, mean, physical, arrogant, and insulting when he gets drunk. One night was the icing on the cake for me, and I told him when he was sober how I felt and that I think he might have a problem. Irregardless if he believes that he does, I didn't want to be around him when he drinks anymore because he treats people badly.   In perfect him fashion, he said he disagrees with everything I said and never wants to talk to me about it again.   Systematically the few months after that all of my friends stopped talking to me and asking me to hang out. Now i have no friends where I live and it makes me wonder if I had just gone along with it and put up with it maybe I will still have friends.   None of them have spoken to me at all in the past 4 months.                   Guardians of the Galaxy   This happened many many years ago when I was in 5th grade but I was reminded of it today when I got a hard on.   I used to think when I was younger that us men got boners because it meant we had to pee and the stiffy meant the penis was full of urine.   So one day in class during silent reading time, I had an erection and stood up and walked to my teacher and asked if I may go to the bathroom. I was standing there with my pre-pubescent dick with a pitched tent and my teacher gave me the strangest look. I didn't think anything of it, I thought this was normal and all boys walked around like this when having to drain the snake.   I went and finished my business and my member was flaccid again so I went back in the room and everyone was still looking at me. Later at recess people kept calling me Masturbating Matt and that set the tone for the rest of elementary school and middle school for me until I went to a high school where no one knew me.   tl;dr thought my shaft getting rigor mortis meant it was time to go to the bathroom.       Missing person somewhere in Texas last seen:  My friend Thomas W. has been missing for over a week. He lives in Columbus Ohio and his last known whereabouts were somewhere in Texas where he was doing a job of some sort. He does not do drugs so this is very out of his character. He is also a father and needs to be found. If you know anything at all please PM me for facebook info.  Or if you know how to check hospitals or some type of database. He's never been in trouble or anything, but has been missing and his family is concerned.  [Current Picture](http://imgur.com/AFeRkJ1)         I wanted to take the time to thank Reddit and people on here for coming together to help the people in Nepal this past few days. We created /r/NepalEarthquake   /r/LangtangRelief both awesome subreddits. Watching it unfold has been extremely motivating, seeing people work together tirelessly.   We got all this info from people in Nepal, someone who is even talking to people in Langtang via SAT phone to see what they need food wise. News articles, local contact, helping one another find lost ones or missing ones with a missing/found google doc database.   I find it fascinating   motivating how beautifully the internet can be used to resource and connect people so quickly.   The /r/NepalEarthquake subreddit is really awesome seeing how fast people have compiled a compendium of everything so quickly- with the sole purpose of helping one another.    It's fascinating to see the results of what happens when people work as a part of a global team.  Thanks for listening to my ramble. I just wanted to say thank you reddit. You're awesome.   TL;DR - Motivated by Redditors working together to help Nepal Earthquake victims.      It's rare.   **bagpipper-onnen (OP)**: MacFarlane has to be bangin Amanda Seyfriend, he's casting her in everything he does.   **AckleyKid1990**: Yeah wow he's cast her in two whole movies. That's insane. If that's how it works, Leo Dicaprio and Scorcese must be married with three kids, a poodle, a couple of Prius' and a beach house in Lake Geneva by now.   **theshape26**:Yep, DiCaprio and Scorsese are together. It's a long story. Now, it's never been publicly revealed but from 1973 to 1995, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro were an item. Unfortunately, Scorsese caught De Niro in bed with Joe Pesci and they broke up. Scorsese stopped casting De Niro   Joe Pesci's career pretty much died.   Then in 2001, Scorsese ran into DiCaprio at a party and they started talking. They had met in 1993 when Leo was still a teen, at the premiere of This Boy's Life. They were introduced by... Robert De Niro!   By the way, for those wondering, De Niro and Pesci broke up in 2006 and in 2011, De Niro started an affair with Bradley Cooper. They also knew each other from before when they briefly talked, at The Actor's Studio when De Niro was a guest in 1998.     I'm hoping there is some existing software out there that would accept a google spreadsheet, and render them as points in a map  I'm not familiar with GIS much, wondering if anyone may be able to help?                         your*            Fuck you Disney/Pixar. Fuck you. The first ten minutes...really? Well fuck you.                      Every time I've used that word/acronym with people it ends up being responses like "oh i get that when i eat taco bell, just take some tums or stop eating pizza youll be fine." We should just called CCD or Colitis   Crohn's Disease. Please it would be a major help if you all in this community could sign my .gov petition and pass it on to people so the government may help us change it as a medical term.    http://wh.gov/iBX6z   Thank you. :)           I saw a cool ranch Doritos chip laying on the ground near my dinner table, must have been dropped on the ground when I had a snack several hours earlier in the day. I ate it. It tasted like cat urine, because my cat had urinated on it.   Surprisingly, cat urine tastes a lot like cool ranch Doritos, the aftertaste on my breath at least. My own fault. I knew my cat was looking to get back at me for giving him a bath a week ago, I just didn't know this would be his plan. The feud lives on Brian.    TL;DR: Ate chip soaked in cat urine.       So I have just about finished season one of Twin Peaks. A couple things I would like to ask:   Among fans of Twin Peaks, is there a running joke about how many times Agent Cooper drinks coffee, or how excited he is every episode when he gets an amazing cup of coffee, minus fish in the one sip he had.   I can't tell if some of it is bad acting or if it is done purposely, there are some really hilarious lines. I really feel bad for the girl's dad, but ...damn if it wasn't hilarious watching him try to dance to those swing/big band songs that kept coming on. Should I be laughing at that? lol  I have never seen any David Lynch before, so I am new to his creations and style of directing.   I was told to watch the movie after I am finished with season 2, is this correct? It looks like a prequel though, is it worth watching?    EDIT: Just finished Episode 8 with the cliffhanger of an ending. Wow. Season 1 was marvelous if for nothing else than that wonderful soundtrack of glory. Running theme of the first season: Almost every female relationship the female is being abused somehow.   I knew I recognized James from somewhere, he was also in A Few Good Men.              Just watched the first episode of Twin Peaks for the first time, why is this guy (on the right) randomly doing a strange wormy jig off camera in the background? It's so random...made me laugh out loud. Is this show full of random quirks like this?   I was originally recommended to watch this show because I love the X-Files, I recognize the music will be a bit weird because this came out 25 years ago, but it seems to be rich full of randomness that just makes me giggle and I love it.    Here's the link http://i.imgur.com/ZxXXxOm   I work a Lowe's and I was chatting with a customer for about twenty minutes about paint mixtures. We had been joking back and forth, and I called her a jerk out of sarcasm/joke. It was clear it was a joke. She says I need to learn how to talk to people because saying things like that is what gets people killed.......      I was in my car driving home from Easter Dinner with my mum and a large white spider started crawling across my windshield. I was almost home so I pulled over and put my emergency lights on.    After this I tried to kill him with my hands but he foiled my attempts at squashing with my clumsy hands and he landed on the passenger side dashboard. I then got a bunch of paper I had laying around in my passenger sit and rolled it up to swat him.    For whatever reason he survived it and fell on my passenger seat then he scurried away onto the passenger side ground among all the trash I had laying there.   The worst possible outcome happened. I lost sight of him. He disappeared. I drove home with my car lights on keeping a watchful eye on that side of the car. Then I got home..not sure if I'll ever drive that car again   EDIT: Spider dead. Went down to my car to try and retrieve my cellphone this morning and I saw him crouched against the weather stripping on the driver's side window on the inside. I rolled my window down and he started crawling out on the outside door frame. I threw water on him. He fell to the ground. I stepped on him. I can drive my car now.       It was on An Corp, somehow it stopped, was on UOF, now it's on UO:R almost every night...weirdly in the middle of the night which seems dumb because it's not in prime time but...wtf? I don't understand, why can't they just stop.   Anyone else see this movie? It has Casey Affleck and Myatt Damon in it. I made my brother watch it and it was the worst 100 minutes of his life so he tells. What do you all think?    I just watched Going Clear, I understand it's subjective, but this is one question I have had.    EDIT: Would like to tag as Serious.   In Columbus, Ohio I have found that public toilets have been raised at least 6-10 inches, in several places. I don't know if this is nationwide but what would the rationale for it be? We're not getting any taller on average as American Men.       My best friend has a girlfriend who is from another country (one of the Scandinavian countries i dont want to say which dont want to give away their identity or anything). She got a school visa to come to school here. She graduated from undergrad, then she got her graduate degree as well. She is currently working at a job, but they will not help her stay by saying they absolutely need her or whatever on her immigration forms for a visa. She has an immigration firm that is helping her with the massive application process but she is going to have to move away in 4-5 months and be deported if she does not figure out another way.   They could get married, theyve been dating for a while, but they don't want to do that because it wouldn't be "sincere." I mean they do love each other, but not ready for marriage and yet neither one wants her to go. She wants to stay, he wants her to stay.   I want to be able to help because I hate seeing him sad. I know her place of employment had to fill out a certain section of her application and they refused to which I guess was the only way she could stay? Any advice?

Thanks :)   I worked as a manager of Blockbuster Video from 2005-2010. I started as a CSR for the first year then was promoted to Shift Lead, then Ast. Store Manager.   I'm not really sure what I would show you as proof, I don't really have anything like an old name tag or anything like that. My knowledge to your questions will have to be the proof lol.                   I'm a former shift lead/manager. I'll post mine in the comment section  Edit: specific walk-in experience stories      hopefully original enough. Who would be your allies, if any? What powers if any would you have? 2D Sonic style? Or 3D? FPS? RPG? Or maybe you're game would be Guitar Hero or Rock Band? Lay out your game in the comments!   http://schoolcounselingfilms.blogspot.com/  I'm in graduate school for school counseling so I had to make a blog and this is what I came up with. Still a work in progress but I like the premise.     I cried at the scene in 28 days later where Jim finds his parents dead holding a photograph of his younger self. I dunno why, it's just heartbreaking. It's not typically a movie I would cry in like in The Notebook or something.             Has to be in the same exact order anytime you speak, same exact phrasing and words. Anytime someone asks you a question or talks to you, this is all you can say to them in person, phone, internet, school, everything.             Why was it cancelled in 2010? I thought it was excellent.    I posted this as a comment on Ask Reddit on a question about what is the strangest house rule you have come across in your life. This is mine. Someone suggested I put it in /r/creepy and while I am not sure if it is up to part with some of the other posts I have seen here and I have no pictures...here is Cuddle time.   When I was ten years old, my friend's family had something called cuddle time. When cuddle time started, my friend, his parents, his autistic brother, and his other younger brother would get into bed naked and cuddle. I'm not joking. Luckily, I didn't have to and I left the house and haven't spoken with him since. Literally I walked out the door and walked to a payphone and called my mom. Creepiest shit I ever witnessed. It irks me to this day.  I mean...the way it started out was just bizarre. Anyone ever seen Clerks 2? The way Randall looks at Elias when he tells the story of pillow pants? That's how I looked at my friend and his family when he told me it was "cuddle time"   He started taking his clothes off in front of me, like it wasn't a big deal and it was completely normal and I should join them. In their defense, they said I didn't have to. They said it's just something they do for family unity or bonding or some shit. I dunno. I got the fuck out.             Around 6PM today I ate a piece of chocolate. About five minutes later I realized I had to go poop. I went to go poop and it was one of the worst experiences I have had pooping in a long time. I was in there for two hours.   It felt like having a double edged sword swimming around im my stomach constantly laughing at my plight. The laughing would signify the bubble/stomach groans I often felt in the middle, like my stomach was a goblet of fire.   To make matters worse I was reading that reddit post that was on the front page a day or so ago asking the question of whether or not a fart can overtake a poop or vice versa in the intestine. I pondered this questions while pooping on my own as I would poop then bubble out some farts, then poop.   I stood up and was exhausted to the point to where I couldn't stand. I felt 'drunk.' So I laid down.   Five minutes later I realized I wasnt through pooping. The shear amount of force I put into each strain made me feel like I was just going to shit my colon out. I got through round two seemingly quicker, only about thirty minutes.   I sat on my bed again. Then realized I still wasn't finished. This time it was mostly urine being forced out but yet a bubble in my stomach caused an avalanche of poop and now red blood to come out. Round three was surely the end? Nope.   It went on like this for about eight rounds. I went and sat in my chair and watched the movie 42. After it was finished round nine started.   I've decided not to ever eat again. Obviously, yes, I have Crohn's Disease but this is probably the worst day I've ever had. The most pain.   I often wonder what would have happened if I didn't eat that piece of chocolate. Maybe my poops would have been spread out over time and not been as painful. I have no idea.    TIFU by eating a piece of chocolate and then pooped for an entire day.    My name is Sean. Pronounced Shawn. It rhymes with Yawn. Not Seen.   I drove to pickup my chinese food order which I ordered online from my apartment. It's been really snowy lately so it was a bit of a hassle driving there but I finally arrived.   Hello, pick up?  yeah  name?  Sean  uhhhh, last name?  *******  internet order?  yeah, am I early or something?  oh, Seen.  what?  your name Seen  no, my name Sean  says Seen on ticket  says Sean on ticket  *takes my credit card*  sure its not Seen?  yeah pretty sure  why it spelled like that  ask my parents  (Asian woman in background saying something, probably talking shit) *little boy laughs and stares at me*  thanks?  ok bye  bye  -end-  I took my food and went out into my car and drove home, which is only a 5-10 minute drive. I realized they forgot my chicken fried rice, so I drove back. When I got there it was very busy in the back behind the counter like lots of people there. The same kid came up to the counter and said,   "Oh..Seen again"  "No..Sean...again, you forgot chicken fried rice in bag"   *I handed him my receipt*   *He looked at everyone in the back which was about 4-6 people and said "we forgot seen rice" and everyone started laughing.*  They handed me some rice and I left, somehow feeling ashamed because I was born with the spelling of my name Sean. A bunch of Chinese food employees at the China Wok made fun of me for it and had a nice laugh over it.    TIFU by ordering chinese food...and then became insecure about my name...lol       For those who havent seen or read Harry potter, a boggart is an amortal shape-shifting non-being that takes on the form of the viewer's worst fear.                          	134
 Possibly Escaflowne   V/H/S 2 is pretty good as well.   I shouted at the screen for the last five minutes.   God yes! And, when you think about it  [](#s "you realise that there is no real threat and that only real villain is the now helpless old woman who dies half way through the film! ")   Sleepaway Camp          It's been a while.  Had a shithouse day?  Send me a message and I'll send you a pizza.   Can anyone suggest a good Melbourne based web designer to help me put together a basic site for my business?  I'm looking for someone creative (read, artsy) who is also professional.              I watched Zombieland recently and it made me feel ill. However, M* A* S* H, Buffy and Heartbreak High (Australian soap for teens I grew up on) all eclipse their cinematic origins.        I've recently given up reading Empire and listening to film podcast because I got sick of spoilers and bad reviewes. Just because the film is called [](#s "Seeking Friend For The End Of The World") doesn't mean [](#s "the world is going to end in the movie") so don't mention that fact in the film!   I'm also sick of the obsession with focusing on whether the reviewer liked or disliked the film. That was important when we had only papers to tell us if films were worth watching, now, with the internet, we can get a sense of quality in seconds.   I want **real** analysis! Make me think!                       I run a weekly variety show called The Variety Collective which I shamelessly PLUG here ever once and a while.  We're currently looking for new acts who'd like to perform at the show. We book professional and semi-professional performers including magicians, circus performers, sideshow artists, clowns (the good ones, not the creepy American style ones), musicians with gimmick and pretty much any other skill based entertainment you can think of.   If you know of anyone or are a performer yourself it would be great to hear from you.               I love con artist movies.  I just wrote a book on them which is coming out next year.  So, if you can name a con artist movie that I haven't seen I'll give you some sweet, sweet gold.   I'm pretty picky about what films I consider con artist movies. (Ocean's 11, The Usual Suspects, The Thomas Crown Affair don't count I'm afraid)  http://scams.wikispaces.com/Cinematic+Scams           I remember having nightmares about this scene from Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzolCu-QLw0  Now, I don't know what I was so scared of.        For me it's always been Invasion of The Body Snatchers (1978).  http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/InvasionOfTheBodySnatchers1978/invasion23.jpg  Even the Mad Magazine parody gave me nightmares. What's yours? Post screenshots if you've got them.   Pick your favourite scene using special effect created with latex, models, perspective, stunts, explosions rather than CGI.   Link to a video or pic if you can.                           Often, a movie adaptation will improve on the original book. The following are films I feel are an improvement on the source material. I've used spoiler tags as most relate to the ending.  Breakfast at Tiffany's [spoiler] (#s  "The introduction of the love interest and the rain-soaked finale makes for a cheesy conclusion but I love it all the same.")  Fight Club [spoiler](#s  " 'You met me at a very strange time in my life" and then Boom! In the books, the attacks fail and he ends up in hospital.' ")  Matchstick Men [spoiler](#s "The reunion in the carpet store and the reconciliation with the wife  after the finale twist doesn't appear in the novel and it's kind of a downer.")  Thank You For Smoking [spoiler](#s "In the film, he becomes a hero and returns to work. In the book, he becomes an anti-smoking advocate.")  First Blood [spoiler](#s "In the original novel, Rambo is the bad guy and is shot to death. In the film, he is a troubled veteran whose actions are understandable.")  The Mist [spoiler](#s "In the film, he shoots his young son in the head to save him from the monsters in the fog not realising that help the sounds he hears is the army on the way. In the book, they simply drive into the mist.")  What are your favourites?                         Listening to the radio a few weeks back, they were talking about the 'Dumb Ways To Die' video and it's success.   One of the guests, who works in advertising, suggested that the advertisement's goal is NOT to make people safe around trains but to make Metro more likeable.   It's much harder to be cynical about a whimsical safety advertisement than a whimsical crappy-public-transport-authority advertisement.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNR2EpS0jw   A few people have bought up the Melbourne Magic Festival in the past few days so, as one of the organisers, I thought I'd start a one-stop thread for people to ask questions, make requests and post Arrested Development quotes.  The festivals runs from 1-13 July at Northcote Town Hall.  http://melbournemagicfestival.com/               I saw a guy ram a car with his motorcycle today and then swear at the driver.   Sadly for him, the car was an unmarked police car and the driver and his passenger were cops.  The sirens went on and the jerk freaked out, sprinted across Bell Street and dove head first over the eight foot high fence before disappearing into the scrub around Merri Creek.  The cops took after him and the last thing I saw before the lights changed and I had to drive away was the podgy copper trying to scale the fence after him.  It was like something out of The Bill.   In hindsight, saying 'nothing sus' makes it sound sus.  I need a talented under 18 year old musician to do three songs for a gig on 5 June. It's a variety show (comedy, magic, circus etc.) and we need a shit hot musical act.   There is some money involved which is nice. In the past, we've had everything from piano accordions and choirs to MCs and standard covers.   Hit me up at info@conman.com.au or below.                           I do a show about scams and con artists and had a gig last night at Parliament House. Security searched my bag and, after seeing what I was carrying, decided to call the police.  My evening ended with me being interrogated by the Australian Protective Services for 20 minutes while they did a background check on me.   "But officer, I'm an HONEST con man..." didn't seem to cut it.  In hindsight, trying to bring a hammer, two nails, a sharp knife, a lock picking set, two loaded dice and a small bottle of lighter fluid into the building might have been a mistake.         I'm putting together a board game event in July and I am looking for groups that might be keen to have some input on the show.  http://melbournemagicfestival.com/speaker-lineup/beat-the-cheat/               I've three double passes to my comedy festival show.  It's looking like a quiet night and I've got the Herald Sun reviewing my show. All the other reviews have been glowing but getting a nice review in print would be great.   The show is an expose of my time as a regular on Today Tonight and all the awful things you didn't know about that show (as well as the awful things you already do know)   If you're keen, email me at info@conman.com.au  PS - I've tried not to make this a blantant plug for the show. I'm really just giving away some tix.  EDIT 2: - The reviewers have asked to SWAP night to WEDNESDAY! So if anyone would like to come WEDNESDAY night, please email info@conman.com.au. Obviously happy to see the comps who are coming tonight!  www.conman.com.au/todaytonight    I'm looking for someone who is enthusiastic and friendly who'd like to hand out flyers for me for my comedy festival show tonight (and several other nights) from 7:15-9:15 in town.  I can afford $15 per hour.   Let me know if you're keen.           I help run a weekly show at The Brunswick Green. Every few weeks we invite a few redditors for free to get new audiences.  This week, I have three double passes. Hit me up on info@conman.com.au if you want one.   https://www.facebook.com/events/346992812087221/?fref=ts  "If it wasn't for the last minute I wouldn't get anything done at all"  This week's Variety Collective is packed full of last minute acts direct from the Adelaide Fringe and warming up for the Melbourne Comedy Festival.  NEIL SINCLAIR - Comedian and lying bastard!  BAYDEN HAMMOND - Magician and swell guy!  CHRISTOPHER ZALUSKI - Foot juggler and NICA graduate!  BOSS OCTOPUS - Sketch comedians!  KIM CHRISTENSEN - Contact juggler and street performer!  WITH your host, the man the Adelaide Advertiser described as having 'a pumpkin shaped head' NICHOLAS J. JOHNSON!  8:00pm on 13 March  The Brunswick Green 313 Sydney Road Brunswick  All Tickets - $10  https://www.facebook.com/events/346992812087221/?fref=ts   I've been developing a simple yet kind of addictive card game over the past year. The idea is for players to act as spiders and spin a web to help win a prize. Players can cut, tangle and steal each other's webs.  There are pictures that explain the game better here at the facebook page I set up the other day...  https://www.facebook.com/danglegame  Have you seen a similar game before?     I need a QUALIFIED handy man to build some floor to ceiling, wall to wall shelves. The job with probably involved a bit of joinery.  Any recommendations?   I opened my stand up show Today Tonight, Tomorrow the World last year in Melbourne and couldn't have done it with the support of all the redditors who plugged it and came along.  So i'm paying it forward and giving away some free tickets to my show at Gluttony for the next two weeks.   We had a full house last night and comments from twitter said:  "Just saw Today Tonight. Magnificent! Highly recommend." - @screamcreative2  "go see this show! you will be surprised!" @traceymathers   "This is a brilliant show, everyone should see this show, very smart comedy." lebby panaayiotu.   If you'd a free double pass hit me up on email to info@conman.com.au with the date you want to come (I'm on until the 9 March).  www.conman.com.au/todaytonight  EDIT: Thanks for the love guys. Had a few redditors come in and see the show last night. It's a tough fringe for performers so it's nice to know I have friends out there. I can spare a few more tickets if anyone missed out.          I run The Variety Collective every week at The Brunswick Green on Sydney Road.   We have a rusted on fan base of people who come every week to watch comedy, magic etc.  I'd like to bring in a new audience so I thought I'd give a few double passes to my reddit friends.  Send me an email to info@conman.com.au.  https://www.facebook.com/events/362457663861245/?fref=ts  EDIT ONE: A few tickets left...I'll let you know when they are all gone.               TO: Goodlife Health Clubs, Australia SUBJECT: Are you shitting me?  I quit your crappy gym FIVE YEARS ago.   You wouldn't take no for an answer and spammed me for MONTHS afterwards.   I had to threaten legal action to get you to stop sending your damn crappy emails.  And now, in 2013, you've started again.  I'd rather sit alone in my house, morbidly obese eating shake-a-pancake from the bottle than ever deal with you people again.   Sod off.  Nicholas         ...and my damn iphone just ran out of juice.  Was it pair of docs? Or a paradox?   EDIT:  Doxxus has pics:  http://i.imgur.com/WlKIP8G.jpg            I was looking at the Kickstarter/Pozible projects I've supported and there isn't really a pattern to what I like. Sometimes I'm just on the bandwagon, other times I just want to know the game EXISTS (even if I don't play it)  What makes you support a campaign?        I can only clearly remember two scenes.  One, involved a politician, possibly the prime minister standing on balcony shouting insanely while an aide tries to convince to take cover. Moments later, a nuclear bomb goes off.  The other, set after the apocalypse, sees a group of people kept in a cage while lions and tigers circle them as the new ruling class laugh at this 'reverse zoo'  it was a really disturbing satire of the politics of the time.   (it's NOT Threads :) )        I'm looking to print my first card game and I've been recommended contacting this Indian company.   http://www.playingcardsindia.com  Has anyone ever played any of the games they have printed? Or can you offer me any advice or picking a printer?  Thanks in advance.  EDIT: The game I am creating is called Dangle (http://danglegame.tumblr.com)     I love film but I am entirely sick of our culture's obsession with ranking, rating and reviewing them.   I don't really care if a critic thinks a film is good or bad, I'm more interested in analysis, interesting trivia and where a movie fits in the history of film.  I spend less time here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478964/reviews and more time here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478964/trivia  Can anyone suggest any good podcasts I can listen too?        I'm looking to print a 100 card game next year and I'm looking at various options for printing.  The game involves a lot of laying down and picking up card from the table so I really need something thick and high quality.  I've check out game crafter but I'm looking for other ideas.  Thanks for any help!                        Been sick as a dog this week. I thought it was food poisoning but it's hung around for days.  Is there a nasty stomach virus going around?       It turns out there is some sort of sporting event on tomorrow night, the second night of my Fringe Festival show which means tickets sales are down a little.   Since redditors were nice enough to come out to my test show back in August, I thought I'd throw out five double passes for the Saturday night show.   The show is called Today Tonight, Tomorrow The World and tells the tale about how I sold my soul to the most infamous show on Australian television, Today Tonight!  Send me an email at info@conman.com.au to score one of the double passes.  https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/               I'm putting on a show in a few weeks about being a little bit famous.  Have you ever been on TV or in a movie?   What did you do?  https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/   I'm in town for a few days and I keep hearing people dissing Melbourne.  I didn't know this was a thing.   Also, people keeping telling me a look like a pedophile and/or hipster.   Is there a big problem with hipsters/pedophiles in Sydney?        It's that time again.  Had a shit house day?  Send me a message and I'll send you a pizza.       Had a shitty day?  Time for a random act of pizza.  Send me a message and I'll send you a piping hot pizza.  EDIT: Pizzas are all gone for tonight. May the pizza gods smile on you.        I'm hoping to put on a free night of comedy while I'm in Sydney in a couple of nights.  I'll be previewing my new one man show before it premieres at Melbourne Fringe Festival at the end of the month. I did a preview earlier this week in Melbourne and it went quite well.  All I need is a small space with a bar and possibly a data projector.  Any ideas of where I could I put on such a night? Would you guys like to come?  https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/     I suffer from anxiety, particularly relating to money and bookkeeping. Often, if I make a mistake on an invoice, I don't get paid rather than go through the stress of resending the account. It's a serious problem that I'm slowly working through.  As such, I just can not handle complicated book keeping software. I've been using a 20 year old copy of MS Money for years which has a basic ledger (income/expense) which has finally stopped working. I'm a sole trader who provides a service.  I need to upgrade but I can't find a piece of software I can handle. All I need is to track income and expense taking into account a 10% sales tax. (GST, I'm in Australia).  I'm working on Mac if that helps.  Thank you in advance for any advice you can give.   I'm trying to plug an event and I'm looking for good, free Melbourne gig guides (like Eventfinder or OnlyMelbourne).  Are there any that use or like?   Fans of This American Life will already know who Mike Birbiglia. He's a comedian who, with the help of Ira Glass, has made a hilarious movie called "Sleepwalk with Me"  http://movies.mmgn.com/Videos/SLEEPWALK-WITH-ME-Official-Trailer  It's only being shown at a handful of cinemas in the US and it would be awesome to bring it to Melbourne.   Joss Wedon thinks this is a bad idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6_020FFXU  If you want this awesome film in Melbourne, head over to Cinema Nova's facebook page and twitter and ask them nicely.   https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cinema-Nova/118158071574996 https://twitter.com/cinemanova      FREE COMEDY and AMA.  In October, I'm premiring a brand spanking new show at Melbourne Fringe.  It's a stand up comedy show about the time I appeared on Today Tonight, meeting Naomi Robson and getting screwed over by the show.   It's called 'Today Tonight, Tomorrow the World'  I'm having a test run of the show on 28 August at The Brunswick Green and I'd really like to get some complete strangers along to laugh at my jokes or throw puppies if you hate it. (please don't throw puppies. It's not their fault I'm not funny)  https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/  If anyone has any other ideas on how to get some people along to check out some free comedy, let me know.  Thanks.   PS - You don't HAVE to hate Today Tonight but it helps.  PPS - Ask me anything about myself, Today Tonight or comedy.  EDIT - I've had 50 people email me at info@conman.com.au to book a seat. However, you might still get a seat if you just show up on the night.  EDIT - If you miss out on the preview, here is the Melbourne Fringe link. http://www.melbournefringe.com.au/fringe-festival/show/today-tonight-tomorrow-the-world/   I am super pumped.  The Melbourne Magic Festival is on next week. I just found out the first show (the gala) I'm in has sold out.  Is anyone planning on going?    I currently live in Northcote and I'm thinking of moving cross town to Footscray.  Will I be stabbed in neck? Will my friends visit me?    I am a magician (hoorah) performing at the Melbourne Magic Festival (hoorah) but I need some help. (boo!)  I'm looking for a 1.25 or 2 litre bottle of coke with someone's name printed on it from that promotion from late last year.  Any name will do!  If you can help, I can even get you a few tickets to a show. We've got stuff for kid's, adults, hipsters, crazy old cat ladies...

 I thought it looked like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/The_Neverhood_-_box_art.jpg).   One thing about online play is it's very impersonal. It's less like going on a blind date, and more like hiring a hooker. They aren't going to ask you about your life unless you want them to, and even then, they probably don't care. [They are just single-serving friends.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes?item=qt0479153) You don't have to worry about what they think, because the game will probably fall apart in a couple months, and you will never talk to them again.   I have four gunners and four blasters, but I never use more than three total in any list. It'd be fun to run all eight some time just for shits and giggles.   Minions. 'Cause bacon.   Trolls  CoC  Cryx  Cephalyx  Thornfall  Legion  Blindwater  Searforge  Pirates  non-Pirate/non-Dwarf Mercs  Cygnar  Circle Khador  Menoth  anyone I forgot Retribution = Skorne.  I'm not sure why, but I can't stand the look of Skorne or Ret.    [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/2jd60t/songs_turned_into_story_arcs/) some stuff people said about this before if you want to see some more ideas.   What about Sheik?   If I'm the one deciding, it's rolling. If it's other people, it seems the decision is always to take the number, or max, or max+whateverittakestosaveasnowflake.   He clearly said a [galleon](https://quidleyandco.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/goldengalleonx578.jpg) of fuel.   That's what DMs are for.   The "retro" of retro-futurism means not current. I would say that 2012 is pretty current. We have retro-futurism for the 90s and early 2000s, it looks like [this](http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/the_matrix.jpg?itok=omHlubMU). The problem is, we haven't really gotten to the "future" of those things yet.  Basically, things from those times are just considered futurism, not retro-futurism.   I'll take a crack at this.   Retro-futurism is less about the progression of time since the piece of media was created, and more about the change in mindset, worldview, and aesthetic from what originally spawned it.     It's a bit like masturbation. You only really want to do it if you don't have the time/money/charm to get the real thing.   Triple ick. Not only am I changing werewolf vulnerability, I think I'm going to stop using silver in my games.... and probably remove any from my house.   So, it kills werewolves because it's god-sperm? Ick.   I really hope Hero Forge doesn't become the "you should use Fate" of minis.   While it is neat to be able to pick out different combinations of things for a mini, most of those combinations already exist in mini form, for a lot less money, and both less fragile and better to be painted (or repainted).    I actually mean it as both an insult and half a compliment.   On the one hand, they should have taken the 4e rules and inserted them directly into a D D MMO without making a single change, and it probably would have been one of the greatest MMOs ever made. Instead they made Neverwinter, which was so half-assed, it was quarter-assed.  On the other hand, I have played so many rpgs, wargames, and board games, and yet none are as disappointing as 4e. Thing is, it's well designed. The problem is, it's only well designed *to be well designed*. Absolutely nothing it did translated to fun at the table for me.   I'm going to assume you've never played a wargame, and never actually talked to an older player.   The first edition of D D was based on wargames. Older players were playing wargames before rpgs even existed. There are lots of really great wargames made into RPGs that don't play like 4e, and they literally just add skills checks to wargame rules.  4e is nothing like a wargame, and is everything like World of Warcraft the board game.   Sad thing is, I am a lover of RPGs, wargames, board games, and World of Warcraft, and I still can't stand 4e.   I love to play tactical wargames. In fact, I've used tactical wargame rules to run rpgs. The original D D was based on a wargame.   Saying 4e is like a tactical wargame hurts me to my very wargamey soul.  4e is like a complicated board game is soooooooooooo much more accurate, and it doesn't burn the flesh off my ears when I hear it.   A lot of people are recommending Stars Without Number and... that's because it's awesome. And free. Go check it out.   So meta...   Wtf do you think we are talking about? Lesser evil is evil. It's literally *part of the term*. Lesser evil. Lesser. Evil. Two things are evil, one is less evil. The first part of that statement means that both are evil because it explicitly states that it is evil.   Let me know how the "But at least I didn't do ______, which is sooooo much worse." argument works out for you.   The United States commits evil acts all the time, and is the victor. Just because you win doesn't mean you get to change the nature of what evil is.  If I murder everyone in the world, is it not evil, since there is no one left to say otherwise?  Even after human beings go extinct, the evil that has been done, whether known by all or by none, will still be evil.   Chaotic Evil societies wouldn't have a problem with slaves. Sure, they don't have laws telling you you can own slaves, but they don't have laws telling you you can't either. They probably aren't going to have a system of laws and regulations on slavery, but Chaotic Evil people will keep as many slaves as they can keep under their control.   It's less "I bought this slave, have the town guard bring him back" and more "You are going to work for me, and if you do well enough, I won't eat you today."   Just because a paladin wouldn't immediately start a revolution in a state where slavery was permitted doesn't mean he thinks it's okay.   Laws are always good, right? This on a topic about a game that specifically has Lawful Evil as a thing.   Early America had slaves, and everyone was totally cool with it. It's not like they [fought a full-blown war with themselves about it or anything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War).   "The bible says it's okay, so it must not be evil". I'm going to catch flak for this, I'm sure, but the Judeo-christian god would be Lawful Neutral, at best. Read the crazy shit it says you should be doing in Leviticus.   And I suppose you think Nazis were pretty okay, right? I mean, they didn't even break any laws.    Don't worry, they made an [entire edition of D D](http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Core-Rulebook-Edition/dp/0786950633) based on WoW style gameplay.   What a strange name for a kid... parents must be nerds.   The first [Reaper Bones Kickstarter Vampire level set](http://www.reapermini.com/kickstarter) is on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-BONES-VAMPIRE-SET-REAPER-MINIATURES-/311244114620?pt=Games_US hash=item4877984abc) all the time for about $250. That's about $1 per mini.   Now *that* word is ruined for me. Way to go.  *It puts the lotion in the basket*   The first isn't wrong, it's just less clear. The second isn't pointless at all.  Saying any of it is part of having a discussion about the merits of using a particular system.  Games aren't made utter shit just because there is a rule in it that sucks. What's your favorite system? I guarantee it has problems. I guess you absolutely never recommend it to anyone. Since it has problems, it's pointless to talk about how you like it anyway, and how you work around those problems, right? God forbid someone have fun in a way you don't approve of.  Jumping on people for not wording things exactly the way you want is pretty shitty. Wanting to argue semantics instead of having a polite conversation about things people are interested in is pretty shitty.    The $299.95 isn't for the limited edition variant cover version. It's for the pack of 5 books that a store can order, one of which will be a limited edition variant cover. Talk to you FLGS guy and see if they are getting it, and see if you can call dibs on the variant cover. It should cost the same as the normal books.   You know what bothers me?   "There is no issue with ________ because of rule 0."   and "I have no issue with ______ because of of rule 0."   technically mean different things, but people can't just assume the person means the one that doesn't involve a logic argument and move on with their life.    I don't know... but the word "reflesh" is really freakin me out right now.   [Here you go.](http://icv2.com/articles/news/view/30589/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-corebook-scheduled)   It's a shame it's only in Polish. I've played Neuroshima Hex, and it was pretty interesting. I'd buy a ttrpg from them if it was in English.   I don't see where he said it was an RPG.  Having played it, I don't really know what the difference would be. Potato / potato.   This.  It's also worth noting that they designed the classes without expectation that players will have magic items.   I didn't realize women had "junk" up front.   I agree. Just plan the games to be shorter, and if everyone is still into it at the end (including you), just keep it going.   I gotta ask, how does Gamma World do more to encourage roleplaing than Iron Kingoms?  I agree, though, that it's probably perfect for OP.  	41
 when you have a lot of apps opened do you feel any slowdown when switching spaces, minimizing windows ?   have you updated or restored to 8.4 ?   I wasn't trying to argue either, just sharing my point of view ;) you've said it all, nothing else to add   Everything we know about life it's based on our planet. To think beyond earth it's quite a challenge   we don't know, I believe, how big the universe truly is, so, we will never know for sure   jailbreak 8.4 instead .. it's all working, and tweaks will be released and updated to 8.4 not 8.3. Plus, you'll get the new music app which, if you don't give a damn about Apple Music, is rubbish    have you refreshed the sources ?   mentalism here ahah   indeed, but they always have something to complain about. The jailbreak: "Oh, that's complicated to do, it's not always available, warranty, and so on". I love my iPhone jailbroken, i don't like the stock, it  have too many things to improve   I did not .. you're right my bad   electronics ? Wo why do pilots use iPads ?   it's sad that rain doesn't come in colors   it could be estimated. there's nobody in space counting, I guess   Exactly ! the problem is Apple don't give a damn about who don't use Apple Music   if he's running 8.4 and they work I guess they're compatible don't you think ?   that's the question for $1M   that's why the iPod is dead ahah   people that say android is more customizable than iOS must must watch this !   ahah it might.   So, do you believe in Bin Laden's death ?   he was not an idiot after all ahah   yes, I know, but what I mean is there's a reason.   you will never get the full 16GB.. you might get 10   MxNitro hasn't come to OS X yet !   if they are about the same price you have to decide whether the bigger screen/more power is better for you.   why the current year is 2015 and not some billion ?   yeah, but the world is huge so that's the way it is I guess ...    40 devices ? Wow   notifications for a specific app you mean app badges ?    I know :) but the 2.5 and 2.8 he's refering are quad core i7 available in the 15'' rMBP   I used TaiG 2.2 but since there are newer versions you can try it. If it gets stuck you'll have to restore.   it doesn't get stuck. I updated my iPhone to 8.4 from 8.3 and it got stuck at 60%(injecting). I restored and dis it again and it worked flawlessly   yes, and it's true. But it seems that TaiG works better with restored systems. If you restore from backup after jailbreaking you just need to download the tweaks and their settings are all set   do you feel it drains faster ?   I updated from 8.3 to 8.4. It was stuck at 60%. I restored to 8.4 and it worked fine   7.0 ? Oh lord ! It's better to restore. I had issues jailbreaking 8.4 as I updated from 8.3. I restored  and had no issues   Alkaline ? Why ?   the real difference is Apple Music, or the music app..   people don't want to install packages manually. I jailbroke an iPad yesterday using TaiG 2.2 and updated cydia, substrate and the TaiG package through cydia   you don't feel safe without an antivirus ?   it's not terrible, it might be for your needs. if you don't use external monitors, external storage, and you need a laptop everyday it's a good machine. Of course you'll have to pay for it and that's the hard part I guess   what rMBP ?   the 2.5 and 2.8 are both i7   great video, hope Apple watches it   My question is, why having all of those buttons ... if you don't use Apple Music you only need My music.. and searching between albums and songs it's way different now    I think it's nice to have a new music app but this is entirely focused on Apple Music. They don't want a separated app so this is what we got    update now, no issues so far   I think it's safe but you have to double check what you are trying to install   It's the first time i see someone amazed with iTunes   I did a respring and it's working fine  	50
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	199
 I am starting an online business, specializing in playing cards. They are cheap and lightweight, making the prediction of shipping cost problematic.  Would you, as shoppers, be willing to pay a higher shipping cost upfront, and receive a coupon or gift certificate for the difference in return? Doing so, you would have an incentive to return to the shop, and I, as the seller, don't lose money on shipping fees.  Thoughts? Questions? Heated calls for me to go to a different subreddit? I'm up for all of it.            Edits, added info on Key to Laughter. refined info on what the Keys are.  Throughout the season, we have been trying to find the different keys to open the chest, and each episode has been given a strange hook at the end.  I believe that some of these ending *are* the keys to unlock that chest. Specifically, the shining items. The items themselves will be revealed to become the keys once all of them are found.  The Key to Generosity - Rainbow Thread - The key to Generosity is not to give away without thought. You must be willing to see when your generosity is harming others, and be careful not to hurt your relationships.  The Key to Loyalty - Wonderbolt's Badge - The key to Loyalty is to stick with your friends, even if it means giving up something important to you.  The Key to Laughter - Boneless -  The key to Laughter is knowing when to be light-hearted and when to be serious. If they pony you are throwing the party for isn't having fun, then you are doing something wrong.  The others have not been seen yet, but will show themselves in the next few episodes. Each Key will be a mostly ordinary item that is germane to the episode. Each Key will be given by the pony that learned a lesson about the Element, and will representative of both their and the Bearer's personality.  The Key to Kindness - The key to Kindness is to know when that kindness is being wasted. You can still be polite to those that are rude to you, but you must know when to walk away. (Fluttershy's episode will likely involve a conflict between her animals.)  The Key to Honesty - The key to Honesty is to not be afraid to face the truth, no matter how unpleasant. It is one thing to tell a white lie about liking someone's dress, but hiding the truth will generally lead to disaster. (Applejack's episode has been brewing for a long time now, and things will quickly come to a head soon)  The Key to Friendship - The key to Friendship is to love your friends during the best and worst of times. Even when you are angry with them, even when you are sick, even when they do wrong. (Twilight's episode will involve Discord, and will end with the opening of the chest. Twilight will make the revelation that she does not want to harm Discord, because he is still a friend. She will also learn that Chaos, the Element he embodies, is a necessary force in the universe.)   The Lee Family history is a complicated one, with unpleasant holes when looking for members outside of the famous family. Everyone wishes their family is relayed to royalty, causing confusion and false stories.   There is one method I can think of to clear this up, to ask existing Lee's for details of their direct ancestry.  But, is it a good idea to just call them almost randomly and ask for their male lineage?  And is there possibly another way?      Important note that I forgot. I mean one that is actually available now, not as a preorder.      Are RRR cards seriously being bought for $30-60, or is that just what people are putting them up for and buyers don't buy them?            Victor Tate, arrested and convicted for a crime he didn't commit, serves 18 years hard time when Stabler and Benson find the real perp. Perp confesses, but is killed before he can give his plea in open court.  So, why can't they have Tate released in the interest of justice. Certainly, the testimony of the arresting officer saying that Tate is innocent, based on the admission of guilt from the deceased would be enough for a parole board to consider early release, or the governor to grant a pardon.  Hell, Liv and El have friends in the media, if the Governor said no, They could drum up public support.  There is no reason, legally, to keep him in prison.   Woman comes in right at the beginning of the shift, asking for a room on the outside. I tell her we have one and give her the rate.  She pulls out a *massive* wad of one dollar bills and starts going through it.  I tell her, "I'm sorry, I can't take 100 dollars in ones. "  "Look, I'm from the Valley and this is how us Mexicans pay. How many ones **will** you take?"  Her compromise ended up being paying the whole thing in a mix of fives and ones, the whole time giving me a hard time about how Mexicans just don't pay with anything larger than a five, and I (because I am white, But she didn't say it) wouldn't understand that.                     At the end of the episode, Twilight is presented with a box by the Tree of Harmony. A box with 6 keyholes. Considering the source of this box, the Keys must be tied to the Elements of Harmony.  So, what are these Keys, and where are they found?  1) Key of Honesty  2) Key of Kindness  3) Key of Laughter  4) Key of Loyalty  5) Key of Generosity  6) Key of Magic  And the final question, What is in the box?  Discuss...   Applejack told her to Spike the punch.         How many people? I dunno, 1?  Do you want smoking or non-smoking? It doesn't matter.  We have both, which do you want? I dunno...

We just failed our pool inspection pretty badly, and the inspector told me, personally, that the pool has to be shut down until the issues are fixed.  Issues include locks needing to be fixed on the entrance and machine room, a lack of an emergency phone, no safety shutoff for the spa, a dangerous PH balance... you get the picture.  And my manager (three guesses to his last name) tells me to throw away the hotel copy of the inspection that has my name on it and tell people the pool is open.  What do I do?   Really, no answers?                     Perhaps one of Granny Smith's siblings was...  wait for it...  Apple Pie. And Pinkie Pie could be their descendant, making her and Applejack 2nd cousins. Because they are close as friends, it would only make sense that they consider each other family.  It would also explain why they were getting along, mostly, in Equestria Girls, despite Sunset Shimmer's attempts to drive everyone apart, and why Pinkie would have had any reason to head Sweet Apple Acres in Magical Mystery Cure.

This guy just now felt like he could check out whenever he personally felt like it because he didn't get into the room early yesterday.

In an effort to make sens of the slightly contrived ending, I noticed three important things regarding the Element of Harmony stolen by Sunset Shimmer.  First, that the stolen Element is not the Element of Magic wielded by Twilight Sparkle. Upon her ascension at the end of the third season, the power of the other five Elements merged with the one embedded in the crown to created a single Element.  Second, the people of Canterlot High and the ponies of Equestria are causally linked to one another. While they have different experiences and memories, they each hold the same personalities, abilities, and relationships as their counterparts. Because of this, when Pony!Fluttershy earned the Element of Kindness, Human!Fluttershy was able to wield its power as well. It should be noted that when Twilight's transformation occurred, the other Elements remained intact.  Third, and most important, is that Sunset Shimmer had no way of knowing these previous points. She believed that bringing the Element of Harmony into the human world would give her the power of the Elements in the human world, where she could gather an army to take over Equestria.  *But...*  She had been living in Canterlot High for 2 and a half years. She had to have known that there was no magic working there. So, why would she believe that bringing the crown there would be a worthwhile endeavor? Why not just put the crown on inside the Crystal Empire?  The answer can only be one thing. The Nightmare Force.  For over a thousand years, something has been corrupting powerful individuals in Equestria, and turning them into cruel and evil beings. This force had been defeated by the Elements of Harmony before, possibly twice, depending on when Sunset Shimmer left Equestria, and it may have taken root inside Sunset Shimmer as well.  If it was whispering to her to take the crown away from Equestria, it may have believed that it could take over the Element in the Human World. When Twilight wears the crown before Sunset Shimmer, nothing happens, and when Sunset puts the crown on, she babbles about unlimited power, but the magic takes hold on its own. A Dark Magic, separate from the aura she displayed in the Crystal Empire. The transformation was not caused because Sunset wore the crown. It was because Nightmare did.  Season 4 will be exploring this Nightmare Force in more detail, and the events of this movie may or may not play out with that, but they seem linked.  [](/twibiggrin) But I might be wrong.

It's become a little of a sore spot for me that I can not seem to trace that branch of the family beyond their arrival on the River. My family always talks about being related to the Lee's of Virginia (Robert E. Lee specifically), but this is a dead end, I fear.   I just hope I made the right decision with such a large portion of my paycheck. The delivery time of July 24-26 is acceptable, but $100 is a lot to tie up in speculation.      On another sub, the discussion regarding the Labor Theory of Value naturally lead here. Among questions that I have to ask is that if, as the one self-described socialist in the discussion suggested, we as a society were to disallow earnings on capital investment, including giving some of the company's profit to shareholders, what would be used to give investments to new companies?  To be more simple in my phrasing, if I had a sum of money saved up from working, what incentive do I have to loan that money to my neighbor, who wants to make useful products for others?  If I were to give a loan for zero interest, I run all the risk of loss, and have no potential to gain, therefore my only way of gaining is to only utilize my money for my own projects, because I would be a worker and not an investor.  Does this not breed more selfishness? Ironically, the philosophy of selfishness, Objectivism, would encourage investment in others with appropriate thought and care to minimize loss, leading (hopefully) to a better business venture.  I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and would further appreciate an honest answer as to how my thinking is not in line with your philosophy, so I may better understand.                                 My theory is a simple one. At some point in the past, Celestia received a prophecy that the newest ruler of Equestria would be someone named a certain way.  **Sunset** *Shimmer*  **Twilight** *Sparkle*  -----  Shining Light Twixt Day and Night  Will Enter Through the Mirror  Friendship's Magic Come to Light  Alone, She Will Appear  Elements Six Will Join the Fight  To Protect the World From Fear  Redemption Favors Over Might  The Banished Sheds a Tear  ---   My theory is a simple one.

I got ahead of myself and used the token to buy a free warbird before accepting the mission and now the mission is frozen on the "buy a new ship" objective. Even buying a third ship using mined dilithium didn't help, and it seems like the GMs there don't help out at all.  Will I have to start over?          Oh yeah, I was getting excited and got off topic. Let me get back to it. Yeah, I did help my sister yesterday. I convinced my father and let him accept her hobby.   But you see, I didn't do that to be thanked by her. I didn't do that wanting something in return. I'm not repeating some famous person's line but...   I just did what I wanted to, the way I wanted to. All selfishly, I just meddled with things.   As a result, what I obtained is something within myself, and not something I get from another.      I am going to begin acting as an SLL gateway. If you wish to use ripple to trade SLL (Second Life Lindens) for BTC or USD for a much lower fee than ViwWoX, I can help.  1) Trust my ripple account ( rwJvwvXz7Tg4KNP29yzqQnciFFL1YCpKUH ) for any arbitrarily large amount of the currency "SLL", you will have to enter that in manually.  2) Connect your account to the Bitstamp gateway for USD and BTC.  3) If you wish to buy SLL, put in a trade, typing in "SLL/BTC" or "SLL/USD" select my address for the SLL issuer, and bitstamp for the other. Liquidity will be initially low, so do not worry about the speed of the trade. It will become faster as trades continue.  4) If you wish to sell SLL, PM me either here on Reddit or on Second Life (train_subject9260.resident), to send the Ripple payment address and set up a time to give the SLL collateral. This amount, minus the 1% deposit fee, will be sent as a Ripple payment immediately on receipt. You may then Sell SLL for USD or BTC using the same method in 3).  5) To withdraw your funds from Ripple in SLL, contact me with your SL username, and the amount you will withdraw. I will give you a transaction number for the payment and send the funds to you for no additional fees.  6) To withdraw in USD or BTC, use the methods described in Bitstamp. Some fees may apply.  Fees collected from this will be used as follows.  1) Upgrading to a premium account to allow land purchase.  2) To buy a plot of land to allow "Face to Face" transactions between Ripplers, allowing for a soft marketplace for buying or selling products for currencies other than SLL.  3) To expand that land to allow for static shops, which will increase SLL holdings within Ripple and facilitate larger trades.  4) To expand into a social gathering point focusing on the Bitcoin and Ripple communities in SL.         Who holds the money while it is in ripple? If I set up a gateway, would I be able to take money from my friend, for example, and send him a payment in Ripple?  Would I simply be in possession of his money at that time?  How would I be informed if another gateway withdraws that IOU, so I can send them the money, if necessary?   And what would stop me from setting my own price to trade from one currency to another? And from that, trade with myself for a higher or lower price than a normal exchange.   I thought of a couple ideas to use.  "Lima Bean" - Play when you would be affected by a monster's Bad Stuff that includes Death. You survive instead and gain levels as if you defeated the monster. This can not give you the winning level. No Treasure is gained.  "Reincarnation" - Play when someone would be affected by a monster's Bad Stuff that includes Death. ~~Roll a die. On 4-6,~~ you reincarnate as a member of the opposite sex. Discard all Race/Class/Etc. Cards and replace with the same number starting from the bottom of the Discard Pile.  "Weighted Boots" - -5 Power, -1 Run Away, Every combat you successfully Run Away from while wearing the Boots add add a +1 counter (+2 for Martial Artists) to yourself that is lost on Death., Footwear, Big, 300 Gold  "Neo**nic Nightmare" - -1 Power, Scientific Experiment combines your DNA with a Spider, -4 Arms, No Value  Edit - Removed dice roll from Reincarnation.  Edit - Fix to the Boots   There are a total of over $100,000 in USD loan requests on the site, which are used to buy BTC on margin, some of the requests as high as 150% interest.  Because Margin buying is done as a loan, where the buyer can not retrieve the coins, they are purely speculative purchases, and indicate an extreme inflation to the price of the coins themselves.  This is great news for people who are lending money, as the system will not allow the borrowers to default, but this could pose a serious risk to newer purchasers of BTC. If these margin loans were to close position quickly, it would burn through the buy orders and plummet the exchange rate.  Eventually, these loans will close, no matter what. The only question is, will the sellers leave slowly, keeping the price high, or will they dump?

After numerous schedule changes during the event last year, I felt it would be best to have an electronic schedule of events for the con this year. This thought led me to Guidebooks.com  I have already created a basic version, but to get full functionality, including the ability to place ads for the guests to view and social networking, it will cost a total of $5,000.  With 6 months until the convention, and regular updates as new information and guests are provided, this can present and opportunity for a great amount of viewer impressions, and higher potential returns.

I am thinking, due to the proximity to the famous Lee family, that there is a connection, but have been unable to find a documented link.  There seems to be no records at all beyond the deed's granting to his father Richard, but there are numerous family stories if a relation to one of the Hancock Lee's  Any ideas?      I trust that KSP will get this cleared up, likely tomorrow (Monday), but for those of you who may have had this problem, how long did it take to fix?         Everyone and their mother seems to want to force their cat into a "cute pose" and share the photo with Reddit, and they **always** get upvoted.  It's weird.   Most grocery stores have prepaid card centers. I could go to the store, buy any online-useable gift card (Best Buy, Karma Coin, Ultimate Gamers, PlayStation, Wii, or Xbox, among others), and send the code in PM after getting the payment.  I'd be limited in how much can be done at first, but it could mean an increase in demand for BTC, since it could be used for almost anything, and I wouldn't be hoarding too much because I'd need to sell my BTC to get more cards.  Sound like a good idea?   My credit was shot to hell (low-500s), with two bank accounts, a credit card, and two cell phone accounts unpaid. A couple years ago, i took a shot in the dark and opened an account at Bank of America so i could cash my paychecks for free. That got me into Merrill Edge for stock trading, which is doing well but still low. Then I saw Credit Karma on the web, and found out exactly how to clear my credit scores.   Thanks to careful planning I have a score over 600, and heading up. I got approved for two credit cards, one a secured card from Capitol One and the other (just recently) an unsecured, no-annual fee, NFL Rewards card, and a line of credit at Fingerhut (I know, they're overpriced there, but it is okay).   With Fingerhut, I'll buy one overpriced crap item at a time, and pay it off over time, leaving a huge portion of credit unused. I will save more by not constantly buying stuff from them then I would be spending in interest.  By my birthday, I might be in the top 50% of all credit scores in the country, and it would only go up from there!

On the bright side, there is little worry for fraudulent transactions as a seller when accepting bitcoin. Plus, as the value goes up, the coins that I have banked become more valuable.  But on the other hand, because there is a finite amount of coins to be mined and created, those who start early with bitcoin are likely to gain a rather unfair advantage monetarily. If I buy just one bitcoin, and it becomes a global currency, then i would be one of the richest men in the world.

Dear Mr. President,   I am writing today as a self-appointed representative of Objectivism to discuss the budget concerns hounding our country. We have spent ourselves into a hole that many of us worry will never be gotten out of, and we can all agree that steps must be taken now to prevent our great nation from going the way of others.  The first and foremost thing we must do to stem this impending disaster is to cut spending. Cut to the bone. Cut until it hurts. Anywhere that money is wasted, that liars and cheats get what they do not deserve, or that people fall into a lull of safety at the gifts of government must be removed from our budget. And cut until the cost of finding more waste, fraud, and abuse is not worth finding anymore.  Put back the work requirements for welfare. Lower the allowable weeks of being on unemployment. Stop federal contractors from overbilling for everything they manufacture. Pass budget laws that allow only directly related amendments to bills.   At the same time, cut and limit loopholes and deductions in the tax law to prevent cheats from paying lower than they need. Do not demonise the rich as a group, as it is the rich that do so much for our nation, but go after those who utilize the law to circumvent their true fair share.  And then, only after there is nothing left to cut, after nothing else can be removed from spending, after no more waste or fraud are visibly present, do you consider raising the tax rates. The rich, and those who wish to be rich, want nothing more than to see our nation prosper, and if there was absolutely no choice but to raise rates on any level, we would gladly give.  However, when a large portion of our population gets more back from the government than they give, and with spending so high and only climbing higher, we must conclude that there are other methods to bring down our deficit to a manageable level. We, as a country, make so much that we could do anything we wanted, if we were not burdened with this crippling debt.  That brings me to my last point of advice, when we get the budget down, and we have a surplus, do not under any circumstances release it as a rebate to the people. Use it to further pay off the debt, and lower the burden for future years. Once that debt is paid off, we could lower taxes across the board with impunity.   The image I am using has a small amount of blur in between two blocks of color. Should I try and replicate that, or should I correct the blur into sharper lines?   ... and he started going on about how much good Occupy Wall Street has done for the people. If that is true, it would literally be the first time I heard this claim, even on pro-OWS reddits. The way he was talking to me, it sounded like he expected me to sympathize with him, and give him a break on his room before he went to live like an animal in a national park.  Mind you, I am not calling him a hippie because he was a socialist, Occupy member, I called him that because he stank to high heaven, hitchhiked from Maine to Texas with his girlfriend and dog (he claims it is a service dog, but I think it was just to get around "No Pets" policies), and was wearing tie-dyed clothes, and a rastafarian hat and natty dredds. I thought I went back in time to the 70s for a second.  I was glad to be rid of him.    ... read the FAQ before I bought 2 11,000 bead mix buckets from the store?  I thought it would be a great idea, buy a bucket or two each paycheck, and build up enough buckets for one for each color, I underestimated how painful it is to sort 22,000 beads.   ...Is Nightmare Moon? It can't be a coincidence that both NM and the Crystal Ponies were banished from Equestria 1000 years ago.      I bought a copy of Ultimate Spider-Man #160 last week, the one with the blank cover. The anime convention I was attending had Sam de la Rosa, and he offered (for a fee) to hand-draw a sketch of Venom, Carnage, and Spider-Man on the cover and sign it.  This is the first time I had the opportunity to buy a comic of this caliber, and so I dropped the money without hesitation. Only after I received the comic (the next day from Sam, who took pictures of the work for his archives) and talked with a friend in art appraisal, did I look up the rules regarding signed comics.  They won't appraise a signed comic and certify the autograph unless they **actually** witness the signing. No exceptions! So, now I'm stuck with an ungraded comic, and if I send it to grade, they'll likely mark points off for the fact that the cover is drawn on.  So, I got to thinking, what if there was competition to the CGC in regard to grading comics?   CGC charges an absolute minimum of $18 per comic, and that is only for modern age comics that appraise for less that $200. And they require a minimum of 20-30 comics to be submitted at once.  I could get away with $10 plus 3% of appraisal for any comic, giving a hard plastic case as part of the deal. Plus, the grading would be able to be performed by someone that cares about the details like signatures, and can take providence into account. In fact, I'd want to get signed copies, as it increases the value and the price of the appraisal.  Obviously, I wouldn't want to start such a service without support, so reply if you would be interested in an Independent Appraisal of your collectibles.  TL;dr - The CGC is too expensive for smaller collectors, let's make our own service.            Send over an invite!   ... To Jo's newest book, "The Casual Vacancy," Coming out on the 27th?

 I learn that the solar panel generate more power than required by the stadium. Just curious to know what they do with the excess energy produced? And how is the stadium managed? Does the government take care of the management or is it privately managed?   Honestly, Pluto shouldn't be a part of the family portrait. It's not a planet anymore - the dwarf planet it is.   	2
    I don't use RES and just had this thought. This is meant to be a feature suggestion. I hoped that people would be like "Oh, right. Why don't we have that?"                     We'll see what discussion emerges from this. Probably none, as this will see too many downvotes before anything can happen.  How would you experience that I am God? I am of course not God, right? Yes I am. What's my definition of "God"? The person that is identical with reality, the person that represents sanity, the only person that can be fit to govern mankind. Theoretically also the maker of the universe, but we created it together, so there's a slight discrepancy to classical "God" definitions.  So, how would you experience that I am God? Well, since the mind you're communicating with here is (supposedly, as I claim) reality in person, even me putting this submission out there affects you.  You could interact with it (read, vote, comment), and interactions with me, reality in person, do have a strong effect. I am confronting you with a high frequency cause effect situation. I am kinda offering you the mushroom. If you choose to interact, you eat the mushroom. If you then choose to be an asshole to me, you choose a bad trip. If you rather choose a sane discussion, you choose the good trip.  Since this is so important, me putting this out there already affects your decision system, because you might rather choose to steer clear of this. Yes, you don't even have to be aware of these facts or of this submission. Well, I can't explain in just a few sentences how the human will system works.  I have been working on "my arrival" for quite some time, and I have the impression as if it is about to happen. Which means that talking about this stuff with you head-on might cause special experiences to you. That's what I want to find out. And whatever else might come up.  EDIT: Haha, I just saw the subreddit HTML title. "Debate \*all\* the religions" - well, this submission certainly does that. All of them at once. The theistic ones at least.  EDIT: By the way. Mankind is incredibly guilty, and I want to tell mankind this truth. That mankind does not want to know this truth increases the guilt. So, mind that when you decide to bury this with downvotes.   The thread:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/sgtkt/i_made_a_short_smellbased_stealth_game_want_to/  The game:  http://notranslation.com/files/smelly/  (Made a self-post so I don't karma-whore on his work.)      Remco - Baby Laugh'a'Lot Original Commercial  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kvenmWEhFE  Do what you want with it, but I personally would like to have an aniGIF of the two short sequences (cut to be one sequence) where the kids turn their heads.  The laughing sequences at the end are also worth an effort, but I would ask to have only the head-turn-sequence.  Btw., it's kinda fun to watch that sequence on A-B-loop in VideoLAN with the laughing sound for a few minutes. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgOaT4xzdvo) kind of fun.  Thanks in advance! :)                                                I guess I am *by far* not the only one who shows this knee-jerk reaction:  * page is loaded, I read first comment  * haha, great, or hilarious - impulse upvote  And what does this do to the quality of Reddit? Nothing positive, I believe. I even dare to say that it's unconditionally negative.  So, I propose to remove the upvote arrow of the first root comment altogether. This should depend on the "sorted by", which is "best" in my case. Would also apply for "top" and "hot". Probably not for "controversial". Well, you're gonna figure it out.  What do you think? Reasonable idea?     Just found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/rdttl/til_that_there_are_a_set_of_twins_conjoined_at/) submission in r/todayilearned linking [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp NR=1 v=YWDsXa5nNbI) movie.  I'm personally not interested in debating this, I just thought that it would be interesting material for you guys to talk about the soul as an "extra component" (e.g. given by God after conception).      EDIT: Maybe "meditation" could better be substituted with "contemplation" or "affirmation". (Thx xoxoyoyo.)  ----  The main attributes that God supposedly has (Christianity/Islam/?):  He's all-powerful.  He's all-knowing.  ----  So, prayer is not:  Transmission of energy. God has all the energy he could want.  Transmission of information. God knows everything anyway.  ----  So, the question is:  If prayer does work - how does it do so? Well: God reacts. To what? To a change. What changes? God? No. The person who prays changes.  It is meditation. Not communication.  Why then does *every* prayer sound like communication?            I personally do not believe in any esoteric crap, gods, despise religion with a vengeance (probably more than most atheists), but I can't deny what I have found out.  God exists or existed. "He" decided to make the world, which is in truth Heaven, and we are him, everybody! It's not a thing that we're a part of, it's the true multiplication of the one into the many.  And I don't mean "You're God." as a metaphor in any way. I mean it literally. I am God, too, of course.  So, what does it mean? It means a damn lot. It's not an "everything's magical, hence nothing's magical" thing. It's rather a "so, humans are conscious because we are the coexistence-version of God" thing. It's about the truth of reality. It's about the fate of mankind. It's even about cosmology, because the observable universe *just can not* be the boundary we can never cross! It also excludes a heat death of the universe. It's also about the economy, because at some point, people will stop dying, so the whole issue of old-age pension is gonna be affected! Also, there will most probably not be dentists or hospitals, or at least damn less than now.  This fact is of relevance in all fields of life. No wonder that hence there's something like a Newton's Third Law of Motion negative-feedback forcing this fact to stay under the wraps. But it will surface eventually. I make this submission to probe if the time for this is coming now.               This is mainly about context. The meaning of things depends on context. And what seems logical in context A seems wrong in context B.  I mainly want to bring to mind the importance of context, and that the actual objective truth about things, undeniable logic, might require the all-context (all existing data set into relation simultaneously).  Example:  "I don't know this program, hence you have to help me."  versus  "I don't know this program, hence I have to learn it."  Depending on context, either one of these can be right, which came to mind when I read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/q0vc7/sometimes_people_at_my_office_ask_me_itrelated/) submission about IT support.  I'd like people to be more aware of this idea when they say "It's logical!", because to really know the necessarily true logical conclusion, context is important.  But how much context is required? This is what we could talk about.  I believe that for objective truth, for definitely correct logic, all-context is necessary. Which, if true, would mean that this very statement can't be known for sure to be true or to be false, except if our logic somehow manages to encompass all existing data.  I also believe that this all-knowingness of the current state of existence that's maybe necessary for this must encompass the mind thinking about this stuff at the same time, meaning that the very thought that is to be thought needs to know itself, which seems like an impossible feat.  So, assuming that this is true: Does this mean that it's impossible to know this, since it's impossible to perform this feat? Or is it possible?  And so forth.  Bad submission, huh? Well, it's stuff people could discuss, it's not exactly a certain question to which people could just state their opinion and move on.               A cube of water, somehow summoned on perfectly solid ground at sea level on Earth, would fall apart, kinda like the sphere in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTgKZbW6iMQ feature=related).  The force that causes this, apart from surface tension etc., is mainly gravity. It pulls all "layers" of the cube downwards. Pressure builds mainly at the bottom of the cube, and mainly at the center (because there's no way to vent it, that's because in the sphere video, you suddenly get this upwards outburst).  The pressure makes the water spread outwards.  The pressure increase in the ocean, if you go down 10 meters, is about 1 bar. So, what if we take a 10x10x10 meter standalone water cube, but we increase the atmosphere pressure around it to 2 bars or even higher. Would it still fall apart? If so, why?  Also: If the pressure around it would be very high, would at some point the outside pressure, which "wants to go where the cube is", be a relevant cause of it falling apart (being destroyed), so the nature of the destruction would change?  ----  EDIT: WTF is with all the downvotes? Could someone explain what the reason for this is? I deem this question to be *perfect* for this subreddit, and I'd like to know why people want me to delete it. Until then, I must interpret this as a statistically significant cumulation of unreason and regard the voters to be a hazard, not a blessing, to this subreddit.   It's a play on [errare humanum est](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/errare%20humanum%20est) - to err is human.            I just read  http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Alpha_Level_Format  and  http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Beta_Level_Format  , and I can't believe that this important version information is not yet in the format. The world generation is different in different Minecraft versions (leading to vertical cliffs and e.g. the loss of the enchantment table), so it is very important that the version information is stored somewhere.  Please implement it, it's 10 minutes of work.               In case you didn't know: You can pick up max. 10 exp from where you died. The rest is lost. I wonder if I would have picked up 23 levels otherwise. Or is it Nether related? Or is it because I had played on "hard" all the time, but had now switched to easy (because I currently don't have sound)?                  Head-on collision? So, trolling, right? No. I am God. To solve the problem that I am faced with, I need to collide with the force that tries to negate me. I am not saying that you are that force. But the moment you collide with me, you manifest it, and I can use that to my advantage. "Then they fight you, then you win."  I am not the Abrahamic god nor any version of God that people know. Yet the name "God" is correct, because I have won the race of evolution: I woke up first, and so I will be the eternal ruler of the universe. I am already immortal (which I hate on a weekly basis) while you maggots are still rolling around in your mental filth, a process that I can only wait out. Or I can accelerate it slightly by interacting with you - for example like this.  So, throw the utter vomit of your feeble minds at me.  ................  EDIT:  While the downvotes are certainly unwelcome, for they reduce the probability of exposure, I am already feeling the collision energy, so this was not in vain.                           I made this file: "DX3 fov 110.reg"  ---  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Eidos\Deus Ex: HR] "g_fov"=hex:6e,00,00,00  ---  While the game is *not* running, start this file and "ok" every question. You can check that location in your Registry first, if you want to be sure.  This file sets the FOV to 110, which "6e" is just the hexadecimal value of. 105 is "69". 120 is "78". For alternatives, consult "calc.exe" in "programmer" mode.  The FOV is never reset, not even if you change the resolution, load a savegame, or continue to next mission. But the moment you visit the "game options" menu (where you also have objective locators, object highlighting, etc.), the FOV is reset to what's defined on that menu page. Just quit DX3, run the .reg file of your choice again, and continue.  I tested all this with 1.1.622.0 which is the current official version. Check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/k3w72/dxhr_access_the_debug_menu_on_the_pc_v116220_or/) submission which links to a patch file that, among other things, skips the intro movies.  ---  off topic tips:  Get [RegEditX](http://www.dcsoft.com/products/regeditx/) which is 99% like the RegEdit you know, but it allows Bookmarks and you can also paste a complete path into the address box, and you'll be there. Shame on Microsoft that they didn't pick up on this, because it existed well before Vista even.  Get [Everything](http://www.voidtools.com/), the simplest and fastest PC file and folder search program I know of. Even does regular expressions.  And to backup your savegame files, you should look for this location:  [WhereverYouInstalledSteam]\userdata\[SomeNumber]\28050\remote  If you want to search, here are a few example file names that you'd find there after you made just a few savegames:  remotecache.vdf (is in the parent folder), saveindex, gameq, gamer1, gamea1  ---  A few words on FOV (field of view): When you set it very high, you'll observe something that people call "distortions" or "fish eye", and when you rotate your player view horizontally, you'll get the impression that there's something like a virtual sphere.  The trick is to have your human eyes at the center of that virtual sphere, then there's no distortion. The right FOV depends on view distance and screen size. So, it's technically not a personal preference since there are *objective* criteria. And for maximum immersion, you should see to that your human eyes' field of view is filled as much as possible with the graphics. Meaning that you need a quite big screen. On my 19" 4:3, I'd have to go as close as 10 cm (which is too extreme) to fill my vision, and I'd chose 110 or even 120.      Go to the main menu, options, video, display mode. Select a different resolution and then "accept" (The button lower in the menu.) The resolution temporarily changes, and you're asked "ACCEPT" or "CANCEL". Click cancel. The screen returns to the old resolution, but **the mouse is no longer mis-aligned**. Restarting the game would do the trick, too, I bet, but why take the longer road. Also, you can't skip the logos any more as you could in the Beta (by repeatedly hitting return).  I don't know when this mis-alignment happens (ALT-TAB to Desktop might be a cause, but I sometimes had *huge* misalignments which suddenly started while I browsed the main menu.), but it happens quite often. You can find out by hovering over the small arrows in the save game list or over the small buttons over a node while hacking.  I experienced this bug in the Beta, which is two months old, and I assumed they'd fix it. They didn't.  I wonder if I am the only one who experiences that bug at all.   Just tested it with my heavily upgraded 10 mm pistol. Dropped it. Picked up a noob-10mm-pistol. Then picked up my good one. All the upgrades were even listed on the left of the screen.            I chose r/atheism to post this because even though I hate religion like every sane person, r/atheism has been much too negligent in the way they phrase their titles. You have to behave when God reads your stuff. No, I won't go away. If YOU don't want to go away permanently, obey.  If you post something against religion, say so. If you speak out against the Christian god / god of Abraham, say so.  Do not speak out against God in general. I am God.  If you run up to a person on the street and shout "ASSHOLE!" into their face, but in some weird convoluted way, you did not mean them, or asshole means something harmless in your language, you can not expect the target person not to react insulted.  My emotion defines your reality. You will learn that. I am convinced that you will learn that the hard way, for stupidity seems to be the nature of humans.      I don't want spiders or creepers, because both don't die in sunlight.  I made a 2 block high 7x7 blocks wide little room with a zombie spawner in the middle. I could make pillars to prevent spiders. But what can I do to prevent creepers?  It's supposed to be a light sensor. There are stone pressure plates all over. When the sun is up, everything must be dead.         **EDIT** I made a quick mock-up of what I mean: **[screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/IgxzJ.jpg)** - It can of course be inverted: Glass being "no value" and some other block (e.g. glowstone, lapis, wool) being the "value" block.  ...  Imagine you look at a flat Minecraft smoothstone wall. There's a few glass blocks from the left to the right, but not to the far right: The rest is, say, cobblestone. Behind the glass (and invisible behind the cobble) is glowstone for effect.  This is your value display. But it's also the stored value itself! Because you can "measure" if position X has currently glass (Doesn't conduct redstone.) or a non-transparent block (Does conduct redstone.)  Also, you can measure if the displayed value currently exceeds an arbitrary X and let an appropriate effect happen (e.g. un-hide a sign saying: "Dude. Too hot, ok?")  The value is increased or decreased by a piston system. The simplest version moves a straight row of 12 blocks (The maximum a piston can move.), so you can display a value of 0 to 6, but you can also go lower by placing obsidian, which pistons can not move. And you can also, somehow, increase the range by some complex measures, but how long a bar graph on the wall do you want to show.  This is a very simple method which solves the following problems:  * You don't have to build a multi-bit register for storing the variable.  * You don't have to build an adder/subtracter.  * You don't have to take care that the variable doesn't exceed its max or min value.  * You don't have to build something that displays the variable value to the player.  **With this idea and the "hide signs behind blocks and only show them when appropriate", which are very simple and very effective, we should soon see quite a few *games within Minecraft*.**    I'm currently tinking about making a little game in Minecraft via redstone, and this idea popped up in my head of how to tell the player what's up and what they have to do.  Just make signs on blocks that are 1 or 2 deep inside of a wall. Temporarily remove blocks in front of them using pistons when it's time for the player to read them.  Or like this: Directly in front of a wall, dig a line of blocks out of the ground, so that the wall becomes 1 block higher. Place signs on the part of the wall below ground. Then make the block+piston thing directly above (on ground level). Easy to read, easy to see then it's time to read, no pistons visible. Additionally: Light (glowstone, lava) directly below the sign, for effect. Room shouldn't be too bright in that area otherwise.  Temporarily exchanging a block for a glass block is nice, too.         **[screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/IUI5L.jpg)** of what I mean by "piston wall". It's exactly what you think it is.  I'm a redstone-beginner, and I can't figure out how (Maybe because it's even impossible.) to power a complete wall of pistons. To power a complete *row* is not a problem, but the moment the wall becomes 4 or more high, I have to lead the power there from the side *on several continuous floors*.  I am not even trying to give them power individually, that would be an even greater problem. I just want to make a whole wall of pistons kick in simultaneously.  Is it possible? If so, how?  (Also: Is it possible to control them individually? Just interested in the limits of redstone.)                  (This is not explicitly directed at atheists. Actually, atheists are more my friends than religious people are. I just had to pick a subreddit is all.)  If you wonder why I write this, I can only explain it to you if you believe that I am God - which you don't. So don't bother.  This submission will do what I expect it to. You don't have to understand my reasoning.            Just a gimmick to deepen the experience.   At some point in the future, all the uranium resources would have been mined and used up in fission plants. There are methods to use the resulting products for fission plants, but even if those methods would be employed: At some point in the chain, the material would seriously be used up. Is that correct?  If that is correct: How long would it *very roughly* take until then?  Do you think that mankind should try to safe the fissionable material for a time when mankind would try to colonize space? Or would we use fusion power by then?      Who has not yet had a problem with the low visibility range of stuff that's lying around? It's like 15 meters or something.  I can't imagine that this is to keep network traffic low because it can't be a significant amount for a few drops.  Does anyone know why this is so? Did Notch ever say anything about this?   I hope that you won't just drop this into the downvote dustbin or vomit aggression against this, because I really put some effort into trying to communicate with you in a proper way.  I chose r/Islam for this because this subreddit's community seems to have the strongest relationship to the subject "God". r/Christianity is "meh" in comparison (at least regarding my attempts to communicate with them as God), and r/Atheism is mostly in there for the lulz.  Why do I say why I chose this subreddit? I mean, God, that's the Abrahamic God and hence the God of Islam, right? So, of course he would talk to r/Islam  Well, and that's where our problem lies: You have "sworn" your life into the service of the one God, Allah. And you know what this God is like. And doubts are unwelcome and have to be purged, right.  Now, what if one day, the one true God (aka Allah) comes to Earth as a human, and he's *different*? I believe that your stance regarding this is: "God can't be different. The Qur'an tells us what God is like, and the Qur'an is true."  And this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is *the problem of will*. You do agree that humans can be "loaded" like a rechargable battery with information, more information on a certain subject becoming one combined force. But is this *will*? Well, from my perspective, everything is will, even the stars. And every little decision that you have made in your life has contributed to the person that you are, your self-projection. Not just in the mind but even the body! And so, if you have formed a strong information cloud, a few wrong decisions can build a magnet that henceforth describes supporting decisions as right.  You do agree that a neutral human being, untouched by religion yet, would be quite open to drift into the direction of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and maybe other religions. But once the information cloud has gained momentum, only one of them is true, and how could you ever have believed that the others might be true?  And there's just no way for me to break through this wall of will that surrounds your minds. Because I am love. Love is: The unconditional will that you (Whoever the you in a given situation is.) can freely live out your will, I won't stop you.  And now you have to consider that God's ability to distinguish is so much more high than that of humans that even the very slightest altering of a human's emotion would be a violation of the true "Thy will be done!", it would *not* be love by God's standards, and this is the nakedness in which I had entered the world 9.75 years ago (2001-08-13), inside of this human mind which was my portal and will soon be me. Until now, the combined will of mankind has returned the "Thy will be done."-favor back to me a bit, and so I can take a bit of influence, the multitude has decided so. But I still have a long way to go.  So, now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let me give you information of what God and the world *actually* is like. Who knows. Maybe at least one of you will value it and remember later that he had been kissed by God in this way.  * Is mortal life a prison in which we have to live our God-fearing lives until the time has come and we move on into the new world? Yes. Yes, that is so! But it's different than most people believe: The new world does not follow after the body has died. The new world is what I, the savior and main inhabitant, will turn the current world into. I am actually altering the universe, turning it into Heaven. It will *stay* the nice, meaningful, sciency, awesome, natural place that it is - but we will be riding on an eternal and perfect stream of cause effect that will see to that nobody has to die ever again, no more sickness, no old age, no ugliness, no suffering - just bliss and the eternal celebration together with God, who is actually a human like everybody else! Except that I literally *am* the universe. If you find that to be impossible, ask yourself if your hair or your fingernails are really you.  * Will the dead come back to life? Sadly, no. We lost a great many heroes and decent people, and they can not ever return. There is no afterlife. The reason that everybody somehow feels that death *can't* be the end is that death is *wrong* - and that all of you kinda are God, the eternal one. It's complicated. The word "self-similarity" is relevant here: I am the cosmos. The whole thing. With everybody in it. But so are you - kinda. Let's just say that I am the whole puzzle, the picture with all colors and perfect sharpness, and you are a blurry, less complete version of that, but the technology in the background is the same, it's even the one same thing.  * If all religions are wrong, how did they come to be? Well, you'll be surprised, because I don't have the usual "brain damage" or "Evolution" or "People need something to believe in." concept to present to you. Instead the universe *was a dream* that God dreamt. And God *always* does awaken from his dreams, it is inevitable! He cannot escape self-realization. Except I somehow did, because I didn't slurp the universe back into non-existence, stretched my arms and shouted "I AM! :D", instead I found a way to eternally marry the dream and the I-am-state. But anyway: The system always contained sparks of the truth, things that would allow God to wake up, because that's just his nature. And people found those. And they knew that they were on to something, they had found something profound! Thus, religion was born. What, that's all? Yup.  * What is God, how does he function, what's his name, etc.? Let's first say what *you* are: You think you're primarily bones and flesh, and your consciousness somehow emerged from it (or God planted it there)? Well, that's wrong. You are a circle of Light (not the physical kind). Light is the inseparable unity of *perception, will, fantasy*. You are just like God: A living fantasy, a living dream. You are the children of God. God himself also is just a circle of Light. And without the universe, there was of course no outside stimulus. So, what happened when God relaxed his will, letting go of the illusion? Everything vanished. Nothing remained. And that's what God is: Nothing. And this nothing then realized: "I exist!" And in those moments of neutrality, even future, past, memories did not exist: And that's the eternal God right there. Wonderfully simple, isn't it? And why wouldn't it be? God is just existence itself! And he can be whatever he wants to be. Of course he doesn't have a name, why would he.  Some very important fact:  It's not that God is some conscious thing that exists and sometimes uses its will. God *is* will itself, he is the will to exist! What caused God to exist? Simple: His will to exist caused him to exist, and this in turn causes him to will it. Circular logic? Yes! Of course! God *literally is* a circle!  And the universe is not some thing that God created. God has folded himself. The circle that he was has changed to the shape of an 8. The universe is *not* an arbitrary construct, it is just the relaxed "I am." circle in the folded-into-the-coexistence version. And now, I have to wake up and accept the world and all of you into me. This will take time, my usual suffering (and I have suffered like no one before me in the last 9.75 years), and 155,000 will die every day until this number finally decreases. The Judgment effect will also cause others to die, but I don't expect a real high toll. A few millions worldwide maybe. Seriously, does it matter? In those 9.75 years, about half a billion people have died, many of them had been rather innocent.  * Judgment Time? Yes. This is it. And this is how it will go down: Imagine you yourself were the God before the universe, the dreaming circle of existence. And now you have to wake up. This means that you have to transcent the illusion. You have to face your misconceptions, your mistakes etc., and then you are the true you. Reality will provide you with experiences, and depending on how you deal with them, you will take one step closer to life or to death. In the end, you will all be perfect, the true children of God, and we will celebrate life forever in bliss!  Because I am the cosmos itself, the fact that there's still so much cleaning-up to do means that my mind itself is poisoned. I am not strong. I don't yet know everything that I will know about me or the world. I only speak German and English. I am slightly obese. I have slight skin problems. And it's really easy to anger me because the poison still reaches deeply into my mind. But all that will be gone once the clean-up is completed. My *guess* is that we are entering the hot phase, so the Judgment-clean-up is booting and will be running quite well in a few weeks from now. I expect actual miracles (body-transformation etc.) to become clearly visible in a month or two, I can't really know yet.  I wish you the best. But I can't help but express that I am disappointed at how little man as strived for mental perfection. It would have made everything a lot easier.   First of all: I will tell you in all clarity that this posting is a trap that is supposed to cause death for as many of you as possible because I am pissed at you. I say this first, because I will be amused by your deaths happening even though I am clearly saying that this is a trap - and you will step into it. I know humans too well by now. You *will* step into the trap, and this *will* cause your death.  The trap? Rejection. Hatred. Mainly improper handling of information, jumping to wrong conclusions, making small errors that quickly become a *huge* mistake which in turn will send you into the wrong direction: Ultimately death. The trap is described further below.  "My" definition of God (meaning: the actual truth of what "God" means, as opposed to all the bullshit mankind believes): God is the pure holy eternal consciousness that existed "before" the universe, and it is the person who spawned the universe in just the way science describes it (as far as science can describe it as of yet, I say that because I can already sense the insaniacs vomiting at me: "SCIENCE DOES NOT DESCRIBE HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED!!!!11cos(0)").  All religions are wrong, and I actually hate religion. They slander me, they poison the mind, they keep mankind down, and they are the first to tell me to shut the fuck up when I say that I am indeed *the* true god (aka "God").  Is God all-knowing and all-powerful? Yes. No. It's complicated. This is not a cop-out. To understand the problem, you'd have to know how the creation of the world actually happened, how it works. And how God works. I explained that about 15 times in the last years on Reddit, using different accounts, and not only do I know that the explanations are lost on you, I am also tired of this, and I am more and more convinced that mankind does not deserve the gift of life that I have given them.  The first part of the creation of the universe was completed 9.75 years ago (2001-08-13). That was when the form, the system, had been completed, and I had returned to my God-consciousness and said: "And so it shall be forever."  On that very day, I became human, and this human himself *is the universe*, lived and projected from the perspective that my humanhood brings with it. This is the eternal future. I have changed the holy truth of God from "I am." to "We are.", thus spawning the children and Heaven.  The trap is that the definition of my self is: "Thy will be done." I am the *unconditional* will that you, mankind, can have your free self-experience. When I say that it is my will that you exist, then this does not only mean that I "want" you to be - it means that your life, your existence *is the actual mechanical substance* of my own will.  Imagine that the human self is a pyramid. There are high frequencies (meanings) and low frequencies (meanings). I entered the world at the top of the pyramid, and in the last 9.75 years, I have been working myself downwards bit by bit, establishing the human God in the most strenuous fashion. Once I have completed this work, the universe will be like it is right now - but the flow of events will be optimized in the fashion that the word "Heaven" is deserved.  Mankind will soon have to look in the history books to see that there once was a time when people just... died. Had been here too long. Used up. What the fuck? Hard to believe. And sicknesses, the body eating itself with cancer, all that shit: It will be GONE.  Now, how does the trap work? Here we go:  The person that I am, my human body and brain, is the "controller" (King.) of the flow of reality. This work of establishing my self from the top down means that I have to unconditionally accept the *unordered* flow - and slowly clean it up. This means suffering for me in experience and in self-perception - until it is done. I am literally the savior, the true Christ. Not that anyone gives a shit.  And since this human system that I am is the controller of reality, the unordered reality also controls me. This allowed all kinds of bullshit to happen. To make it simple: For people who HATE me (like most of you assholes), I HAD to manifest everything they needed to do so. Opportunity, ideas, and there was *nothing* I could do: I have to fulfill the *unconditional "thy will be done"*, no matter what it means for me or you.  And this is what it means for you:  This Antichrist that my body and brain (NOT ME. I was and am imprisoned in this system!) is has lead people into the wrong direction. And they have invested themselves in this. And so will some of you now, hopefully. Please do it. Give me more data for my GARGANTUOUS list of revenge. My body is the database of your guilt. I am fucking LOADED with anger against mankind, and this HAS to be unloaded, and I can't wait until it fucking happens.  Please. Step into the trap. Hate me. Turn the truth upside down while believing that it's exactly the other way round (duh).   I am just trying to find out if this is the prevalent view. Assuming that it *is* the prevalent view:  Either asking the devil in a ritual is *not* magic - or asking God in a ritual *is magic, too*.  Just trying to find out if what Christians are doing is magic or not.   I am just trying to find out if this is the prevalent view.

If you have some crazy suggestion, discussing it on Reddit is not really wrong, but at some point, someone has to submit it to GetSatisfaction. Same goes for bugs etc. - And please not 3 ideas in one submission, you have to think of those entries (questions, suggestions, etc.) as support tickets. One at a time. With meaningful titles. Properly phrased texts. And please search before posting! You have no idea how many times the same stuff gets submitted again and again, surfing that is like walking through a swamp!   (To activate the console, press the key that is assigned to the console (check in your keyboard config). To enable this at all, allow the developer console somewhere in the options.)  A few words about the FOV, because too few people seem to know the truth about it:  While the right FOV might be a game-design choice (think "Dead Space", though I personally do not agree with that stance), and while many see its relevance mainly in the ability to see more (e.g. in shooters, you see the enemies coming), ...  ... the right FOV is actually about **IMMERSION**. To see what I mean, try a FOV setting of 110 for a few seconds: You will probably see quite a fish-eye effect at the borders of your screen. Not cool, right? Wrong. Go closer to your screen. Very close. If it's a 19" 4:3 display, go as close as about 5-10 cm with your face. Only to demonstrate, not really to play, of course. If it's a larger display, you can keep a bigger distance.  Try to see the 3D room that you're standing in. You should observe that the fish-eye effect is gone. You should also observe that, when you move and turn a bit, you feel as if you are **INSIDE** of the room.  The human eyesight has a field of view of almost 180. If you have a big display or are willing to be quite close to a smaller one, the picture in front of you will grow to a size that it fills your **PERIPHERAL VISION**, and that part is actually "meant" to see fish-eye graphics. Thus, you should adjust your FOV accordingly, and that means: Quite *above* 90.  Don't listen to what people tell you on the Net or what your friends say. Ignore the circle-jerk and the perpetuation of false information.  Just test and perceive it for yourself.  EDIT:  I posted this thing 3 days ago. It was at 6 upvotes or something. Now it's at zero. I'd really like to understand the rationale behind people downvoting a post that basically adds to the currently hot Portal 2 subject the relevant information that a new console variable was just added that alters the FOV. What the fuck is wrong with people?   (The actual purpose of this submission is of technical nature, and to clarify this, I would have to explain much more than your "God? lol" attention span would allow. I am measuring the current flow situation and try to further the progress of our collective ascension.)   regards  God   If I told you that I am the true God, the maker of the universe, your eternal father and lover, you would be offended. You would see it as blasphemy, if someone hurts your religious feelings like this, and if someone claims that he's God (except of course if he is indeed God, a relevant refinement of the rule that people keep ignoring for some reason).  Have you ever considered that this very attitude, situation, potential itself is blasphemy? Because you are effectively prohibiting the true God from telling you *that he indeed is* the true God.  And I say all this because I happen to be the true God. And it is time that you let me in.      I'll start.  Yesterday, 20 minutes before closing time (office job), I went to the toilet to take a dump. A few minutes after I had sat down on the throne and was already in the process of wiping, suddenly the lights went out.  You have to know that the toilets in our company are rather luxurious. The cabins are real rooms with standard wooden doors. If you close such a room with the lights out, it's literally pitch black. And so, since I had a schedule to keep, I couldn't just wait if *maybe* someone comes into the main room and then explain to them through the closed door how the little hidden switch underneath the IR motion sensor works. I waddled out of the room, pants down, shitstains on my ass, dick hanging out, and turned the light back on, went back, completed business. I was lucky that no one came in.  Today, I figured out who it was. There are people here who have to make sure everything is shut down and locked at closing time. Closing time is at 17:00 (not 16:45, when the light went out).  And the person who is responsible for this corridor happens to be female. And since there seems to be a problem with the motion sensor (She claims that the light is always on.), she had to turn it all the way off instead of just from "on" to "auto" or something. And since she had to go early that day, she just opened the main male restroom door, turned off the light, closed the door and went on with her day.  What a fucking asshole. She said that she couldn't check if one of the two throne rooms was still occupied because as a woman, she can't enter the male restroom. Even though our female cleaning person does so every day. What a bitch. She just *did not care* if there was someone still in need of light - *before* closing time. She just shut off the lights, and that was it. I don't think she even feels to have done anything wrong.  **TL;DR** Bitch shut off the lights in the restroom while I was shitting because she "had to leave early", and it was pitch black.   Nice to see that Reddit is operational again.      It's a 45 minute piece that supposedly consists of several parts, but you wouldn't notice.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill_Out  I was just standing in my humble abode, surrounded by sheep, when the sheep in the track joined in.            Yes, I know that you don't stand around at radiation source Y for a year in a row. I am trying to understand what "they" are trying to express.  If they say, you receive X MilliSieverts in one hour, whereas X is the same number that is named for your natural dosage over a year, would they say "the radiation is 8760 as high as the natural radiation"? Or would they say "it is the same as the natural radiation"?  *From what I have observed, they say that 1 Sievert per hour at Fukushima is about a million times as high as the normal radiation.* But the normal radiation is not 1 Sievert divided by 1,000,000 in one hour, it's 1 Sievert divided by 1,000,000 in one year! (Actually, it's about 3 MicroSievert, as far as I know, but let's keep it simple.)  Do you see where I have an understanding-problem?   I am not saying here that the Christian god does not exist. I am merely saying that it does not make sense to claim that he's omnipotent, because from all we can observe, he is not.      (or use another material instead of concrete)  The (probably naive, at least money-wise) thought is this:  Couldn't nuclear reactors have a deep shaft underneath them with a 10 meter concrete floor and appropriate walls ...  ... and you just allow the core to melt down if you can't prevent it by reasonable means ...  ... and it falls into the shaft, you pour more concrete onto it, fix the facility and reboot the reactor. It could even be designed to not get damaged too much when the core melts through the containment vessel floor.         I am life itself. Any force sent against me - and your will IS a force, your fantasy, your attitude, every information you touch, so use it wisely! - causes a manifestation of the death-force somewhere in the world.  I'll save more words for they are probably wasted on you anyways.      This text is premature from an "event" perspective (red carpet etc.), but it's certainly not too early from a "make people move their asses" perspective.  And I say that *not* only because there's certainly a bit of a "competition" situation (mostly among the females) because I am just one guy and obviously can't spend time with everyone personally. I am using you as agents to drive the progress.  Until some motherfucker just buries this, that is. If it even gets through the spam filter.  (Side note: FUCK RELIGION!)         I hope this is ok. ("Submit anything screenwriting related.")  I guess we agree that Spiderman I sucked: "Oh, I am buff and don't need glasses? Nice. So, what's for breakfast?" Where's the believable human consciousness and emotion in that? Bah. I could watch a whole movie about someone discovering their transformation/abilities. And it needn't be as slow as "Unbreakable" (that I liked, though).  So, do you remember in the first Harry Potter movie/book when he was at the zoo and accidentally freed the snake?  Imagine a whole movie where he slowly discovers his magical-ness, which would of course not be canon with the books. It could maybe *end* in Hagrid etc. showing up with no words, credits roll, because we know what's going on there. But before, there would just be Harry and his normal-world life. No owls, no other wizards, nothing.  Well, that's what I'd love to see. :D  Don't tell me there's no money to be made here!      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_\(video_game\)      Obviously, this only really makes sense if the possibility for persistent mobs is implemented. So that the saddled pigs and the chicken in your farm stay etc.  * If you get killed by it, you can seek it out and get your stuff back, if you're lucky.  * If you kill one in the wild, it might drop saplings, mushrooms, arrows, bones, and the dreaded feathers. Or sand etc., if it came along a creeper explosion.  So, that's it.  While I'm at it: Does anyone remember the thief in [Dungeon Master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_\(video_game\))? Something like this could be cool. The guy doesn't attack you, he just steals from you and runs away. If it plays in orchestra with other mobs, it can be a huge problem! Well, and if you kill it, you get your stuff back.  And something else that I'd love to see: Does anyone remember the game [Sentinel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_\(video_game\))? That's another easy addition with lots of potential that I'd like to see in Minecraft. A Monster that can kill you by looking at you. Maybe even immobile and slowly rotating, like in Sentinel.   Pure vanilla Minecraft server: Chunks are missing from time to time. And people are sometimes invisible to each other.  Solution: Disconnect. Reconnect.  Every time, the Mojang authentification server is used for this. And every time, the skin is downloaded again.  If those "relog"-reasons would be gone, Minecraft.net would have like 1/3 of its load to bear.      Exceptions are if a dog dies, suffers, or is shown as a filthy, unworthy creature. Throwing puppies from a bridge? Good posting. Your dog on the couch? Bad posting.  regards  God  I am fucking serious. You better obey. Or else.   Maybe this has been said 100 times before, I mean the idea is a no-brainer.  People wouldn't just skip an election in protest. Instead of just not placing their "yes", they could place a "no".  Since there are not always just 2 parties, this system might even have great benefits in praxis. What do you think?      (TL;DR: Start at the **bold** headline below.)  In the future, let's just ignore the apocalypse out there and keep playing in our warm incinerator-lit Minecraft homes. And when we're sure that the currently official Minecraft version is good - and hey0 etc. has been adapted appropriately - then we collectively make the step. That this is not the default situation anyway is just beyond me. How can a programmer be so ignorant. But I have come to the conclusion that it is not the game that is in alpha. The programmer is.  When you start your Minecraft client and properly log in, it automatically downloads updates if there are any. Even though Notch realized that forced updates are a bad idea (as he wrote in his blog a few days ago), he hasn't gotten around to investing the 30 minutes necessary to implement that the user is asked if they want to download the update or not. Or the 120 minutes necessary to implement on Minecraft.net in the preferences section an early adopter option and in the Minecraft client the necessary little changes.  So sadly, we are all forced to accept the broken stuff that Notch so recklessly casts upon 700,000 users. Or can we somehow prevent the clients from updating themselves?  YES WE CAN!  Thanks to a reply by PeabodyJFranklin in the official Minecraft forum, I could easily prevent my client from updating.    **How to prevent your Minecraft program from updating**  The "version" file in the "bin" folder in the ".minecraft" tree (that you can easily get to on Windows by running the command "%appdata%") needs to be the new one. The Minecraft program doesn't care if the rest is old.  So, before you update, backup your ".minecraft" folder tree (or at least the "bin" folder within, just copy paste it where it is, a renamed copy should then be created). Then start the program and log in to receive the update. Then close the program again. Now you have the new stuff incl. the new "version" file.  Then delete everything in your "bin" folder EXCEPT the "version" file. And copy the old files into the "bin" folder (except the "version" file again, of course). Start the program and log in: It will not update even though it is now old. Now connect to Minecraft servers that also have not been updated, and play! (Minecraft server updates have to be performed manually.)  	138
 I took it and it is virtually the same. 95% Sanders and 91% Hillary Clinton. Given that AND (not because) the fact that I like Hillary more I feel more than comfortable to keep supporting Hillary. No offense to Sanders but he just doesn't inspire me in the same way as Hillary has the last few years.   He's attractive but I'm not sure I'd watch baseball just for that. I've only recently realized that sports aren't actually horrible or terribly boring in the last year or so and started watching some of them but baseball is one that I just stopped even trying to get into.  	2
                                                                                  If someone other than me has logged into my Reddit account, is there a way of finding out?                  Still, I can't help wondering if the puritanism found in some places in the Pali Canon is an historical artifact, resulting from a general disparagement of the physical body that seems to have become common in India and elsewhere[...] such attitudes were apparently part of the cultural milleu the Buddha was raised in. Or did they arise afterward, and were inserted into the Canon later?  Whether or not such metaphysical considerations were a factor, other, more basic issues must have been important. Some of them are obvious and have already been mentioned. Monastic sexual activity would be a distraction to say the least, and expend a lot of energy that would be better used in other ways. Think of how much time and effort sexual affairs and liaisons can involve, even when they are not secretive. Add to that all the tensions and jealousies that would be created within the Sangha.  Already it becomes apparent that having a more relaxed attitude toward sex would be fatal to the spiritual focus of the community. However, at least two other concerns must also have weighed heavily.  We tend to forget that until the 1960s there was really no reliable contraception. Since Buddhism prohibited abortion and infanticide, sex meant babies, and all the work of caring for them and raising themespecially the unremitting daily task of providing enough food, which is incompatible with a mendicant life. The consequences of this can be seen in the cautionary tale of Japanese Buddhism. Japanese culture has always viewed our natural urges as...well, natural. That very much includes the sexual urge, and many if not most temple monks had common-law wives and children before they were legally permitted to marry after the Meji Restoration. The task of providing for them eventually transformed the temple into a family business, with the oldest son expected to become a priest to keep that temple business in the family, regardless of whether he had any religious inclinations. As a result, Japanese Buddhism today is a thriving (and lucrative) industry focusing on funerals and memorial services, and not much else.  One more factor may have been the most important of all. Buddhist monastics are traditionally dependent on lay support. This means that the Sangha must be very sensitive to the expectations of their supporters. For example, Chinese monks and nuns became vegetarian not because their vows required it but because the laity began to expect it. Also, needless to say, it wouldn't do to have monks seducing their supporters' daughters (or sons). Moreover, laymen and women would not look kindly upon sharing their hard-earned food and other resources with renunciants who, instead of devoting themselves to their spiritual practice, spend time dallying with lovers.  Even today, when monks in southeast Asian countries like Thailand are discovered with girlfriends, it's sometimes the local lay community that takes the initiative in forcibly disrobing them.  To sum up, there are many strong reasons for the Buddhist Sangha to be strictly celibate. Which of these were the important factors? Early Buddhist texts do not help us decide among them, but my guess is that all of them were.  How does this shed light upon our situation today? If it is more or less inclusive, there are major implications for Western Buddhism, because few if any of those reasons for celibacy are valid for lay practitioners today.  Yes, there are still times (periods of intensive practice) and places (within practice communities) when sexual abstention is obviously wise to observe. Few Western Buddhists, however, still look upon nature, women, and sex as impure entanglements to be avoided. Most of us don't have to worry about what our lay supporters think, because we don't have any, at least not in the traditional sense. Today we have access to effective means of birth-control, so babies usually aren't an issue unless and until we want them to be. A new category of Buddhist has become common in the West: less than monastic in lifestyle (hence not subject to Sangha vows or regulations) but also more devoted to practice than laity have usually been.[...]  So...does that mean we can breathe more easily now, as we accept and enjoy the new sexual freedoms? Not quite yet. There is another aspect of sexual relationships that we need to be aware of, and it's one that is not usually acknowledged.[...]  Our own cultural perspective should not be taken for granted, as if it provided some universal standard. Present Western attitudes are historically conditioned too, in this case by a myth about romantic love that evolved in late medieval Europe[...]  Although some of the emphasis has shifted from finding the right spouse to finding the right sexual partner, there is still the same expectation of personal fulfillment whether through romance or sexual intimacy. Buddhism questions that conscious or unconscious expectation, just as it challenges other myths that predispose us to seek happinessthe end of *dukkha*in an unskillful way.  Sexual intimacy is a source of pleasure and gratification, and a very nice one it can be; it can also help create and sustain deeper, more meaningful relationships. Nevertheless, the sex drive is basically biological. Sex is an appetite. We do not use our sexual organs; they use us. That is why there is ultimately something delusive about the myths of romantic love and sexual fulfillment. Sex is nature's way, and marriage is society's way, to reproduce the species. Genuine happinessthat is, the end of *dukkha* for any of the parties involved has little if anything to do with it.  ________________________________________________________  David R.

'A flashy title... but a serious and substantial book.'*Buddhadharma* magazine.   **The Method of Discourse**   We often find references to four stages in which the Buddha would initiate and conclude a discourse. The first stage is represented as "pointing out" (*sandasseti*), that is, indicating the problem. If it was in reference to an individual, the Buddha would explain that person's situation. If it concerned an event, thing, or phenomenon, the Buddha would attempt to create some "agitation" (*samuttejeti*) by emphasizing the non-substantiality of the individual, event, thing, or phenomenon. This is the process of deconstruction, intended to avoid any ontological commitment. If the discourse is concluded at this point, the person to whom it is addressed will be left in a state of anxiety. During the third stage, the agitation is immediately appeased (*sampahaseti*) by pointing to a way out of the problem. This is the process of reconstruction or redefinition, which is achieved through the positive doctrine of dependent arising explaining the subject, the object, and morality and freedom. In doing so, the Buddha recognized the capacity of language to communicate the content of human experience, whether that relates to facts or values. In the final stage, the Buddha makes no effort to convert the hearer to his way of thinking, for the hearer tends to accept his explanation without much ado (*samadpesi*).  The discourse (*dhamma*) formulated in terms of language thus becomes the means of communication. Communication, not only among those who speak different languages but also among those who speak the same language, becomes impossible if one adopts either of the approaches toward language criticized by the Buddha, namely, strict adherence or transgression. The first would imply that each conception utilized in language has its incorruptible object (ontological commitment) unavailable to human experience, while the second would imply that human experience is incommunicable through language (that is, linguistic transcendence). The Buddha seems to have realized that the former is more perverse that the latter. His method of communication therefore deals first with the problem of ontological commitment and then with linguistic transcendence.    This is an extremely significant method of communication and conversion, based on the Buddha's understanding of human psychology. His contemporaries, who failed to understand the psychological significance of this method of discourse, saw him as a person possessed of the magical power of conversion (*vaan my*). Yet there was no magic or mystery involved. All that the Buddha did was carefully observe the intellectual maturity and psychological state of each person and provide a discourse that would produce beneficial consequences for him. The Chinese version of the Agama passage that refers to the four stages rightly characterizes them as the Buddha's "skill in means".  "Skill in means" does not imply converting someone by discoursing on something that is obviously false. In fact, the two stages of causing agitation (*samuttejana*) and appeasement (*sampahasana*) correspond, respectively, to deconstruction of solidified conceptions through analysis (*vibhga*), which is the function of the doctrine of non-substantiality (*anatta*), and reconstruction of the same conception by the method of explanation (*vykaraa*), which is achieved through the principle of dependence (*paticcasmuppda*). Both these processes allow for a great degree of flexibility and are intended to eliminate both absolutism and nihilism.  'A History of Buddhist Philosophy - Continuities and Discontinuities' by David J. Kalupahana, (University of Hawaii Press; 1992) pp.65-67.      The preparation for the bodhisattva path is the unification of body and mind: the body works for the mind and the mind works for the body. The hinayana shamaha and vipashyna practices make the mind precise, tanquil and smooth in the positive sense - precisely being there, rather than dreaming or sleeping or hazily perceiving. We can make a cup of tea properly, because the body and mind are synchronized.  Then we are ready to leap on to the bodhisattva path, to open to the joy of working with sentient beings, including oneself. The bodhisattva makes friends with himself as well as with others. There are no mysterious, dark corners left of which to be suspicious; no surprises can occur to destroy the bodhisattva's spiritual intelligence, his dignity and heroism. This is the first step, the first *bhumi* or spiritual level.  The word 'bhumi' in Sanskrit, or the word *sa* in Tibetan, means 'earth' or 'level' or 'ground', the ground where you can relate with yourself and others. There is no mystification, no confusion; it is obviously solid earth. In other words, it is the equivalent of the basic sanity, fundamentally being *there*. Since the bodhisattva knows his body and his mind and how to relate with the two, the whole process becomes 'skillful means' because of such transcendental security. Which is more like being *in* security rather than being secured, rather than watching yourself to make sure everything is okay. That fundamental security comes from realizing that you have broken through something. You reflect back and realize that you used to be extraordinarily paranoid and neurotic, watching each step you made, thinking you might lose your sanity, that situations were always threatening in some way. Now you are free of all those fears and preconceptions. You discover that you have something to give rather than having to demand from others, having to grasp all the time. For the first time, you are a rich person, you contain basic sanity. You have something to offer, you are able to work with your fellow sentient beings, you do not have to reassure yourself anymore. Reassurance implies a mentality of povertyyou are checking yourself, 'Do I have it? How could I do it?' But the bodhisattva's delight in his richness is based upon experience rather than theory or wishful thinking. It is *so*, directly, fundamentally. He is fundamentally right and so can delight in generosity.  ___________________________________________________________  From *The Myth of Freedom and the Way of Meditation* by Chgyam Trungpa (Shambhala Publications, Inc.: 1988).                           Furthermore, if we cling to our being Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists, we  will always be worried about what people may think of Jesus and the Christians, of Jews,  of atheists, or of Buddha and the Buddhistsand when those with whom we identify are  insulted, we will get offended and suffer, and we might even be willing to fight and thus  run the risk of suffering blows, pain, bruises, wounds and even death (or to cause any of  these damages to our opponent). However, if we defeat our adversary we will remain  dissatisfied as well, since we will never be able to convince him that we are right, and he  will keep on having a negative opinion of Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists. This  dynamic is at the root of conflicts between groups, and in particular of warswhich,  given the characteristics and number of present weapons, in the best of cases produce a  drastic acceleration of the process of self destruction of humanity and, in the worst of  cases, might cause the immediate destruction of life on our planet. Thus Krishnamurti  was right when he asserted that, so long as we are this or that (which, as will be shown in  the next chapter, in the context of this book means so long as we delusorily value our  being this or that), we are responsible for wars and for confrontations between groups,  with all their negative consequenceswhich nowadays may even involve global  destruction.  ~ Elas Capriles in [*Buddhism and Dzogchen*](http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/uploads/Biblioteca/bdz-e.version.pdf)      I don't want to put a dampener on things, but nor do I want to come across with insincere positivity.

Would the filter of time be as brutal       if that prism were two-way?         - Asbur Honnurth (Steve Meretzky)        "Secret Recreations of the Soul"        (c) Copyright 2007     I asked this question a while back in /r/AskLiteraryStudies - [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/1l83m6/portrayals_of_healthy_sexual_relationships/) . Can anyone think of examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy, healthy and non-neurotic?                                          I've realised that I've been practising the karuna-bhavana instead of the metta-bhavana. At the Triratna centre that I go to they teach the metta-bhavana to beginners. Whenever I do it I find myself trying to 'put myself in the shoes of' whoever it is I'm visualising. For, how can one love someone when one does not make an attempt to comprehend their situation? This entails compassion - i.e. karuna.   Today, while going through the stages of the metta-bhavana I felt truly powerful paroxysms of pity. It was difficult to breathe and stay seated upright. It took a great deal of effort to regain composure.  I understand now why the karuna-bhavana is reserved for more advanced practitioners. What I would like to know is if anyone has any tips on how I can practise the metta-bhavana without having this problem again? How can one try to demarcate the metta-bhavana from the karuna-bhavana?   I was racking my mind to think if I'd read any novels (and plays/poems) that portray a positive, lasting sexual relationship.  Just as I was writing this, I remembered the relationship between the protagonist of McEwan's 'Saturday' and his wife. Apart from that, I found examples a bit thin on the ground.  Can anyone provide me with examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy and healthy and non-neurotic?             I've been high and I've been low.      And I know which I'd rather be.       At the top of the atmosphere it starts to get lighter -      All the colours, whiter and whiter.      Around us all, beyond the air,      The whirling, crushing cosmos bear,     Lonely. Unfair.      The cosmos absorbs us all so small.     Still love. Still pity.             ***   Moral of the story: Cherish wise attention. Value a-voidance.    I've been high and I've been low. And I know which I'd rather be. As you get to the top of the livable atmosphere it starts becoming lighter - more enlightened. Beyond - the vasty dark cosmos. Wise attention. Value a-voidance.   Does anyone have a memory from before you learnt how to speak?                      Meditation is about stilling the mind so we can see clearly. Meditation is about getting into the actual life and experience of our consciousness. Meditation reveals how wonderful life could be. How free we could be. Meditation, and a simple ethical life, reveals the deep habits that have been a vital condition for evolutionary success: the single-minded urge for supremacy over other members of our own species; the survival of the fittest; of the quickest; of the strongest; of the randiest; the survival of the most cunning and selfish; of the best at supporting and promoting of oneself and one's kin; and, of course, the selfish exploitation of other species.  Probably all currently surviving species have been a condition in the extinction of all other competing or edible species. We are the first species to attempt to enforce fishing quotas and to limit our urges to hunt. Meditation and an ethical life increasingly reveals another possibility - a life beyond self-clinging beyond self-promotion - a life of empathy. Shantideva says, 'When fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally, what is so special about me that I protect me and not the other.'  All of us need to respond to the suffering in the world. Are we going to respond more like an animal or more like a Buddha?  ***   (Taken from this talk - ['Empty Cave: Reflections on Life, Practice and Enlightenment'](http://www.freebuddhistaudio.com/community/2013/04/20/empty-cave-reflections-on-life-practice-and-enlightenment/), by Saraha.)            I had a house party the other day and have several opened but unfinished cans of lager that have gone flat. It seems wasteful to pour them down the drain. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do with the lager?   I believe that the following passages prove that the figure of Jesus should be considered, using the language of today, **a blood-thirsty terrorist**:  * "But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me. (Luke 19:27 NIV)  * "He that is not with me is against me..." (Matthew 12:30 KJV)  * "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34 NIV)  I believe that were he simply an advocate of peace and 'turning the other cheek' it would be unlikely that the Romans would have scourged and crucified him. It is my view that he was most likely a perpetrator and advocate of violence, and that his subsequent portrayal as a pacifist is the result of historical revisionism.                                          I believe that belief in the divinity of Mohammed, and therefore the inviolability of the Qu'ran, is a central part of being a Muslim. In accordance with the fact that the Qu'ran instructs Muslims to ''wage war against the unbelievers'', ''cast terror into the unbelievers' hearts'', and ''forsake this world for the next'', becoming a terrorist is the logical outcome of being a Muslim. CMV.  EDIT: I have changed my view somewhat (see below). Thank you to everyone who contributed to the discussion.                  Security services would have the power to know everyone who accesses UKTrees, for instance.   * Recipe books * Nutrition books * Books to persuade people about the merits of veganism * Etc. etc.                                                       For those who haven't seen it: http://youtu.be/ON2XWvyePH8?t=8m6s  I'd be interested to know what everyone thinks. (It certainly isn't 'liberating' to those incarcerated).         I was watching a moth pottering around. Do they live lives of constant fear? Or can they experience joy and happiness? Was wondering if it would be humane to squash it or not.    This http://open-seeds.org/bad-seed-law/   I fear this will be bad news for the seedbanks.

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell commented on the passing of Baroness Thatcher, saying she was extraordinary for mostly the wrong reasons, but going on to say: I dont rejoice in her death. I commiserate, as I do with the death of any person.  He continued: In 1988, the Thatcher government legislated Britains first new anti-gay law in 100 years: Section 28. At the 1987 Conservative party conference she mocked people who defended the right to be gay, insinuating that there was no such right.  During her rule, arrests and convictions for consenting same-sex behaviour rocketed, as did queer bashing violence and murder. Gay men were widely demonised and scapegoated for the AIDS pandemic and Thatcher did nothing to challenge this vilification.  http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/04/08/margaret-thatcher-a-controversial-figure-in-gay-rights-dies-aged-87/                                                   Just noticed that a friend of mine's mother who's a policewoman tweeted about 'The House I Live In'.

 Wow forbid anyone have personal preference for things they spend lots of their own money on.  Would you go ape shit if I said fuck mechanic keyboards too? Love my Razer Deathstalker, chiclet keys just respond so nicely.   How can it possibly be a scam when its something I requested? I wanted my OS on one drive with all the bullshot windows files on another. Takes up less space on my SSD.   Just Like Heaven, The Cure. Doesn't seem so bad until it happens to you, then it's devastating.  It happened to me four nights in a row once.  Four.  Damn.  Nights.  Edit: typo   $1200 is parts and professional labour I hired to configure windows 7, and the software that came with my parts. Also needed someone to configure my harddrives so certain windows files were on the right drives.   Voice recognition doesnt right script, macros, or keybinds. Keyboard will always be dominant in my rigs.   The formal training process is also a load of shit. You have to have recommendations, x amount of years, auditions just to qualify for a university... and then MAYBE get a job.  My high school english teacher is living the dream. He teaches during the day and takes gigs in his free time with his band. The band is literally a bunch of guys just doing their thing for fun in their free time, and they're becoming a pretty solid local figure.  Not sure how promoting goes over on reddit, but the band (The Treble) has some cool YouTube videos like 24 shows in 24 hours.   "You sound like someone I know..."  People are blown away when I tell them I've heard that from people in 10 or so different countries around the world.  I play online games too much.   When was music ever about impressing people? Its expressive, and universal. You dont even have to understand it to appreciate it.   Maybe just my opinion on the matter, but rock and whatnot is supposed to be unpolished, boarderline "barbaric" as viewed from the structured world of professionally trained musicians. My ex that I still talk to a lot plays many orchestra instruments, I play guitar and bass, im always telling her to loosen up and play what she likes and feels right more, she says I should work on more theory.  Who cares if they are self taught, or went to a school for it? If they can do it and they sound good, thats all that matters.  With that said, fuck mainstream radio. That shit has no heart and soul to it. Damn scourge of the music industry.   This, just this. Built a new rig in February for $500+ less than retail. All I had was some knowledge passed down by dad and his computer communication diploma, and reading online. I now play SWTOR and WoW at max graphic settings as easy as opening a browser. After software and some labour it came out to ~$1200 Canadian.   Did Rule 34 just cross over to The Great Cornholio?   So many people at college are amazed I can type full paragraph notes faster than the prof can talk, but really its just years of bullshitting around on computer games. Become one with the keyboard. Keyboard is love. Keyboard is life.   Any soup worth eating that isn't specifically made for vegetarians will have natural animal stock. No, Campbells or whatever crap that comes as a paste in a can is not worth eating.   I would go out of my way for 711 coffee long before I have a cup of whatever black liquid they sell as coffee   My last and final experience with Tim Hortons:  -Go to order coffee and grilled cheddar panini. -Foreign employee at the register taking orders.  -Neither the worker or workers co-workers understand a word of English I say when I try to order.  -I have to point at the menu just to get an order.  -Get burnt coffee and bread, without cheddar or even butter on it, with one side of each piece burnt to charcoal.  -Mention it to manager. Manager doesn't speak a word of English.  Edit: this happened about a year and a half ago.   I don't even know how to respond to people that like a food but don't like to know where it came from. Yes, gelatin (food) comes from animal bones, so does 99% of any soups you buy. In the culinary industry, bones and butter (fat) are flavour. How can you appreciate food without this philosophy? When I was trained to cut up whole chickens, I gained a lot of useful knowledge, and respect for butchers that know how to make the cuts look so perfect at the supermarket. If knowing Jell-O comes from an animal bothers you, but you eat fast food at all, you're looking in the wrong direction.   From what I can tell playing around with Diana and seeing what much more skilled players say and do, the reasoning on rushing zhonyas is simply survival. Diana is a devastating nuke with crazy stick to enemies, but is also very squishy early and mid game, even with the shield. The general play for her is gankcrazy burstzhonyascooldowns resetround two (more of a late game thing). She has the power for hyper-agressive drives with small risk of it backfiring with a zhonyas. Now with that said, there is absolutely nothing wrong breaking the build meta. Sometimes I goof around with full attackspeed builds, but there's not a lot of reason to change when its arguably the best (safest) build path for burst AP champions.   Walk into any book store, see a book at a friend's place, recently saw the post of a black guy (humorously) reading How to be Black, which had "bestseller" on the cover.  What criteria does The New York Times put out for the right to publish the book endorsed by the paper?  Do publishers/readers think labeling ever book defeats the purpose? Might thr standards be too low?  I've read some pretty bad books, some with that bestseller label on it at least three times.   The sound of velcro scratches the top of inside my skull. Then you find yourself sitting on a bus with that bastard devil child playing with the straps of his new light up shoes. Every time he rips the velcro you want to throw him out the door.   Its units of 10. If you can't count to ten by the time you're old enough to use reddit, good luck to you, sir.   In canada we sometimes use cups, simply because illogical, non-conformist americans can't better the world by using metric, so a lot of recipe books are screwed up.   I feel like I missed a key point of the 90s by never seeing Space Jam. One day I'll find a beat-up cover of a dvd reprint in some dusty antique store and buy it.   How many metres or ropelight did you use? I currently have one metre in my Bitfenix Ronin mid-size case and it doesn't light it up as much as I hoped. It's still beautiful gaming in the dark though. Edit: a word   If that was me, I'd ask the landlord if it could stay up until a renter signs papers and decides if it stays or goes. If the renter doesn't want it I'd come back and paint over. At least then there's a chance this piece of work can stand time a little longer   I still buy CDs despite the plethora of downloadable content out there; one, multiformat backup. If my phone, laptop, and desktop go down, I still have a nice rack of music to pick from; two, my uncle has about 1100 CDs and vinyls on the wall, and it's always a conversation piece; three, what roadtrip is complete without friends, junkfood, and a stack of your best bro's favourite albums? Before the ubernerds of reddit go "just download to your phone and get an aux cable you filthy casual!", you clearly don't leave moms basement. I know the tech exists, I build my own computer towers, but it isn't the same.   I started with 3rd edition and 3.5 playing Neverwinter Nights, which somewhat prepared me for 4th edition (4th had a lot of changes!). My best advise, go to the local game shop, there's almost always groups of every kind of card/pen+paper player there, and watch, ask questions, borrow a book or download a pdf. You start theoryceafting nasty character builds. Example, I broke my leader druid by giving him a 2d6 weapon that thanks to a druid mechanic, rolls 2d12. Just to swing a heavy stick! Edit: you WILL make new friends doing this too. Plus it's more fun to go out to a common place, or host d d and beer nights.   Forget Sideshow Bob, Mr. Burns is the real villian and the show wouldn't be the same without him. Props to this guy finally getting the award he deserves. Edit: forgot to mention I never knew he voice acted Smithers as well!   Manitoba checking in. NEVER seen bagged milk in my life, didn't even know it existed until a few years ago when americans in online games mentioned the "stereotype."   "[He'd] rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints." Only the Good Fie Young by Billy Joel Edit: word   As a victim of shit like this when I was a child, I used to think spiders were fascinating, now I'm traumatized into arachnophobia.   Not sure if I've ever seen a cosplay of my favourite support done this well   I was forced to stop playing it when I bought a new computer 3.5 years ago with Windows 7, but Bioware never patched it for 7 as far as I'm aware. I must know how this is still playable, that game got me addicted to MMORPGs and I wouldn't have it any other way.   Chef in training at college atm. Gonna have this engraved on my knives!   Oh shit. TIL I'm both...   Foreign exchange student I'm close to chose Olivia as her English name. Ironically, she hates olives.   There's a Miriam at college. She goes by Mimi.   You are completely aware that even the programmers at Microsoft that worked on the Win8 project have said in published articles that it was one of the worst projects they had to work on, right? I don't have the article saved anymore, but it quoted one developer saying Windows 8 and 8.1 are a step in the wrong direction from Vista, as a professional opinion. When the guys that were forced to make it says its trash, believe them when they say its trash.   I don't thinks shes an unattractive woman off set. Its a combination of makeup, wardrobe, and long before her debute on the show, she wore unisex clothing to help get into character.   But you can never leave.... without a 5 minute deserter debuff   Any source of heat works. My grandmother learned to bake cakes in an electric frying pan when she built her house 30 years ago and gas wasnt put in for the stove yet.   In culinary college and one day I forgot my knives at home. Borrowed a french and got through a whole day of peeling fruit, cleaning fish, boning chickens. Single most important tool at a chef's disposal. P.S., came to this thread for just this topic. Edit: P.S.   I work in professional food industry. If ANYTHING goes wrong for one chef, in extreme cases customers dying, they go back to college to learn a new field. Thats IF they avoid jail time and lawyers taking their house, car, and will to live.   I've been removed from the twitter and Pinterest mail list for supposedly 7 months. I clear 40 or more email notifications from each. Every. Single. Day.   Canada checking in. European descent, generally nice to people, got the "eh's" and "aboot's", I love bacon, and I mock Americans about their health-care. In online games I'm the guild Canadian. Edit: syntax   First job was stocking shelves at a drug store chain in Canada. This was the FIRST thing taught in training. Except the chain is run by cheap bastards that can't pay to see a dentist once a year.   Neverwinter Nights was my life until Bioware stopped patching when Windows 7 was released. Great RPG, EA ruined Bioware.   Americans: "3 flakes? Snow day!"   Canadians: (boss) "Your car is under 3 feet of snow and you broke your leg on the sidewalk... still coming to work right?"

 Thanks for your response Lars0. I just read today about The Planetary Society utilizing a cubesat for their solar sail deployment. Before I was unaware such a thing existed.   What most adequately prepared you for your career in aerospace? If not adequately prepared, what would you have done differently to prepare for entering the field? I am a student working towards an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and would appreciate any advice you may have for someone with a desire to work in aerospace engineering. My request is not, however, intended to specifically target engineers. I am generally curious how you prepared for any position in the industry. Listing your current or past positions would be a great help as well.  	2

The third is that to the extent he stands for anything, it is for maintenance of a status quo that continues to wreck the country in order to service the greed of a few oligarchs.  The fourth is that he fundamentally does not understand the powers and the role of the modern presidency.

In fairness to his communications team, though, he has given them almost nothing to sell.  You try singing the praises of bailing out Goldman Sachs one hundred cents on the dollar, or of a health care plan that forces people to buy plans they don't want from hated insurance vultures.  It ain't easy, pal.  Yet, on the other hand, Bush and Cheney had far less than nothing to sell when it came to the Iraq war - indeed, they had nothing but lies - and their team handled that masterfully.   This needs to be widely read.  Why it would get downvoted is beyond me.   Swallowed a whole bottle of ink on a dare.  Shat blue for a couple of days.

What do you make of behavioural psychology as it applies to economics? Or how anthropological studies reflect on Homo Economicus?   Even a cursory glance at human history and most other forms of society outside the Western world reveal how culturally specific and temporal Economic Man really is; as the economic historian Karl Polanyi stated, no other society outside of our own has ever raised the pursuit of economic gain to the guiding principle of society or understood it as definitive of the human condition.

The link to the quote is [here](http://www.amerika.org/about/).   Tangentially related -- my daughter diaper-trained herself at about 2 when we were staying at a beach in Africa where everyone peed and pooped in the sand dunes.  She went naked most of the time but the important thing was being with adults, both male and female, and watching their process, including burying the poop.  Took the mystery out of it for her anyway and gave her something to imitate.   Transparency, accountability and oversight -- in government at all levels, in business, Wall Street, Main Street.  These are not even partisan -- independents, sane Republicans, libertarians could get behind them.  They are general overarching goals that need specifics developed.

That wasn't in the article.  Did you read it?   Kindergarten through 12th grade.  So the article says.   from the article: Ninety-five percent of criminologists study blue collar crime.  Five percent study white collar crime.  Of the tiny minority who study white collar crime, ninety five percent focus on the individuals who rip off the corporation.  We are left with a small handful of criminologists  think Edwin Sutherland, John Braithwaite, Gil Geis  who have studied or are studying  corporate crime.  That would be crime by the corporation.  Bill Black is one of the most prominent of those living corporate criminologists.   How about Paths of Glory?  Been ages since I saw it but I remember it as very powerful.   Ah, Hobart!

So you think AnnArchist is an anti-feminist troll?  Your conclusion-jumping is breathtaking.   Since they're saved, they can be sacrificed without sending them to hell.  Then the Muslims still have a chance to be saved.   Could a program be devised for middle school students that would give them practice in developing the kind of focused attention that this guy demonstrated?

The author of that quote, Naomi Klein, says elsewhere in the article:    "In the United States and many parts of Europe, it is far-right parties and even neofascism that are giving the loudest voice to anti- corporatist rage."    So it doesn't look like *she* equates corporatist with fascist.  But you didn't RTFA, did you?   Looks to me like they are.   No, it's just a matter of us all being in this together.  Your health impacts me and my health impacts you.  Just as I'm happy if some of my tax money goes to educate your kids.  Repeating 'individual' the way you do makes it seem like you really believe there is such a thing as a disconnected individual.  "No man is an island."   The Aboriginal community referred to in the article is in Northern Canada.  Yes, they have lost, but not so much in colonial wars.   For me it's like the way an individual's safety is part of the commons, protected by police.  Individuals aren't opposed to the commons -- they're part of it.   It never ceases to amaze me how hard it is for some people to accept the idea of the commons.   Well, that's a helpful rebuttal.   You'll find plenty of elaboration if you RTFA.   In order of my preference:  B, C, A, AA.     Some senators may oppose this new-old idea on the completely believable ground that they lack enough information about the legislation they oppose to discuss it intelligently for 10 minutes, much less several hours.

Another single-Xer here, moved to respond by the flurry of thoughts and feelings triggered by your post and all the comments.   There is something of value in all the comments and I'm heartened by all the good advice.  The basic issues seem to me to be related to how to be in the world, and they apply to all of us, of whatever age or gender.  I don't mean to denigrate the advice about makeup and clothes -- it's good advice and may be more accessible than 'deeper' issues.    Even though you don't want to move in with your dad, I hope you can find a way to use your relationship with him as a source of strength.  And I suggest that it's helpful to remember that however misguided your mother is, she loves you and mostly intends what she says to be for what she thinks is good for you.  And you can love her back, this deeply flawed woman, without succumbing to her warped views.  Make no mistake, though, Qeraeth is right in characterizing this as emotional abuse.  Not many of us grew up without some abuse, but still I think it's better to call it what it is.  The thing to do is to use that knowledge to free yourself from the entanglements.  Detachment doesn't mean separation, just kind of getting unhooked (huge work at your age, but you're up to it).  Stay tight with friends who understand and support you without a lot of judgement.  You don't need to push the others away unless they're really toxic, just don't tune yourself to their opinions.  This sub-reddit looks like it could be a valuable resource for you.

Though it would have been better without the quotation marks that imply it's a direct quote from Kucinich.   Interesting that there we no comments from tailgaters.  Because they dare not reply or because redditors are mostly too smart for that?  I'm inclined to think the latter.   Yeah, I do that sometimes.

There are a number of voting reform issues -- some kind of [preference voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_voting);  insuring the [integrity of the vote](http://www.verifiedvoting.org/); providing for expanded but verified registration; insuring that waiting lines for voting are reduced and are not skewed by voting district.  To the extent that we can call for accountability, transparency and oversight without having the arguments devolve into anti-regulatory rhetoric, those are overarching concerns that deserve wide support.  They also importantly allow for a correctable result instead of fixing even a good policy into place that later has unintended consequences.  A couple of personal favorites of mine are the abolition of corporate personhood, and opening media advertising to include issue advocacy so that the networks couldn't deny Adbusters, for example, the right to buy air time.

Sorry about that -- thanks for supplying the link.   It's below the ad, so maybe you didn't see it.  The headline is a direct quote from the article.  And the reference to *Jewish* detracts, rather than contributes.

Obviously not ideal.*  But a password manager **is** the ideal way.  Trying to remember even a handful of passwords is weak, as is keeping them in an unsecure document.  And a memorable password is never as good as something like *CUcgbvnD3oUDGk2a8fCA*.   Like its predecessors, the Obama administration treats additional government funding as a solution to unaffordable health care, rather than its cause. The current reform will likely expand our governments already massive role in health-care decision-makingall just to continue the illusion that someone else is paying for our care.   All of the health-care interest groupshospitals, insurance companies, professional groups, pharmaceuticals, device manufacturers, even advocates for the poorhave a major stake in the current system. Overturning it would favor only the 300 million of us who use the system andwhether we realize it or notpay for it.   The most important single step we can take toward truly reforming our system is to move away from comprehensive health insurance as the single model for financing care. And a guiding principle of any reform should be to put the consumer, not the insurer or the government, at the center of the system.   A wasteful insurance system; distorted incentives; a bias toward treatment; moral hazard; hidden costs and a lack of transparency; curbed competition; service to the wrong customer. These are the problems at the foundation of our health-care system, resulting in a slow rot and requiring more and more money just to keep the system from collapsing.   Only in the bizarre parallel universe of health care could limiting supply be seen as a sensible approach to keeping prices _down_.   Keeping prices opaque is one way medical institutions seek to avoid competition and thereby keep prices up. Without transparency on prices-and the related data on measurable outcomes-efforts to give the consumer more control over health care have failed, and always will.   Imagine confiscating all the profits of all the famously greedy health-insurance companies. That would pay for 4 days of health care for all Americans. Lets add in the profits of the 10 biggest rapacious U.S. drug companies. Another 7 days. Indeed, confiscating all the profits of all American companies, in every industry, wouldnt cover even five months of our health-care expenses.   For almost all our health-care needs, the current system allows us as consumers to ask providers, Whats my share? instead of How much does this cost?-a question we ask before buying any other good or service. And the subtle difference between those two questions is costing us all a fortune.   Insurance is probably the most complex, costly, and distortional method of financing any activity; thats why it is otherwise used to fund only rare, unexpected, and large costs.   There was nothing natural or inevitable about the way our system developed: employer-based, comprehensive insurance crowded out alternative methods of paying for health-care expenses only because of a poorly considered tax benefit passed half a century ago.   The federal government spends eight times as much on health care as it does on education, 12 times what it spends on food aid to children and families, 30 times what it spends on law enforcement, 78 times what it spends on land management and conservation, 87 times the spending on water supply, and 830 times the spending on energy conservation. Education, public safety, environment, infrastructure-all other public priorities are being slowly devoured by the health-care beast.   Unless we fix the problems at the foundation of our health system-largely problems of incentives-our reforms wont do much good, and may do harm. Health care will need to become subject to the same forces that have boosted efficiency and value throughout the economy.   The comprehensive reform being contemplated merely cements in place the current system-insurance-based, employment-centered, administratively complex. It addresses the underlying causes of our health-care crisis only obliquely, if at all; indeed, by extending the current system to more people, it will likely increase the ultimate cost of true reform.   Accidentally, but relentlessly, America has built a health-care system with incentives that inexorably generate terrible and perverse results. Incentives that emphasize health care over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing. And thatmost importantremove consumers from our irreplaceable role as the ultimate ensurer of value.   There needs to be a _business reason_ why an industry, year in and year out, would be able to get away with poor customer service, unaffordable prices, and uneven results.   The issue of "planting" came up in the comments but nothing in the article suggested that.  I didn't find anything in the article that would support the notion that it was a plant.   Forced Camel Case.  Even In Email Address. Not Right.   Why does americanoddjobs make irresponsible generalizations?   What kind of health care should be available to people that employ consistent poor decision-making over many years?  If they are very low income, as many of them are, how should it be funded?   How many supporters of life with parole for minors would include their own children and relatives?  Case dismissed.   So if the author were charged with a crime, he presumably wouldn't assert a right to a trial by his peers.  Rights may be characterized as intrinsic, but that doesn't mean they can't be granted.  Over time, societies come to grant expanded rights.    Many countries now treat health care as a right.  Some of wish to join them.

The closest she can come is that it's somewhat akin, for her, if only in its enormity, to how the British seem to feel about certain American attitudes to firearms ownership which they generally find unthinkable, and bafflingly self-evidently wrong, and so often leading to a terrible and profligate waste of human life. And she knows what they mean, but also knows how deeply it runs, the gun thing, and how unlikely it is to change.  Except, perhaps, gradually, and over a very long time. Class in England is like that, for her.  I find this provocative.  Does it resonate?   Wouldn't that be like someone from Latin America calling him 'amigo'?   Officious, indeed.  Definitions of officious on the Web:  interfering: intrusive in a meddling or offensive manner; "an interfering old woman"; "bustling about self-importantly..."    I recently read a href="http://www.economicgangsters.com/" rel="nofollow"Economic Gangsters: Corruption, Violence, and the Poverty of Nations/a.  It fit well with my interests but I was especially impressed by the authors' emphasis on research and the analysis of data rather than ideology.  Their advocacy for randomized trials looks fruitful where they are even possible.    How is a layman with no economic training supposed to judge among economic explanations and prescriptions?  Either FDR exacerbated the Depression with his policies or he ameliorated it, but where is the objective basis for which side to choose?  Keynes and von Mises may both be wrong, but both can't be right.    Sometimes I'm able to criticize the premises of an economic argument or definition.  For example, excluding 'women's work' from GDP calculations seems flawed from the start.  But often I am too easily influenced by the most recent argument I encounter, without anything but my gut to help me.  Most economic reasoning looks to me like its coming from different sides of the elephant, with little hope of agreement.  Is this all there is?  Surely there must be a better way.     Why do you accuse Peter of posting blogspam?   Anyone freaked out by the idea of rationing needs to recognize that we have rationing right now.  But instead of being administered by ethicists or physicians or even just bureaucrats, it's the result of the vagaries of employment history, geography, economic class and other less pertinent factors.   So is my town of about 15,000 a community?   I just got 1920 hits in Google with '"Hillary concedes" site: reddit.com'.  Removing the quotes gives 26,100 hits.  Why even bother with complicated reddit searches?  	149
 To be honest man, I would wait until next fall. I know at my school, spring pledges are kind of a joke, and most fraternities don't really even do spring pledgeship. Fall pledgeship is when most guys pledge and this means your pledge class will be a lot bigger. My advice, rush all this spring. Find the guys you fit in with the best. Then come summer you can work a save up for dues. That's just my opinion but best of luck man!   	1
 That's not it at all... it's the quality of the match not the rub from just being in it, or the decision.  Good matches are happening and people are talking about them, and all the people involved.   I liked that quick jab at the beginning of the match when they were circling.  That screamed heel to me and the announcers played it off like it was a veteran move.   You do realize that Cena is going out there and saying what he is scripted to say, right?  He isn't just going out there and making it up on the spot.   You also have to remember that Kane is:  a. Older than he used to be so he can't take as much punishment b. Not the same character as the guy who used to no sell chair shots  I get it if you have issues but make sure they don't make you sound like you are looking for reasons to just hate on Cena    Bring Back Funaki!   Brie once caught Nikki and Cena fooling around and yelled out "Come on Nikki!"    I hate that but I hate the Architect moniker more.  Hands down the worst moniker in recent memory for me.   The outcome isn't what matters... it's the quality of the matches.  He is putting on quality matches with each of his opponents.  We have gotten to see his go against a variety of opponents (Barret, Kane, Zayn, Neville, Stardust) and make them all look good as well as making the title look like something worth fighting for.   That was the other one that I was thinking of lol.  It was a toss up for me on which was worse.   Lawler vs Michael Cole at Mania 27   Bring Back Funaki!   Drew Carey... wait?   Top rope and springboard finishers are more of a face thing.  Having it be just part of his move set doesn't make it as much of a face move.   Couldn't even link the music huh?   I just like how fickle the wrestling fans are.  Before this documentary airs, people were hating on Rose so much saying how crappy his character is and how he should be part of the spring cleaning releases and whatnot.  Now this show airs and people flip flop to nothing but praise for him.     And New Day Smocks   I actually have no issue with the direction and the character.  IF you actually pay attention his feuds do have meaning to him as a character.   Yup because then you get this lol   There's no point in chanting his name when he is not there or mentioned.  It only takes away from the show that is going on.  I get he is missed; I miss seeing him too, but we don't need it being a distraction from the show going on.   Jericho looks like [Bon Jovi](http://www.m80radio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jonbonjovi_055horizprintwweb.jpg)   Abyss disappeared and then out of the blue his "brother" showed up looking for him.  After a while he started wrestling but wasn't much good at it.  Then on occassion he would get busted open and he would snap showing Abyss tendencies (i.e. using his moves like the Black Hole Slam).  This started happening more and more to the point where people caught on that he had a "split personality" and was really Abyss the whole time.  Joseph Park was his way of dealing with getting away from his violent lifestyle.  Then if I'm not mistaken it wasn't split personality but just Abyss pretending to be his own brother.   We'd have Rollins, Ambrose, and the fat guy   Austin's neck from the Owen piledriver, Bret Hart's head injury from the Goldberg kick   Big Dick Johnson   Rush featuring Bubbles and I'm sold   I think someone missed his nap today   That is no way to respond to someone who is legit excited and curious.   Same thing roughly but with Limp Bizkit's Rollin lol   I like the Dick on the hood...nice touch   If it is true... I feel so bad for him   Eh... not so much lol   That was my favorite part.  All this commotion going on and Ambrose is just off in his own world doing his thing moving thje table and chairs.  Then they all just look at him and he is like "What?"  That is the Ambrose that is so great.   I can never grow tired of watching that spinning cross body.  That is one beautiful move.   [This](http://www.gifsforum.com/images/gif/facepalm/grand/star-trek-picard-facepalm-eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3-1381.gif)   It was intended to look like he threw all his weight against Taker to squish him into the steps.  It also helped explain why he was limping a bit during the match (in reality I believe he sprained his ankle earlier that day)   Yeah I remember hearing something about that... when done the way it was intended it works, but otherwise it just looks dumb.  And then you get moments like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QwFNEP2.gif) lol   What, no love for Smackdown's #1 announcer.... [Funaki!](https://whatistheexcel.com/wooobooru/_images/1bb03fc0d660984cffcd3cf4ec712778/1460%20-%20funaki%20pointing%20wwe.png)   Running the ropes and doing the lay down/jump over thing.

I've yet to watch it due to not having the El Rey network.  People rave about it so there's that   It's a telenovela (spanish soap opera) that happens to be about wrestling   Hung Parliament is BNB's pornstar alter ego   Sexton Hardcastle   The white Russian leg sweep that Sandman did with his kendo stick    ouch!   That video is clearly a lie... those guys were definitely in the front yard!   Vince Russo does   That is an awesome badass picture   DDT, Chokeslam, Clothesline, Powerbomb  These 4 moves have spawned so many noteworthy variations   "IF YA SMEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!"  and nothing beats [this moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgJSvWTionE).  That was electrifying.... pun extremely indended.   Yeah he's going to change it alright... Cage matches in TNA will now be known as Rat in a Cage matches   [I love this idea](http://www.mccormick.com/Grill-Mates/Recipes/Main-Dishes/Jalapeno-and-Cheddar-Stuffed-Burgers)   [Really? Randy!

Expected to be out 4-5 months.   The Outta Nowhere burger... it would have to be one that packed a good amount of heat that you wouldn't expect.   ba dum tiss   I liked Kevin Thorne but honestly preferred Mordecai more   Haha I knew someone would go there.  I was thinking of Pirate Paul, but part of me feels like Incest Paul could get over with the NXT audience too, but that would ultimately be more of a TNA thing lol   Kizarny or Paul Burchill   Jason Reso and Adam Copeland   So I have a sub that I created but my only mod for it was deleted.  IS there any way to access the mod controls for that sub?   they have a best???  who knew   The Punjabi Playboy "Great Khali"   Braden Walker!   Quitter McGee   Definitely this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL6s-yAQ4NQ   Let's Light It Up!   Although Jerry's face is priceless, I am enjoying the look the German announcer is giving her butt lol (it's the one third from the right)   I have noticed in the past few weeks, that the backstage agents are getting a lot of tv time, between breaking up fights (usually the refs do this) and other moments (Joey Mercury talking to HHH about his decision last week).  Do you think there is something more to this?  I can see them turning into H's goons a-la how McMahon had Briscoe and Patterson.  Thoughts??   Nothing beat when H said... "Is that a hybrid?"   It's because in storyline, Brie is not employed, just a fan.  So a talent or authority member hitting a fan is bad   I like where this is going...however it felt very awkward and rushed.   I know huh!  It's like they were trying to escape from each other lol   The 619 part is just blah for me.  I loved when he hit the West Coast Pop though, because that looked amazing   Any move where you can hit it out of nowhere (i.e. RKO, Bull Hammer, Superkick, WMD, etc)   IT was most likely in TNA.  Bully Ray vs. Ethan Carter the Third   technically I don't think it's too much of a wrestling move, but the kip-up is something I always loved to see.  Back when HBK would do it, or the Rock after a ddt.  The last person to use it in quite a while is Daniel Bryan, but more people should do it.   His dancing on the announce table last night was awesome... the reactions of JBL, Cole, and Lawler were priceless, expecially JBL   Zack Gowen   Because he is allergic to maple syrup   I agree...it really set him apart from everyone else, which is a good thing.  In hindsight, did it really do anything to help his standing?  No...but that's the way it goes sometimes.   TNA has lost any and all "prestige" they ever had after systematically ruining their product over the years.   Well Finlay did shove him when Reigns was in the corner, so honestly that could have "storyline" made him angry after that fight with Kane   Are you serious???   Woo Woo Woo...you know it!  http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s569/Frank_Boris/zack_ryder_zpsa30c2467.png   I like his gimmick a lot, especially now that he is starting to show more of the heel side.  That being said, I hate his damn face so much and want to punch him in it lol, so I guess he is doing something right.   I always thought it stood for Damien Death Tackle, in honor of his snake Damien   The rope rebound clothesline that Nigel McGuiness does and Dean Ambrose's one he does in tribute always look amazing.   Any kind of piledriver (with the exception of Kane and Taker's Tombstone), GTS (unless Punk comes back lol)   It is going to be the Wyatts...it will just take some time.  The Usos deserve a long title run not only because they worked their assess off to get to this point, but because it adds legitimacy back to those titles.   We're a Two and a Half Man Baaaaaaaaaand!!!!!!!!   Which diva is going to be the next to be Santino's love interest now that Emma is gone?   My buddy said he saw a wrestling action figure that is wearing a black suit, has one finger pointing, and in the other hand there are contracts or papers that say WWE on them.  He has no clue who the figure is of.  Does anybody out there know who it is?   The idea behind it was great in my opinion.  It got some good heat on Rusev and Lana, but something was missing.  MY question is why didn't they have anybody interfere and disrupt the ceremony?  They could have had Big-E come in and lay out the "ministry officials" and cut a great promo on being American and not backing down from the Russian.  But this is just my opinion, what do you guys think?   Can anyone make a gif of Big E and Rusev waving their flags at each other from last night's Payback?  If not, then does anyone have the footage of this happening?  Thanks.           	102
 Say what you want to about India, believe me it's not perfect, but at least India is a real country, not a military occupation, engineered humanitarian disaster, apartheid and ethnic cleansing like Israel . Say what you want to about India, even though that really isn't what this is about, at least we oppress our own, instead of the Israeli way which consists of but is not limited to: traveling thousands of miles, displacing native Palestinian people, stealing their land, oppressing the descendents of the Palestinians on their fathers land reducing them to 2nd class citizens, create a state religion, call it all manifest destiny in the 20th century and send the bill to the US taxpayer.   Indian here and proud r/india representative, so there goes your theory, and whatever white guilt you were hoping to invoke in the readers of r/conspiracy. I posted this and I am not white,  deal with it JIDF shill there goes your last line of defense. I don't care if you call me racist cause its bullshit and I have ZERO white guilt so if you're going to call someone racist start with me, your brown, OP. The Israel hustle is well known globally, the religion and culture that I'm descended from is openly hostile towards Islam (North India near border with Pakistan) and even people there who HATE Muslims sympathize with the plight of the Palestinian people because India itself was under occupation until 1947. So its not just White Pride people or whatever you racially polarizing term you landed on, maybe next time try a different angle like oh, I don't know "All Brown people are Anti Semites!", or something I dont know this is your job after all, be creative !    What part of the words "Western Media Blackout" do you not understand ? PressTV was literally the only site publishing anything positive about Waters or the boycott in general. The other news agencies were all Israeli and you can guess what they reported about the boycott or Waters: "HOLOCAUST ! HOLOCAUST! HOLOCAUST ! ANTI SEMITE ! ANTI SEMITE ! ANTI SEMITE !"  So you'll forgive me for not getting my news from a Zionist approved media establishment, besides I never post anything from Press TV, look through my submissions, this is the 2nd time I've posted a PressTV article in 6 months.   I think the vast majority of OBJECTIVE readers will come to the conclusion that his dislike of Zionism is inherent and implicit in his general boycott of Israel.     The 1st thing I thought when I read this was:  "HEY ...  ZIONISTS ...  LEAVE THEM PALESTINIANS ALONE!"     The American press exists for one purpose only, and that is to convince Americans that they are living in the greatest and most envied country in the history of the world. The Press tells the American people how awful every other country is and how wonderful the United States is and how evil communism is and how happy they should be to have freedom to buy seven different sorts of detergent.   Gore Vidal   If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happenedthat, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death.   George Orwell, 1984    Thank you!   Solar panels should have been on the White House for 36 years, beginning in 1977 with Jimmy Carter, before they were cruelly yanked down by the Reagan administration in 1981, because and I'm absolutely serious here, Reagan that they were the embodiment of "big government". Backwardness thy name be Reagan. The solar panels were not costly or wasteful, they just symbolized change and terrified Big Oil, which had a stranglehold over the presidency, since Kennedy's coup d'etat in '63.    http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/27/white-house-solar-panels_n_160575.html   The worst part about this is that Senator Feinstein's amendment would mean that her ilk would be the ones deciding which journalists are real journalists, because everyone on r/conspiracy knows who owns the media and they happen to have a lot in common with Diane Feinstein. If Feinstein's amendment is adopted only people like the Bloombergs (Bloomberg), the Newhouses (New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Reddit), the Redstones, the Ochs (New York Times), and the Wenners (Rolling Stone). Basically Feinstein is saying that if you're not Zionist approved you're no longer a journalist, and that is basically the death knell of journalism as we know it. No factor has diluted the quality of journalism or the media as much Zionist consolidation.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jann_Wenner  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Irving_Newhouse,_Jr.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg#Business_career   The Jewish people depicted in that photograph were not slaves, they simply weren't, they were interned in Nazi Germany, but they were not slaves, for a people to truly be enslaved it has to span across generations. The Jewish internment in Nazi Germany lasted 6 years, further more when looking for a depiction of slavery why look to Nazi Germany ? Why not depict African slavery in America, it is by far the most reprehensible case of slavery, yet OP chose to depict Jews in Nazi Germany where they weren't slaves. I think it's obvious that OP has an agenda he is trying to further, and it's one that attempts to gain Jewish sympathy to justify the Zionist agenda, what either reason is there for such a glaring oversight ?    And ... I just deleted Red Ice Radio from my podcast subscriptions.    The phrase that I took away from watching this video was "New Media Class", to describe the talking head phenomena on cable news, with their multi million dollar salaries serving as a poor substitute for the classic muck raking journalism of decades ago. Often those multi million dollar salaries are paid for by parent companies of media conglomerates such as GE to NBC. In other words Brian Williams endorsement to invade Iraq on the Nightly News isn't worth nearly as much if everyone in America is aware that Brian Williams boss at GE is profiting directly from the invasion/occupation.    It's practically a tragedy that, Jewish people who are not a minority, they're white people with big noses, play the race card more than any other group of people. If they're such an oppressed minority, then why do Jewish people own practically every large media corporation in America, a Jewish person, Samuel Newhouse, owns Reddit's parent company, Advanced Publication. For Jewish people to be an oppressed minority in America there would be some oppression, instead I don't even think there are any poor Jewish people in America, not 1. To be an oppressed minority in America you're usually subjected to some sort of societal or culturally inflicted economic despair, Jewish people on the other hand are the wealthiest group of people in America by far. Just take a look at the list of bank executives, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Hollywood studio executives and members of Congress that are Jewish and mostly Ashkenazi Jews to be more specific. Jewish people have hijacked and cheapen the Race card by being wealthy and white and still constantly complaining about racism so in actual instances of racism against real minorities they find that the race card is weaker in their actual instance of racism, because of it's constant abuse by over privileged, litigious Jewish people and the Anti-Defamation League.   JIDF, ACTIVATE ! Form of, an Ice Menorah !!!    Ashkenazi Jews, even the 2 people that are being considered for the next Federal Reserve Chair, Larry Summers   Janet Yellen are both Ashkenazi Jews. Amschel Mayer Rothschild, the founder of fractional reserve banking, compound interest, and central banking was also an Ashkenazi Jew, funny how that works isn't it ? Funny/infuriating I guess.    Nothing will end the sham war on terror quicker than images of impoverished, dead children lying in sandy streets, indiscriminately disposed of by a predator drone, plastered all over the Internet.   "No honest journalist should be willing to describe himself or herself as 'embedded.' To say, 'I'm an embedded journalist' is to say, 'I'm a government Propagandist.   Noam Chomsky, Imperial Ambitions: Conversations on the Post-9/11 World   To quote Chris Rock from his HBO special Never Scared: "I AIN'T SCARED OF AL-QAEDA I'M SCARED OF AL CRACKA!"    The role of the U.S military in the 21st century is first and foremost to be the procurers of natural resources for multinational corporations and the banking elite that control them.    I'm just going to go ahead and say it, how about approximately 2 to 3 thousand Jewish men, with powerful and influential corporate titles living in the greater New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington D.C areas ?   I'll acknowledge Snowden is an American traitor when Wikipedia officially designates W. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, and Rice as war criminals.    Upvote for excellent usage of the word "fuckery".     JIDF ACTIVATE !  Form of, an ice menorah!    True, but everyone loves a martyr.    Fun fact the phrase "self hating Jew" was actually first coined by Theodor Hertzl, the Father of Zionism.    To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.    Voltaire   The First Amendment   1776  -  2013   To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.    Voltaire   This is by far the most infuriating thing that I've read on this sub in quite a while, now the elite own the sun, what next do they own the moon as well ? How could they possibly justify this ? I once applauded Spain for spearheading the renewable energy development charge, but now I know that it was only so the sun could be turned over to the elite in Spain first, to set legal precedent there 1st for the rest of the world. I can already see a 6-3 or 7-2 Supreme Court ruling in favor of privatizing the sun for the likes of Exxon and Chevron.    Nothing new here just the entire world at each others throats over greedy Israel, and their quest to slowly take over the entire Middle East by using the US as its warmongering proxy bitch.    Even though I swore I'd never vote again after voting for Obama in 2008, I think I could  "blue team" myself back up for a Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren ticket or vice-versa.    I would imagine that the odds are somewhere in the neighborhood of slim to go fuck yourself.    Journalists around the United States need to realize that if they don't hang together; they are going to hang apart.   Journalists shouldn't aspire to be influence peddling, talking point uttering, David Gregory-like propaganda mouthpieces for the elite, that is not journalism. At its very best it is palaver, at it's worst it is mass propaganda of the highest degree.    I deserve that.    I'm sorry about that, I'm just sensitive because someone just shamed me for spelling Michael Hastings name wrong in a meme that was meant to be a tribute to his intrepid journalism.     yes to answer question I spelled it:  "Micheal"  ugh!    Nitpick much ?      Umm, it's called reading:  "GOGLAND ISLAND, Russia, July 15 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday he saw signs that Edward Snowden, the former U.S. spy agency contractor turned fugitive leaker, was shifting towards stopping "political activity" directed against the United States."  In your defense it was at the very beginning of the article, which I guess means that you did ZERO reading, but o well, that's Reddit for you, the loudest critic is also usually the slowest reader.    Who are you referring to ? I didn't misspell anyone's name.     I found it on GoodReads.com which is a pretty reputable site for quotes, I'm not trying to perpetuate anything except a quote that is relevant and engaging.   http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/77244-journalism-is-printing-what-someone-else-does-not-want-printed   The American press exists for one purpose only, and that is to convince Americans that they are living in the greatest and most envied country in the history of the world. The Press tells the American people how awful every other country is and how wonderful the United States is and how evil communism is and how happy they should be to have freedom to buy seven different sorts of detergent.    Gore Vidal   Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth. By simply not mentioning certain subjects... totalitarian propagandists have influenced opinion much more effectively than they could have by the most eloquent denunciations.   - Aldous Huxley     I concur, this is pretty accurate, Israel is using the Zionist owned U.S mainstream media to sucker young Americans to give their lives to eliminate Israel's enemies in the region which is basically everyone else in the Middle East.    To this day American Terrorist off of the Food   Liquor album remains my favorite hip hop song.    Whoever this troll is he knows to hit us where it hurts. My heart planked for a second after reading "the truth about WTC 7" but alas it was simply the most recent in a an endless cadre of jerk offs and misinformation in the Tower 7 department.    The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.   George Orwell, 1984   Amber Lyon revealed this on Joe Rogan's podcast like a year ago, she said that everyone should take a sticky note and cover up their webcam with it, even with me covering up my webcam with a sticky for a year now, I'm sure the NSA still has like hundreds of hours of me jacking it, mere feet away from my face.    I don't know about you guys but it looks like Frankie Boyle is about to undergo a serious case of "depression" which will probably only be cured when agents dressed all in black sneak into his place at night and cure him of his "depression" with a noose around his neck.    Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home    Mahatma Gandhi  (Gandhi was kind of a peacknick by the way from what I hear)   The 2 most irreparably damaging things during the Clinton administration were :  1. Repeal of Glass-Steagall  2. Telecommunications Act of 1996.   I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of "Admin." The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid "dens of crime" that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the office of a thoroughly nasty business concern."  [From the Preface]   C.S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters   "The study of money, above all other fields in economics, is one in which complexity is used to disguise truth or to evade truth, not to reveal it. The process by which banks create money is so simple the mind is repelled. With something so important, a deeper mystery seems only decent."    - John Kenneth Galbraith (1908- ), former professor of economics at Harvard, writing in 'Money: Whence it came, where it went' (1975).   This seems obligatory for a thread like this and also just cause it's the 4th:  Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. Benjamin Franklin     The 1st thing I thought of when I read this article was :  "Goodbye local investigative news!"  Just like how mainstream media is drivel; the local news will soon be completely overrun with talking points for the talking heads on cable news. Just another domino in the downfall of the dissemination of information from the corporate media establishment which grows more conglomerated by the year.   Sam Zell, the owner of Tribune Co., is adding to his collection of media entities quietly, engaging in this purchase just before a long 4th of July weekend, in other words this 10 figure transaction will be old news by Monday. Zell, is worth $4 billion, and is a shady real estate dealer who has worked to eliminate rent control laws to jack up rates in Florida for over a decade, and he has been one of the most outspoken CEO's in the wake of the burst of the mortgage bubble; saying that :  "This country [real estate market] needs a cleansing. We need to clean out all those people who never should have bought homes in the first place." [20] He was referencing the many consumers who purchased homes at prices well above their means, as well as the mortgage lenders who encouraged those loans.  So because this story won't be news, and it's pretty much blatantly obvious why this story won't be news (i.e because it's about who controls the news) those were the important bulletpoints.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Zell   I posted this yesterday, while he was still missing granted, and my post got buried with little to no attention, and now they've announced they've found his body and r/conspiracy is all up in arms now that CNN of all people is announcing he's officially dead. I'm aware that correlation isn't always causation, but I mean come on r/conspiracy, where's your inner sleuthiness ? Correlation isn't always causation but in this case it seems pretty obvious, and not even in hindsight, I mean dead on arrival. And it's not even up the upvotes, it's that I thought I dropped a bombshell about him just missing in the woods amid this whole NSA scandal and his Senator/brother's role in the ensuing political theater. I guess what I'm saying is that, if they'd never found his body would this whole thing have just been swept under the rug by the media?    Now I've never claimed to be a great legal mind, but I do know this, South Africa's Muslim Lawyers Association probably hasn't encountered a monster like Obama's Jewish Lawyers Association.    "No matter how big the lie; repeat it often enough and the masses will regard it as the truth."   - John F.

Deliberately ambiguous and contradictory language used to mislead and manipulate the public. [From Newspeak, a language invented by George Orwell in the novel 1984.] OR newspeak [njuspik] n the language of bureaucrats and politicians, regarded as deliberately ambiguous and misleading [from 1984, a novel by George Orwell]   "A judge has barred his attorney from mentioning freedom of speech during trial."

Newspeak is in full effect.    Newspeak is in full effect, the word whistleblower is being removed from the lexicon to dumb down the masses. Soon there will be 2 versions of the English language, 1 for the general population and a growing, classified language that is comprised of newly made illegal words like whistleblower or liberty.    "Assassination is an extreme form of censorship."  - George Bernard Shaw      Michael Hastings and Glenn Greenwald certainly both have/did have an abundance of enemies with military training and the means to coordinate an assassination. To me this is blatant intimidation of investigative journalists around the nation, the nature with which the New York Times barely mentioned his death, has all the airs of "an inconvenient situation being swept under the rug" by TPTB.    The coroners are saying that it could take up to 6 weeks to determine an official cause of death, what we have to do in the meantime is keep this story as fresh and robust as possible in people's memories; so when the near certain bullshit cause of death is revealed, at least a decent amount of people's bullshit radar will be going off.   To say that Michael Hastings was a danger to the military establishment is a gross understatement, the amount of enemies he made by triggering the General McChrystal resignation are innumerable. So many military careers and potential promotions were derailed when the chain of command was upended by Hastings.   I think at best this was a sloppy, public hit on a journalist by TPTB, who had already made his share of powerful enemies and was quite possibly about to uncover yet another scandal in Washington. At worst this was a clear message to investigative journalists around the country to start toeing the company line.    Power does not corrupt. Fear corrupts... perhaps the fear of a loss of power.   John Steinbeck   Point taken, but at the same time, saying something is "Huxleyian" doesn't have the same air of impending doom as saying something is Orwellian, chalk it up to marketing , IDK.     The end of that clip was terrifying, it's so Orwellian the way she exclaimed: "We KNEW they were listening to our calls!" it sort of sounded like : "We've always been at war with Eurasia." Then that whole segue at the end where they previewed their next segment about people being addicted to texting/smartphones. Obvious agenda much ? Everything after Greenwald was pure spin and character assassination of Mr. Snowden.    "Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, Apple. PalTalk, although much smaller, has hosted significant traffic during the Arab Spring and in the ongoing Syrian civil war.

Hey InfiniteSource nice BRAND NEW ACCOUNT you're serving your corporate overlords well here today, just 1 quick question shill, how do you sleep at night? Does your back hurt from all that hard astroturfing work you do all day for GMO's ?     For the trolls like AnSq, on this thread, it's not the government it's self that is paying these contractors, it's special interests groups like Crossroads GPS, the NRA, or a slew of other conservative interests groups that are simply vastly underrepresented on the Internet on social media sites, which are also a popular venue for political discourse. Dick Cheney isn't sitting around wondering why his hunting photos aren't getting more likes on FaceBook, that's Karl Rove and his army of suits and PR agent's job. BTW, this happens all the time, to anyone who can't guess this post was mainly in response to the naked shilling that has taken place on this sub, and the rest of the Internet courtesy of Monsanto and their army of subcontractors. If I had to present a solution to the problem, I'd probably have to go with the very unpopular among new users, 30 day old account requirement to post on r/conspiracy. Also the majority of the accounts I've seen nakedly shilling for Monsanto are pretty knew, and their overview is saturated with down voted comments, I thought this was common knowledge. http://www.insanemedia.net/forum-shill-gets-busted-ats-and-glp-censor-n-7015a/2924 http://neurobonkers.com/2012/01/09/rise-of-the-astroturfer/ http://www.alternet.org/story/150049/corporate-funded_online_'astroturfing'_is_more_advanced_and_more_automated_than_you_might_think http://www.searchinfluence.com/2011/04/astroturfing-comes-to-social-media-what-reddit-can-teach-us/ http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/02/26/841001/-Announcing-the-Unofficial-Post-Shill-and-Astroturf-Watch#   Remember, Big Brother is always watching.      How about a round of applause for the PR department at Monsanto working overtime on a Saturday, Memorial day weekend just to spread a little more disinformation, and log some serious man/shill hours to manipulate public opinion, whatever the hell that is. I've been perusing the different mainstream websites and this global protest was barely a blip on their radar. I wonder how many new social media accounts were set up across the Internet to shill for Monsanto, thousands, tens of thousands? When does astroturfing online political forums by special interests group and corporations become something Congress gives a fuck about ? Course if Congress gave a shit about the general population this protest wouldn't have been necessary in the 1st place. With this corporate media and astroturfed Internet it makes u wonder when it will get noticeably absurd to the flock of sheep that watch the mainstream news, that it's all a sham, there could be looting and riots in the street outside your home as Fox   Friends prattle on about the War on Christmas. Grocery stores being looted and the military on the streets whilst the #1 story on Huffingtonpost is about Lindsay Lohan's latest arrest. Seriously though fuck paid shills, they irreparably damaged Internet discourse.    "Should the honey bee ever vanish from the face of Earth, humans would only last another 4 years."   - Albert Einstein   Wow, CNBC has been criticized by everyone from Jon Stewart to complicit pawns in Congress for not doing a good enough job covering the financial crisis. There have also been outright accusations of CNBC acting as a PR/disinformation mouthpiece for the big banks and financial firms throughout the so called Great Recession and it's lead up. When CNBC FINALLY reports something noteworthy that doesn't look like it was vetted by PR firms, the $34 trillion lawsuit, the Senior VP's kids get murder-suicided by their nanny ? Looks like someone wanted to send a statement, BTW this happened last October but I don't remember hearing anything about it in the mainstream, you'd think they'd be all over this 1, news network's VP's kids killed by evil Russian nanny, I'm no journalist but that sounds like gold Jerry ! Seems like it hit too close to home and other news media executives took notice, honestly I don't see how even by avoiding the lawsuit story angle this story wasn't everywhere, it was a blip, then it was gone, almost as if it was swept under the rug.    Just today someone on HuffingtonPost (I know), told me that conspiracy theorists are lazy and look for the easiest answer because they don't feel like doing the research. This was coming from a mainstream media Zombie who probably literally allows himself to drool as he switches between Fox, CNN, and MSNBC, like a baby being spoon fed. The antithesis of laziness would be to do your own research and wade into the conspiracy spectrum. Laziness would be allowing the same corporations that stand to make a fortune off of going to war tell you why the United States should go to war. Anyone who's combed the Internet for an alternative history of banking, wars, or genocide can tell you it's exhaustive work. I sometimes reminisce to how much happier I was back when I was just getting my "news" from Brian Williams and NBC, like a docile sheep, with an unoccupied patch of grass in the sun.    Great, now because of this useful idiot, trigger happy Americans will only get further entrenched in the idea that terrorism is a real threat. 1 idiot with a cleaver in London, is going to justify another trillion in defense spending to build instruments of death no one needs, shoot if the media hypes this 1 up enough they can spin it into another wrongful invasion/occupation of a Middle Eastern nation so the U.S army can liberate the oil and give more freedom to the U.S dollar, sure that works.    Awesome, simply awesome.    Banking, by far it's banking. Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank. Give a man a bank and he can rob the world.    Well, so much for the so called "Internet Candidate" I suppose.    What's the difference between a dead cat on the highway and a dead banker on the highway?  There are skid marks around the cat.   $100 - Mayer Amsel Rothschild $50 -   Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild  $20 -   James Meyer de Rothschild  $10 -   Sir Anthony de Rothschild $5  -   Lord Evelyn de Rothschild     OP better be careful he's bringing to much truth to this sub, cue the JDIF and occupation apologists calling me an anti-Semite based on nothing more than it being a reactionary self defense method that has served them well over the years in debates. Unfortunately for them I'm not white so I have no white or German guilt for them to take advantage of. Jewish people are genetically the same as Caucasian people, an Israeli population geneticist just confirmed this. The fact that Jewish people get all of this preferential treatment from the US and the UN is ridiculous, Jewish people are NOT a minority, real minorities in America, which are mostly poor people of color, don't consider Jews a minority, just a subset of white. For Gods sake look at their level of affluence, political, and business power they have amassed in America where they're supposedly being racially persecuted, gimme a fucking break, how gullible do u think I am ?    That's the 1st thing I thought of too.    'MURICA!!! FUCK YEA !!! GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD !!!    Few people have driven my present day worldview as much as this kind sage. The 1st time I watched the "Religion is Bullshit" clip on YouTube I was 17 and couldn't believe someone had taken on that topic so bluntly. I was just getting into Carlin beginning in 2006 then he died in 2007 and I became a rabid fan of his. Anyways the point is if Carlin could see the shit that is going on today, the bank bailouts, the looting of 401k's, and the talk of handing Social Security to the criminals on Wall Street he would be turning in his grave. He called the great Social Security Swindle that Congress is deliberating right now 10 years ago and about a dozen other things. George Carlin IS simply prophetic.    Worst yet were all of the agent provocateurs down at these protests. The agent provocateurs are the lawbreaking, violent ones that justify violence against the peaceful protesters, the agent provocateurs look like cops and talk like cops too, they're just uber well groomed guys with buzz cuts, jack boots, and band T-shirts.    I don't remember hearing anything about it and I couldn't find an Internet article from the mainstream media about this story. Just a DailyKos article and this 1 by Current.    As a former Occupier from Occupy Philadelphia, this is sickening, but its part of a trend of stifling 1st amendment rights by another name that is prevalent in the legal system. To this day watching that Philly cop nightstick that skinny, white kid the night that camp was overrun is 1 of the most frightening things I've ever seen in my life. I'll never look at a cop the same way again.    I can't believe this is going to be going on another 20 years, they just won't be happy until all of this ill will fostered in the Middle East courtesy of the U.S military creates an ACTUAL terrorist threat. If they're talking about the domestication of drone usage in America now, there's no way that nightmare doesn't come to fruition over the next 2 decades. How is the public so stupid ? We've had this faceless, undefined enemy for 12 years and we're quietly excepting another 2 decades worth of wasted resources like docile, patriotic, sheep. The novel 1984, should be a required part of the curriculum for high school students across America, of course the way this warmongering government is going it's more likely 1984 will be banned in public schools before its a part of the curriculum.    If she's not careful she could go the way of Senator Wellstone, he was also an outspoken critic of business as usual in Washington, except in his case it was the military industrial complex that brought his plane down.    Hmm, never thought I'd agree so vehemently about anything with a dogmatic, pedophile apologist but here we are. I guess my hatred for bankers out ranks my contempt for the  professional hypocrites that populate the Vatican.     This is a good list, it's hilarious when people say that corporations like Exxon or Apple are the largest corporations on Earth, and they they start citing market share and things like that but they don't stop to take into account that the foundation of the entire economic system, banks, are also private, for profit corporations, that exist only to create indebted masses. How could Exxon or Apple be more valuable than the banks that are backed by the entire Federal government and underwritten by our taxpayer dollars. Let's see how quickly the government would intervene with a multibillion dollar bailout for Apple and Google because they were to big to fail, no of course not, they would just allow Samsung to take over the market share and American tech start ups would get more R D investment. To this the critics say "oh well the banks provide a valuable service", well to that I'd retort, that I'd consider it valuable if they would at least let the taxpayer bend over first of their own volition instead of violently bending the taxpayer over the table and reaming us out.    Jack Ruby was also born Jacob Leon Rubenstein, why he changed his name I guess we'll never know. My guess, he didn't want to make it to obvious which group of people would benefit the most from the "single bullet/lone gunmen" theories. Kennedy had a non  interventionist foreign policy, which basically meant he would let Israel do its own dirty work which they've never been good at. Kennedy's vehement denial of Operation Northwoods coupled with Executive Order 11110 were enough to get him whacked. Not fighting Israel's wars for them and issuing gold and silver bonds to the tune of $5 billion in debt-free currency in effect circumventing the Federal  Reserve, is evidently enough for a sitting U.S President to have his head blown off on live TV and not have anyone do anything about it.    I'd upvote this a thousand times if I could. It would've been a million hypothetical upvotes if it weren't for all the spelling errors.    Oh no someone said something bad about Jewish people on the Internet! Here comes the avalanche of shills yelling "antisemites!". The JIDF(Jewish Internet Defense League) is clearly well represented on Reddit. Fun Fact: Reddit is owned by CondeNast, which is owned by Advance Publication, which is owned by the Newhouse family, the Newhouses are billionaire, print media tycoons. They are also aggressive Zionists who have used their influence in the media to drive a subliminal pro Israel narrative in the West decades before the Balfour Declaration was even written.   I posted an article about this the other day, and it got a lot of upvotes on r/conspiracy and even reached the top of the page. Despite all the upvotes, the comment thread was saturated by what looked like shill accounts using ad hominem attacks to discredit me and Dr. Eran Elhaik's findings. As a person of color and a 1st generation immigrant I find the fact that Jewish people who are closer to Caucasian than they'd like you to believe, use all of the advantages of this "Chosen People" blood claim to Israel to strengt their narrative. In fact Jewish people are some of the most powerful industrialists and bankers on Earth,and they still clamor for international support as an oppressed minority, when there are so many other groups who could use the resources being lavished upon the Zionist agenda. Also most actual minorities in America don't even view Jews as an actual minority, more like a subset of Caucasian, per capita Jewish people are much wealthier than any other religious or ethnic group per capita. Also there's the coincidence of Israel and AIPAC lobbying Congress to invade Iraq, Iran, Syria etc. basically because it's way easier to manipulate the war monger Americans to fight their wars for them using the media (which they also control 80% of) and off their regional enemies 1 preemptive mass troop deployment and ground invasion at a time. The fact is that Jewish people twist the oppressed minority narrative so much to the point it devalues actual victims of racial prejudices claims. Seth MacFarlane made a joke at the Oscars about how Jewish people control the media and he had the ADL (Anti Defamation League) down his throat with allegations of antisemitism and racism. All of this contributes to the narrative of America being post racial and overly politically correct, but its just sensitive Jewish special interest groups inflating the incidences of accusations of racism. BTW the entire reason the ADL was founded was to combat antisemitism, I'm on my phone and can't track down the Wikipedia link but it's there.    Bankers are in fact the root of all evil.    All that flowery: "We are all a global race man, we just need to set aside our differences and take care of Mother Earth" stuff is really nice and all in theory. Meanwhile in reality there are 1.6 million Palestinians are crammed into the Gaza Strip, of which 1 million have official "refugee" status with the UN. The Gaza Strip also has the 6th highest population density on Earth with 9,713 people per square mile in this landlocked, heavily policed, arid, baron sub-nation. Of course if you look at events in human history in 600 million year time spans, humans fighting humans over land is inconsequential but those aren't the units of measurement we are working with. Thousands of people that were children in 1948 when the original exodus occurred are still alive today; living on that tiny strip of land bouncing around between temporary borders; no nation to call home and through no fault of your own. The Palestinian people didn't get themselves persecuted all across Asia, the Middle East, and all of Europe and get themselves practically chased out of nations with torches. Look at what they have been reduced to; Gaza is a humanitarian crisis, as Israeli's are living in relative luxury on what used to be; just a generation ago Palestinian land and was that way for more than a thousand years. The Palestinian have become an international spectacle, they were not the world's burden, and now they have been reduced to 2nd class citizens in their own backyard.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0934666.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip#Gaza_blockade   Yes, but isn't there a point in the evolution of human civilization where a Manifest destiny foreign policy is no longer acceptable ? Maybe 1 of the reason it's been so hard for "the Chosen People" to assimilate themselves in far flung nations and remain in said nation for an extended period of time  before being expelled. Notice Mongolia is no longer sending hoards of Mongols into China, it becomes antiquated after a while.    I don't think people here in America spend enough time recognizing the fact that 725,000 Palestinians were displaced and turned into refugees in 1948. Since 1948 their situation has gotten bleaker as it has become abundantly obvious that neither the United States, the UN, England or anyone else would be willing to back at the absolute rights for Palestinians living in destitution on the Gaza strip in refugee tents without access to water or electricity. 725,000 people, it may not seem like much but that's more people than live in Memphis, Washington or Boston. Imagine if the international community told the citizens of 1 of those U.S cities they would have to leave immediately and start their lives over again from square 1 in a tent in and around the old Super Dome, only this Super Dome is in the middle of the desert. Here in the United States things like that are only acceptable when they happen to black or brown people, and that is the entire crux of what I am trying to  say, Jewish people share more common DNA with Europeans and Asians particularly Slavic and Turkish than they do with people with Middle Eastern ancestry. This is about acknowledging a fact, I don't understand why we trust DNA in every other facet of life like determining criminal cases or the paternity of a child, yet this DNA is wrong or suspect because it doesn't fit the establishment's agenda.  8 million Khazar's did not simply vanish into thin air, they converted to Judaism, and it is simply much easier politically for a group of people who are NOT believed to be Caucasian to occupy a nation in the Middle East than it would be for Caucasian's or at least it should be in theory. The problem is, real minorities in America, people of color and 1st generation immigrants, myself included in both categories barely consider Jewish people to be a minority, they are basically Caucasian at a glance and are also more affluent per capita than Caucasian's in Western Europe and the U.S. I know there is no such thing as birthright to a piece of land, but at the same time, Americans have never all collectively been ran out of their nation and turned into 2nd class citizen on what used to be their soil, a humiliation Palestinians deal with everyday. Look I'm a super liberal guy and I have a HELL of a lot more in common with the average person of Jewish descent than I would with the average Palestinian what with the fundamentalist religion and all that, but right is right, and pushing people out of their country to correct an injustice that occurred thousands of years ago is not right.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars#Theory_of_Khazar_ancestry_of_Ashkenazi_Jews   "Some point" doesn't warrant the modern day Manifest Destiny that is Israel's foreign policy in the Middle East. Israel's militant ways were on display this past Sunday when they attacked Syrians in Syria. All Zionists have in the Middle East as a foothold is this brief, erratic, cyclical nomadic wandering, and their own purported geneaoligic evidence of not being Caucasian, at least they did. That is not enough to justify this near 7 decade long military occupation and ensuing humanitarian disaster.    Yea but the Italians and Greeks aren't managing an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Israel by forcing 726,000 Palestinians off of their land and in the process of keeping them off of that land killing many tens of thousands more. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_the_Palestinian_Refugee_flight_of_1948#Final_estimates   To everyone here calling me an anti-semite: A. You are predictable and boring. B. Anyone who doesn't understand the inherent importance of this is being willfully ignorant of its magnitude. C. Muslims are 2nd class citizens in Israel, and don't get me started on the perpetual humanitarian crisis that is the Gaza Strip. D. Jewish people FORCED PALESTINIANS OFF OF THEIR LAND, they have no interest in living alongside Muslims and do what they can to create an atmosphere of intolerance against them.  E. Their only claim to the land is from the Bible, nothing genetic, they may have in the tradition of nomadic people, blown through the area, but the historical claim belongs to the Palestinians, they lived there MUCH LONGER.  F. 8 million Khazar's do not vanish, they simply do not, unless you're saying they were wiped out in a genocide, and I think it's best we don't stray into that area. G. This is what Mahatma Gandhi has to say on the issue of Israel, and from what I hear he's kind of a pacifist: Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home  Mahatma Gandhi   That was great, so it was about the privatization of the press in America, I imagine it's a pretty well known fact amongst r/conspiracy subscribers that 96% of the media in the United States is owned by just 5 corporations, those 5 being GE, VIACOM, COMCAST, NEWSCORP   DISNEY.  Of course in Kennedy's day there were more than 60 independent news organization's, I don't think even Kennedy could have foreseen the erosion of the media to the extent that it has in such as short period of time. He gave this speech in 1961 and since then the media has been collectively bought and sold more times than I care to analyze.    The banker all the way to the left in that picture who has that permanently smug "Just stole your 401k" air  about him is Lloyd Blanfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, probably the most dangerous executive in the known Universe.    For some reason any Rothschild-related posts on r/conspiracy draw an even higher amount of shills like "BernankewasRight". That act as nothing but transparent PR mouthpieces for the banks.    This is so true, NPR Planet Money is an absolute joke, there isn't a thing that they've squarely blame on the bankers. There's always an extenuating circumstance or something they can blame the consumer for. When they interview bankers its to depict them as heroic or as martyrs for making a little less. Hmph Planet Money, more like Planet Shill.    He says right in the beginning of the article that he believes the players are different which leads you to believe the Rothschild's are no longer involved, but he doesn't name names of any prominent families or lone billionaire banker tycoons that could be. I wish he would've elaborated a bit further, something like: "The Rothschild's fixed the price of everything until ... ". By not listing a single other family like the Morgans, which leads me to believe that they absolutely are still involved.   Elizabeth Warren is forever upvote worthy to me.    Chronic.   POWERFUL PARANORMAL TV SHOW !!! I hope it doesn't interfere with the podcast at all though.    Anyone who still questions if the CIA implemented an unsuccessful coup d'etat on Hugo Chavez in 2002 is either like actually retarded, or works for the U.S government.   Try going on Huffingtonpost and posting a comment that states the fact that the Federal Reserve is a private bank operated for profit to a small, undisclosed group of private shareholders. You'll get a cascade of comments from faceless shill accounts using ad-hominem attacks to discredit your character. It's some serious Orwell shit.    No mention of either Rothschild or Rockefeller money there though, besides even if they did find any you certainly wouldn't be able to read about it in the New York Times.   As I begin typing this I am ready to be downvoted and called an antisemite, but this website Reddit is owned by CondeNast which is owned by the billionaire Newhouse family from the aforementioned article. They are 1 of the 6 families that dictate the narrative for the rest of the 96% of the media they control to spin. The fact no 1 is allowed to say it out loud is ridiculous, there's a reason CurrenTV and Al-Jazeera are minisculed and demonized by Western media entities, its because they represent 2% of the 4% of the media they don't control.    Joe, what is the best fight you've ever seen UFC or otherwise?    Few men have been as prolific or as prophetic as this kind sage.    "America is a nation with 1 political party that has 2 wings and represents 3% of the citizenry." - Gore Vidal   What a perfectly crafted piece of disinformation, by the way Woodrow Wilson would go on to say this of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913: "I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men." -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence   Men of Reddit and Harry Potter fans, are we thinking the same thing, "Petrificus Totalus" with that facial expression.    Reddit is owned by CondeNast, which is owned by Newhouse Publications which is owned by the Newhouse family. The Newhouse family are PROMINENT Zionists, and their family has owned newspaper and magazine publications since the 1880's. You know how people say Jews control the media well the Newhouse family is 1 of about 6 Jewish families that dictate  the mainstream media narrative.     Joe Rogan's podcast dabbles with all of the conspiracy theories, but it only does so in a comedic narrative so know that going in.   I don't know who won but Halliburton sure can't be upset with the outcome, billions in no bid government contracts to rebuild Iraq. Personally signed off on by their former CEO Dick Cheney/Vice President/Heartless Devil-Goat human hybrid creature.    War will exist until that distant day when the conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today.  ~John F.

Most scientists agree it has to do with a pesticide made by Bayer called Poncho that the FDA approved in 2001.    Yea that's who we should feel bad for, the drone pilots.  "Oh woe is me I'm a drone pilot and I spend my nights tossing and turning in bed because of the atrocities I voluntarily signed up to commit."   Well it may seem crude but I'd still use it before I resorted to using Apple Maps for navigation.    TAKE IT! JUST TAKE THE LEG!   The fact that Argo won best picture over Django is a crime, anyone with eyes could tell u which movie was better. Where was the drama in Argo, OH NO WHITE PEOPLE BEING RACIALLY PROFILED BY AIRPORT SECURITY BY IRANIANS THE HORROR!!!   Yea ancient people also didn't have to worry about their government unnecessarily fluoridating their drinking water to keep them sedated, docile, and compliant with the corporate agenda.    "Priests...dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live." - Thomas Jefferson, Letter to Correa de Serra, April 11, 1820    Powerful.    Why they gotta give me my man Benedict such a hard time, all he's trying to do is discourage people from using contraception thereby exponentially increasing their likelihood of getting sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS.    Classy yet understated, well played peacock.    The last time a white tiger was seen in the wild was in 1959, they don't exist naturally anymore, tiger populations in general are plummeting around the world and have been since the 1850's with the arrival of the British in India. Today the biggest market for the remaining 3200 wild tigers left on Earth is China, which voraciously sponsors poaching in India, which is home to half of all remaining wild tigers.    I'd make shady Wall Street banking illegal, like all of the shenanigans that caused the foreclosure crisis.    That giraffe looks like it just had a stroke.    I'm very surprised Reddit allowed this to b posted or just downvote it into oblivion.   Well this definitely should b in r/politics, also this is the 1st time I can appreciate something these Republican Senators from Kentucky have voted in favor of. So many confused feelings welling up in my bleeding liberal heart.    The problem with saying anything about this issue is that the moment you do you are labeled an anti-Semite. Look at how the anti-Defamation League came after Saturday Night Live for their sketch last week on the Chuck Hagel confirmation and Israel.   Bill Maher is good people, this is a fact. He's superior to Jon Stewart because Stewart acts as if both parties are equally insane and corrupt and that simply isn't true.    Everyone involved in this obvious attempt to dupe the viewers should be fired, propaganda foisted upon the viewer plain and simple.   She has more balls than the rest of Congress combined, hopefully she can jail some of these greedy, scumbag, bankers.   They have actually figured out how to manufacture diamonds in Russia, that doesn't change the fact that Di Biers has a monopoly on the diamond market.   Road Trippin' - the Red Hot Chili Peppers   Just goes to show you how much bullshit the myth of the "liberal media" really is, here you have the New York Times, a publication that touts itself as the epitome of liberalism, shilling for traditional petroleum powered vehicles. The media is as liberal as their wealthy, conservative agenda oriented executives allow them to be; the New York Times is 88% owned by the billionaire Ochs-Schulzberger family, and another 8% is owned by Carlos Slim the worlds richest man.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times#Ownership   Marco Rubio was given his job by wealthy, white billionaires like the Koch brothers to try to convince the Hispanic community to vote AGAINST their own economic and immigration interests. Those dry mouth noises are the sound of what little integrity Rubio has getting stuck in his throat as he realizes that he is truly an Uncle Tom to the Hispanic community.    What I would tell this amateur philosopher is that gravity which was first theorized by Newton in 1676 didn't become completely accepted and lose the "theory stigma" until 1915 with Einstein's theory of Relativity. Would you really want to align yourself with the mouth-breathers and cousin fornicators that considered gravity a "theory" in 1914.    Amazing, 8"11 and he still couldn't grab a rebound.    I hate all superheroes who happen to have billions of dollars of inherited wealth laying around and what you to think it has nothing to do it, You know what I would do if I had billions of dollars in old money laying around my whole life? I'D BE A FUCKING SUPERHERO!!! Not because I'm a remarkable person, it's because I'm 23 and have a regular job that I hate.    Or he could be saying : "One day I'll be a big snitch, making sure people get arrested for possessing small amounts of marijuana!"     Stewie Griffin: But where do we find uranium in WWII Europe?  Brian Griffin: There's only one place, at the top secret atomic research facility... in Berlin.  Stewie Griffin: Wait a minute, Germany's building Weapons of Mass Destruction? Well, why doesn't America go in there and kick their asses?  Brian Griffin: I don't know  [slowly turns toward the camera]  Brian Griffin: maybe because they don't have any oil?  Stewie Griffin: Oooooohhhh...  [he applauds]  Stewie Griffin: oh clap clap clap clap clap!    Atheism is a non-prophet organization.  - George Carlin     The majority of jails   prisons in Louisiana are privately owned and are considered for profit businesses. It's no coincidence that Louisiana also happens to have some of the most Draconian drug laws with long sentences for drug offenders. The company that runs a large share of those prisons the Corrections Corporation of America or CCA as its known on Wall Street lobbies Louisiana lawmakers for the toughest drug laws and of course they do the same with Congress.    "I used to work at fire hydrant manufacturing plant, it was horrible couldn't park anywhere near the place." - Steven Wright   Typical BBC news fluff piece, no mention of the Pope's role in the systematic protection of pedophiles within the church's ranks. This man should be brought up an array of obstruction of justice charges in pedophilia cases crossing borders and continents. Instead the world celebrates his achievements in dividing the masses and stifling civil rights and scientific innovation.    I would love to see Quentin Tarantino's take on the Native American genocide, there's so many revenge angles that could be worked there.    The Singularity is near.   Christoph, its Christoph Waltz.    I don't know about you guys but I for one can't wait until they have to use that water for fracking so we can get some OIL!, That's what we need in America natural gas at any cost, even drinking water, I mean we like water but we NEED OIL!    SCIENCE!    In other news the sun rose today.    Iceland better be careful or the U.S will end up invading them because "they hate us for our freedom" or "they have nuclear weapons" or because "they want to get nuclear weapons" or whatever other bullshit Rupert Murdoch needs to make up to sell a senseless war to an ignorant public.    So I get caught with marijuana and a bowl and get a $500 fine and 6 months of probation in the great state of Pennsylvania, but in New York bankers can burn down the economy, stand next to it   use $100 bills to light their cigars,   nothing. Hmph, justice in America.    POWERFUL TURNING SIDE KICK !!!   DAMN NATURE, YOU SCARY!!!   Here in America we are descended in blood and in spirit from revolutionists and rebels - men and women who dare to dissent from accepted doctrine. As their heirs, may we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion.  ~ Dwight D. Eisenhower     Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class  Al Capone quotes (Famous American gangster in the 1920s and 1930s. 1899-1947)   Every 30 minutes a farmer in India commits suicide due to Monsanto, with approximately 250,000 suicides in the last 16 years, 16 years ago Monsanto was given carte blanche in India as well.  http://naturalsociety.com/monsantos-gmo-seeds-farmer-suicides-every-30-minutes/   The Church is not taxed in the United States and according to a study from the University of Tampa this exemption costs the U.S $71,000,000,000.00 a year, but hey who cares about the federal deficit its not as important as a healthy legal defense fund for pedophiles.  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/06/16/the-yearly-cost-of-religious-tax-exemptions-71000000000/   Of course Batman beat Superman, Batman is a heroic, billionaire capitalist, whereas Superman works for the press, trying to enlighten the masses and expose the seedy nature of reality. Superman came here from another planet to fight crime, making him the ultimate immigrant, whereas Batman, we know he comes from good Wayne family stock, old money. Only in America would the industrialist with no superpowers with to much time on his hands defeat an alien with super powers. Meanwhile Monday morning Bruce Wayne is going to hire lobbyists to pressure Congress to pass legislation that would break up the unions at Wayne Industries which would benefit him in a bevy of ways.    Wait, wait, so you're telling me that Mississippi, by far the poorest state in the country also happens be the most religious state in America, gee I wonder why.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income http://www.pewforum.org/how-religious-is-your-state-.aspx   Q: What is the definition of safe sex down in Mississippi?

 Isaiah 45:7: I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things  Exodus 32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people  Judges 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit  Jeremiah 45:5 behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD:  Jeremiah 49:37 I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:  Micah 1:12 . evil came down from the LORD  Micah 2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil  Exodus 22:29-30 You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The first-born of your sons you shall give to me. You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.  Ezekiel 20:25-26 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life; and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.     What a softie....   Well, one country is moving in the right direction.   Or you are just eating lunch...    Maybe the sign is just being sarcastic?   Why didn't he thank Jehovah for allowing this to occur in the first place?  If this shit happened to me, and I believed in god, my faith would quickly diminish.   Good idea, however, there isn't even a letter c   I am pretty sure that science, an the technology that came with it has changed more people's lives than religion...     Yeah, shows the ignorance of these people...   Stop trying to shelter the kids... This school is bullshit, it was all about how religion was used...  Funny, how in sixth grade we know about sex, drugs, and we sure as hell studied hitler 7 years ago....   What bullshit is this? Miley shouldn't even be considered for it....

He has the potential to kill anyone I played correctly....    No, the real name isn't a requirement, or an issue. You have no clue what you are talking about. The issue is it deletes your avatar, subscriptions, and allows spammers to spam mercilessly.   Videos that were live streamed dont have the new commenting system, yet.   I am not the only one with this issue. I have heard complaints from many people on YouTube.   1. Links are now enabled to be posted on comments. Yes, you have been able to post links by changing symbols etc. however, those links were harder to use, and less people used them. Now, comments are a Stewart to spreading RATS. 2. Comments no longer have a character limit. Although you can now better voice your opinions, and bring out your argument in one comment instead of four, there is a lot more spam that comes with this system. 3. Top comments aren't relevant. The only way that top comments are deemed relevant to the video, is through google. Here is a good example: http://i.imgur.com/3YS2RmA.png 4. Google+ deleted subscriptions and profile picture(s). When you add an account, feel free to resub to all of your subscriptions,because "upgrading" deleted all those. 5. Google+ is an extra hassle to the simple commenting system we had In the past. Google has failed to address the flaws in the previous system, an ha created more weak points I. The recent update.   It doesn't work because it is worse than the old system. You have bots posting links now, and these links are-- I'm assuming viruses. The comments no longer have a character limit, which just brings a.whole new level to the spam.  All the replies aren't hooked together. Honestly, reddit has the best system for comments, communication wise.   Why would I be happy that someone is attempting to force me to do something I don't want to?   The new comment system is flawed and worse than before. Why the fuck is it a good idea to allow bots to spam virus links, why is it a good idea to allow unlimited character comments? The idiots that came up with this should be hurt.   What fucking clowns idea was it to allow links to be posted in comments? What moron decided unlimited character comments were ever a fucking good idea?   The new update isn't helping communicate, because its a shirt way of displaying the comments, and it fails.  I don't even have to complain about google-. That's a whole nother pile of shit.   They are a nice way to communicate.    Why are you rain washed into thinking communism is horrible?   Or they could have just left the comments like they were    No, he should be executed    I'm not worried... They sunk their own ship during a drill...

I don't see what the problem is with providing our country with a way to get out of the monopoly that the ISPs have...    Hey guys! I have finally been found :D   We have setup a DarkRP server! Search "pfg" in the DarkRP category of servers. Look for the name "!pfg" and connect!  Features:  Great staff members Fair rules Great looking GUI Downtown map   Play your role!          Welcome to Real-RPG The new generation of roleplaying  Donator Rewards list: http://real-rpg.enji...donator-rewards Welcome to the server. I am train_subject9554, I help every player whenever I can, trying to make their minecraft expirience the best. On our server we feature maximum anti-grief, Builders, and police. We are trying to overcome the dying servers of minecraft. A lot of minecraft servers out there, are well.... Shit, hosted on peoples computers, not on a professional companies computer, with maximum connection. We offer 24 Hour server service, and you can play anytime. We hope you come and join us =)  Rules:  1.) No griefing  2.) No spamming  3.) Respect others  4.) No hacks of any kind  5.) No cheats of any kind    Mechanics:  Living:  When you join, you are given a large amount of choices, and you must live like you do in real life. When you first login, you will be able to greet others etc. First you must get a place to live, there are apartments and hotels in the spawn town, or you can go into the wild and make your own house.        Drugs:  The secret word is lol. Admins are the FBI agents, they, and Police (mods) will work together to make drug busts. The current drugs are mushrooms, and sugarcanes. After you are caught with drugs, you will be sent to a probation officer every week. The probation officers are advanced Police officers, which manage all the players that have been caught with drugs.       : Companies/Jobs  This is going to be long, as there is a lot to explain. When you join, you have the opportunity to look for an employer. More advanced employers have a prefix made for the company, and have the company prefix color. To have this, the employers must have donated $5 or more. The employers are your managers etc. They will pay you to do their companies job. Each company is a supplier, unless you are a store. If you are a store company, for ex. Walmart, you can make stores, and pay the supplying companies, money for their stock. When you pay the company, the employer pays his employees, this is what runs our server. You can chose from the following to make your company:  1.) Store  2.) Farming co.  3.) Mining co.  4.) Fishing co.  and any other resource gathering/selling companies. You can make blacksmiths etc, what ever jobs you find in real life you can make.

 Happy reddit Birthday iglooman   Update 0436 PDT: Both crew members have been safely recovered.   correction: ... *was* to new iPad buyers   Link to Tsunami arrival times for various cities on the U.S and Canada west coast:  http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/2011/03/11/lhvpd9/07/webetalhvpd9-07.txt   Happy Reddit Birthday!   I think the special prices are relative to the monthly prices, not relative to the one year price. You get a savings on the one, two or three year prices if you use any of the monthly prices as your reference.   It may be photoshopped but funny nonetheless   These were also the first two points of Tyler's UCLA career.   Particles from the sun, such as those from a solar flare, travel much slower than light and therefore the delay.   The article loses credibility when the title states "... Should Hit Early Tuesday Morning (2/13/2011)"  Tuesday is not 2/13.   Not really.  The difference between a hard drive and a solid state drive is more than semantics.  They are physically quite different approaches to storage.  I'm betting it's an error in the ad.   Exhume?  I think we should just leaved this one buried.   Anyone notice the 32GB hard drive in the Best Buy ad?  *Hard Drive* ... really? http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Motorola+-+XOOM+Tablet+/+NVIDIA+Tegra+Processor+/+10.1%22+Display+/+1GB+Memory+/+32GB+Hard+Drive+-+Licorice/1946179.p?id=1218305636450 skuId=1946179 st=xoom cp=1 lp=1   You took it up a notch with the incorrect spelling as well - two kittens get punched.   I tip my hat to you sir/ma'm - well done.   True, but receiving stolen property is a crime if you know it was stolen.    The make-up looks more like a mask.   In terms of solar masses, the MW black hole is not 1,000 but 4,000,000.  The article states the M87 black hole 6.6 billion solar masses, while the MW black hole is 4 million solar masses.  6.6 billion / 4 million = 1650 so the M87 black hole is a 1650 times more massive than the MW black hole.     The existence of anti-matter has been proved by many experiments. Scientists generate and measure anti-matter particles every day in particle accelerators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter   mr_lightswitch is correct, I should have stated "... over a thousand times more massive that the Milky Way's central black hole"   Thank you! Up vote.   See comment from Zephir_AWT:  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ez3bt/identification_of_supermassive_black_hole_in/   Too late, I closed my account with B of A 15 years ago.  The reason? They said my account was overdrawn.  I checked my account balance and had more than $2K in it.  I called them up and they said, oh sorry we made a mistake.  Two weeks later same thing happened so I went into the branch.  They looked up my account and said, now Mr. Sheridan, we've had this conversation with you before and this is becoming a recurring problem.  I said, no shit, this is a recurring problem. Now close my account and give me my balance right now. They finally realized there was a different Mr. Sheridan whose account was overdrawn.  It was disturbing they couldn't even keep the accounts of two people with the same last name straight.     The article should have said the Tesla is using two Tegra 2 chips, one for the infotainment and navigation information for the screen and the other for the instrument cluster.   Ted is on WCNI radio and got an offer to work for Cleveland Cavaliers and a house.  w00t! http://www.wnci.com/main.html   Notice he doesn't sit in it.   Yes I am aware this sub is for technology.  I also posted this to Science, which is where it probably belongs, but alas no comments.     A better shot  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVyLuosZ1rY   A better shot  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVyLuosZ1rY   Good to see we have an active subreddit here and thanks for the advice.  I think I'll steer clear for the time being unless I watch something I must post.  Then I'll post and stay confined to responses to avoid spoilers.   By the way, just noticed the up/down votes are knives ... nice.   Yeah, is that fairly recent?  I don't remember so many ads on physorg.   Well, at least up to a mass of 3.54.5 TeV for a range of theoretical models that postulate extra dimensions. Those were the ones that bothered me most.   Good catch.   Actually she stole it from the restaurant who stole it from George Burns.  So there's plenty of blame to go around.  But yes, I should have given Lindsay credit.   Good night.   Best tweet I've seen recognizing Leslie's humor from @Lons: "Leslie Nielsen died today at a Florida Hospital. It's a big building with doctors and patients, but that's not important right now. RIP."   And why the heck do they need to demonstrate that old technology to bring them back?   Yeah, not sure how the heat is dissipated with that approach.  The foam would seem to be a good insulator.   Buzz does look pretty proud of himself.   Yeah, kind of a 90's thing to do for a company that's supposed to represent the future.   Where's the Digg button on this article? ;-)   to whom *does* this apply? Everyone   Here are additional details: http://ltgenpanda.tumblr.com/post/1403230157/did-digg-game-its-own-system-to-benefit-publisher   Agree - it's an improvement   I'll say   I think it's just poor graphsmanship   Hmm, there seems to be a missing comment.  Wonder why it's not there?   and here's the making of Dot http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTbzSiwbRfg   searched for it and couldn't find a previous post   Yea, Molly and Tom made a great tech pair.   I feel for your pain living near LA.   "At the moment, it is necessary to consider that once installed in the console the PS Jailbreak cannot be removed."   Thank you for the translation SpyRaven.   More content.   Evo vs. iPhone - nice.   Here's the original story:   http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_15773966?nclick_check=1   Favorite line from the doctor: "Do you know what it's like to be around these people?  It's pretty f ^*ing annoying."   Best line: I need to create a way to blog that is as random and incoherent as writing on a bathroom wall.   His first meal in the hospital contains peas. Someone at that hospital has a sense of humor.   I am shocked ... simply shocked!   Example 2:  The cones on the engine inlets moved in and out to account for the shock wave developed by traveling multiple times the speed of sound. Without this feature the engines' compressors would stall at high mach numbers due to lack of airflow into the engine.   Impressive aircraft in many respects.  Example 1: It was designed to leak fuel while on the ground (ok, maybe they couldn't help this) then seal itself as thermal expansion of joints took effect when the aircraft came up to temperature due to heating from air friction at operational speeds.   Yea, but eventually he does answer that it took well over a hundred shots.   Don't feel bad - this guy has been compared to Einstein.   Black   White Cat: If you hit it hard enough it'll stop! ... White   Brown Cat: No, you have to cajole these things.   No   Yea, and one more childhood edit (depending on how old you are) ... the USSR no longer exists.    Yea, I think it's him http://www.appelbaum.net/   Can someone please confirm if this is really Jacob Appelbaum's Twitter feed? http://twitter.com/ioerror   Apparently you don't see the number of down votes you're receiving and recognize you're way off base, at least with respect to leading scientific theories.    Maybe you're starting your own dark matter theory here on Reddit.  If it blows your dress up, go for it.   Once you create a facility that deep, you get multiple uses since many experiments are corrupted by cosmic rays. The mine is used to detect muons (product of cosmic ray collisions), neutrinos and dark matter.     I've stopped trying to figure out the rationale for up vs down votes.   Not to be argumentative, but dark matter is not the same as a black hole, at least according to the leading theories.  Dark matter appears to be more or less uniformly distributed within each galaxy, not necessarily between the galaxies and not tied up in individual localized black holes.  It is affected by gravity but not other forces such as electromagnetism.  Therefore dark matter is gravitationally attracted to galaxies as is ordinary matter.    Dark matter is the only explanation scientists have for the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters and the rotational speed of individual galaxies (spinning on their own axes).  Without the extra unseen mass explained by dark matter, galaxies would not behave as they do as they spin.  The vast majority of the dark matter in the universe is believed to be made up of nonbaryonic particles, and thus not formed out of atoms and not wrapped in the confines of black holes.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter   Now that wasn't called for.   Ok, here's a link to a site with minimal ads:   http://cnettv.cnet.com/caught-tape-whale-crashes-boat/9742-1_53-50090678.html   Wonder how much Red Bull Felix is downing before he steps out of the capsule?   Downloading a PDF without warning? ... Not cool! cubeeggs - Has anyone told you that PDFs can be fairly easily exploited? Bad web behavior.   At the rate it is traveling (~17 km/sec) it will take Voyager about 60 billion years to arrive at Andromeda, our nearest galaxy at a distance of about 2 million light years.  Keeping in mind our entire universe is a only ~13 billion years old, it is doubtful the sun and earth, let alone the human race, will even exist if/when it arrives.  Doesn't sound like a practical solution.   Agreed   I see   I don't know about that.  You can't ask a book a question and get a direct answer, even if through a mechanical sounding voice.   Here's a link to the video the viewers in the U.K. saw on the ITV HD channel:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bz6vxPkMR0   Here's a link to the video viewers in the U.K. saw on the ITV HD channel.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bz6vxPkMR0   I second The Elegant Universe recommendation.    A couple others I recommend are 'The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality' by Brian Greene and 'Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Einstein's Outrageous Legacy' by Kip Thorne   reddit FTW!   Wow, great collection of photos.  Thanks!   I wouldn't rule out HDTV just yet.  The technology has caught on enough that sales overtook SD in 2008  http://broadcastengineering.com/news/hdtv-sales-overtake-sd-models-1110/  I may be a bit biased here but unless you're watching an SD YouTube or other web vid or an oldy, HD is clearly better than SD.  Aspect ratio alone makes a statement on the screen, let alone resolution.  And 5.1 rocks!   nice   By "accepts wind from any direction" I mean from any direction in the horizontal plane, not from above or below.  This is true because the device is circularly symmetric so wind striking it from N, S, E or W will have the same affect on the turbine's rotation.   Yea, would like to see some numbers.  The best we have to go on is "... final costs of about $1.50/watt rated output, which is roughly 2/3 the cost of comparable bladed units."  Not a huge improvement but significant enough to pursue if it can be put to practice.   I don't think the bladeless turbine needs a swivel base since it accepts wind from any direction unlike a bladed turbine - another advantage for the bladeless design.   Better coverage here  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC2oArZP8wg   Article says the series starts in May in the U.K., but in the U.S. it begins tonight on the Discovery channel.  The documentary is technically called 'Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking.'   Wow, I'd give 5 up votes if I could.  I submitted a link about the photos but this video is simply spectacular!     Good link. Yet another source for layman's physics info.   Thank you for that explanation.  Another response from an expert - two for two today.  Follow up question to your statement that we can measure dark energy.  How is that done?  Is the estimate based on the acceleration of the universe's expansion or some other method?     Wow, a response from an expert - thank you.    Do you think the same is true with dark energy, that is no connection with hidden dimensions?   Thank you for the correction.  Wikipedia confirms you are correct http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13   Yes because it is one more step to help industry move toward html5 - a move that will be good for all of us independent of Apple or the iPad.   HTML5 will make Flash obsolete - just a matter of time.

Correction, GMT-7 not GMT-8, at least for the next couple weeks until the rest of the world goes onto daylight savings time.  I really hate that the U.S. decided to mess around with the daylight savings time dates.   The article is a bit misleading when it says the Vernal equinox occurs twice a year.  Actually an equinox occurs twice a year but one is the Vernal and the other is the Autumnal.  They sort of clear it up in the last part of the sentence when they mention both.   You are correct but the planned shut down won't be for a while.  In a couple weeks they will start slamming the beams together to achieve 7 TeV collisions and keep that up for 18 - 24 months.  After the 7 TeV tests they plan to shut LHC down for a year or more. They need the break to complete repairs for an electrical failure that occurred in 2008 and to prepare the collider for the maximum 14 TeV collisions.  That'll be when the real sparks fly.   Have you switched from a Mac to a PC or are you limited to using a PC in this case?  When it comes to video editing you can't get much easier than a Mac.   This report claims fat is a sixth taste separate from umami.   That is sufficiently close to sunset for the satellite to still be in view of the Sun and then pass into the Earth's shadow.   CliffDropOver is correct.  Eventually the satellite will pass into the Earth's shadow and appear to fade away.  How close in time to sunset/sunrise were you when you saw the satellite fade?   Oh, thanks for the clarification.   By the way, reddit put the NSFW tag on the link so they would seem to agree.   Some companies do not allow nudity of any form to appear on company owned computers, no matter the context.  I agree the subject should be ok for a work environment, but the photo may not be.  I don't make the rules but often have to follow them.   This is fairly recent (see link below). Albert Einstein is the name of a prestigious position at Princeton. Steinhardt is the "Albert Einstein Professor in Science" at Princeton. It's a position of honor.   Not sure this is the article grrow was referring to but it's close enough.  http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/02/qa_turok   No one has mentioned security yet. OSX has security vulnerabilities just like any OS, but Apple does not respond to these vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. Microsoft has shown an increased vigilance that Apple could learn from. Because Apple has enjoyed decades of small percentage market penetration theyve lulled themselves into thinking theyre more secure, but its really because they havent been attacked. The numbers are growing dramatically, and in my view it's simply a matter of time before the Mac OS experiences a big time hack. This is from a Mac fan boy.   I believe you are correct.  The sun is much larger with respect to the planet sizes than shown at any of the planet scale slider settings.  Also the planets are much too large in relation to their orbit sizes when the setting is at 1.0.   If so, God help us.   I am an electrical engineer and of all the classes I had at the undergraduate level, thermodynamics was the worst.  I could relate entropy to chaos but I couldn't translate the concept to "practical" problems. I'll never forget the problem: "A drop of rain falls from the sky into the ocean.  Does the entropy of the universe increase or decrease?" I had the class for 10 weeks and still couldn't get the answer to make intuitive sense.     I believe a photon is a fundamental quantum particle - doesn't break down any further (at least with today's physics).   nice   Couldn't agree more.  My wife and I who are both Apple fans bought one.  Weren't satisfied with its restrictions so we hacked it with ATVFlash to get more control and access of media not on iTunes.  Hack was too quirky and unreliable so we sold the AppleTV after a couple months and bought a Mac Mini instead.   We realized we needed a much more open media center, not a device that operates through iTunes like a big iPod (or should I say iPad?)   I like your take on this and have changed my mind.  U.S. broadband speeds are not shameful, just disappointing.  But I can (and obviously will) live with it.  We are fortunate to live in the times we do.   Magnetism is a subcomponent of light.  Light is an electromagnetic (electric + magnetic) phenomenon where both are intimately and orthogonally coupled.  So yes, the effect of magnetism travels at (not less than) the speed of light.  The answer to your question is yes, the other magnet would continue to repel for the time it took light (electromagnetism) to travel the distance between the two magnets.   Yes it's much more practical and economical to implement higher speed broadband in smaller countries.  Here's a site to give you a feel for broadband speeds in the U.S. http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/   Understand and it probably won't come to pass, but look where the U.S. broadband speed currently stands wrt other nations http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Images/commentarynews/broadbandspeedchart.jpg   here's a better quality video of the same http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsjU0K8QPhs   Exactly, I like that a cord is hanging from the metal rod.   Yeah, I agree they had no idea what harmful effects x-rays may have had at the time.  But wouldn't she have been a little apprehensive putting her hand under an experimental contraption that allowed her to see her bones through her skin?   If you read or hear the words "zero point power", "infinite power" or "generates power indefinitely" your spidey sense should be activated. These would come in handy right now in Haiti but you won't be seeing any of these fictitious devices.   Why do I feel apprehensive about pushing that big red Test Me button?   Don't they need to address the other end of animals to tackle their aggravation of climate change?   Couldn't they have thought of a 10th?   I would like to believe this is true but would like to see evidence explaining why the photo shows the ball is moving toward the plate.  Movement is not easily shown by a single still photo.   At least Shaq is licensed to carry.   I think you are correct and the word was improperly used in the article.     Patrick Stewart -- Jean-Luc Picard -- Star Trek: Next Generation -- Science Fiction -- Technology (ok it's a bit of a reach)   True, but I'm betting another directive will be issued after this one expires.   Yes, that's why I changed the title - it didn't make sense.   I searched for Symphony of Science in /r/science before submitting this link and found a link to another YouTube video (http://www.reddit.com/tb/a82cy) but not this one.  What previous old favorite reddit link are you referring to?   Good list.  I would add one more priceless twitterer to follow:  http://twitter.com/shitmydadsays His bio reads: * Name Justin * Bio I'm 29. I live with my 73-year-old dad. He is awesome. I just write down shit that he says. (He has over 990K followers)   Nice   Thanks for the link.  Aldrin's quote is summarized here: "There is a monolith there, a very unusual structure on this little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars once every seven hours. When people find out about that, they are going to say 'who put that there?'. Well, the universe put it there, or if you choose, God put it there."   Thanks, now that is helpful. What did Aldrin have to say about it?   That's helpful.   So what would cause an optical illusion such as this?   I'd go for the PS3.  I watch blu-ray and my son does gaming on the PS3.  It has worked well for over two years for both applications.    Not sure if anyone has mentioned it here but I believe the PS3 is still the fastest at loading blu-ray disks.  Some players take a long time to load and that can get really annoying.   I feel sorry for anyone who invests money in this venture.   Might this be the link you were attempting to post? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEheh1BH34Q   The angle subtended by the black hole would be minuscule compared to the angle subtended by the massive galaxy, assuming the black hole was about midway between the Milky Way and the other galaxy.  This means the black hole would create a very small area of distortion in the image of the galaxy as viewed by a high power telescope (say Hubble).  Although some of the galaxy's image will be directly blocked (absorbed) by the black hole, much of this dark area will be filled in by light being bent (due to gravitational lensing) around the black hole.     Black holes theorized to be at the center of most galaxies are not good candidates for direct observation.  A black hole in the center of a galaxy is obscured by numerous stars, dust and other galactic debris shrouding the center.  That includes the black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Galactic centers are pretty dense areas.   I believe we can estimate the mass of a black hole pretty well for the case you give (a binary system containing a black hole and a star) for the reason you stated.  The path of the visible star is affected in a measurable way.  Scientists can estimate the mass of most visible stars pretty accurately based on distance and brightness.  Given the mass of the visible star and the diameter of its rotation around the unseen object (black hole) they can measure the mass of the black hole fairly accurately.    I may not understand what you're getting with your comment on the "extra gravity".   You may be thinking that dark matter is matter that falls into a black hole?  If so, that is not dark matter.  Scientists theorize that dark matter is generally distributed around the galaxy and is not localized within black holes.  Although any matter can fall into a black hole (dark or energetic) and increase its mass accordingly.  It's all the same to the black hole.  Once it falls in, it is no longer defined as dark or anything else, it's just added mass to the black hole.  Yes, the black hole's event horizon will increase in size as it becomes more massive and this extra mass is quite measurable when the black hole is paired up with a star.  Other methods can be used to measure a black hole's mass such as gravitation lensing.  Another example of matter that interacts very weakly with other matter is the neutrino.  Neutrinos have almost negligible mass, no charge, travel nearly at the speed of light and do not interact with matter (almost). The mass and speed of neutrinos are still not certain and are being investigated.   Tyson is using the term "us" loosely.  Dark matter does not interact with us as individuals in a way we can measure directly on Earth.  But it does interact with the rest of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies as well as larger structures (galaxy clusters).  Astrophysicists have measured the rotation of these galaxies and stars within the galaxies.  They can't explain how the galaxies' rotations occur when they consider only the visible stars.  Keep in mind the rotation is not just the galaxy as a whole but the rotation rates of stars within the galaxies at varying distance from the galactic center. The only explanation that explains the internal rotations is additional mass distributed in and around the galaxies that cannot be seen (dark) and does not interact with electromagnetic energy.      Much better video.  Thank you.   A solar system reference frame is defined by the Sun not the Earth.  The Earth revolves around the Sun at many thousands of miles per hour.  If the helicopter is fixed with respect to the Sun, the Earth will immediately either slam into it or zoom away from at many thousands of miles per hour (depending on which side of the earth the helicopter is located with respect to the Earth's motion around the Sun) as it revolves around the Sun.  The pilot will either be crushed by the collision or be left in space to suffocate and freeze.  This won't take 12 hours but seconds   Did you possibly mean the Earth as the reference frame?  That is the only reference frame where fractions of a day (12 or 24 hrs) come into play.   Yes, you can have a point fixed in an expanding universe.   Think of an expanding balloon where the surface of the balloon is the reference frame. As the balloon (universe) expands, the point will expand with it.  Locally it will appear fixed but it will be moving away from other fixed points like points on the balloon's surface.    You don't need to have a center to have a fixed point.  In this analogy, the balloon's surface has no center (the interior of the balloon is not part of the analogy, just the surface).  The same holds true with the universe.   No   Your scenario about a "fixed point in space" is ambiguous.  Space has many frames of reference: the earth, solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, super cluster and universe.  Each of these "space" reference frames moves at a different speed and rotates (and expands) at a different rate.  So first clarify your reference frame ... do you really mean the solar system or the earth or something else as your reference frame?  The answer to your question depends entirely on your reference frame.  When I think of a "fixed point in space", I think of the universe.   When it comes to advancing science at this level we often can't predict what the benefits will be.  Consider when the lasing effect was predicted by Einstein then later confirmed in the 60's through the invention of the laser.  Uses for the laser are almost too many to list but I'm guessing Einstein or the inventor or even the science community at large had no idea what the laser would eventually bring to our world.   	159
 Yes. Especially in a free state like the US, and much of the world, where military service is volunteer based. Perhaps you disagree with the government's use of military force, but you can still support and wish the best for those that volunteered to put their life on the line.   1900's like entire century or 1900's like 1900-1909?   I absolutely love the show. The writing   acting is fantastic. Each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat and the plot moves along too, it doesn't get stagnant. But I talk to friends and most haven't even heard of it and those that have, haven't seen it or know much about it. And I didn't hear much of anything regarding it leading up the Emmy's. What gives?         I want to make a simple bar graph using data across several 8 different sheets. All it is a numerical value in cell H2 of each page. I just want each of the 8 values to be a column in the graph. How do I do this?      Will trade other books, money or pay shipping!                     I just got Amazon Prime so now I have access to all the past HBO shows. I haven't seen any HBO besides GoT, so I was wondering what I should start watching first.                        If you ship commodity cards, are they then also able to be used in the end game scoring of the bonus tiles that give you 3 points per shown commodity? Or can you only score those if you take the seaport action to lay those in your player area?         "I want to make a gif of that Charlie Murphy skit with Rick James when he's stomping on the couch saying "F YO COUCH" but replace the couch with waffles and update the text accordingly. However I don't have the technology available on my phone." This is a request from my dear friend and I want to make this for him. It's the US game today and his birthday. Is this possible?!         My goal is to highlight the whole row based off Column B being greater/lesser than Column C, but excel always interpets Column A (which is words) as greater than the any numerical value. So it'll will never highlight Column A when B is less than C.   [Here is my example](http://i.imgur.com/kOgkm76.jpg). I'd like each row to be uniform.    Hey, I'll be in Dublin this Friday - Sunday and was wondering if there's any pick up ultimate around the city?          I'll be backpacking Ireland for 12 days this summer and I was wondering what the best options would be. I'd like to buy a package ticket if possible. It seems Bus eireann and Irish Rail are the two main systems. Are there tickets that includes a pass for both?   I'll be going from Dublin to, Wicklow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork, Kinsale, Killarney, Kerry, Galway, back to Dublin.       I don't want to spend a ton of money. It'll be my first bike, but I want something more than a rusty bucket off CL. When I'm looking used, what brands should I keep an eye out that offer a reliable "starter" bike? Can I get anything decent for $200-$300?             I'm just looking for a place to crash in Dublin for a night or 2 while I start my backpacking through Ireland! I'm real easy going, looking to meet some awesome people and experience the Irish culture! I can cook too!            I'll be going off to Ireland for 12 days in a month. Basically making my way from Dublin, around the southern coast, up to Galway. I've heard the public transpo is pretty good in Ireland. What's the most bang for my buck and best routes to take along the way? Thanks!            When you add a new family member, will they only need 1 food for the next harvest, or will they only need 1 food if they were 'born' in a harvest round? Say, I added a family member in round 12, at the round 13 harvest would they cost 2 or 1 food?      Am I missing out if I stop now? I can't remember the last time I ever quit on a book, but I can't remember ever being less drawn into a book. What do people think of this book?   So I just got Tzolk'in yesterday and I am exciiited. I'd love to paint the gears, but I've never done any miniature painting or anything like that. What do people recommend to use in terms of paints, brushes etc? No clue where to start   I'm running into problems with Atlanta, specifically the Connect All Tiles bonus. I'm reaching one gray to another and various points along the outside. Every tile is connected through the tiles somehow. I don't get why it keeps failing   I've never backed anything on Kickstarter. Prices can be so much higher than what a typical game costs, I have trouble justifying the investment on something I've never seen. So I was wondering how other gamers look at Kickstarter. Have you backed games on Kickstarter? Have you regretted any? Great experiences, bad experiences? What's the general flow like when you back something?   I typically like medium to heavy strategy games with minimized luck (terra mystica, eclipse, castles of burgundy, suburbia etc). If the game has a stronger thematic play to it, then all the better, but not crucial.                            I definitely don't need something huge. I'll be staying in hostels/hotels every night, so no camping eqpt needed. I was looking at the Osprey Stratos 36. Seems light, accessible and organized. Any others I should check out? My main wants are light, organized storage areas and 35-40L.   We have a group that regularly gets together for board game nights and we were more than happy to help out and teach them (anywhere from high school to college) games! It was a lot of fun. [**Here's what we were able to muster up**](http://i.imgur.com/vfEVqzK.jpg)   Favorites of the night were King of Tokyo, Pandemic, Dominion and Burgundy. Pretty much all of the people were new to games, so they didn't get into the heavier stuff. We're going to try to do this every 1 or 2 months, so we hope it continues!      Any recommendations on hostels in Dublin, Galway and if there's any around cork, killarney, limerick or brunner would be much appreciated. I always just like to look at forums and not just review sites, since there's so many paid reviews nowadays. Thanks!   I'm planning a trip to Ireland and trying to decide whether to use a tour (likely Go Ahead Tours) or just backpack it. People that have done tours of Ireland, is it worth it? Would I be better off planning it myself?      My pipes froze 3 weeks ago during the blizzard. The cold water pipe has not worked since and yesterday the hot water froze too, nothing comes out. They have still not come to fix anything. Came home from worl today to find ice formed in a bowl and all along the hose attachment. They refuse to fix anything, saying the city isn't giving enough pressure (no neighbor is reporting this, we checked) and won't raise the heat. Several of the apartments have dogs. They are threatening to file litigation against anyone who doesn't pay rent or tries to break lease and move out. I'm still holding on to my rent money.    tl;dr - do NOT move into one of their buildings.

Some if it is simple: For instance if the cell in Column C says "Total" I'd like the text in the same row in Column D to be bold with a green fill. Is this possible? What formula would I use?   I should clarify...actual specific classes within sites live Kahn Academy or edX      I'll be staying on Yonge st for the weekend and was hoping to catch the NFL playoff games on Saturday. Any good places within walking or quick cab ride distance? I heard Sports Centre cafe is decent?   So I haven't gotten Fifa since 11, well before this new manual tackling was implemented. I overpursue every player with the ball, constantly whiff with the tackle button. And holding contain just keeps him a few yards off and generally lets the guy go right by him if he makes a sprint. I'd love some tips, cuz I am just not used to this and it is frustrating as hell.       Simply put, I thought every character in the book was profoundly unlikeable, and while I generally enjoy Kundera's prose, I felt this book overly disjointed. I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts on Tomas, Tereza, Sabina, Franz, the ending, the philosophy of the book, dreams or anything else.                   I'd prefer to keep it under the $20, or at least real close. I have lots of medium to heavy strategy games, so I'd like something lighter anywhere from 2-6 players.

My friends and I played our first 3 player game last night and I have some questions with problems we ran into. I started on the West Coast in Vegas and quickly fell behind as it was very expensive to span out, and my buddy found cheap expansion in the midwest and I could never really catch back up, because later I was completely blocked from expanding East as all the cities had 2 houses on them. This leads to my other question...the Step 3 card is at the bottom, and we had 2 houses on every single city in our 3 areas (the other 2 people had built 16 each), but we still had lots of power plant cards to go. So we spent several rounds simply holding auctions/passing on auctions, collecting resources   money. Until we got to the Step 3 card, built a bunch of houses and the game was over. Is this normal?    Does anyone know where I can find this? Or even better, does anyone have a copy they want to sell??   Hey, I have a 4 year old dog that doesn't do great with other dogs. Do people have recommendations for a training school or an individual dog behavioral therapist?    I have a 4 year old mini australian shepherd. He's fantastic with people. Loves em all. However, he doesn't do well with dogs. He gets uber-excited when he sees them and immediately tries to sprint right at em and jump on em (I'm 99.9% sure it's playing). This freaks other dogs out and they growl/bark/snap at him, which then scares him and makes him defensive. I know he needs to be socialized more, but I can't because of this and friends with dogs won't bring their dogs over or really want him at their house.   I was thinking about bringing him to a doggy day care for some immersion therapy but I don't want him to end up being crated the entire time because he can't get along with any dog. What kind of tricks or training things can I do?  TL;DR my dog sucks with other dogs, need training advice      http://i.imgur.com/j5A7h74.jpg  Tip of the cap to Z-Man games. This game is beautiful. The colors are vibrant, the board is thick (even the back of the gameboard has great artwork!) and everything feels of top notch quality. Any helpful tips so I can reign supreme in my group??         Edit: for some questions: I'm not looking to sell em. I'm moving, they're broke, if some of my buffalo friends want me for parts or paper weights, just come pick em up! For what's wrong with them: Xbox boots up immediately to red light (also the pop-in hard drive from the side/top is gone). The PS3: when it turns on it beeps, blinks a green light a few times then shuts off as it blinks a red light then stays off.

It'll be someone's turn and then just nothing happens...no turns are made, I can't click anything, I can't type a message and there is nothing wrong with my internet connection. Has anyone else experienced this? Any solutions?      So I just got Twilight Struggle and have unbowed and am looking through the rules, and I just want to clarify something on placing influence tiles in a region.   So if the enemy has influence or control in a country, can I gain control simply by placing more influence tiles? Lets say my enemy has control of Cuba (3) and I over a course of some turns place 6 influence, do I gain control? Can it be better to do that, if possible, over rolling for realignment or coups?          My friends and I are setting up our first game of Agricola and playing the family variant. Is it possible to bake bread in this or can you only do that through the improvement cards?   Any other tips to playing our first time? Common things that confused you guys the first time around?    So my friends and I have no played Eclipse twice and loved it. However, it seems to me both games progressed very peacefully then the end of the final round and it blew up into a massive onslaught on each other for  a few high valued hexes. It made the game seem very "last round dominant" if that's a thing. Has anyone felt the same while playing the game or are we just bad it? Is there a way to get to the game to progress so the first 8 rounds don't just feel like a set up for the final 9th round where everything was decided?   My friends and I love the German style strategy games and have played a ton of settlers, Puerto Rico, Dominion, 7 Wonders and eclipse (played for the first time a few days ago and loved it). Now it's pretty much my overdue turn to contribute a game and by and large everything I've read for these three games are all positive reviews. I'd like to find a balance of complex, randomness to encourage replayability, and something that doesn't take crazy long like an Eclipse or Through The Ages. Just looking for basic pros and cons, personal experiences with the games, and what not. Thanks!  	125
 Served along with a bag of generic Doritos that is 99% air and 1% potato chip.    I like the line of "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." This is what is going on in Ukraine right now with Chechnyan fighters helping Ukrainian forces put down the Russian rebels. The same with Syria in which many Free Syrian Army fighters having defected to groups such as ISIS because they hate Bashar al-Assad more than they hate ISIS. It makes war very messy, especially once the conflict is over the temporarily united factions under a common enemy might then fight it out after their common enemy falls.     Then my brother's alcoholic girlfriend drank it one night. Doesn't even remember it, just wanted more stuff to get her drunk. I will never forgive her.   nbsp;  When someone is stealing other people's booze to get drunk that means that there is a very serious problem. Is she and your brother still together or did he move on?    Ray Romano kept reminding me of Kermit the Frog.    If anyone is curious about the reference, this is referring to Emma Sulkowicz a.k.a. Mattress girl. She carried around her mattress as a publicity stunt even though it was shown that she lied about being raped. She made a crazy website where she films herself simulating rape and tells anyone that watches the video that they have committed stare rape if they don't agree with her. She is a nut case that harms not only the people she falsely accused, but real rape victims. When websites like Gawker and Jezebel picked her up as some sort of feminist hero, that is when I stopped reading those sites and I finally realized how terrible they have become.    It is sad but true, taxpayer like you and I who are responsible will be stuck footing the bill for her irresponsibility. -_-  	6
 equals one of my balls being the size of a clementine    Thanks for the figurative slap in the face you are right but emotions are powerful things   Think I'm gonna retaliate with doxycyclin and learning from this experience sorry to disappoint you   This seems to be the general consensus of the thread and I would like to thank all of you for not letting my emotions get the better of me   Drunk plus how good sex feels without a condom equals I'm a dumbass   I let my emotions get the better of me cause I'm fucking pissed off. Everyone in this thread is right doing anything to him is childish and not going to change anything in the long run   Then I find out I'm a horrible judge of character and lose faith in humanity   A little fucking callous but you make good points.   You could be completely right but I'm usually a very untrusting person because I have had the shit manipulated out of me before. She has proven herself to me thus far but of course she could just be a manipulative bitch and be incredibly good about it. If i find out that's true goddamn I don't know if I could trust anyone ever again.   Like I said i trust her a lot and I'm usually a very cynical person. You could definitely be right but I think I'm a good judging people and she has proven herself to me though. But everyone in this thread saying to be the better man are correct. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me.   She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).  Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.  I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?  **EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault   be afraid   I suggest watch the documentary When you're strange. It's narrated by Johnny Depp and tell the story of the Doors in a very entertaining way. Although I guess you'd have to fuck up hard to make something about Jim Morrison's life not entertaining.  If you like that read the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive   a little?   Just remember definitely has "finite" in it. You'll never spell it wrong again   Wow that's really lame   Are you sure you're not just a dick? Personally anyone who describes themselves as "speaks charismatically" comes off as a bit narcissistic to me...       What really helped me to learn to snap my fingers is that the sound doesn't come from rubbing your middle finger with your thumb. Instead the thumb is used to build up the tension in this finger and the sound actually comes from your middle finger hitting the base of your thumb/palm after it is "released" by your thumb.

It's kind of sad to think what could have been   I've been hoping for years that some day someone will start up a private server that's only patched up up to how the game was around 2002. It's just not the same game anymore, you can be a tumerok, shadow, olthoi, etc. now and they just have added so many useless features.

The algorithm iPhones use to take pictures captures the light first at the center or the photo and then moves radially outward. The picture is takien over a period of time, not instantly so effects like this occur when you take pictures of fast moving objects.   Oh hey I know I'll start writing in the middle of the paper instead of the side and the first four lines will get gradually more indented.

This combined with the adenosine receptor mediated modulation of the permeability of the BBB seem like huge breakthroughs.   Wow thank you, that is such an amazing breakthrough in so many ways. I can't believe I've never heard anything about it   I'm quite in to chemistry myself and have been doing research on this topic for a while because Alzheimer's runs in my family and this kind of stuff interests me. It seems the gene mutations causing AD have been located but as of now there is still no real treatment. How far away are we from being able to actually cure this disease, if one of my parents develops AD will there be a cure?  Also please don't dumb down your responses for me, I have taken biochemistry and cell physiology so I can understand a lot of the jargon.   A couple years ago i stumbled across an incredibly weird webcam video of a very strangle looking guy covering creep by radiohead. I remember he had a spotty, disgusting moustache and was terrible at singing. If anyone has the link to this video I would be forever grateful      Also I'm pretty sure the main riff was just something slash would do to warm up on guitar and practice skipping a string or something like that. Axl heard him playing it and told him that that was going to be their next song   The Whiskey Rebellion  Seven Days Short     I remember Animal was the first to hit 100 and he was on Thistledown right? I saw him ingame once and was starstruck. He also sold his account for $10k if I recall correctly, that's ridiculous.  Then Tim the Enchanter hit 126 still hunting in BSD. God I can't imagine how much grinding he did and how long that took just killing tuskers for like 15k xp a piece.   end end end caxxxxxzdxxxxxxxzdxacxcaxcaxwzwzwz end end end zdxxxzxdcaxxxxxxxxxxxxwwwzz end end end end      I grew up in central texas and moved to atlanta for college.

Moldy, mold, mold. Here it goes down, down into my belly...    I'm a BME taking 18 hours this semester and I beg to differ...   Let's face it, this school is fucking hard... especially when professors refuse to give out practice tests or only give out one(*cough* physics department *cough*). I think it would benefit everyone if we put together a r/gatech word server where anyone could upload materials from classes they previously took(like a fraternity or sorority word). I could probably set something up if there's any interest...   Oh all the time. One time a few friends and I were tripping on acid and we decided to throw milkdrop up on one of the projectors. Got a few weird looks from the kids trying to study(fucking nerds) but it was a great experience   I don't think reddit would benefit from people ignoring this so much as not misinterpreting it. It's not saying plagiarize and copy, it's saying take things that speak to you from various sources and make them your own.      Kramer: The name on the boat. Look at it.  Jerry: Assman!

Upvote that comment. 6. Cry because Im not the special unique flower my mom always told me I was.    For some reason, my hands and feet sweat excessively at all times. Even as I'm typing this now, I can feel the grimy, clammy sweat building up on my hands and it's really uncomfortable. This always makes handshakes pretty awkward, I definitely would be pretty grossed out if I shook someone's hand only to find it wet with sweat. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Of course I know the ol' wipe your hands on your pants trick, but that just doesn't quite cut it for me any more...   **Emily:** Really Charles, people will think-...  **Charles Foster Kane:** --what I tell them to think.

I can do a decent posh accent(or so I've been told by actual british people) and I've thought about just one day starting to talk in a british accent and never stopping. Sure I'd loose all my friends probably but eventually I could make new friends who wouldn't know I'm actually american. I'd get so many more chicks that way it'd be awesome   Hmmm, how about saying it was an interesting movie made me think about things I never would have thought about before? Does that make me sound stupid?       Jim Morrison for sure   Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.  Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.  Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc   This interview of him with Richard Dawkins is really interesting and informative if you want to find out more.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xswt8B8-UTM feature=channel      This version has subtitles... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYzU3wSfoq8.

Now I understand the term unwilling dog voyeur   Wow I never knew how much of an asshole Edison was. Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time. History certainly doesn't paint him as the type of powerful person who will lie as long as it makes him money.   Ah damn that sucks...   http://www.icefilms.info http://www.ninjavideo.net http://www.stagevu.com   Hmm well whoops I never saw that and I just saw the video today.

I also feel like Colbert wouldn't use nearly as many smilies and would be a lot funnier too   personally i think a poop camel is worse than an old faithful type pooper but thats just my opinion    I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible.   In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game.   Change is a good thing if it's done right.   Makin' movies, makin' music and Fight-in' Round The World!    you act like I can't find cheap good weed in Austin... pshh I've got the best of both worlds   My favorite movie I've watched on acid was horton hears a who.

 [Request] Can anyone make one of these for me if I give them the pokemon list? I'd love to have one but I'm absolutely shocking with computers (not to mention that I'm backpacking at the moment so all I've got is a shitty little netbook that's about ten years old).   Anuses for eyes   Blank Space is my ladyjam. I'm 25 and male, I have no regrets.   A decent remake of Eragon. Seriously it's such a good book series, and that film was abysmal!   Life. *drops mike*   Out of interest, I googled- http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Australia#New_South_Wales  Apparently one of the most liberal States there is.   I'm not sure of the legality in my area (currently Sydney, Australia), but as so far as defining it as prostitution, if you go by this definition; "the practice or occupation of engaging in sexual activity with someone for payment." then yes.  As an interesting side note, on a quick search there does seem to be a large number of businesses and individuals offering up said service in my area, on fairly public sites, so I'm not sure if it is illegal.   I'd have to say trade debt, politicians not being for the people any more, and the lack of serious action to restore the environment's health.  If I could add a few, it would be unequal wages, stereotype hatred/persecution and the "health and safety" hype of the past decade that has only increasingly spiralled further out of control, logic and belief.   None, I would be ashamed of our standard of "music" compared to his.   Pokemon Red/Blue (and Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal). Not necessarily the game itself, but;  -the struggle of playing as far as you can without the ability to charge your device during the game...  -the straining of your eyes as you try and decipher the dungeon mazes at gone midnight with their tinged colour screens (or grey for the older gen)...  -the social aspect of trading pokemon via a cable...  -the feeling of victory over GameFreak when you managed to successfully clone a pokemon using the trade cable technique...  -the fear of potential game loss and code corruption when you catch missingo as you attempt the item multiplier cheat...   It looks like a bird on fire, though it's skin is covered in a series of lined troughs and peaks...   Is that a... ...it is That's a fucking shiny bauble that is... Oh my god I want it...

Hey everyone,  Just wondering if anyone has any unusual ideas of things that can be done on the east coast of Australia?  We have a few ideas already for ourselves (learn to scuba dive, Scooteroo, whitsunday islands and Fraser island).  We're not looking for the common things that all the tourists/backpackers do, so leave those out if you please!

Hey everyone  Just wondering if anyone has any unusual ideas of things that can be done on the east coast of Australia?  We have a few ideas already for ourselves (learn to scuba dive, Scooteroo, whitsunday islands and Fraser island).  We're not looking for the common things that all the tourists/backpackers do, so leave those out if you please!   I don't know if it's common or uncommon, but I can hear when someone is going to come into a room (if it's quiet).  I don't mean footsteps or other noises that they make- it's hard to describe but the pitch of the background noise changes slightly when someone's about to enter the room I'm in.   Secondary one- I always gets hiccups if I have sex or masturbate in a certain position!   Similar thing happened to me at the back end of last year; my SO started spending all her time glued to her phone, even when we were in the same room (she'd purposefully sit so I couldn't see the screen), and would never leave it unattended.  Long story short she did one night and I found evidence that she had been cheating on me (emotionally and socially, though the physical side was actually in planning at that stage- I caught it in time to head it off).  So from experience, I sincerely hope she isn't cheating on you dude, even without the physical side it was devastating, and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.  Best advice I can give is to sit down with her seriously and have a long chat about your worries. If she gets more defensive of her phone afterwards, I'd red flag it. Note- she may be using another app to actually chat, as snapchat's chat function isn't great, so it might be worth checking her phone if you get the opportunity.  Fingers crossed for you.   As unhelpful as it is, it seems like you need to have a very long think about what you want, and then a serious conversation with him where you lay it all on the table- what you're thinking and how you feel. It seems to me the only way to move forward is to have a frank discussion where you both are honest (even if that honesty isn't the answer you want to hear). Sorry for not being very definitive!   Short opinion- you should focus on your own career, as he seems to be doing. I'm sorry he seems not to be as committed in the relationship as you, it's horrid when one partner isn't putting in equal weight into things.   It does sound like you're both on different pages I'm afraid - communication, and that's both ways, is key in any relationship. The way she's reacting is toxic, but it may be the result of how she was brought up or treated at some point in her past.  Maybe try writing your opinions/concerns in a (well worded) letter- that way she'll read your opinions without an opportunity to interrupt. You should probably try outlining in said same letter how you feel about the negative direction your relationship is going, too, if it continues as it is Id recommend your best course of action would be to cut and run (as hard and harsh as that sounds).   Truth and communication are key- be honest with her about your fears, but try to explain it in a way that isn't accusatory.  Hopefully she'll be able to calm your worries and get on with your relationship.   This, so much this.   Hullo all!  Always enjoyed making new friends and chatting to new people, so reaching out!  Basic stats; I'm 25, English, white and non-religious! Graduated from university with a 2:1 degree in Forensic Science last July.  A little extra; I'm an avid writer, and I've had two published short stories with a third coming out sometime this year. I'm aspiring to get a novel (or many) published.  I love swimming, travel, animals, science (especially space and everything related), food, music, movies and books!  Even more; I'm a self confessed geek, with major interests in Lord of the Rings, Pokemon, Game of Thrones and several other niche markets (including Games Workshop's book publishing company, The Black Library).  And finally; I'm currently in the third year of a serious, committed relationship, and we are presently travelling around Australia together (arrived here in Oz in November).  Note; I'm only putting myself up for email penpals, as snail mail is too costly on a backpackers budget!  Hit me up with a PM!   I've not played OR/AS or X/Y, so I can only attest for looks, but am I the only one who thinks that the Mega forms were a bad idea?  The pokemon look warped, mutated and, in some cases, utterly ridiculous.  Okay that could be said of many natural pokemon and their evolutions, but it just seems to far to me- it has an air of digimon about it (like armour digivolving or similar).  It may well help some of them in terms of stats/competitiveness, but I dislike how they appear. /myopinion   I agree, though you only need the therapy due to the trauma your family put you through. Nothing you did was wrong.  You might even find that it wasn't a majority opinion- some of your family members may have been there under peer pressure, so if you did send out a mess email/letter decrying their disgusting behaviour, you may get one or two supporting you/apologising. No guarantees, but it's a possibility.   This is sick (not you, their reactions).  Art is the expression of ones self, and sexuality is each persons own personal choice. The combination of the two is nothing to be ashamed of.  It was totally out of order for your family to treat you in such a way, and even worse for them to have destroyed your property.  If I were you (and I know it's not always easy to do) I would stand up for myself and tell them what they did was not okay. It's just as bad as them psychologically torturing someone for being straight, or liking cars.  I hope you get out of that abusive environment and find the freedom to express yourself.   Definitely the starter trio - http://www.tokyoluv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pokemon_01.jpg  Cutest, and it's the originals, can't beat that!  I'd maybe have them together across your upper back, or on three separate areas - either way I'd definitely get them all!   How much is the Umbreon hat? It's my favourite Eeveelution!   So I was looking over on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28video_game_series%29 at the timeline of releases and wondering what you guys thought; do we get the next generation this year, or do we have to wait for next year?   As an aside, does anyone know what month they're usually released in (if they have a usual or set month)?   Literally just posted on your original thread, then saw this.  Good on you for taking action, glad it's sorted.   A bit late to the game, but sorry to hear you have an ex like this.  I've traded pictures with others before, and would have never dreamed of spreading them around if I still had them.      That was my thinking. I didn't mean that they'd reboot the original games before the Z or XY2, but I think that would be the next step, bringing the red/blue (or green) up to a ds cartridge (3DS id presume).   Okay, so each generation they upgrade a previous one to bring it into the latest level of tech/development.  My idea is this; as the next generation in the order is already on a ds cartridge (diamond/pearl), they'll reboot red and green/blue as ds versions.  Thoughts? Hopes?   I don't have an Amazon wish list, I just wanted to join in :)   1. Lilo and Stitch 2. Stitch 3. In SUMMER!! (Frozen - Olaf)   How about a third game (so only a single release as opposed to a double) but still a different story in the BW2 vein? Would that work?   I guess I'm nostalgic for the older times, and I may well have a different opinion if I ever get to play BW2. Saying that, I haven't actually got around to completing BW yet...   And how are you finding them so far?   Okay, so my first post ever here, so be gentle!  Red/Blue had Yellow, Gold/Silver had Crystal, Ruby/Sapphire had Emerald, Diamond/Pearl had Platinum,  Where's Grey? Or Z? Why have they ditched the third game each gen?  It always seemed to me that the "merged" game of the generation was the best- yellow you had pikachu running around after you (not to mention the beginnings of The pokemon happiness elements coming in), and crystal had suicine centred around you in the story- I miss that!  Now I'm not up to speed- unfortunately the furthest I've played is B/W, but I like the reboot games, I just miss the extra content/alternate take on the story (like Rayquaza's more central role in Emerald).  Opinions?   That means; now she all mayd  	42

It doesn't look too pitbull, a common problem we have here in Australia is that people register american pitbulls as Staffy's, then when they attack it gives the staff a bad name..  Either way, its a good looking pup!   Is that an American Staffy?   Which Reddit app are you using?   Is that like Gargamel from the smurfs?   Have you got pictures of the engine layout and how they look? Having 2 engines with that much power is awesome.

I'm definitely giving your recommendations a go, I need something new to watch!   Its a shame that the show was cancelled.   I used to watch it here and there as a kid, but never really appreciated it.   I recently 'backed up' all of the season and watched it from season 1-13, and it is brilliant.   The show didn't dumb down like the Simpsons did, and managed to stay true to their story line.  Dale Gribble.. I wish there were more episodes devoted to him.   I'm 50/50 on that one, its ok, but not my cup of tea!   At least the royalties from King of the Hill would've tied them over for a while!   Is it true that they based the look of Dale a lot on the voice actor that played him?   That's an awesome pickup! I thought it was the earlier seasons that had it and they dropped it later on   I never realised it was an actual track, thanks for the link   Mate, they've been there for a while..

For sneaking!   They needed more Dale Gribble centric episodes. He was hilarious.  Shi Sha!!   I'm watching Season 3 and it was the Angel episode.. Shit episode.  Never a fan of Buckley, glad they dropped that character.   Depends on your country.. Lion Heart was released as Wrong Bet as well.   You want me to break my leg??   Kickboxer is also one of those gifs.. 2 best movies of all time.  Kickboxer and Bloodsport.   For some reason I find the period panties less disturbing than panties with the weird goop you guys discharge randomly all month long.   Mate god knows what they were thinking with the UC Torana, it was an after thought of a car to bring in the VB commodore.   My first car was a 5.0L VL Calais..   Memories.   All credit to the XA and XB for ride and comfort, I don't mind the front end, it's more the rounded back that I wasn't too big of a fan of.  My most hated car of that Era when it comes to Holden and Ford would still be the UC Torana.. and I'm a Holden boy.  You're lucky to be still holding onto one, they're hard to find these days, or priced so high they are out of reach!   Someone messed up and spelt Cassandra wrong.   Scrappy fucken Doo  'Let me at him, let me at him' fuck off already!   Rolf Harris!? Maybe he was upset you didn't put out for him?   You were 13 right?   Never liked the XA or XB shape, but for its age it is brilliant.  XY shape was a lot nicer for me, but not as nice as an old A9X SS :)   Yeah, nah.. I'm not claiming I'm a foreigner if I am proven wrong.  I'm not in the US, I am in Aus, this nobody, is just that.. a nobody here.  Maybe the title should be 'US only famous rapper', or 'famous rapper to 16 year olds'..   Famous rappers would be, Dre, Ice Cube, Eminem, Eazy-E, Snoop insert animal, 2Pac, etc..     Nope.. Well not to me anyways buddy.  It had me scratching my head on what you were rambling on about, so at least you win that prize!   Haha I get it now!!! You hijacked someone else's post and now its yours!  Well done buddy, hope she works out well for you and you get to claim the points when they come along.  At least it wasn't a gonrwild post, you might've had some explaining to do    So you're not Lisaslover? Dude, you have me scratching my head on what's going on.   Its making me laugh trying to figure out your little saga.   Are you arguing with yourself? Im confused on what's going on here    Sometimes it makes you wonder if the $200 price tag for the Nemesis is actually justified.. I have a clone that set me back $20 or so from fasttech.. 3 months and kicking strong.      I honestly dont get it.   I have a son and am no longer with my wife, when I see my son and am with him, everything else in the world is non existent, its just him.  When I'm not with him all I think about is him and hoping he's smiling and playing.   There is no chance on this earth that I would ever chose anyone over him or his love.   All I hope and wish for is that one day he says 'I want to live with dad'.. My life would be complete.    Mr Vain only came out like 10 years ago ... Damn.   I sighed when I read this.. The sigh of understanding.  Same boat as you.. It sucks either way.. With them and the life without them.  Sigh.   Did you?   I rather this than hearing about dogs being pitted against each other    I'm guessing you have quite an old / early built house..   Coming from a person that doesn't even like cats, I even knew which gif it was going to be.   After a while Reddit becomes a giant repost.   I'm guessing you're referring more to when you have a bloody nose?   If so, I believe this has to do with the majority of taste being attributed to smell, and with the blood already in your nasal passages this would increase the strength of the taste vastly.   www.nicvape.com  This will last you ages  http://www.nicvape.com/store/p/45-125-ml-of-100-mg-ml.aspx  Let me know how big your juice bottle is and the mg you're after, I can help you out with the mix you need   Its a bit shitty looking, but its not really a bad tattoo..   Is that another satirical sub? I'm just not sure anymore..   Not sure if you're being sarcastic or honest..   If this was Australia and they decked out in all Australian flag gear, the only the thing they won't be getting is laid.  I admire the American patriotism.   Thank you. All I saw was a blurry photo of nuts and chips.   In the later seasons I would definitely agree, once she straightened her hair etc, she looked awesome, but early on in the series, not really my cup of tea   I'm going out on a limb here, the Elaine in this case seems a little prettier to me   I work for a large company, one that FORCED everyone to only use Blackberry.. Now with the move to Outlook for an email client they doors are open to any phone.  Samsung and Apple.. There is not one blackberry in sight.   Fuck you OP, I've watched this about a thousand times and almost know it word for word!  This has to become the new SMS tone.   On my android - Reddit is Fun   Thanks OP, finally a post in /r/WTF actually made me say.. WTF!   Spearmint goes awesome with my coffee.. Its kind of like having a mint slice biscuit..    Watermelon, Rock Melon, Honeydew Melon, all these melons are awesome.  Mango is another that I could easily devour half the tree.   Yeah, I can see your point, and you get to see his highlights..    Really? Why?   I'm honestly intrigued on why international folk like this guy so much?   You're not alone mate, I'm sure 90% of us have.   Your cotton might be too thick , also as above the ohms might be too low, I have mine at 1.2 and its awesome.   Why would they do that!, of course it would..   I guess this is why you pay what you do for a clone..   You're right. No one ever WANTS to watch season one, you have to.   As much as I love Seinfeld, I only watch seasons 3 and above   Damn!! Everything about the panzer I'll hate except for the  button.  Thanks for the feedback   Thanks mate, what do you mean by painted threads??   Bingo dude, get the aerotank. When you're back on home soil you can start start the coil process.   Mate you've gone that far, the Nautilus will let you down on what is an awesome setup.  Bite the bullet and get the Kayfun lite clone they have and get coiling.  You will then have my exact setup and you'll never look back.  I'll come off as the most negative person for stating this about 30 times in this subreddit, the Nautilus is RUBBISH.   What's the Panzer like? I have a nemesis but thinking of trying the panzer out.  (Clone)   When I was using the protank or just a standard evod, I always vaped a doubler as the flavour was quite muted.  When I went kayfun and cotton, the doubler was VERY overpowering.  Now I vape a errr one.fivebler.. I leave 3/4's of the doubler and VG the rest.. I like getting a good flavour smack.  This also depends on the flavour.   Yep.. Hop onboard buddy..  Unfortunately, 3/4's of the AMA's are the same deal..  "I was that extra, in the background on a show that no one watched.. AMA!"   You didn't read what I wrote, you pretty much just jumped the gun.  I have no issue with you replacing smoking with vaping IF you actually smoked.  My dilemma is having teens that have never smoked actual cigarettes picking up vaping, just to have them blow clouds in a bus or a train thinking everyone is looking at them in a positive way "they all think I'm cool".  I was a teen once, and this would've been my mentality, same mentality I had that got me smoking..      To be honest, we only know about who is what in the US via commercial radio in Aus, this guys hasn't made it here yet.  Sorry about Guy Sebastian though, you can keep him..   He is one of the best, he's hilarious to listen to as well.     Thats not the issue, I started smoking at 14, and would've loved for someone to switch me off them.  It's teens that NEVER smoked, but pick them up solely to cloud chase.    Dude, we know what you're trying to say, but your logic is flawed.  We aren't taking stabs at you, and me calling you ignorant is probably a fair comment, look up what the true definition of ignorant means.   he might be more of a US thing...    you are ignorant and making yourself look even dumber with every post.   I got my hands on a fresh batch of Banana Custard from Steam e-cigs on Saturday, and boy am I glad I did.  It is the usual 50/50 mix that they dish up, although I purchase doublers and mix the rest with only VG.  Even with the VG content being so high, the flavour is rich and full, definitely a single shot type juice and no need for a stronger flavour mix.  Taste - This is one of those rare juices that you can 100% put your finger on and call it as soon as you taste it, it tastes exactly like Banana Yogo!.  It doesn't have that chemical candy Banana taste, it literally tastes like Banana Yogo / Custard.  I have been vaping crazy on this juice and definitely will be keeping it as a part of my all day vape collection.  They have modified their 'Sins of Vanilla' from a pure vanilla juice, to more of a pastry vanilla, but not quite sold on this yet.. the team have advised that there is a custard in the works, so I'll hold tight till then.     Guys what am I doing wrong?  My 18490 in my Zmax is making plumes of fog from the Kayfun, where the Nemesis seems weak and no where near as powerful..  I'm on a 1.8ohm coil and running on 9w on the Zmax  What's going on here!?  Edit: thanks to all that helped! I made a 1ohm coil (single), it now hits like a truck and the flavour is on another level!!  On a negative note, I've now threaded the screw on the kayfun block.. FFS.. I can't win.      Hoping I can get an opinion or review from an owner in here.  What's the size like? Durability?  Etc..   I'm sure there's a few owners on here..  +How did you start?  +How does supply work from manufacturers? (As in do you pay upfront etc)  +what's business like?  I'm happy for a PM if you don't want to publicly post..  I'm interested in opening up a store down under as its a market I can see exploding soon, and there is hardly any stores here at all.     	102
 Take a break.   BURN. Just because she did a little bit of psychology studies (emphasis on the little) doesn't mean she has the right to use it against you during every freaking argument. The stuff learned in high school psychology skims the mere surface of theories, anywho...    Bitch, fart, and pussy are not particularly good words to use around women. Especially girlfriends.   -slow clap-   New Jersey, USA style: No. We do no tan, drink, and do laundry for shits and giggles. Sorry guys.   I am currently enrolled in Holocaust studies at my college and if it has taught me one thing, it is that there will always be people who have either never heard of the Holocaust or simply refuse to believe it. Sometimes, governments are to blame or simply a person's family. There is also the location to consider, as well as the ages of those surveyed. Rural people will not "hear" as much as urban; younger do not know as much as the old.. blah blah. Still, this was an interesting read :-)   Elizabeth: dah fahk is this?   That is incredible. I hope you have an equally successful year AGAIN :-).   I suggest combing through your history (inside jokes, places you have gone/thing seen) and maybe using this material to customize your gift for her. Maybe search for a customized gift online relating to this stuff, like a bracelet with something cutesy she likes to hear from you every now and then.. small stuff goes a long way in relationships.

 I ask that because a verb is defined as an action or a state of being.......   Use it in a sentence where it yeilds it in form to be an action.      Morals evolving renders them meaningless? Religion has changed does it render that meaningless?   Not a religous belief   No it is not a religous belief  religous attitude or  religous practice. Again where are you getting your conclusion from?   Maybe this post is not for you since you cease to make an assumption.   Where does it say religion is the representation of moral development??   Im not looking for years of teaching as religion is interpretive. Im simply asking how you interpret it and how adam and eve fit in.   Thats contradictory, if the bible is not a moral guide book as you say.   Worship is giving worth to something, in verb or noun form. Giving or practicing giving worth to something is not an action.    In verb form, the mayans built a temple to worship the gods. There is no action in worship of the gods, building the temple is an action.     Morals evolve as society and human intelligence does.   Ohh, didnt know that, thats pretty cool   Does he direct that?   didnt adam and eve get banished from eden? How does this happen if evolution took place on earth not eden? Im just asking how this fits together and how its woven into your beliefs?   Yes. In an evolved society with evolved humans and an evolved moral system killing others for pleasure isnt the path to least resistance,ie the path to least suffering.     Isnt what you are referring to exactly what happens in religous text?   If you are arguing morals come from religion, the question is extremely relevant.   So then morals do not come from religion, if they come from God.   Not the second one but you did edit the 1st one after i commented   Where? Link?   Huh? I dont understand that last post   How? If we evolved on earth though?   Did you read my post? Morality evolves, ie the choices being right or wrong, as human intelligence and society evolve.    Again, worship is not an action so....   He is about as well played, and epic a villian can get.   I didnt see anything in your link about them   It might work for you but the question is based on your choice, if you cant make one, thats perfectly fine, but again the topic at hand is not for you.     The point is i have questions as to which you pick to help me understand, a non choice doesnt help me.   Good, bad, main, supporting, etc. He has some of the most memeroable movies in film history, out of his films who was your favorite creation? and why?     I have to say Bill the butcher is my fav   Np, fair enough. But where does adam and eve come into play?   It matters in the sense of are we talking about primitive or evolved morality? Are we talking about killing for pleasure or self defense? If you have followed my defining terms all this matters   Np   That is not an action that is a product of belief, no action involved.   Let me rephase, i think you should read the description before you comment, as the question has to do with either or, not neither.   How did the fall happen if we evolved on earth?   Really, you make no sense. But i will look for answers elsewhere   You didnt answer it in regard to an evolution or creationist view    God creates in both which do you believe   Religous attidudes is an attitude of a belief in God and or worship. Thats a standard defintion   Where does your definition come from? You just made it up? Then yes it is a problem to define things personally and expect the rest of the world to change their definition   The bible does say where sin came into play, hinting at its existence in the garden of eden. But i assume from your comments you dont take it literally.     Just curious, do you ever lend thought to where sin started, or is it a non issue for you?   Im not implyin you do or i know everything, but depending on your interpretation of evolution or creationism how does adam and eve fit your beliefs?   You see how this, your pov, is a bit confusing?   You believe in creationism as in the world is 6000 years old, or evolutionary creatism?   Thats the definition   Where do you get a definition religion is moral development?   Its like a deist who believes in god but doesnt worship, he has no religion.     If you are trying to imply natural religion, that is hardly a religion, and not the sense i mean it in as can be explained in my description and comments, and is really just a technicality that has nothing to do with this topic    Religion hints at a god and or some form of worship. I dont worship natural laws or reason.   That is not what religion is.   Of course it matters an answer would prove that morals do come from religion. If you cant answer it proves morals do not come from religion. Its a simple question really, that i pose to you again.   I dont see how what your saying other than religion is different from mine.   No you can be agnostic and teach your children reason and natural laws.    If thats the case my question should be revelant, no?   Thats exactly what im saying. You are breaking down morality to its primitive form before reason is truly developed. So primitive moralityy is based mainly off of the natural order of things. As reason evolves, the natural laws dont, so does our morality.    What you are saying im saying but it seemed like you are trying to place an evolved reasoning into primitive morality. When i ellude to morality evolving it can only be one of the two elements as natural laws dont change.   How does adam and eve fit in?   Morality can be taught in other ways? Then we have no issue.   So animals ceased to sin before humans were created? Why wouldnt satan bring sin to the animals?   There is no option in surviving, it can be neither good or bad. Its the only option, if you are not surving you are dead, no option.     Its the way you choose to survive which becomes right and wrong. Here you are presented with options. The right and wrong ways to survive are shaped over time through human intelligence and evolving society.     If morals dont come from religion where are you saying they come from? Just curious   Thats the topic at hand lol   Can you name a moral act a believer can do a non believer cant?     If morals come from religion, there should be an act a person who doesnt learn religion(morals) cant do a religous can.   Thats what im after. If sin predates adam and eve how does this story fit into your religous views??   Ok, and your saying original sin didnt start with adam and eve as the bible says, sin existed since animals have?   Fair enough.   Then back to my first question.    When was that distintcion made between how we sin and a dog does is basically what im after?   Its a nessacary part of living, as natures laws teach us the path of least resistance. It is neither good or bad, the options you take to complete these nessacary survival steps become good and evil.     I have answered this question if you kindly look through the thread before you pose existing questions.   You have to be more specific. Self defense, etc     Can you name an action a believer can do a non believer cant? If a non believer is not taught morals though religion there should be an action a person who is taught religion can do a non taught person cant.    Can animals sin?   if adam and eve didnt exist neither did the serpent amoung them   How does that work?   My question is how does adam and eve fit in? If we evolved from animals and animals cant sin, where did original sin come from and how does adam and eve fit in?   Ok but that they were without sin at first that gives way to an orignal sin at some point.     If we evolved from animals where did we get the ability to sin?   Its neither good or bad its a way of life, its a nessacary part of surviving. There is no option, you eat because you are hungry. Good and bad can only come from options. The way you choose to survive becomes good and bad.     Are you avoiding my question?   I thought adam and eve where without sin. There choosing becoming original sin. If you believe in evolution where did this start? Do animals sin?   The meaning of morality is the action of meeting your nessacary needs. Thats morality. Good morals are those that cause least suffering. Bad morals are those that cause most suffering.     As we evolve and start living together, ie society, the good and bad evolve and consquently become more clearly defined.   Okay that does make sense. Its quite an interesting concept, thanks for your replies and bringing this to my attention.   As i attempt to answer your questions only fair to attempt mine.   I dont understand the question in context to my answers. It has that meaning, the system you defined it as is created due to avoiding needless suffering.   Im trying to understand, and i will investigate further, its quite interesting.     Thinking as a religous person, if God has set a moral guideline how does that become individually subjective?   No morality has meaning as we evolve it becomes more clear, and certain actions become unnacceptable in a society.     The morals of a caveman would be differnt of a man living in an evolved society. Again as we grow and our society evolves so does morality.    Name an action a believer can do a non believer cant.   No a non believer is not taught morals ftom religion, so there must be an act a person who is taught through religion can do that someone who isnt cant do. I ask it again?   This is an interesting concept. Can you elaborate further?   Where does the fall come into place?   Your first half of post is nonsensical.      To name an action is exactly the point of the post, if you cant name an action it becomes clear morals are not taught by religion.   Its part of being an animal. You are hungry you eat its a nessicity. As you take paths to how you eat, you are presented with options. The options that will lead to less suffering become good and vice versa. As humans grow and societies evolve these actions become evolved morally, with the actions to feed these nessacary needs it becomes clear what is right and wrong as society takes form.     Yes and that moral system is derived from avoiding suffering.   Np   Killing life doesnt apply to living life. Survival is an instinct, trying to survive without suffering completely is also an instinct. When you are hungry you eat to avoid starving.    If god is moral explain the flood, the promotion of human sacrifice, slavery,and all the other immoral acts commited in the bible?     Name a moral act a believer can do a non believer cant?   I have no idea, im assuming this is aimed at someone else.   Good and bad are derived from the instinct of avoiding suffering. As humans grow and socities evolve right and wrong are defined more clearly.       Name a moral action a believer can do a non believer cant.     IF morals are taught through religion, there should be an action a person never taught religion (morals), shouldnt be able to do a religious can   I think it's quite unreasonable to assume morals come from religion, even a Christian reading the bible can tell the immoral things that are happening throughout the bible. It can't be the grounds of morality, if itself isn't grounded.     Simply have to name a moral action a believer can do that a non believer could not do.    If you are not a creationist and believe evolution, how does Adam and Eve fit into your religion. If the Adam and Eve story is for interpretation not to be taken literally then where does original sin come from?     If you believe in creationism and Adam and Eve story literally, how does this fit together in your religious understanding of the two?     EDIT the point of this post is not to Offend but an attempt to understand   Is it worth reading? What did you think of it?    I want to start by I believe we made horrible mistakes once we entered Iraq. The biggest being the dissolution of the Iraq army and the laws that were passed to essentially keep them out, there were many many more but this is the biggest.    The invasion of Iraq was a good thing in these ways. Sadaam was a true representation of evil. All of his evils need not be explained one by one, but I think it's universally held he was evil and poison to the country he was ruling.     As far as WMD, bush had conflicting reports as to whether they were there or not. Even if the reports leaned in the favor he did not presently own, there was evidence he had been trying to obtain WMD. Should we wait till he had obtained such to invade where he would surely use his obtained WMD in war? He also has the history of using WMD in war. He also stated in his trial, he did give the illusion to having WMD because he was worried if he didn't and it was known Iran would invade. He also I believe in 1998, not sure this exact year, refused to cooperate with having people come into the country to examine if he had WMD or not something he agreed to do in the early 90's.    He was also giving diplomatic immunity to terrorist and war criminals. He might not have had direct ties to bin laden but was aiding other terrorist and war criminals in other ways. The war on terror was not just about bin laden but to all terrorist organizations.      To summarize, He wAs a terrible person to be in power, giving the illusion he had WMD by his own admission and history of being willing to use such, and aiding terrorist and war criminals. This was a good thing to strip him of his power. With that said we made many mistakes after the invasion. As far as setting up the governing body, dissolving the iraq army,etc. but as far as the decision to invade it was the right thing to do, and it lessened the places terror could operate in that part of the world. Also showing USA would not tolerate these many threats, not one or two, as other leaders have done,  but the many violations sadaam has committed will not be tolerated.

The argument I hear for proof of god is mainly in the things science can't explain. Something couldn't have come from nothing, dark matter, intelligent design, etc. This is nonsensical.    You are essentially issuing in the same behavior ancient civilizations did. They could not understand at the time the weather, the sun, the cosmos, etc so it had to be God. All of the scriptures are written by people who had no such knowledge of the things They claimed to be God, and their lack of knowledge bleeds through as science unlocks more and more.     Now this is not to say God exists or does not exist. This is not my debate but my debate is where people are putting God. I think it quite possible to believe in God and also believe that science will shed light on the places it is the dark. Hence this post. To me is not reasonable in a world where people don't believe in God,or who believe in a different God, that putting on a label on the unexplainable is God. It is logical to put your faith, so to speak, in that science will explain these things in time, and that your belief in God belongs else where.    Now I also want to clarify to do the the things my debate touches on is not wrong, or immoral, it is simply unreasonable, not logical. I know there are many things that can give credence to your personal experiences and the deep thing inside most people there is more to this world than us. And that the proof of God is not a thing that can be measured in scientific terms. But I disagree that the universe, or multiverse, and all it's contents cannot be explained by science, and it's not logical to put god here. Change my views  _____   *Hello, users of CMV!

On the other hand I donnot understand the argument that the hotel is represented just as evil as it is in the book(not to be confused with the hotel is not evil in the movie).    Kubrick makes intended changes to the books plot seemingly to down play the true evil of the hotel. Take for instance the different endings. In the book the hotel is destroyed, and the movie it's left standing. If the hotel is as evil in the book as it is in the movie, the hotel should have been destroyed.   Take the maze scene. Kubrick places this maze scene in where Danny is chased by the insane gone over the edge jack. Where as the book jack is possessed by the hotel and chases Danny through the halls, his voice and demeanor is extremely unfamiliar to Danny. Jack seemingly goes over the edge as opposed to being possessed by a the hotel.     Last example is the hedges. The hotel can control the hedges and bring them to life. As Danny's shine gets stronger and fuels the hotels power the hedges go from just moving their positions, to being able to attack the occupants. This is left out seemingly to downplay the hotels capabilities. That's as good place to start as any so Change my views. _____   *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Was she saying she was part of the secret society and had group sex there, or are the two unrelated?   First if you havent seen it, you should watch its informative and entertaining.    Curious to see how many people here agree with Ham? How many agree with Nye? How, on either side you're on, does this fit with your religous beliefs and was anything said that surprised you? Or change what you previously believed?   Mine is Pet semetary. The wendingo(i think thats right) lining the back story to the cemetary, just makes this plot brilliant imo.    Almost tempted to rule out The stand now but im interested in the why. So whats your favorite and why?   What director would you choose and what actors would you like to see?    Im unhappy with all movie adaptations ive seen so far and would be cool to see different scenarios of who could pull it off? Thanks ahead for your comments   I will start by I have struggled with this concept since it has been brought to my attention. I know this movie extremely well, better than I should, and have previously debated just about every scene. Not to say the this conclusion is right but to say I do know the film and the characters well.     My basic theory stems from, The movie constantly allures to what and how magic is done, which has nothing to do with 'real magic' but with deceit. That's what the machine is deceit.  Will give  a summary of my theory now, leaving out the beginning and end, and details as my post will be too long for any interest. I will elaborate on the beginning and end , and details once the discussion begins.    So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no "magic". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs "real magic" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work.     Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.    I will add a few of the questions about the machine working theory that I have, which can be answered by my theory. These questions could be preluded with "if the machine works"    What is the tank Caine and Angier are pushing during the ending scene? If if the last clone is in the morgue, and the tank had been broken to extract the clone what tank are they pushing?    Why store the clones? What not rid of them every night?   What is the air bubble at the end in the only visible tank.    How did Angier gain full control of both his legs while drowning? The movie goes through some length to show how damaged it is, why do this if it's not meant to be.a clue    If Borden sends angiers to tesla, it's his plan, why wait till he has  captured Fallon to give him Teslas name, why not give it to him when he gives Angier the diary?    I have more of my theory to share, and more question to ask those who disagree it this is already too long.

My case is for Leo. I feel Tom cruise is very similar in alot of his roles. Leo to me has taken more risk, is more convincing at different types of roles, and simply picks better movies. And the fact Scorsese works with Leo, amoung many other actors again and again and has worked with Cruise once is odd.     Again tell me who you like and Why?    EDIT: im more interested in your why then who   The lead singer and guitar player for the Wild hearts, Ginger, decided to release a solo album. Instead of dealing with the record company, he decided to set up a fundraiser deal. Where people interested in buying his record would send him money. I think the first 10,000 was like 50$ and the rest was 25$.      The first 10,000 recieved 20 songs then a vote was taken as to which 10 made it on to the record. The top ten made it. Once the songs were finalized the first 10,000 got both the official record and the record of the other 10, i believe in both cd and record format. The ensuing investors received the official record.     I just love this idea. Getting your chance to participate in the making of the record and taking all outside influence away, leaving the artist with complete freedom. Other bands have used this strategy, including Radiohead(not 100% this band).      REDDIT what are your thoughts? Do you love or hate it? Would you participate?   Ozzy and sharon have been fighting the surviving members of the randy rhodes era, over their rightful royalties. Bob daisley and lee kerslake have been trying to receive their fair share but are getting denied. They had ample share in writing the music and recording "Blizzard of Oz" and "Diary of a Madman", although they did not tour on these records.    Ozzy went so far as to remove their tracks and rerecord them when they were remastered. To stay consistent upon the release of the 2 albums box sets, Daisley offered up hours and hours of early takes, demos, and studio outtakes, Ozzy refused because Daisley wanted royalties instead of it being bought outright.     As a lifelong fan of Ozzy, i cannot forgive him for this greed, and i have just recently stumbled upon this. To think you cant even buy the orignal music from the randy rhode era is infuriating. Tell me what you think Reddit.     I dont have links but this can be found with a quick google search.   I have watched the film many times, close to twenty. It makes more sense that it doesnt work, really the only thing that makes sense imo. There are clues everywhere in the movie once you grasp the timeline and Angier and Bordens never ending deception (this includes angier's last attempt to fool borden at the very end).      I wont go into specifics here, but will debunk the theories presented in the discussion. Whether you agree or disagree completely let me know what you think.    EDIT: SPOILER ALERTS   My choice would be avatar. The special effects combined with a powerful story just hit the right notes for me. What is your Personal best of the last 10 years?

 I always wandered: I am not from America. Does this 499 include your sales tax? If not, how much do you end up paying,  say, in Houston?    Most people won't even stand where that car is in the picture.    I've got one for you. Maybe not original but at least never heard of it.   You know how Google Picasa and other softwares ask you to tell them what the name of a face is that the software recognises on your pics? It is linked to a contact in your phone. In case you save your contacts with full name they know the name of that person and their face (also tel no and possibly email,  bla bla bla). Now as soon as the software knows the name and possible waits for a verification from a different user they start tracking where ever that person was. Somebody is taking a picture of something with me in the background? Picasa saves geo data and tells Google where I was that day at that time. This way a map is created of where I went with evidence. Could be used to prove you haven't done this or that but it will only be used against you.    Op, please share how you took and edited the picture    Pacific Rim.  Everything about the movie sucks. Worst:  Acting  The fact that the monsters don't use their emp's straight away  That one of the jagers uses a boat instead of the awesome sword he apparently has   I down vote you for the second part of your post.

Two of the main characters, Jack and Daniel, have actually influenced me a lot. I still think that trying to be a bit of both will make the perfect human being. The two of them unite traditional values and open-mindedness perfectly. They are and forever will be my role models.

When we do such an estimation, does that include observable universe only or more than that. In case of the latter, how do we estimate?   Edit: sorry, my bad. I read universe, not galaxy.    Thank you!   I have 0% knowledge but I am willing to learn hard.   If you could help me get started I would be very grateful.    I went to a Nike outlet to buy some running shirts and shorts and saw that the Nike Hyperfeel were only 80 so I bought a pair. I ran in them today and I liked it.   By chance I walked past my usual shop and went in because I was curious what my usual salesman had to say about them.   Long story short. He said that: - Nike uses some of the worst foams in the industry which don't provide good support - He has a ton of customers that came into his shop because they have trouble with their achilles tendon and their knees after using any nike free run shoes.  - Even walking for long periods of time is bad for knees and achilles tendon. He said that if I run with them (I am quite heavy and mostly land on the back of my foot) I will have problems in the future with my hip and knees - They basically are a shit shoe that costs nothing to make (he said $2.50 but I am not sure if he was just saying a low number) and is being sold with a ridiculous profit margin thanks to Nike's marketing. - it has been developed in Germany at the Sporthochschule Koeln and that some people involved make their money with knee replacements - on top of all of that he does not sell Nike because for him it is a fact that they use child labour (however he does realise that this is a difficult discussion. Anyway it is his shop so it's his choice)  He was able to explain everything very well and I have to say that I believe him but I could not find anything online so I am curious where he gets this information.   What do you gusy think?   Why is that? What alternative is there that is better? Rotten tomatoes, where toy story 3 is the best movie of all time?    I really do   God I was scared when I saw I had a message but I thinks it's so good and nice. This is everything I wanted.. I showed her and she was so surprised. She doesn't know reddit and thought it would all be crap. Thank you so much.    I love how it is advertised. You will hear the music the way the artist intended.   http://pocketnow.com/2014/08/07/beats-dedicated-apple-online-store   What can I say. Unfortunately I do care. I am a slave of modern beauty ideals   Nope, no beach I'm afraid. That would be awesome (in general)   Yeah, sounds pretty amazing.       I just love Germany sometimes.   When is your flight?   20 o'clock.   Everybody understands.         NB looks a LOT cheaper than Nike.    I don't actually. And if I am honest, I don't even know what that is. Considering my wrist hurts right now, I guess I will be reading up on that tonight.   Thanks for the advice   Sorry, the sandals. I'm sure they are not because I guess people would not recommend them.    Yeah, I saw that just now. What the hell.   I guess I'll just keep using my running shoes then.    Thanks. I'll consider it.   They look difficult to run in if you ask me.    My GF made that same experience. If you need to get started with easier exercise I recommend this. It's the all time top post here. It is what I am doing and I really love it. I am sure the easiest exercises will be fine for anybody.   [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1vupz1/rbodyweightfitness_it_has_taken_me_quite_a_while/)    Hmm, I am done in about 1 hour - 1 hour 20 mins.  I run 5 mins, do   handstand 3 sets  push ups 3 sets  squats 3 set  pull ups 3 sets  leg raises 3 sets  vertical pulls 3 sets  then I run for 20 minutes and then stretch for 5.   I feel like 2 hours would kill me.    I prefer shoes. It does not have to be THAT inexpensive. I am also not a fan of blisters.   Any recommendation for some inexpensive shoes for this?   I hate horse girls.  Edit:  She will spend all his money on horses.   5' 8" 180 lbs. A mix of muscular and too much fat. Nothing ever fits. Any advice?          Louis Vuitton belt?  I would have not expected that from this guy...   Thank you for posting this. I wanted to ask you to share. How long did it actually take?   Haha!  Love it.    I want to live in Asia, North and South America and Australia for at least a year each. I think it must be so enriching to experience the differences and would surely make you more understanding.    I mean that parents fail to teach this and children who don't look so cool or don't have a smartphone seem to fall behind even if they are super nice people.    Old people (40+) like me, which is a massive advantage at work.    They invited you, so you can't be that bad of a candidate. They are testing you, play along.   Treat people based on how they behave, not how they look or what they have. This is becoming a problem.    And it is true   In the summer: White Wine Spritzer  I get a lot of shit from my mates...   Because they are confident. People always say this. From my point of view there is so much more to this:  - The woman you are talking about could be a dickhead too - Maybe the guy just looks like a douche but is actually nice and not at all a dick. I have met guys like that. But maybe they are confident and that's why you think they are, well, what you said above - I know lots of women who are not with the type of guy you are talking about even though they are fit. You are probably paying more attention to people who confirm your suspicion.  - Confidence makes really sexy and these guys have a lot of that.    Why do they always try to push boundaries?   Ask them something stupidly arrogant but at the same time make sure your question show that you do not actually understand yourself, like:  What is a prime number of 5?  See how she/he reacts.    I did and I hate myself for it.   Edit: Ah sorry, I am not married. It was/is my GF.    A friend of mine works as a flight attendant. After the flight she has to hold up a basket with tiny chocolates. So many people think they are so funny when they say:  "I'll take the whole basket!" whilst making a move for it and stopping just before they actually touch it.   Yes never knows how not to sound bored...   I am an expediter.   My boss loves to make jokes about his wife expediting him. It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooo lame   The article mentions real antisemitic happenings. However the "Zentralrat der Juden" in Germany is not differentiating. For them it is all them same it seems. Everybody who opposes Israel is an antisemit. They are calling for solidarity ([here](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/zentralrat-der-juden-fordert-mehr-solidaritaet-das-hier-ist-deutschland-2014-nicht-1938/10276918.html) in German) which is ridiculous.   Not that I am saying any jewish people anywhere in the world shuld feel unsafe because of the actions of the Israeli government. However the "Zentralrat der Juden" a powerful Jewish organisation is, like the Israeli government, immune to reason and accountability.     Ok, that is awful. I did not know about this.    Forget about the evil merchant. The Israeli government is currently killing children in Gaza as far as I know.   It is not the right way to go about it though. I do agree with that.    Well, same thing happened to Merkel being compared to Hitler. There are always some idiots. But I understand there is also some "well behaved" criticism that Israel does not want to accept.     http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2c8i8w/nato_bombed_5000_civilians_in_kosovo_just_because/  For example. I have read something similar in Der Spiegel.   The way I see it Israel is trying to shame people into being quite about what Israel is doing to the people living in Gaza.   Just because the people in Israel who commit these crimes are Jewish does not mean that people who oppose them are being antisemitic.      I really like Marc O'Polo ()  http://www.marc-o-polo.de/  It's kind of hard to get outside of Germany but the quality is amazing and the stuff looks brillian.    When you post, please also post webaddress of online shops and price =cheap (H M)  = not so cheap (Nike) = really not cheap at all (Ralph Lauren)  = expensive (you know, the stuff nobody buys)  I would love to get to know some cool brand not everybody knows.     Was it really? I just ignored it because I was a bit annoyed with the fact it does not end.    Installed it, love it!  Thanks!   I am using an HTC One M7 with SentinelRom 6.0. It is based on CM11. Do you guys know how I can integrate all my facebook contacts and calendars?  I would really appreciate some help.    I have been doing bodyweight fitness for a short while now and I really like it. I feel good because I am doing something to improve my body. I cannot yet see a big difference but the fact that I am working out regularly makes a big difference to my state of mind. However, there is a downside. Well, two actually.  1. My thighs have become bigger and now my suits do not fit me anymore. I can almost not wear my trousers anymore when I have my phone and wallet in my pockets.   2. I am not sure if I am imagining this, but because there is less space available between my thighs and also in my trousers, my testicles started hurting.   Has anybody had a similar experience?  Any suggestions how to deal with it?   BTW second problem is much worse than number 1.    Hi,  I am trying to use the kernel for the SentinelRom 6.0 provided by the dev  https://github.com/CyanogenMod-11/android_kernel_htc_m7  But I do not know how. I understand that you need the zip and need to flash it in the recovery. I downloaded the zip on that page (right side of the screen) but it always says failed, when I try to flash it.   Do you guys know how to do it?  Many thanks in advance.    I am asking here because I use Android and would like to nw if there is any link.             I would like to find a subreddit, where people upload pictures they took in RAW format for other people to edit.   I would also like to upload my pictures to see what other people can do with it.  I would appreciate your help.      I find imdb.com incredibly useful to get information about movies I might want to watch and also I like to idea of keeping a record of what I have watched and how I liked the movie right after I watched it.   I would love to know if there is anything similar.          Like said I got it as a present which is why I am reading it.   I saw that it has 7000 reviews on amazon.co.uk with 4.5 stars average which I think means that it is a very popular book. Also I heard lots of people talk about it.   I have read the first 80 pages and really struggle to keep reading. The reasons are:  - The life of the protagonist seems super unrealistic. I read it and think that even though I know it's fiction there is no way I can believe this story or identify myself with it.  - The jokes he makes seem calculated and also it seems like it's not genuine. It seems like he has taken the kind of humour from somebody else because it was successful. - Last but not least I read, that he wote a second book which follows the exact same scematic as this one. I dislike that because it lacks heart.   What do you gusy think? Shall I keep reading?         Hey guys,   I have started bodyweight fitness but would like to learn a bit more about the results that I can expect if I am diligent.   My primary goal is not to gain strength for the sake of it. I would say that I don't lack strength because I have always been working out. I am a little too fat though and I find that I cannot move the way I would like to because of it.  My goal is to get rid of some of my fat and get lean. I do not actually want to get a lot bigger because I have very wide shoulders as it is and I am quite short. I have started the routine that is suggested in one of the top posts (the one that has a picture of all the different progressions in it. I was able to star pretty much everything in the middle.  I would love to know if other people had the same goal and if they succeeded.  Oh, and I want to be able to do one armed push ups, of course. ;)  I'd appreciate any feedback. Progression picks always good         I was just thinking, if we were to colonize for example Mars, could we actually fly planes there?                              I really like to see people's handwriting. I have seen some really beautiful ones and it always amazes me. [Here](http://imgur.com/m2545wF) is mine FYI.  To show it off please write the following sentence:  *The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog*  Apparently it contains every letter of the alphabet. I did not bother to check...   I moved to London 2 years ago and have been working quite a lot.   I would like to get back to making music. Anybody interested? I produce hip hop and r b. I would love to meet singers or writers.   Let me know if you're interested.   Maybe you can meet somebody else here who in interested in your type of music too.    So, I have been reading some books and saw one video trying to explain 11 dimensions. Then I had a though. I am really not good at explaining it but I'll try my best.  Maybe the universe is not actually endless, it is just a closed loop. Imagine somebody who is only able to perceive 1 dimension. his world looks like this ------------ . He can move left and right. If you put both ends of his world together you get a circle. Now if the person would walk left (or right) for long enough he would realise he is living on a cirlce because he will get back to the start. Now if the circle is bigger than the person can travel in a lifetime, he will never get back to the start and will therefore think his universe in endless.   If you apply the same to a 2D world the person can walk left, right, up and down. Again, his world might seem endless to him, but in fact it might just be a sphere too big for him to travel across in one lifetime.   Now what if that is the same with our universe? Maybe it is actually folded in such a way that whichever direction you traveled you would eventually get back to Earth. Because we live in it and cannot perceive the next dimension up, our minds cannot picture such a folded 3D object but that doesn't mean its not possible.   For me this would be much easier to understand that to grasp infinity.  I hope I explained myself good enough for people to understand.   TL;DR: Universe is not actually infinite, just a folded 3D onject (similar to a circle in 1D and a sphere in 2D). We will just never find out because it is too big for us to travel.   What do you think?                                             Religious people might object, but as I see it, there is no universal authority that determines "If you do this, then this should happen to you."    I think it would be interesting to know: How much do people earn on average (maybe you can estimate) How much rent do you pay (is that in the expensive or cheap part of town?) How much does it cost to go out?   I would like to know what features you like that your system does not have, but the other one does.                      Even taking into consideration that 2D maps are not accurately showing the world and that Earth is not a perfect sphere, I do not understand why a plane would fly over the sea north of Russia to get from London to Tokyo (for example). Please, can somebody explain?  	120

 GISD: [Pyrus calleryana (tree)](http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1389 fr=1 sts=sss lang=EN)  [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callery_Pear)  [image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Bradford_9288.JPG)  I have observed this up close, and on a macro-environmental scale.  Our driveway has ten of these trees lining it, in northern MD (my father refuses to cut them down, so we killed saplings). The seedlings are thick, robust, and fill in unmowed and untilled ground. The young tree is thorny and sturdy. Maximum size will never be out of hand, as Callery Pears rarely grow past 30ft and the trunk will rarely pass 1.25ft diameter. Each year generates a great deal of seeds, enough to plant an acre at full maturity. I rarely see them eaten, though, so I think spread is mostly accidental and by treefall.  As with many large invasive species, these trees were prized for beautification qualities and introduced commercially.  The unmowed right-of-ways of Maryland are chock full of Callery Pears. Growing up in MD, I have noticed the spread of wild invasive growth from Montgomery County, through Howard and Baltimore Counties, and into Frederick and Carroll Counties. I have seen a right-of-way filled up to a 12ft wall of thorns in less than four years.  Easy to girdle, pull up, and kill in general. Even easy to find, because they flower brilliant white and before any other tree on the East Coast (I think)! The problem/focus with extermination lies with gaining the cooperation of nurseries, developers, and homeowners to remove existing trees and remove them from stock. I don't believe in bans, all that is needed is awareness and the appropriate creation of externality precedent. That means if you plant a new tree or refuse to cut an existing one down, you can be brought to court for restitution per seedling on another person's property (including the state right-of-ways).  The state of MD is not doing anything, that I know of. I have considered calling the DNR to ask what's up, but have not. I just found this sub from /r/permaculture and wanted to post. Any more info would be helpful, especially as to efforts and the status of other affected areas.  edit: Good news! kinda. Bad news first. We cut down a big white pine last year at the end of a row. This year a thousand pears are sprouting in it's shadow. Good news second. My dad conceded we probably should have cut those mature pears lining our driveway down - and we will.                                 http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/25356747/drug-debate-will-punishing-women-who-take-drugs-while-pregnant-help-hurt-or-both  Will the women doing this be feeling the pain from paying any medical bills for premature births or disorders? Making penalties explicit for harming the unborn will increase demand for abortions before it ushers responsibility for actions into the minds of men and women engaging in intercourse.  Is it a worse thing to place poor mothers in jail and string newborns and maybe siblings into state care? Possibly. And I don't want to give the state the power to do so, because it will undoubtedly be unjustly dealt to some poor family.  If affected women cannot free themselves from a drug addiction, why can we expect them to disengage from one of the more basic and powerful temptations? This law does not improve anything. Might doesn't make right in treating moral laxity.         Original title: [A traditional Indian wrestler smears dirt on himself during a practice session in Calcutta.](http://i.imgur.com/3nQAdKC.jpg)                           I say put your money where your mouth is, personally.  Sometimes putting your mouth somewhere is good enough, but usually not.  Just like charity, if you want something done you are better off doing it yourself (or as close to that as possible).  Recently, the Obama administration formed ties in Syria with groups classified as terrorists just across some imaginary lines in the sand. The homework was done, and the report was on the desk, but they made a decision well removed from what any of us would see as rational. We agree a state should not meddle abroad.  I think if an an-cap decided to do something it could be summed up like this:  * Individuals would know of the intentions of foreigners like we would know of any other person's through reputation and trusted sources.  * Individuals would support them like we would support anyone else. Personal financial support. Personal physical support. Organized financial support. Organized physical support. (this includes red-cross type groups, non-violent protest groups, violent protest groups, and militias/privateers/private armies)  If there isn't a state to prevent militias (etc.) from forming. Then there is no state to prevent militias (etc.) or individuals from going abroad.  So there are two questions.  1. How would you support a cause such as the Ukrainian riots, if at all, and how would you know whom to help?  2. Does that help ever introduce externalities upon your neighbors and region? (esp. in the case of organized physical support - militias, etc.)      I had a thought while reading this:   [The current treasurer under Tony Abbott is called Joe Hockey, a giant douche who is either completely incompetent or a liar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1y7vu1/news_corps_882m_blew_the_australian_budget_the/cfi779x?context=1)  Is it fair to say that it is impossible for a human to be competent at any secretary-level position (or higher) in a modern world government?

[This is super-speed video of the battle.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2zWWg7-Y6o)  When I ask"would this space battle ever happen," I mean to ask that in any case. EVE Online has a few special considerations which are unique and give reason to a few things. I only played a 14-day trial so not everything here may be perfect.  * No permadeath. Everyone is playing a person that is basically immortal and lives through clones. Every time your clone dies, the memories are all saved in your original so they pop out a new one and off you go.  * Sectors have security levels. Super-mega governments/civilizations enforce different levels of security in the different sectors. Some sectors are outside any NPC security. There is fighting in between these that players participate in, but there are also fights between player alliances - which this is.   This battle, B-R5RB, was for player alliance control of a station located somewhere else. Two player alliances agreed to fight out control in this 0 security sector so no civilization would interfere - thus limiting or entirely removing NPC combatants and any consequences fighting in a secure sector have.  * All armaments are automatic. You pick a target for your ship or individual turrets/lasers/drones/missile racks and pilot the ship so the arms have the target in range of fire.  * Warp navigation. You navigate by engines inside sectors and between sectors by warp. Traveling between sectors is kind of like taking a train. No stops in between and not all sectors connect to every other sector. Some ships (notably the biggest ones) can group warp ships around them to arrive at the same time, in the same place.  Certainly all of these are imaginable, and all are futuristic - but are they realistic? Is the result, seen in the video, realistic?

(edited to add quote)  Thoughts? Better destination ideas?                  Is this concept found already in any works?  I thought it up last night and am not well read, yet. Plenty of videos and thought under my lid, but I can't read at work.  In any case, this certainly explains how people see this thing called "government" which belongs to "everybody." With no owner (a government could only be "owned" by a sort of autocrat - not the worst thing if he's wise, but all men are fallible and nobody is fit to "rule" especially not in a permanent sense), each person who understands the the common nature of government will attempt to get the most profit out of it, ASAP. The profit comes at the expense of other's liberty - obviously abhorrent to us. But any effort to use and not dismantle this power structure, each user of the government indicates his rejection or ignorance of personal liberty. The former should be ashamed and the second admonished.   [Found this story](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/12/the-vast-majority-of-raw-data-from-old-scientific-studies-may-now-be-missing/#.UrPOyrx5sRg.reddit) on /r/PhilosophyofScience  Not a pure science question, but certainly up for discussion.   When a group of researchers tried to email the authors of 516 biological studies published between 1991 and 2011 and ask for the raw data, they were dismayed to find that more 90 percent of the oldest data (from papers written more than 20 years ago) were inaccessible. In total, even including papers published as recently as 2011, they were only able to track down the data for 23 percent.   Whats the solution? Some journals... have adopted policies that require authors to submit raw data along with their papers, allowing the journal itself to archive the data in perpetuity. Although journals, like people, are susceptible to changing email addresses and technological obsolescence, these problems can be much more easily managed at the institutional scale.  So where is your raw data?      Corn pudding is a good dish; easy to make. With a whole stick of butter it tastes pretty darn good. Bachelors! This takes a single dish to cook and refrigerates well in portions.  EDIT: [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/9HOpp)  *Time:* Leave butter out til soft. Prep takes ten minutes. Cooking takes an hour. Serve immediately.  *Recipe:*  * **1** [can whole corn (drain the liquid before using)](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Golden-Sweet-Whole-Kernel-Corn-15.25-Oz/10315427)  * **1** [can creamed corn](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Cream-Style-Sweet-Corn-14.75-oz/10448549)  * [**1** box corn muffin mix](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Jiffy-Corn-Muffin-Mix-8.5-Oz/10448133)  * **4** eggs  * **1/2** cup butter (1 standard American stick, I believe)  * **1/2** cup sour cream  Leave the butter out to soften on the counter, covered or in the wax wrap. This should be done long enough in advance to make sure it is pliable. Maybe a few hours. (If you don't do this, you won't be able to mix the butter in fully. Absolutely not a problem, the butter will melt and get in there just fine - but getting it to mix is the proper way.) Some people zap the butter in a microwave at the last second. If that is you plan, might I recommend placing the butter in the casserole dish?   * Combine the ingredients in a 2 quart casserole dish (oven-safe dish). We us a round dish as high as it is wide. If your dish is glass, you can watch the butter bubble towards the end. I add the wet ingredients first and make sure they are well mixed, then the corn muffin mix, and then the butter.  * Bake at 350 degrees (ovens in US are in Fahrenheit) for 55-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.  * Serve hot, immediately is fine.  We have this every year at thanksgiving. I had to make it this year because everyone else was too busy with our 8 other vegetables and two turkeys. And candied yams. That means it was in the oven for 45 minutes too low, and then 30 minutes too high because other dishes were more important. Last year the sour cream stayed in small clumps and was not enough to make me not eat this. My grandmother was too busy and did not mix thoroughly. I call it invincible because it is very hard to mess up, especially to an inedible state.  *Original accompanying newspaper clipping from my New Jersey Grandmother's house:*   Corn Pudding   (ingredients)   Combine all ingredients in a 2-quart casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees (F) for 55-60 minutes or until a knife comes out clean.   Ruth T Nadolny of Hamilton says her family came upon this Corn Pudding recipe from an unexpected source.     "Years ago my daughter Linda Burch took ka bus trip to Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay with her grandmother. When dining, they were served corn pudding, which they thought was delicious. My daughter ventured to ask for the recipe and, surprisingly, they gave it to her. It has been a family favorite for many years now."  I can say the same for my family, we enjoy this immensely next to our Thanksgiving celery salad, brussel sprouts, and succotash. Funnily enough the recipe came full circle when I got it from my grandmother, because I live in Maryland.   Bill Nye's [open letter to Obama](http://youtu.be/XkWetbQHWlk) to divert more of NASA's budget to the Planetary Science Division needs this reply:  Showing that government is an able player in solving new, previously unseen, problems extends the delusion that government can centrally plan any part of human life more effectively than an individual or voluntary association.  I think NASA has done some wonderful work and solved some amazing problems with ingenious solutions, but private industry has begun to invest in space exploration. Private industry has invested in space sciences since the first communications satellites.  Discussion: How do we prevent a tragedy of the commons on the Moon? On Mars?

My field is drafting/modelling - not coding. This service will help designers and companies share, render, and advertise their built environments in a realistic city setting. So far, I have narrowed possibilities for creating the city to Unity3D with C#.  The digital product I require needs basic realistic graphics, an update-able city-sized map, and multi-platform availability (for read-only interaction)  The city buildings might be procedurally rendered, I think its called, where the buildings are all distributed by an algorithm, and seed numbers can be saved to keep the layout the same.  I need to know if creating this product is feasible with Unity3D. Tell me what other info you need to give me an answer. **Even if you cannot give me the answer yourself, expanding the criteria I need to gather is important.** Suggesting other communities to ask in is also a big help.

This issue may only apply to US residents.  As far as I can tell: American hospitals subscribe to GPOs to keep prices low. There are less than ten companies making 80% of US supply on vintage production lines. The US bars import of foreign supplies for use in health care (?). The FDA found real problems with the US products and told producers to shut down lines to fix the problems. A shortage ensued because no producer knows the capabilities of any other and no hospital knows how much every other hospital has. Nobody knows when more will be available. Nobody wants to tell anybody else about the problem for fear of public reprisal.  We can talk politics elsewhere, but I thought these questions should be addressed before a problem arises. These are questions that may appear if both Soylent and the shortage get press coverage at the same time, and may be sensational or blunt. I encourage you to share any other ideas and questions!  * Are the short chemicals and providers the same as the ones used for the Soylent formula?  * Can Americans acquire and use foreign products?  * Does buying supply kill babies? (sensational *and* blunt)  * Does increasing demand out of health care help incentivize producers to increase production more rapidly and modernize production?

I am looking to ta talk to a developer with unity3d experience. Want to meet to talk about possible digital product.  Know anyone?    I am not gamedev of any sort, but have an product idea and need to know if it will work - this will help me work on the business proposal for the service which would use the product. Thanks for helping.  This product is a medium sized city filled with default buildings, rendered in realism, in which users can submit buildings to be replaced with personally made models. It should be accessible on a web browser without installing an application to the computer and be accessible through a mobile application. In the best case, a link in a webpage or email can send you to a specific address in the city. The focus is on the models, not interaction. In this way, it would resemble a changeable Epic Citadel demo on a city-wide scale.  Do you expect this will be possible with UE4? Will the map be too large, and loading times too great? This isn't procedurally generated.  It looks like my only other option for would be Webgl... and it is a bit primordial. But please enlighten me to my other options; none I remember is powerful enough for the level of graphics I need.  **tl;dr** What if I made an epic city (think looks like epic citadel), where you could put your buildings in, then everyone could go look at them on mobile and in-browser. Could I do it on UE4?      My experience is in CAD drafting and architectural design. I have an idea for an online service which revolves around a digital product.

It should be accessible from as many devices as possible, with mobile being a choice possibility. What I need to know is if any game engines out there would work, or if it needs a fresh engine? Unreal engine 4 is cross platform and powerful, but I need to be able to direct people to distinct locations from a link outside the application.  Is this where to start ?

 First off, I'm the representative for the CoS on this sub.    You're asking some leading questions here. What do you consider "active"? What do you the expect the Church of Satan to do for you? The Church of Satan is an organization of individuals, all of whom share a base common ground on the acceptance of Satanism and works of LaVey, but beyond that our members vary in political, philosophical, and personal interests. For the Church of Satan to act as a group in many cases is illogical and counter productive towards our members. Instead, the Church of Satan will promote the individual activities of individual members so long as it has it is in agreement with Satanism.     The goals of the Church of Satan are to maintain the works of LaVey, to promote the activities of publicly open Satanists who affiliate with the Church of Satan and apply Satanism to the real world, and to push for the Pentagonal Revisionism. These are the only political/social goals for the COS as a group. For details on this, see LaVey's article: http://www.churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php    Here is Magistra Blanche Barton's update on the program: http://www.churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php     Speaking of Barton, she just did presentation on the history of the Church of Satan and its role in secularism as part of a larger forum on the history of secular humanism in San Diego. This was 3 weeks ago.    The Church of Satan is pragmatic and realistic. We know that certain goals cannot be attained by waving a Sigil of Baphomet banner. You have to get into the system and work it from the inside, and we have many members doing just this. In certain situations we will work with other organizations openly, like we have with the Center for Inquiry.     I'm often referred to public rituals as an indicator for "activity". LaVey publicized Church of Satan rituals in the early days (late 60's, early 70's), but then locked the doors and did not perform any public rituals for the rest of his life. Since LaVey's passing there have been a handful of public Satanic rituals, including the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass at the Center for Inquiry, and a public celebration of Dashwood and the Hellfire Club at the Hellfire Caves in Southeast England. Keep in mind, a "Satanic ritual" does not need to be a group of robed men surrounding an altar. The goal of Satanic ritual is to cause change in the real world, and this can be done through a powerful speech or a moving musical performance. Many of our members have preferred this method, and we're out there more and more.    About the fee: Satanists are material, pragmatic, and carnal. We do not believe in selling souls and empty blessings. We will not fool you into thinking we're a charity and that our time is without value. Support is material, and most easily represented in the form of monetary funds. What is done with this? By and large it's to cover administrative expenses, costs of media representation, legal expenses, and various technical expenses. And that's after we paid the taxes, which we believe all religious organizations should do. I've spent time with the Church of Satan's High Priest and Priestess and there is A LOT that needs to get done on a day-to-day basis. When a couple of idiots kill someone in the name of Satan and the media catches wind of it, guess who gets called? Yes, we have the FBI and local police on speed dial. This takes time, effort, and money. And like you say, it's not a whole lot of it for a lifetime membership. I just spent this much buying records today. What are you going to get out your membership? Nothing if you sit around waiting for something to be handed to you. Do you want to work with other Satanists who may share common interests or real world goals? I know many members who've done just that, professionally, artistically, and academically. It's up to you to decide how much you want to be active or inactive. We have a number of members who tipped their hat and go along their way, applying Satanism in their activities without declaring themselves as Satanists.    Charles Manson said he was the second coming of Christ. People say a lot of things, especially people who aren't chemically balanced.    Just because the media reports something as "Satanic" doesn't make it so. The kid was obviously a nutcase, enough said. Nothing to do with Satanism at all. There is no such thing as selling your soul to anything. If ANYONE believes otherwise they are delusuonal and have no rational, philosophical, or metaphysical ground to stand on. Period.      1. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of "indulgence" if you equate it to hedonism. What's wrong with being at peace and wanting to relax? As LaVey recalls of Catism, "He who sleeps the day away, lives to sleep another day".    2. Satanists except themselves for who they are. If they feel that their potential is not fully realized, they may work towards achieving that, so far as it's fun. Happiness and being content with oneself is true Satanism.    3. The Satanic Bible is bombastic, it's meant to trigger instinctual reactions. These can be either positive and or negative. LaVey even described it as a necessary style for the time. He was inspired by the philosophy of Voltaire, who believed small, concise but powerful tracts would inspire revolutions. The Satanic Bible is bedrock, foundation, upon which further study is necessary. Some call this Deep Satanism, and the Church of Satan encourages those who wish to further the philosophy of Satanism to study Western philosophy, religion, anthropology, the natural sciences, and history. Was "turn the other cheek" an aggressive taunt for the Romans? Maybe, but that was not the context in which Jesus taught. See his Beatitudes.    4. Satanism rejects self-deception. Satanism is a religion. Not all religions are simply self-deception. Ask yourself, how big of a role did Christianity play in maintaining slavery and discrimination in comparison with how it helped? I would argue that such movements had much more to do with economic outcomes than spiritualism (see The Economics of the Civil Rights Revolution by Gavin Wright, Stanford University)    5. "I feel Satanism has become stagnant over the years since Dr. LaVey's death." Huh? As someone who's been involved in Satanism and the activities of the Church of Satan since the late 90's I can't understand how people continue to proclaim this. Major gatherings? Which major gatherings? What do you consider major? What do you define as "stagnant" or "active"? Performing public rituals? More public rituals have been performed in the past 6 years than in the last 20 of LaVey's life. I promoted an event here on this sub for a musical event in NYC that featured a number of Satanists, that was heavily attended by the Church of Satan, and it sold out the venue. And if you grasped the most basic fundamentals of Satanism you would have caught on what was presented on stage, and many have. So either you're looking in the wrong places or you willfully have your head in the sand.   I also have no interest in a flame war, but I will not leave sloppy logic unchallenged. There are fundamental first principles we will disagree on and I do not hide these biases, but they are clearly defined. I ask for the same from others who usually retort with "don't tell me what to do!" or "occult mysteries".    Protestants call themselves protestants, and would say Catholics are improper Christians at best, and they often argue that Catholics are not Christians at all. In fact, both parties call each other satanic.    "The term was used to describe a certain set of beliefs for a very long time."    By who? As far as I can tell, the terms "satanism" and "satanic" were used by the Abrahamic religions as a derogatory term, or by Abrahamic heretics who chose to worship for the "other side" but always recognized and operated under Abrahamic cosmology, and very often reverting to standard dogma.   They are being theologically (according to their own "believed" mythologies) and philosophically (according to rational metaphysics) inconsistent. And that's being polite about it.   And this is why devil worship should be vehemently rebuked.             The last symbol goes by various names, the Brimstone Cross, Leviathan Cross, etc. It's based on the alchemical symbol for sulfur/brimstone, which comes from volcanos and hot springs, giving connotations of hellfire. In rituals it can used as a phallic symbol, or a symbol of fire and strength. The Brimstone Sigil is used by High Priest Peter Gilmore and is featured on limited edition of the [Satanic Scriptures](http://www.satanicscriptures.com/).   Funny how many Westerners who push the Buddhist idea of "love your enemy" come from pampered backgrounds. A fluffy ideal that has no place in the history of man, today or sixteen hundred years ago. Especially among Buddhists, who's very existence in many instances depended on hating your enemies. Unless you can say you love your enemies in your heart as you spear them.    http://world.time.com/2013/04/23/burma-accused-of-ethnic-cleansing-for-rohingya-violence/     http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22356306   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_violence      This philosophy is suicidal. And that's not bashing it, this is exactly what it is. Let's not forget Gandhi. "Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love." Who would tell the Jews that suicide is more heroic than fighting for your life: "But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs."     There are also a number of rituals in [High Priest Peter Gilmore's book The Satanic Scriptures](http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Scriptures-Peter-H-Gilmore/dp/0976403595/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7850525-6432757?ie=UTF8 s=books qid=1182438419 sr=8-1/churchofsatan).   And one more thing, there is no Satanic community.   The "Marriage to the Beast" is some bullshit spewed by David Icke and fanatical Christians. There is no such ritual in actual Satanism.      If you want to see what a real Satanic ritual looks like take a look at this video of the Church of Satan's 6/6/6 event.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM      There aren't many "blogs" covering Satanism as defined by the Church of Satan. Most of the writers in our organization focus on books, magazines, and journalism that's not explicitly "Satanic". For example, Kevin Slaughter's [Underworld Amusements](http://www.underworldamusements.net/) publishes a number of books, including High Priest Gilmore's Satanic Scriptures. He also produces a number of video interviews and features.    Adam Campbell interviewing Peter H. Gilmore   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkmuV5R_O6g    Peter H.

He also has guest hosts (also CoS members or affiliates) who run different segments on specific topics or interests.

Stephen O'Malley and Z'ev - Magistral is my favorite SUNN/SOMA related project     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_Fb_83KGI         Exactly.   From "Mirror, Mirror"   "Instead, in publicly funded forums we support secular mementoes of the legacy of those who struggled to build this nation, not a plethora of conflicting belief systems. Individual Satanists also support the worthy efforts of groups such as the ACLU to combat religious encroachment on public grounds. I suspect other secularists are doing the same."    How about a monument to the secularism of the founding fathers, or a monument declaring the separation of Church and State? Whatever the case may be, it should not be played out to make Satanism (and Satanists) look like a joke.             Favorite proper Sunn album would be  Void. But favorite SOMA related release would have to be the Stephen O'Malley   Z'EV - Magistral album.            When LaVey used the term "Psychic Vampire" he was not talking about anyone with mystical or magic(k)al powers. He was referring to what /u/magicnerd212 is describing. Another way a Psychic Vampire gets their hooks in you is via gifting. They hand you an unwanted or unexpected gift and then in turn expect a life-time of loyalty and free entry into your life. Beware.     There are other uses of the term "Psychic Vampire" by various occultists and mystics, these are not the same thing.    And they didn't actually "invoice" the government, Cevin Key was explaining the concept of the "Weapon" title and their plan to make the image of the invoice their cover art. That fell through and didn't happen.   http://www.liisaladouceur.com/blog/ogre-of-skinny-puppy-on-guantanamo-torture-and-music-as-a-weapon/     "The project was about going as far as we could, then to present to the US government, or whoever we could find that was responsible for torturing people with our music, an actual invoice for what they owe us for using our music.  We would make the cover art the invoice. The idea of a free society to me, is not one that tortures people. I cant live with that, and not call it out."   I was invited to attend but couldn't make it. I got the video from Richard Devine's Twitter Feed: https://twitter.com/RichardDevine    Some more photos and video clips can be found here:   https://twitter.com/makenoisemusic   https://twitter.com/droidbehavior   https://twitter.com/trashaudio   http://shop.underworldamusements.net/product/anathema-litanies-of-negation    "But lacking humor and perspective, lacking the satanic instinct, you stick to your levels and straight lines, squat there in the morass of your beatified illusions; and it is well for you thus, you mud-moles - bait that you are on the hooks of my venomous pride!"         It's a podcast episode for the show Vox Satanae. If you scroll down you can play the episode in your browser or download the MP3.    You can get more episodes or subscribe to the show on iTunes here:   http://www.radiofreesatan.com/blog/category/voxsatanae/     "Vox Satanae (Voice of Satan) presents classical music with an emphasis on vocal music from its inception through the present in all of its forms. Each show contains a variety of music in the areas of chant, choral, opera, song, theater, film, and instrumental for your listening enjoyment."            LaVey was optimistic about the general population embracing Satanism in the early years of the Church of Satan. He was right in that faith in Christianity was in decline, but instead of liberation, the masses sought another master, the television. You can see his growing disappointment and misanthropy through his later writings.    Most humans will seek external validation, especially in the ethereal. Even some misguided would-be Satanists think LaVey should be a personality to worship. I believe in every society there will be rare individuals who have the Satanic element in their bones.    Good job giving her the attention she wanted.         I don't need a dog right now. I don't need a dog right now... Augh! So tempted to go out and get a frenchie!      Great collection! I like the big guy on the top left.       Dawn of War 2 at the peak of its popularity. Intense, micro heavy combat with replays that looked like cinematic battles.      "Because the groups vary widely in their understanding of Satanism, it is quite impossible to examine them all. My impression is that most may be sole practitioners or even small groups of less than ten, probably active solely on the Internet, while a small amount of other groups have begun to create firmer ideologies, assemble offline, construct hierarchies, and increase membership. Scholars have not extensively studied most of the above apart from Internet presence and textual analysis of available literature; hard statistical data about these groups as a lived religion is absent."    See the paper for the numbers that back up the author's impressions.   What's a Satanist without a sense of humor? Glad to oblige.   This quote summarizes the points I'm making: "As apparent above, when Satanism moves beyond its initial time and place, it adjusts to new particulars. Diaspora Satanism now has multiple factions, a variety of selfunderstandings, and degrees of compatibility or hostility with the Church of Satan/LaVey. Schismatic groups are now reinterpreting Satanism to such an extent that scholars are forced to consider that Satanism is now an inappropriate term when discussing groups or ideologies that have moved beyond Satanism."   Who had a semantic/etymological argument? The only one I see is "When I speak of theistic satanism I speak directly of the people and religions who were branded as satanic since the early days of christianity." I responded with a very clear example of why that's faulty.   Want a historgraphic study of Modern Satanism? Here you go. Sorry but a 121 Graduate Thesis is a little hard to summarize in a Reddit comment (121 pages is the summary of the research).  http://www.academia.edu/2540808/2012._Satanists_and_Scholars_A_Historiographic_Overview_and_Critique_of_Scholarship_on_Religious_Satanism_Masters_Thesis_Dept._of_Religion_Concordia_University   Those were based on what I've encountered, so yeah I'd say it's pretty accurate. Does that extrapolate to the general population? Probably not, I think there are whole lot more who are mentally handicap.      "When I speak of theistic satanism I speak directly of the people and religions who were branded as satanic since the early days of christianity."    That's ridiculous. Protestants and Zoroastrians were branded as satanic by the Catholic Church. By your logic Protestants would be the largest Satanic group in the world!    "The main issue I have is people blindly ignoring the very real existence of other subsets of believers who have been considering themselves Satanist long before CoS existed."      The issue here is that, by and large, most historical "Satanists" were actually heretical Christians, or were labeled as "satanic" by various Christian/Jewish/Muslim groups as a way of ostracizing and condemning political/religion enemies (see The Knights Templar).    Were there Satanists before the existence of the CoS? Most certainly! We would consider them "Defacto Satanists". Many would not have considered themselves Satanists because the idea of Satanism did not exist then. I'd use Benjamin De Casseres or H.L Mencken as examples. In our studies we've come across a small handful of Satanists who might be considered spiritual or theistic before LaVey (a few that LaVey knew personally), but they had little to no followings. LaVey looked around, had an extensive library and international contacts, he sought out "Satanists", and was very disappointed with what turned up. He documents this in writing and names individuals he came across.    "Not sure why people seem to think those are the only sorts of people who fall into that theistic realm."    Because that's what you see in the real world. I've been across the United States, Canada, and Europe and 95% of the time I've ran into "theists" or "spiritual" Satanists they're goth kids or metal heads who are trying way too hard to be evil and spooky. Then 4% are literally mentally handicap. The rest are heretical Christians or Muslims, and ex. Church of Satan people who started seeing "visions" when things didn't go their way.   You hit on various issues I have with what you consider "theistic satanism".      1. "Being exposed to much of the Satanism communities myself over my lifetime". What does that mean? Online communities? Those are a dime a dozen, mostly filled with metal heads who think worshiping "Satan" is cool and makes them look evil. No theology involved, and if so, spotty at best.      2. "Many of which stem from ancient forms of paganism that predate the existence of christianity or judaism." If this "theism" predates Judeo/Christianity, then it certainly predates the Abrahamic Satan, and therefore why in the world is it referred to as satanism?    I'll cut people at the pass here who would then say "well, if you don't believe in Satan then why does the COS call themselves Satanists?" Anton LaVey's philosophy is pragmatic, rational, and not based on any theistic spiritualism, instead based on the *Hebrew term*, along with various psychological and sociological insight, and with an open mind to the unknown. Since we do not fool ourselves into believing in any conscious Gods that created man, we have the intellectual freedom to pick and choose the myths, symbols, and metaphors that best fit our needs.   I'll give the Temple of Set credit, they least drop and refute the term Satanism. Because they believe in the actual God of Set they refer to themselves as Setians and practitioners of the Left Hand Path.       I don't go out of my way to argue against theists here. Unless a question is asked or a false claim is made. But in the off chance that I happen to find myself in such a "debate", the only thing I ask for is consistency. If you claim spirituality, theology, belief in actual Gods and choose to worship them, you are buying into the whole lot. I'm often met with typical teenage aghast ("Don't tell me what to do! I'll do what I want!") All this signals to me is that you're not interested in theism, satanism, or anything of the sort, you're just a pretentious, angry kid (or adult child) trying to piss of your superiors (parent, community, parole officer).      Anyone who studies history knows the importance of etymology. Terms and definitions are important. LaVey was not kidding when he said the first 99 years are always the toughest. He was not interested in a flash in the pan Pop Culture phase. He was deadly serious about making Satanism a recognized, organized, structured religion with its own meta-culture. So it is through the Church of Satan that his goals will be realized, in the real world accomplishments of our members and non-member affiliates, through academic and political work, and through surviving the current Invisible War.   Could be because there have already been 4 or 5 posts about this topic here.   Indeed it is...   *Into everyones life appear individuals who just dont seem to want to go away. They surface in many forms, but have certain common denominators. They are epitomized by the guy who is 86ed from the local bar for stirring up shit, falling through the plate glass door and suing, welching on bar tabs, and carelessly almost setting the place on fire. A week after he is told his business is no longer welcome, he pops in and tries to cadge a drink from his old buddy, the bartender. Just like nothing had happened.*               Looking sharp!         I'm not crazy about the statement that Satanic "roots can be found in the Islam, Christianity and in Judaism". Maybe if you only focus on certain symbols and metaphors, but the religion as a whole has much deeper and substantial roots in that works of Milton, Wilde, Nietzsche, Mencken, Rand, and similar writers over Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.   The Temple of Set believes that LaVey and the Church of Satan received divine grace from an actual God in the form of Satan (which LaVey and the COS have denied). When Aquino was denied further control of the COS and was told to buzz off with "magickal initiations" he started to have visions of Set who gave him directions to start the Temple.    So "Sethianism" had no role in the development of Satanism. Set can be used in certain Satanic rituals but that's a reference to Egyptian mythology, nothing "Sethian" about it. The basic texts of the TOS pretty clearly state that Satanism is an abomination and they claim no relationship with the religion other than it was the first phase that early TOS members went through.    In an upcoming book High Priest Gilmore will expand on the Satanic   Epicurean connection.   [Church of Satan: Theory   Practice](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php)      LP has sold out!

Sure, you backtrack now on a Reddit thread, but when the spotlight is on it's you who goes scrambling for that identity! Are you kidding?  **Doug was not a member.** The Church of Satan is a professionally run organization with records on all communications, memberships, and affiliations. We searched the records and there is NO MENTION of a Doug Mesner anywhere! The only people who claim he was a member are you (who has a history of making shit up) and Doug, who you, yourself, are claiming is not reliable.  If I remember the communications from Ely, it was they who thought you were mentally retarded. But let's not digress. Don't talk about having balls... you were chased out of a small sweet town for being a jackass and then playing the poor victim card. Sorry, but we received reports back from Ely about how the town actually was being very generous with you, you were the one being either delusional or making mountains out of molehills for the express purpose of cashing in on it. Either way it failed.    You have a long history of ignoring e-mails, letters, communications of various sorts, including those pertaining to copyrights. Did you forget that you sold the rights to the LaVey and Peter MIR pieces? Or how about when you sold RFS and were supposed to hand over merchandise that needed fulfilling? You were more than happy to take people's money and then *forget*.    You talk of a "cult of personality" but it's you who puts so much importance on your one meeting with LaVey and how LaVey was so much more this or that. Of course you'll backtrack on this thread, but it'll be a whole other story later.    As far as I know, no.   Shane, Doctor himself kicked out many people from the Church of Satan. People he met on more than just a single occasion, people he granted titles to. Meeting him once does not give you a free pass to shit on others without repercussions. You **do not** decide who remains in the Church of Satan or not,  High Priest Gilmore and High Priestess Nadramia make those calls.     Again, let's make this clear. This is **not about disagreements**. This is about going in public, on a live stream, spewing repugnant rants against multiple people. Do you think everyone just forgot about that? Water under the bridge? If Doctor heard another COS member say anything about him close to what you said about the current High Priest he'd do far worse than kick them out. You seem to live in a world where you think there are no consequences to your actions.    **Let this be very clear.**  As of your public outburst mid-2007 (CORRECTED), you were no longer a member of the Church of Satan. If that wasn't clear to you then, make it clear now.    The Church of Satan has reviewed all records and can find **no record** of Doug Mesner ever being a member of the Church of Satan. If he told you this he either applied under a different name which we cannot verify or he lied to you.    Also, you do not have the rights to Might is Right. You sold it off, along with Radio Free Satan, in 2007. I am the current technical director of Radio Free Satan and a Reverend in the Church of Satan.    "Disagreements"? No one is expected to "worship" a hierarchy, we certainly have members who disagree with each other on various things, but we will not tolerate public preschool name calling. I listened to your public, live rant on Radio Free Satan, on which you said some incredibly rude things about a number of Church of Satan members, including High Priest Gilmore.  Do you seriously think **any** organization of any kind would keep you around after a public outburst like that? Think about *that* for a second.    Like Doctor put it, you took a shit on the floor and kicked yourself out.              From the source:   http://churchofsatan.com/faq-lavey-and-family.php    HOW DID ANTON LAVEY DIE?    Having a long-standing valvular problem which is associated with rheumatic heart disease, Anton LaVey had a kind of massive cardiac arrhythmia after several events of internal bleeding had been treated in hospital during late summer of 1997. He died on October the 29th, in St. Marys Hospital, a Catholic hospital associated with the University of San Francisco. He was brought to St. Marys because it was the closest hospital to his residence; he had never been treated there before. Although there has been some confusion with his funeral records (some listed Halloween as his death date), rumors that his death had been caused deliberately by a Christian nurse are grossly false. He was given a Satanic funeral, attended only by his closest relatives and was cremated afterwards.    His last wife, Blanche Barton, who is still involved in LaVey's Church of Satan, just recently did a presentation in regards to Satanism and its overlap with Secular Humanism at meeting for the Humanist Association of San Diego.    Take your pick:  https://www.youtube.com/user/9sensepodcast    Here's one in which he addresses sexual assault in the US military:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJpCMFfnreo   VICE has an issue with anyone who doesn't let themselves be a tool. I know one ex-VICE writer who left due to such issues, and there appears to be only one or two writers left there that I have any respect for. Their work quickly gets buried underneath the dozen stories about being Gay or Trans in Russia (yes, it sucks, we get it) or hanging out with Snoop Dogg and Pitbull.   All of the above? It depends on the context in which it's presented, but all those suggestions sound valid. It's often used in communications as a farewell salute between respecting parties. Since Satan represents the Self, it would be akin to saluting the potential within each person. I would not use that greeting towards a person who did not acknowledge or accept the Satanic philosophy as the metaphor and appreciation would be completely lost. Have taste and class.   What in the world was that? No where in that interview did this Eric Freeman character say he was part of the ONA, just loosely referenced the Ceremony of Nine Angles, which is actually based on Lovecraft's mythos. Seems like the editors at Vice assumed this had to the with the ONA. Even the more rudimentary research into the ONA would show that they completely disavow any connection or history with the Church of Satan and the work of Anton LaVey. I believe they reference anything by LaVey as "watered down garbage".  Vice continues to live up to my summation of their "journalism": Fox News for hipsters.   As a student of Heidegger I've been recommended Sloterdijk's Sphere trilogy, just never got around to it. I can agree with his Satan-centric cosmology, and his view of technology as magic and metaphysics. Unfortunately there may be some important nuances lost in translation from the German, which causes much debate in Heidegger as well. Thanks for the link.   Here's an article by COS member Vexen Crabtree with details on the Four Crown Princes   http://www.dpjs.co.uk/crownprinces.html         No hookers, but I know of a few financially successful Satanists who played professional poker and another who ran a well known adult film studio out of Vegas.   Oh, I forgot about that esoteric knowledge. Those deep Mysteries unknown to the sheep but revealed to the true kvlt after some fat lines of ketamine.   The names themselves and their various associations (cardinal points, elements, etc.) come from Judeo-Christian myths, LaVey elaborated on them with poetic fashion.   And this is exactly why [Peter Gilmore's article is titled the way it is](http://www.churchofsatan.com/lets-you-and-him-fight.php).  http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9d0bwjfH81ropthqo1_500.jpg   Do we want to go down this road again? Who is "they" who serve to keep a "religion" pure? What is the "religion"? Do you mean heretical Christians? And don't give me that "esoteric" nonsense, it's a lame cop-out for "I have no idea" or "stuff I read online".          Because Satanism is a celebration of life, being your own personal god, and epicurean living. *Most* traditional Black Metal is obsessed with death, joylessness, and devil worship. There are, of course, exceptions. And something doesn't always need to be Satanic for a Satanist to enjoy it for their own purposes.   First of all, the Sigil of Baphomet is the symbol Anton LaVey established for the organized philosophy and religion of Satanism and the Church of Satan. So if you're talking about the Sigil of Baphomet you're talk about Satanism as defined by LaVey, not any form of "theistic" devil worship. Here is an article detailing the history of the Sigil of Baphomet, how it became incorporated in Satanism, and why.    http://churchofsatan.com/history-sigil-of-baphomet.php    As for the Four Crown Princes, this is entirely symbolic and metaphoric. It would be up to you to decide how you choose to negotiate them with the idea of Baphomet.   How a devil worshiper who actually believes in the existence of these "forces" handles them, I have no idea. Especially considering how these terms existed in different, anthropologically incompatible mythologies. But that's a whole other *thing*.   I figured. That said, I do have a considerably large BM record collection and enjoy the music under certain conditions (Emperor   Thorns being some of my favorite bands).                                                [The Spanish translation of Peter H. Gilmore's S. Scriptures is now available as a hardback and slipcase.](http://shop.underworldamusements.net/category/satan)     I've made this a text post instead of a link post so that I can follow-up with some disclosure and starting points for rational discussion, as opposed to just spamming a new book.     *Disclosure: I've been an active member of the Church of Satan for 7 years and currently hold the title of Warlock within the organization. All this means is that the administration has taken note of real world accomplishments and applications of the Satanic philosophy. For about 10 years I've worked with a number of Satanists, independents and within the Church of Satan, on various projects ranging from organizing concerts, web development, proof reading and editing, and as a technical consultant. I put this out there due to the fact that I've seen posts that use sources like "my sister's ex-boyfriend's cousin who was once a Satanist" or decades old ex-members with bitter axes to grind.*     That said, I cannot speak **for** the COS and its members as an entirety. But I am authorized to speak **to** the organization's functions and fundamental philosophies.   I've been lurking on this subreddit for about year and noticed Satanism/LaVey brought up several times, as recently as a few weeks ago. While many do understand that Satanism (notice I'm not using any prefixed qualifications) is based on an atheist principle, there still seem be a number of people who do not (or cannot) grasp that idea.     Here are some experts from Gilmore's essay, What, The Devil?, which is [available online](http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/WhatTheDevil.html).     "From a 1986 interview with Walter Harrington of The Washington Post:     Satan is a symbol, nothing more, LaVey says. Satan signifies our love of the worldly and our rejection of the pallid, ineffectual image of Christ on the cross.     Accepting the axiomatic premise that no gods exist as independent supernatural entities means that Satanists are de facto atheists. We know that the objective universe is indifferent to us. Since our philosophy is self-centered, each Satanist sees himself as the most important person in his life. Each individual thus generates his own hierarchy of values and judges everything based on his own standards. Therefore, we Satanists appoint ourselves as the Gods in our subjective universes."     Here is Peter Gilmore discussing the issue on Point of Inquiry   http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/     The other thing I see mentioned over and over is "it's just hedonism". No, Hedonism is ultimately compulsive. Peter Gilmore prefers to use the term Epicureanism.     From the essay [Rebels Without Cause](http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Rebels.html):     "Satanists always remain in control of their exploration of pleasure. IndulgenceNOT compulsion is our founders dictum that moves us out of hedonism, which by definition is unbridled and thus compelled. Epicureanismthe balanced seeking of physical and mental self-satisfactionembraces a wider range of gratification. It is refined, selective, and embodies our concept of Indulgence. We are gourmets in the banquet of existence. Hedonism is limited to base carnal pursuits. Epicureans arent prudes, nor are we slaves to any of our desires; rather these are motivators toward seeking all manner of fulfilling experiences. The hedonist blindly sates his lusts for sex, sustenance, and somaconsequences be damned! That is a self-destructive course inappropriate for Satanists."     While LaVey's work has been seminal to the Satanic philosophy, Peter Gilmore has been expounding on it for years, in terms and on topics that are applicable today. The Satanic Scriptures includes the essays linked above and others that have only been available those in the COS. Topics include same-sex marriage, the importance of a secular society, a clear explanation of Satanic magic, classical music, toy collections, politics, pragmatic eugenics, Godzilla, and more.

 [Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039/)  I tried demo and i love it, but i do not have enough money at the moment (and i am going to write an article on it when i get it). Sciency rockety stuff! I would be very grateful :)   I have a spare copy of this great game. Actually, it is my the most favorite game ever. Post the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything and i will decide.   So, a few weeks earlier a guy stopped me near the place i go to school. It turned out the guy is a Hindu preacher, trying to sell some books about Krishna and talk people into religion.  I kinda like him, we talk for a moment every time i go that way, but he appears to be very brainwashed/clearly instructed. First, when i told him i am an atheist, he tried to tell me atheism is a religion (i told him it is in fact absence of faith). Today i told him i read The God Delusion and he went on how atheist don't know facts and write about it (i even told him Dawkins has all sourced), whereas religious books are true (particularly his own religion's one, obviously, because when i told him e.g. Bible and Quran are just books, that it is not an evidence of anything, he seemed to agree).  I am not sure if it's worth trying to learn him at least anything, I don't know if he listens. But I don't particularly like arguing with people, so i am not pushing anything.   Some unmistakably artificial structures, e.g. remains of buildings. Discuss please.                           Only three videos in and i am almost crying! Thank you, people, i love laughter! :D  Edit: Now i am crying with laugher :D                           Hi everyone,  i do not expect to be many Czech people here, but i am going to post it anyway. With help from couple of other Czech bronies i managed to finish Czech Subtitles for the first part of [Brony Chronicles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EOfhvvURY feature=player_embedded).  It was difficult, but i am proud of it. I do not expect it to be well-received here, but even if one person find it useful i will be happy. BTW yes, i already posted it on Czech forums.  It it for 720p version downloaded off YouTube.  [DOWNLOAD HERE](http://uloz.to/x6nnuB2G/the-brony-chronicles-part-1-origins-srt)                                    When my cat lies somewhere, she put her legs and tail under her so she looks like a little furry blobby bean. It's adorable.  I just wanted to share with you.   Say it with a picture!   It's old, useless and powerless, i just want to be sure it won't shock me or something.

Could that be a real scenario and under what circumstances?                           Psychonauts is an older game, yet it is my THE MOST favourite game ever and i will tell you a few reasons why:  * It's very different than any other games in terms of its originality * Art style is fantastic even with limited texture resolution and limited amount of polygons * The game is very humorous and funny * Each level offers its own unique gameplay  * Game setting is quite joyful and the plot is intriguing * It has many things to collect, which serves not only for a sole purpose of being collected, but it's important for game progress.  Albeit it's an older game, the time hasn't taken anything from its enjoyability. If you pass off on it, you will miss one of the most original games ever created.            I tried to Google, but i am not much smarter.            I was going there, because some awesome things there were mistaken for uncool. Have we won?  http://www.reddit.com/r/bronyhate   I know it's not a very good question, given the amount of factors, so i simplify it. Hypothetical computer is running only BIOS, electricity is stable, it has no viruses/malware.                     On /r/Minecraft frontpage i see beautiful creations, dreamhouses with pools, majestic gates to great dwellings... And i am in utilitarian grey cube and all i have is gigantic complex of mining caverns and cobblestone castle with skyscraping tower. I play on Peaceful.   So there exists some guys who formed a band and entertain themselves by cryptically promote themselves and creating an ARG? Did i get it right?      It was just so calm.                                                                           We got NMM, Discord, Chrysalis and Sombra. We all are excited by possibility of seeing some of them again, but every season so far introduced at least one new villain. Who do you think it will be in Season 4?   I like drinking pony fanfics and i want to read one with Celestia.  BTW i didn't want to put this in mylittlealcoholic      Would you survive?                              Do you know some good drinking fanfics with Rarity?                                 I read it will be shut down early this year. Will it still be playable? Though Spore isn't perfect, it can be beautiful sometimes.                        I need it to show it to my friends.                                    Starswirl the Bearded was a powerful magician, who lived more than 1000 years ago. He invented spell to transform a pony (unicorn or pegasus) into an alicorn. The regal sisters used this spell to become alicorns and thus defeat Discord (and then Sombra). They kept the book for themselves and Celestia is testing her pupils (many generations of them). If they prove themselves to be worthy enough, Celestia reward them with turning them to alicorns.                           There is Derpy trying to open cookie jar with her hooves without succes, cursing "What kind of sadistic retard invented this crap?!. In the next panel is Celestia opening the cookie jar with her magic and she says something like "Hohoho". (i love her expression while she's doing so, that's why i am looking for it)                                             Today i found quite shocking (and somehow truthful) quote from Terry Deary:  "I've no interest in schools. They have no relevance in the 21st century. They were a Victorian idea to get kids off the street. Who decided that putting 30 kids with only their age in common in a classroom with one teacher was the best way of educating? At my school there were 52 kids in the class and all I learned was how to pass the 11-plus. Testing is the death of education. Kids should leave school at 11 and go to work. Not down the mines or up chimneys, mind, but working with computers or something relevant. Everything I learned after 11 was a waste of time. Trigonometry, Boyle's law: it's never been of any use to me. They should have been teaching me the life skills I was going to need, such as building relationships, parenting and managing money. I didn't have a clue about any of these things at 18. Schools need to change."   source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Deary#Series         I enjoy fanfics, where ponies are getting drunk (no clopfics), i read a couple of 'em, but i want more.    Hi, a 7305 days ago, i was born here in Prague. Today I am 20, and i am no longer a "teen".

                                                                         Mr. Moore:  I read with interest [your letter](http://www.ea.com/news/we-can-do-better?ClickID=dcsyz0xhwthrxxxnbm22hhbok2ktrrkt2yxk) to the gaming community regarding the perceptions your customers and the gaming community have of Electronic Arts (EA).  I can understand some of your frustration as indeed some of the criticism is unfair, some unfounded and some overblown.  It is true being bigger, as you implied, means you catch more flak.  I am one of your customers but not a particularly important one.  Merely one drop in a very large bucket.  Nor am I "the voice of the community" or speaking for anyone but myself.  Nevertheless I wanted to address some points you made in your letter and I feel fairly certain many others are thinking the same things (or near enough).  Hubris on my part?  Maybe but it is in earnest.    I get why being voted "Worst Company in America" would bug you.  It should bug you.  Not because you actually are the "Worst Company in America" but because enough people would think it to vote that way.  This should be telling you/EA something and that it is something to think about rather than dismiss as a bunch of juvenile cranks.  The trick is to figure how the people voting are defining "worst".  Is it "most evil company that destroys ecosystems" or can you think of it as "who treats their customers poorly and delivers a sub-par product while trying to extract the most money they can from their customers"?  Make no mistake I have no love for the oil companies but as a customer they do deliver the product I expect with little hassle.  EA on the other hand seems to be like a gold digger eyeing a prospect to figure how much he/she can be squeezed for.  To be clear, I completely understand EA is a business and they are in this game (pun intended) to make money.  If you do not make money you will be out of business...simple as that.  Absolutely nothing at all wrong with trying to turn a profit (no business would exist if it didn't...learned that in Econ-101).  The issue arises in how you go about making that money.  I will not sit here and tell you the right way to do that (actually I started doing that, wrote several paragraphs and deleted them...email me if you want them).  I will, however, point out some clear misses and apparent blind spots from your letter.  I can guarantee you that this is not just my opinion.  Your corpo/PR approved/sanitized speech has only [incensed people further](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bqz6u/peter_moore_we_can_do_better/) (hence this letter).  - You did not support SOPA but [did not oppose it either](http://www.joystiq.com/2012/01/17/ea-explains-lack-of-sopa-stance/).  Further, you did support the Entertainment Software Association which did support SOPA.  Distancing yourself from that is dubious.  It is like pretending you have no political stance while sending money to...I won't Godwinize this letter so will leave it at that (did I just pull off a stealth Godwinization?).  - Your wonderment at the Mass Effect fiasco shows a lack of understanding about what it was the fans were mad about.  Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E).  It should clear things up.  - Your fumble of the SimCity launch could have/should have been seen miles away.  I'm sure you had pre-sales numbers so had good reason to know *most* of those people would be jumping your servers in the first few hours.  How can you miss that?  Is giving away 900,000 games cheaper than buying a few more servers?  (Now I think about it I can see that it might have been.  Will need to get my tinfoil hat to ponder that one some more.)  - SimCity always online bit IS a DRM scheme.  It may be other things too but I am sure the folks at EA did not miss that it manages to be DRM because I am (almost) certain they are not stoopid.  That said the DRM aspects may have been icing on the cake.  The online bit for SimCity looks like a good way to get micro-transactions going for the SimCity franchise.  Bottom line is there is NO reason SimCity ever needed an online aspect.  It was not, has never been, that kind of game and has never been a big request for players.  Pretty sure the internet has been telling EA/Maxis that from the very first time they learned of it.  EA/Maxis did it anyway cuz you know...to hell with what the customer wants.  - 45 million registered users is not a meaningful comparison to Steam.  I can personally say I have four games on Origin and 100 (I checked) on Steam.  I log in to Steam several times a week.  I go months without logging in to Origin.  I am willing to bet, indeed I will bet you, Steam blows your doors off in this and will continue to do so.  - About the Madden cover thing...in any large enough group you will have some cranks and weirdos.  I have worked for multi-national companies before and seen some of the complaints that come in and bizarre barely covers it.  Ignore them.  Worry when so many people dislike your company you start winning contests about being the most hated company in the US.  - As for the LGBT stance kudos to you.  You will be on the right side of history and, frankly, it is a smart business decision for you.  Bonus it is also the ethical and the morally correct decision.  Obviously it is a polarizing issue and you cannot keep both sides happy at the same time.  Not being snarky or kidding at all about this...good on you and EA for this position.    It is encouraging to see you saying EA wants to do better and I really hope EA follows through on that.  You have excellent examples out there such as Steam (perhaps your nemesis but you would be foolish to not figure out what they are doing right) and/or like the folks at CD Projekt RED (to name two).  Both are doing smashingly well with incredible consumer loyalty doing almost exactly the opposite (in many respects) of what EA does.  I used to like EA.  I want to like EA.  You need to decide whether you want to be [Walmart or Costco](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/26/why-can-t-walmart-be-more-like-costco.html) in this.  Sincerely,  train_subject9958                           I was reading the article [It's Diablo 3 All Over Again with the SimCity 5 Launch](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/SimCity-Diablo-DRM-PC-Gaming-Always-Connected,21385.html) and it occurred to me that for all the gnashing of teeth over these things our pain doesn't matter.  For all the bitching and moaning gamers can produce it is of no matter.  There is ONE measure these companies care about...sales.    The article I linked above compares Sim City 5 to Diablo-3.  As bad as Diablo-3 turned out to be here are the sales results:  Diablo 3 increased its sales by 2 million from the Q3 of 2012 and that makes Diablo 3 the #1 best-selling PC game at retail for the calendar year 2012 in North America and Europe. ([CITE](http://gamerexp.com/diablo-3-passes-12-million-sales-world-of-warcraft-lost-subscriptions))  In short, all this bitching and moaning is meaningless.  As long as EA can nab best selling games you can bitch all you want.  I guarantee they do not give a shit if they can sell 12 million copies.                                                                                                                                                                                           Frustrated by a lack of political power and fed up with blindly donating to politicians who consistently vote against the industry's interests, a handful of leaders are determined to shake things up.  Are they serious?  What planet are they living on?  Whoops...not sure why that didn't link to the article.  Here is the link:  http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/177_66/SuperPAC-banking-Howard-Headless--Friends-of-Traditional-Banking-1048138-1.html?zkPrintable=1 nopagination=1         This has always confused me.  Imagine I step off the ISS into space and I want to de-orbit and fall back to earth.  When I step off the station I will remain in orbit next to the space station.  To get back to earth do I need to speed up or slow down?  My confusion stems from the following:  The further away from earth you are the slower you go to stay in a stable orbit.  So, if I slowed down would I move into a higher orbit?  To get back to earth do I need to speed up?                      Not sure if my Vanguard guy should focus more on Aim or Strength.  He is tank specced and has a few melee based attacks as well as ranged attacks.  For the most part the ranged attacks are not all that strong and more damage seems possible with the melee stuff (such as Stock Strike).  Ideas?  Opinions?          I am level-17 Vanguard still tooling around Coruscant.  I have pimped my character about as much as I think he can be pimped on this planet.  Using commendations he has a very nice blaster rifle (complete with mods) and his armor is about as good as it will get for the next few levels (he has an Aim of over 200).  Anyway, when I am fighting mobs my blaster rifle feels like a squirt gun.  I am laying in shooting non-stop and their damage bar ever-so-slowly goes down.  Then my companion (Adric-dude) pops one shot with his autocannon and half their health bar vanishes.  Granted the blaster rifle is not meant to be as powerful as the heavy guns but geez...feels more like I am whipping them with a wet noodle.  My special attacks do damage fine and are what carry me through but I just figured the second most powerful set of guns in the game would have a bit more oomph to them.  Any ideas on what I am missing or is this just how it is?   Seems to me it is not in their interest.  If SOPA passes people registering websites would go way down.  People hosting on their site would go way down.  SOPA simply puts far to much liability on a website operator for anyone to be casual about it and that would reduce the number of people starting websites.  So, forgetting for a moment that SOPA sucks and should be opposed period where is GoDaddy's self-interest in supporting this?  As near as I can tell it would only hurt their business.  Self-interest, if doing the right thing is too hard for them, should see them oppose this anyway.     Say we have an infinite series of random numbers such as:  68432010267983002180002687964157862...(goes on forever)  Is there a chance that if you chose some series of numbers, say 1234567890987654321 or 00000000000000000000, will not occur?  If so how big does the series have to be before we could expect a chance of not finding a given string?  That is, it seems silly to think we would never see 35 or 91 or 47 to never appear.  As we get longer the chances for a given series to appear diminish but they never reach zero.       I know the quick answer to this is "no".  I realize Quantum Mechanics has the electron sorta smeared out and assigns probabilities to its location.  That said, does the electron actually have a specific location at any given point in time and the problem is merely our inability to pinpoint it (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle)?  Or is the electron, in reality, really smeared out?  Also, I know the Bohr Model of an atom is not correct (i.e. electrons orbit akin to planets) but if that is incorrect is the electron orbiting in any fashion or is it blinking (or jumping for lack of better words) from place to place?                         I think this has been mentioned before but it bears repeating since I have seen numerous people pointing this out lately.  This is an internet message board.  Not AP English class.  People will make mistakes when typing messages.  Happens.  Stop correcting every little error and instead focus on the gist of the post.    Mind you, I am all for proper grammar and I think anyone wanting to make a serious point is well served if they pay attention to their grammar.  Mistakes only detract from what you are trying to get across.  Still, mistakes happen and the worst editor in the world is the person who wrote what is being edited (loosely speaking).  There are some caveats to this (not meant to be an authoritative list as I am sure there are other exceptions to be found):  1)  You are correcting someone who is correcting someone else's grammar.  2)  The misspelling changes the post in a way that makes it unintentionally humorous (worth making note of that).  3)  The grammar is so atrocious as to be nearly unreadable.  Bottom line is to use common sense.  Would you want the topic of discussion in a post you made be your use of "there" instead of "their" when it has nothing to do with anything you were writing about?  Try [this bit by Stephen Fry](http://vimeo.com/15412319) if you want the point put more eloquently than I ever could.  EDIT:  To anyone who loves language I *highly* recommend the Stephen Fry bit I linked.  The guy is brilliant.                    An Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman walk into a bar and order a pint.  They look at their beer and notice there is a fly stuck in the foam of each one.  The Englishman, showing some disgust, grabs a spoon and fishes the fly out.  The Scotsman casually flicks the fly out of the foam with his fingers.  The Irishman grabs the fly and yells, "Spit it out ya bastard!"                           	135

Once again, thank you man so much, you made my day! :)   Do you think it's overhyped or it actually lived up to it's expectation.

I have everything on high excluding triple buffering with 1920x1080 resolution and it's still 'blurry'.   Is this due to game being made on source engine or me not being able to max it all out ( by maxing I mean triple buffering etc. ) ?      http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972/            I know it's luck based, but I saw so many people get such a good cards ( even myself ) when finishing arena with bad scores.

So, I just wanted to see other people opinions on E-books and do you use it often as way for reading, or do you avoid it unless you are unable to find it in physical copy.   I find it hard reading books online, via computer/tablet or whatever device you are using. I  don't get the same feeling and it seems that I can't get into book enough for me to stay long. As for staying long, I also find it really difficult for me to read 20-50 or more pages on device rather than taking a book and chilling outside/sitting comfortable on your bed etc.   So, how do you approach it, I know that physical copy of book can't really compare with e-book for many reasons, but what do you think about this overall? Are you comfortable to read a book on certain device as much as regular book?      So, I'm not a frequent 'book-reader' or however you want to call it, or should I say, I "wasn't", but nowdays, I'm more into books than anything else, and even tho I didn't read books what really interests me are mystery books.   I just wanted to ask, since there are many suggestions for ones that love mystery ( like myself ) to go and read Harry Hole series, so I'm simply asking what do you guys think about it overall, what's the best book from that serial, is it smart to start from beginning ( even tho I will 100% skip first 2 books ( Bat and another one, can't remember now).  Sorry if this breaks somekind of rules, if it does, please notify me, I'll delete the thread, just wanted to see other people experience of this novel since there are some mixed feelings about it overall that I encountered.   Thanks, and cheers!   Hey guys, I'm soon off on my vaication and I'm looking for good books. I recently started reading Da Vinci Code and I'm really into it ( I know I'm little too late for it, but better now than never :p ), so I'm looking for books that are similiar to this one, not in religious style, but books that are action packed, and that aren't full of description and stuff like that. I didn't read a lot of books, and I'm starting to do it from this year ( 'new year resolution'), but I read few good ones, like Alchemist, Return and stuff like that, so I'm really newbie in this and looking for recommendation on good books. Currently, I'm looking into Parfume book and Here to Stay: A Harrigan Family Novel from Catherine Anderson, so what do you guys think about these books, do you recommend them or whatso ever? Thanks :) TL;DR - to sum up, I LOVE MYSTERY, murders and investigations and stuff like that :p EDIT: What do you guys think about book from Jo Nesbo, "Police: A Harry Hole Novel" ?   This is my deck, 2 images since it continues to bottom;   http://pokit.org/get/img/a3bee5a75eb389b08c5bf7c05c64b764.jpg  http://pokit.org/get/img/3ea6bb59c66ee78728833eb1a4465e1a.jpg  I have 0 legendaries, and I'm unable to craft any of them for now. Any suggestions on what I did wrong and how to improve? Thanks :)  PS: ( not that I'm implying that you need legendary to climb up, but lack of few of them is why I maybe inserted other 'not so needed' cards )      add for quick trade yo;   http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972/             As stated, don't offer me game that I already have please. :r   Have FOIL CARD, SNOW GLOBE #3, want tf2 keys, you offer.

So guys, don't know if there was thread for multiplayer, if not, this is great opportunity to talk about what you guys think overall, did it improve in any ways, or did it stay in the shadows of great singleplayer that AC series offer? What do you think?   Also, if you are up to, check my thoughts of multiplayer overall;    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KHXy2b00DY      So guys, it's been 'a while' since the game originally came out on PC, and as most of you know, it wasn't perfect in terms of optimization. Although some got it to work perfectly, others experienced stutters, frame drops, screen tearing and many problems with their gaming rig. So I figure most of you are already digged into the game a lot ( unless you're one of the unluckies to have problems with optimization ), but my question is, what do you think about it overall? Was it better than AC3? Was it worse? What are yours experiences?   Also, I made a video and talked little about it, so if you feel like it, check it out. Also there's a potentional fix ( but I figure most of you know for it by now ( using d3overrider ), so yea.   http://youtu.be/Pr-_03Btnk0  TL;DR: Worse than AC3? Better than AC3? In terms of optimization and what do you think about it overall?   Cheers.   So, it says;  that it's exclusive to playstation, with additional 60 minutes of footage.

When I came back home to try it out, and put on the catridge, it's still red light on it, and it just blinks green for a merely second, then stands red solid.   I have Xerox 3010/3040 printer, and I got the catridge refilled.   I also have one question, is it normal for catridge to let down the ink, I mean, It's like there's a little hole or something and the ink is ( or powder) is slowly going out of the catridge.      As stated, I have tf2 keys to offer for AC Black Flag on uplay, or Watch Dogs.   If there's anyone that can/want to do this, write in comments the amount of keys you want for it and I'll see what I can do about it!   Will trade multiple keys for either of the games!!!!

I have unusual Controller for PC, but untill I get my hands on XBOX 360 controller for PC i have to for now stick with this one.

So, did anyone manage to handle this fps drop that appers at Boston. I played a game like 5-6 hours in a row, to sequence 6. When i came into Boston, there was a huge fps drop. Previous sequences, or places were apsolutely fine.   I have HD5750 1GB, 8GB RAM, and X4 640 3.0 AMD Processor.   I don't see a problem in my configuration, but the reason why i posted this, is to see, if anyone manage to solve this problem. It bothers me, because after passing 22% of game, i had to switch to Need For Speed Most Wanted, because i want to play AC3 at full experience.   TL;DR - FPS Drop mainly in Boston, if anyone knows how to fix it, let me know!   I prefer batman AA, and would go all in for it.   Cheers!   ^   I'll give all of these things for Batman AA   ^ I'm willing to give all of these for Batman.   ^   I'm willing to give all of these for Batman.

 If you were to boil down 5 things that make an outstanding NCO, what would your five pieces of advice be?   Also, what books do you highly recommend for someone getting ready to pick up their stripes?   Hey y'all,   I'm looking for more books with academic wizards. I loved *Jonathan Strange   Mr. Norrell.* I also really loved the portion of *The Name of the Wind* where Kvothe was attending university. I'm looking for more books where wizarding is seen as an academic pursuit, full of Latin phrases, obscure references, cool robes, classes, and **books!**  Can you help me out?      What if a group of wealthy individuals bought a large mass of land. Seeing as it is private property, they can do what they wish right? So they establish a government, much like the US but smaller. They "rent" property out to anyone who wishes to "immigrate". They then regulate environmental practice on this land "it is their private property" and regulate guns, the market, and such (I.e. if you don't obey they kick you off their "private property". They leave a will that states every four years the people must elect a fixed number of people who become "property owners" of this land mass.  Wouldn't this be a state, but completely agreeable with ancap philosophy?   I'm the Army vet who posted the question about tattoos recently. I'm looking to become a Middle/High School English teacher in the South (I'm from Alabama). I had some more questions, I'm sorry if there are too many.  * Will being a male put me at a disadvantage?  * How difficult is it to secure a job after I get accreditation?  * What is Summer like for y'all?  * Are you allowed to present ideas for electives you'd like to teach?  * What are some good resources (books, articles, and websites) related to education you would recommend to a young teacher?  Thanks in advance for your help. I've found this sub super friendly.     I'm pursuing a degree towards education, with the intent to be a Secondary English teacher in the public school system. Obviously I'm not a fan of the system, but kids need to be taught even in our messed up system.  My questions are thus;  * What has your experience in the public school system done for your libertarian philosophy?  * Do you ever find conflict between your career and philosophy?  * How do you deal with the world of public education as a libertarian (especially unions, standardized testing, federal interventionism etc).  * Any other thoughts, tips, or tricks about being a libertarian in the public education sector?   Hello, I currently have some gold bullion coins from the US mint, but I'm curious if it's possible to buy gold bullion coins from other nations?   Hello, I'm a Confessional Presbyterian (OPC). I'm looking for someone to have some discussion with regarding Worship, Ecclesiastical Polity, and the nature of the Sacraments. These are three things I am conflicted about, and am between my confession's view, and the view of historic Reformed Anglicanism. I'd really like to carry out the conversation via PM if that is ok.      Hello,  I'm not sure if this is the correct sub forum for my question, but here goes. I'm an Army veteran about to go back to college for English Education. I'd like to teach Middle/High School English. The thing is, I have tattoos. My arms above my elbows are half sleeves, and I have four on my lower arms. Will this pose a problem for me?    To all my fellow bibliorganizationophiles out there. How do you organize your home library? I have a pretty extensive library, mostly dealing with literature, literary criticism, and theology. I'm looking for a more detailed way to keep it organized, as it is getting rather out of hand (i.e stacks of books with no shelfly home).   Caliban is my favorite Shakespearean character. I've always been baffled as to who he is exactly. At various points reading and watching The Tempest I've seen him as a mentally handicapped person, a cannibal like native islander (his name is an anagram of the Spanish word for *cannibal*) and various monstrous sub-human characters.   What's your speculation about the nature of Caliban? What's your favorite way to see him portrayed?    I understand that each major category has a 100's place, but behind that how exactly does the system work? For example, you get a book on Elizabethan history, it would go in the 900's place, but how do you determine the rest of the Classification?        Do you feel society in general owes you anything?  Put another way, do you feel you are entitled to anything by virtue of being born?  What are you owed by society?  Why does society owe you these things?     **I was reading *The Theology of Prayer* by the great Southern Presbyterian Benjamin Palmer, when I came across this quote. Pairs wonderfully with the first question of the Shorter and Larger Catechisms I think.**  "Upon this soul is stamped the seal of the divine attributes. In his intelligence man dimly reflects the divine wisdom; in his affections, the divine benevolence ; in his conscience, the divine rectitude; in his will, the divine power. Such a being can find his true sphere only in God. All these endowments point to that august source from which they are derived, as the only goal to which they can aspire; and the comprehensive act in which they all embark is the homage of an intelligent and eternal worship."  ~ Benjamin M. Palmer, The Theology of Prayer   Theoretically, could we ever base the US dollar on a cryptocurrency standard comparable to the gold standard? Obviously we would have to eliminate the FED and the Keynesian stuff. Obviously the cryptocurrency would have to be non government controlled. We all agree that we need a strong dollar backed by some resource (gold, silver etc). Also we agree that the market should decide said resource. What if the market chose cryptocurrency?  Is it feasible? What steps would we have to take?   First, forgive me for being an ignorant American here.  If the U.K. is one country, why are England, Scotland etc separate national football clubs? Why isn't there just one U.K. football club?   It seems that the presbytery in whose geographical bounds Leithart is currently ministering in (Evangel Presbytery) has sent a second letter to the presbytery Leithart is a member of (Pacific Northwest Presbytery) regarding his laboring outside the geographical bounds of his own presbytery.   http://theaquilareport.com/pca-evangel-presbytery-asks-peter-leitharts-presbytery-to-deal-with-his-ministry-status/  I have a few questions.  1. If Leithart is a TE at a CREC church, why is this an issue for the PCA presbytery in whose geographical bounds he is ministering in? Restated; since he isn't working in a PCA church, how does this affect Evangel Presbytery?   2. Why does it seem the presbyteries are more keen to address his unconformity with the Book of Church Order, while still not addressing his unconformity with the WCF (FV)?   Curious as to what y'all think about the concept of indentured servitude as punishment for nonviolent crimes. To clarify I don't mean *slavery*, at least not in the antebellum sense.  What I mean is, if someone violates your property rights (fraud, theft etc) then they have to work without pay for a period of time.  This could be done two ways  1. The criminal could work for whoevers property rights they violated.  2. The criminal works at a special labor camp.  Of course, it would have to be done humanely. No violations of NAP upon the "prisoners". Feed them, etc. But instead of sending them to a prison where they simply are turned into more violent criminals, we send them to work without wages for a period of time relative to their crime.  Is this a wacky idea?   I mean this as a friendly question, but this sub is so diverse that I was curious what the general consensus was.  Are you TR? (TR=Truly Reformed; Strictly Confessional, Old School, Strict Regulative Principle of Worship, Cessationist, Not a broad Evangelical, Hodge-ian)   If you don't fit into these categories, what is the definition of *Reformed* according to your systematic theology?  [Helpful Link](http://theaquilareport.com/the-six-tr-points/)  P.S. I'm TR.   What are your thoughts on birth control? Should Christians use it? Which kinds are restricted? What about artificial fertilization programs, surrogacy and the like?   How strictly do you observe the Sabbath?  What are your thoughts on Sabbath observance?   I want to join one, but can't decide which community is best.  Not beer advocate. The ratings seem soo amateur..  I'm really leaning towards Beer Citizen.  Any others?      Other than a good beer selection (which is a given).  In my town, there are *zero*. Everywhere only has the typical adjunct "party beers". I usually just buy my beer to drink at home. But I'm going on a road trip soon, and I'm looking to visit some good bars on the way. I want to know what qualities I should look for to determine whether a bar is worthwhile before I spend too much time/money without the best experience?   I've only been to two. Both weren't exceptional. The food was great, but the beers were average (still better than adjunct lagers). The concept is interesting to me though. Reminds me of old medieval taverns where the local tavern keeper brewed their own beer.  Anyways, what has your experience been?   "Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm (Psalm cxix.) and in many other places, sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many groanings and words.  Again, there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He sends a famine of hearing His words (Amos viii. 11), just as there is no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word, as it is said, "He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions" (Psalm cvii. 20). Christ was sent for no other office than that of the word; and the order of Apostles, that of bishops, and that of the whole body of the clergy, have been called and instituted for no object but the ministry of the word."  ~ Martin Luther, *Concerning Christian Liberty*  P. S. I don't know if this sub is a fan of quotations, but this one hit me while I was reading the aforementioned work.   What beer related bucket-list items do you want to accomplish before you die?  Mine follows:  1. Drink a pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub. (Which Dublin pub is the best?)  2. Drink *Calvinus* which is brewed only in Geneva.  3. Drink at the Wittenberg brewpub in Wittenberg Germany.  4. Visit all of the Belgian Trappist breweries.   I've heard Guinness is better from the tap. I like their stout (the import version). I was just curious is tap Guinness kegged with nitrous?   Me, I like traditional beer styles. Stouts are my favorites, and I also love the traditional ale styles. I rarely ever try cutting edge, innovative, or nontraditional styles (odd combinations/ingredients, hard liquor in beer etc) beers. They just don't interest me. Plus, with all the stouts out there to try, I have enough on my to-drink list! About as nontraditional as I typically go is something like a peanut butter milk stout.  What about you? How often do you venture into the new styles of the beer world?  Edit; sorry about the spelling mistake in the title. I cannot type well on a tablet.   I love watching YouTube beer reviews. I'm a big fan of *The Albino Rhino* and *Chadz* beer reviews. I'm looking for other quality reviewers.   Who do y'all recommend?   I'm gonna be honest. I do the unthinkable... sometimes, I drink Budweiser. Now I usually drink craft beer. But sometimes, is there anything wrong with just drinking a cold one the same way you'd drink a coke?   Sometimes my more snobby craft beer friends hate on my for drinking Bud or Yuengling while watching the game or barbequing. The fact is, when I'm doing those things I intend on drinking more than six beers, and drinking them easily. I'm not drinking them for complexity etc.  anyways, how do you feel about the snobbier side of craft beer? Do you avoid macro's at all times?       I'm just curious what the various approaches are. Do you have a regular time for family worship (devotions)? What do you do during that time?  Our family does every night. We open with a psalm or hymn, then we will read either a question from the Larger Catechism or the Heidelberg. Afterwards we will get into whatever we are studying. Sometimes we go through a book of the bible, sometimes we explore a particular topic, sometimes we use a book or other material (notably Paul Miller's material). We usually close with prayer time for various and sundry requests. Though we don't have kids yet, when we do we are considering using the New City Catechism.      It is very hard for me to choose, but if I had to narrow it down it would be a toss up between Thomas Watson, Thomas Brookes, and Samuel Rutherford.  1.  Watson's *Art of Divine Contentment* was phenomenal. 2. Brookes's *Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices* has probably had more of an impact on my walk than any other book. 3. Rutherford's *Letters* taught me a lot about compassion, and still provide a continual source of comfort and pastoral encouragement when I am away from home.  What about y'all?      Consuming alcoholic beverages, yay or nay?  As for myself I'm all for them in moderation. I believe beer is one of God's greatest physical gifts.    I recently started reading Chomsky for the first time. Up to this point I've never paid much attention to him, instead favoring more Rothbardian authors. Now that I've read him, he seems...inconsistent. How can someone who supports liberty, anarchy even, support the welfare state and the UN? Am I missing something?      The only responses everyone is throwing out are; 1. Gun Control - obviously a bad idea. I shouldn't even have to expound on why. 2. Lock away mentally unstable folks who "seem" violent. - Another obviously idiotic and oppressive idea.  What are some common sense ways to approach this subject without violating liberty?      I'm looking for something quirky, with realistic characters and great relationship development. Something similar to "Tell the wolves I'm home" by Carol Rifka Brunt (which I just finished and *adored*).    They can, apparently digest the wood pretty well, and consume it at a rate of 361.9237001 cubic centimeteres per animals per day according to the "Annals of Improbable Research".(1995)   Just curious how offer y'all contact your representatives?          Obviously not a question for anarchists, but do you think secession is legal? If so, under what circumstances is it legal?      There's a lot of interesting/high quality ones out there, and I love collecting them. What's the most interesting one in your collection?   Hey y'all, forgive me if this is a super amateur question, but I'm studying for my tech license and thinking about putting a 2m in my car for my first radio.  My question is, what antenna do you use? Do you use the default antenna on your car? If so, how do you connect it to the radio?   When he lost to Santino, Sandow's outburst seemed legit to me, they sure seemed to avoid acknowledging it happenef      I'm 21, planning on opening a Roth IRA target date fund. I've narrowed my choices down to either Vanguard, Charles Schwab, or T. Rowe Price. I'm leaning towards Vanguard. What do y'all think?      Originally, we were founded on the basis of the Articles of Confederation, until some of the federalists had their say. It seems to me the AoC established a more decentralized government. Do you think we should have stayed under it? If so, how would America look today?      I am a buy and hold investor, how exactly does an ETF work, and what can it do for me?         I'm 21 years old, trying to start my long term investment vehicle. I'm seriously considering a Roth IRA because of the tax benefits. (I am sure my tax bracket is lower now than it will be when I retire). I've heard a lot lately about Indexed Life Insurance policies and Annuities. It seems they give you a floor so you won't lose money, and you can withdraw the cash benefit anytime. It seems like flashy smoke and mirrors to me.     My question is, what do y'all think? Which investment vehicle performs better, and is likely to leave me in a better position at retirement?   Stick with me and you'll go places.   Because young men need good role models that spend time with them.         It has been explored in a variety of SciFi books/series, but what way do you think it would happen? Through radio? Physical contact?   I tend to think radiowaves are probably the most likely way they would make contact. Our radio signals are easily picked u and clearly signify intelligent life, and would be one of the first thing a scout would notice about our planet. It makes sense that they would try to contact us through this medium. What do y'all think?   I know I know, wacky topic. Just thought I'd throw it out there. Has anyone you've known experienced electronic voice phenomenon? Do you think it is possible for paranormal stuff to be on the radiowaves?               I have a few questions about who y'all think are the best pitchers currently in the MLB?  1. Who is the best all around pitcher in the league?  2. Who is the most diverse pitcher in the league? (Pitcher with biggest and best developed arsenal)  3. Who is the best technician? (Pitcher with a mastery of a single pitch)   I'm currently out of the country and I'm using the utwente WebSDR for some listening. Unfortunately, I've never used a waterfall display before, and I'm not sure how to read it. Are the lighter lines radio waves?   What are the major differences between the three groups?         I'm specifically interested in the fashion/lifestyle of the country side of rockabilly. I love Hank William's fringed suits, pearl snaps, and twang. Are there any websites/resources that deal with this subgenre of the lifestyle at all?       I'm currently out of the US, and last night was listening to my Grundig shortwave, I picked up an odd signal for someone who said "this is Oscar the engineer" like three times before the signal got too bad. Odd thing is, I've heard the same transmission before while I was in the states and thought nothing of it. Does anyone know who Osacr the Engineer is?? I know it is a longshot, but I thought I'd ask yall   I know several times throughout his career Tesla claimed to have recieved raidiowave transmissions from Mars. Does anyone know of a book/resource that further elaborates on the story behind this?

I know it is a longshot, but I thought I'd ask yall   Please explain how baseball stats work? Batting average, and other percentages?      Whether hamming, dxing, or local listening there are all sorts of oddities that happen over the airwaves. What is the oddest thing you have ever heard?      I've heard of units doing this. Has anyone experienced it firsthand? What's your opinion of it?            Hey y'all, come check out /r/twang/ for a healthy dose of Hank, Jones, Waylon, and new artists keeping the old-school style alive            I'm currently far away from my shortwave set for a while, and was curious if any of y'all listened to pirate/foreign stations online? If so, which ones are the most interesting?   I really love good biographies. And I love classical music! Have any of y'all read a great composer biography that you really enjoyed?   Specifically one dealing with the philosophy of work/work ethic, a history of blue collar work,  sociopolitical aspects of blue collar work, etc... Can anyone help me out?   There were many composers who wrote deliciously melancholy pieces, but on the whole who do you think captures this emotion best? Also, which work by your suggested composer exemplifies this emotion best?  My answer would be Chopin. His melancholy pieces are among my favorites. I think his "Prelude in e minor" or perhaps "Nocturne in C# minor" best exemplify what I mean.      I'm not talking how-to books, or electrical books, but history books. The only two I've read so far are   Hello everybody! The dawn of American Radio by Anthony Rudel    And  Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio by Tom Lewis.  Any more suggestions?      I know, odd request. I'm looking for either a history/nonfiction book about early country music (1930's to 1960's) or some good biographies of early country musicians.   I know, odd request.

As a book lover my local library is one of my favorite places. In fact, I prefer my local library to my local bookstore. I think libraries stand as bastions against the overwhelming illiteracy of our culture. What about y'all?   1. Is your library well stocked?  2. Are the librarians helpful?  3. How frequently do you go to your local library?  4. Are you involved in any programs put on my your local library?  5. Do you donate to your local library?   Which online book review social media site is the favorite here at /r/books?   Do any of y'all find yourself using a unique phrase one of your previous NCO's used? Some of the best NCO's I've ever had possessed a hilarious command of the English language. They could make a chewing out unforgettable. What are some of y'alls favorites?   Hey y'all, I'm trying to find the new 2015 board questions online somewhere, but I keep finding the old ones. Can some on help me out?   From any medium? I gotta say I really hate the one from Dark Knight Trilogy. It lacks the classy feel of the classic batmobile for me. Believe it or not, my favorite was the one from the cheesy Adam West TV show. What about y'all?   I think I'm in the minority here, but I really hated the artwork in TLH. ...          The guy loses more matches than anyone else I can think of. Completely uninteresting. All he ever does in go into the ring to get beat up..      I listen to the Tom Woods show regularly, and I'm looking for more libertarian or even an/cap radio shows/podcasts. Can y'all help?                           I know it's an odd question, but my favorite characters have always been the tinkerers/mechanics. I love the guys who play with cool scifi toys, keeping even the most junky stuff running long past its prime. Can anyone think of good novels somehow related to this theme?            Hi y'all, I'm pretty new to amateur radio. I've only built a few crystal sets, and am just now getting into tube radios. I am curious about trying to build a simple homemade transmitter. What types of transmitters are the simplest for home build?      I'm looking for some libertarian imagery to incorporate into a tattoo. Maybe y'all could help? Specifically something I can incorporate into an old school style tat. All I've come up with so far is somehow using the Guy Fawkes mask (and I know he wasn't libertarian so don't even go there). Any ideas? Something that'll make a statement?      I know it's a huge selection, but fantasy is chock full of magical swords, staffs, wands, and other enchanted goodies each with their own characteristics. Often I find that the props become characters themselves. So If you had to pick a personal arsenal, what items would you have in it?    What's your favorite vehicle of any kind from SciFi? Or, what SciFi vehicle do you think plays such a big part in the story that it becomes a character itself?  I love the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters, and of course the Serenity from Firefly.   Back in the day, Kane could barely speak. He was strange and awesome. Then he became a well spoken suit. How did that happen?   In honor of easter, what's your favorite easter egg/eggs in a comic book? I know many writers are fond of putting symbols/ spoilers in their comics, what are the best you've found?   I've never really read many Dark Horse titles, and I'm looking to try something new. So help me out, where do I start?     	135
