 Dammit....this is the exact same day Lykke Li is in Kansas City, which I already bought tickets for and started making plans for the trip.   Dammit....this is the same day as Lykke Li in Kansas City. . .and I already bought that ticket.   Libraries arent everywhere, sadly.   It's not on the 65% list. Also the only New 52 it seems is Hawk and Dove vol 1.   I wonder how functional it is.   The Presence, but I feel that is cheating a bit here.   If I say yes, will they make a Hawkman movie(s)?   Is Brightest Day worth it? There are some newer trades that I want, but might hold off on to take advantage of the sale.      The illuminati dick. You forgot about that.   Ah man. Thank you very much. If it wasnt between paydays I'd give you gold.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/T2qAIC3.png) we go.   No...at a low resolution she kinda has that face.   Any particular reason you don't like horror themed books? How about the other books in the Dark section of New 52?   Face   Maybe because she kinda sorta looks like Natalie Portman.   Think you can make one for mobile. The second one almost fits, but the text gets cut off slightly.   They are premiering some new songs at A3C on 6/21.   When did Gravy get the gauges?      Lorde is love, Lorde is Life?   Leave the autist alone. Dates are hard to read.   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   Im wondering the same shit.   So do we ever figure out what JFK's mutation is?   This is proof 4chan browses /r/incest . . .pretty much word for word from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/27kwaz/bs_true_experience_with_my_sister/)post   I'm just questioning your definition of recent. Those have been on reddit for a minute.   recent   I never liked any of the reddit apps.   .compact all the way.   Just give a little jiggle and giggle?   But it is still at the discretion of the venue. Looking at you Outback -.-   Put it in his face get that shit understood!  I was thinking something by TumTum, but this one reigns supreme.   As long as it isnt the purple one. That one isiffy at best for smell.   Or just fat.   ಠ_ಠ   Worst case scenario: Lose 55lbs and in 9 months have 3 babies  FTFY   Well years is indeed minute. . .   The itchy arms makes me think this is legit. I miss salvia.   Dafuq kind of title is this.   Well I had been on celexa for a minute, so just another salvia trip as far as I could tell.   How about for some extra inches :3   I dont know if is safe, but I was on celexa when I did salvia a couple times.   I doubt any bus stories could top that.   OP cropped out the mfw   Batman Eternal, Futures End, JL3000, Swamp Thing Vol. 4, Aquaman and the others.  Others: Cyclops, and might try out nailbiter   I actually like Brownsville :(   No. If you sage a post, it won't get bumped back to the top. Any post that isn't a sage post essentially bumps the OP's post.   Glad I came to the comments. The $20 credit almost won me, but alas I have no Kindle.   I was kinda hoping DW 1/2 or 3 would be the first titles from the series, but this is a pleasent surprise. I wonder how hard it would be for them to port #7. . .   Makes me want to dust off my PS2 to play this.   Being a Catholic President?    You should watch Mr. Nobody. It is on netflix.   Cesar's Tacos is a delicious local chain. Can't really think of much else even though I've been here since I was born.   Here is to hoping for The Question getting his own.   I never heard of these plans to make a live action Paprika. Now I am sad it probably is not going to happen.   Frankenstein! This had a good run and is collected in two trades.   I hear good things about Lucifer. I'm going to check those out after I finish Sandman. Same with the Death Trades.   Shoulder Rubs. I just can't stand them at all.   I don't like HEB for the fact they are so far away from where I live.   My thoughts exactly. It would be way too loud in there.   She turned the alarm on and then left? I know for my system that turns on the motion sensor and would be tripped if someone walked through the house. . .   By making it a rite of passage into adulthood if you so choose.   Vampire Academy   A couple weeks before the end of the year is not the time to be cracking down on petty things like uniform IMO.    For New 52 I like the Batman Eternal weekly. The story is great and I cant wait to see how the Commissioner comes out of this.   I've been pulling most of The Dark comics ( Justice League Dark, Phantom Stranger, Pandora) but havent quite read them yet since I am missing a couple issues here and there. The trades for them all are great. For Swamp Thing and Animal Man I just wait for their trades and have yet to be disappointed.   Justice League United seemed to start out strong so I'll keep checking it out. I do recommend Sword of Sorcery: Ameythst trade if you can find it. Since it was a short run it is all collected together.  Secret Origins is a nice take on the origins on well known heroes.   Not exactly New 52, but still Vertigo, I do enjoy Sandman: Overture. However it is only two issues in and it is months in-between releases.   Picked up Sandman: Overture 1 and 2 the other day and absolutely loved it. So I decided to start reading The Sandman. Finished the first two volumes and I was wondering when a good time to read the Death trades would be?   Buy me the hoodie and you got yourself a deal.   Ceasar's Tacos is by far the best chain anywhere.   He has a Libertarian view on drug usage. But according to the end of [this](http://www.examiner.com/article/moby-talks-dating-natalie-portman-gay-bashing-and-drugs) interview he has been sober since 2008.  EDIT: Found [this](http://news.beatport.com/blog/2013/06/10/at-movement-moby-gives-us-the-lowdown-on-class-a-drugs-the-internets-diminishing-returns-and-playing-really-loud/) interview where he says "And I’m not “anti-drugs.” I’m not saying stay away from drugs. . .Have a great time, just try to have a degree of moderation and self-care applied to it."   Despite having the strategy guide as a kid, I could never get very far in DW2.   I feel he would be the one to help me acheive the ego death to finally go full vegan. It is sad tho after trying LSD when he was a teen it caused him to have a panic disorder.   He's a remarkable and highly respectable guy. Even just his wiki page is a good read.   Either LSD with Moby or some MDMA with Lykke Li.  If neither are available maybe some weed with C.S. Lewis or St. Francis of Assisi.    No this is the internet.   Pull forward until stream starts so it you know where it is going to go. Then relax and let it do its thing.   So you are telling me you have zero food in your house and always eat out?   A newer one goes something like: "You'll never know, if you never do."  I can't help but think that this is subliminal advertising to get you to drink Mountain Dew. "Do the Dew"   Am I the only guy that uses his foreskin as a sort of guide when taking a piss?   In English class I fell asleep while the class was reading the book we were studying. I woke up in the middle of the teacher relaying the story about how her son committed suicide years before at our school. I just feigned sleep until we went back to reading.   Empire Ants by The Gorillaz   Tarantino originally said he scrapped the movie after the script leak. He only recently said he will make the movie after all.   Probably [this](http://imgur.com/hsFZeLM) picture of Lykke Li. She's a goddess.   In WoW if you say 'lol' in Orcish others see it as "kek".   Can you even catch hiv from mosquitos?   Apparently it was all from a relatively new, but bad batch/strain of synthetics that just went on sale.   It was meh. I fell asleep watching it.   The Secret Circle. The ending was still great tho.   Have a phone but cant afford a computer.   +/u/dogetipbot 100 doge   It is a thing. But you totally probably have a sadness fetish.    But then she would still leave due to him popping a sympathy boner.   I found a copy of the limited box set for rather cheap and was wondering if it would be worth it. I saw a couple examples of it online and was rather intrigued.   Like the idea that his member is just not long enough? Oh ok...cool ideas, at least they got a tree planted before his ED kicked in   There is still magic.   Your gaydar is broke bro. What else do you expect from a /v/irgin   I just started Sandman Overture and i dont know what the fuck is going on, but I like it.  Only recently started with Marvel. Deadpool vs Carnage, All New Ultimates, Hulk, Nightcrawler, and All New Ghost Rider. Figured I'd start Marvel with some fresh #1's   I was thinking a Captain Morgan pose.   Do those subtitles actually exist?   Would love to see it over DFW   The quality of 0 is still null.   And they wonder why places like Fort Hood get shot up.   It's from the [Kim and Cookie Interlude](http://rapgenius.com/2814746) on Stankonia. Shoot I always thought it meant toe up. Like mind-blowing good sex or something. But I guess torn up still makes sense.   I had some ask me years ago how do I assign myself to an orientation if I never had sex with anybody. . .I was a little dumb-founded and didn't know how to retort.    Yea man that poodle was kinda hot  -Cpt. Jack Harkness   Unless maybe his individual room was locked?  	103
 Interesting.. would have been nice to have been notified why.   People complain about moms all the time on here, I guess showing sympathy for a dead child, even while pointing out parental stupidity, is a no no? I don't have or want kids, maybe I should have made that clear before I dared show sympathy for a child.      Well, it isn't just parents. There's this girl:  https://www.facebook.com/supportingjase/posts/1583148091903256  ... using this Facebook page to pimp her own story. "I'll tell you the short version" and then hijacks the page with her own medical issues. Oh dear god.   I need to stop looking at Facebook.   My guess is it's drug-related. Your run of the mill burglars don't break into houses when people are home. They just want your stuff, they don't want to be seen or deal with anybody. I am assuming the people were home based on the terminology being used - "home invasion" and "robbery" vs burglary.    Yeah, I saw that.   It always amazes me how completely stupid people can be during a tragedy.    I think if you are going to have a child, you need to be prepared to deal with anything that might be wrong with the child. One of the many reasons I don't want kids myself... they are enough of a responsibility, god forbid they have something wrong that requires tons of money in medical bills and there is no chance of them ever living on their own.  That said, you have to keep in mind it is a cultural thing in some places. Hell, it wasn't until relatively recently in the United States that kids with disabilities weren't immediately shipped off to an institution for the rest of their lives. Not saying that is right, it's just how it is over there.  The one thing that kind of annoys me about this whole thing blowing up - if it were the father walking away from the mother and child, this wouldn't be news.    Not for nothing but... home invasions like that very rarely happen to your every day, law-abiding citizens. Even more rare, for it to happen TWICE, in three months, to your every day, law abiding citizens. I worked in law enforcement for a long time. Not saying it doesn't happen, but... just saying.      Well good... Someone else said it.   It's good the OP is at least recognizing these feelings are a bit exaggerated. When I was reading the post I was thinking "Jesus, this is why CF people get a bad rap for being selfish."  Do you have abandonment issues in other aspects of your life or just this one? Something to think about.   I think a lot of people on this sub get so wrapped around the axle about people not accepting their choice to be CF... Yet they don't accept other people's choice to have a family if that's what they want.    Yep. Long term care insurance is cheaper than having kids, and better peace of mind.    God, I'm sorry. I was actually thinking about that when I looked up the program earlier. I would love to volunteer but the things that I am interested in doing are things that would break my heart, too. I went to ONE volunteer meeting at the SPCA years ago and could tell immediately that I would be coming home a mess every day. I thought about volunteering in a nursing home around the corner from my house, but same thing. Just a depressing environment and so much potential for loss just around the corner.    Elderfriends - never heard of it but it sounds like something I might be interested in!   Check out r/relationships and you will see people with the same concerns and doubts, on a variety of different topics. It's not just a childfree thing.    Who knows if these issues stem from bad/lazy parenting or if the kid is just a bad seed? I can't imagine feeling afraid of something I brought into this world and can't get away from because I'm responsible and obligated to take care of them. Yikes.  My ex's son showed a lot of behavioral problems that no one else seemed that concerned about. At age 2 they were excused away, by age 7 the kid was being suspended for hitting and biting at school. The parents always blamed ADHD/poor impulse control. Perhaps I am just a "worst case scenario" person, but my biggest fear in that situation was it getting worse and worse and being a stepparent to some out of control kid.       Coworker - male, older - told me that despite what I have been telling him for years about not wanting kids, he doesn't believe me. Because... drumroll... "It's in your DNA."  I don't really get too upset about ignorant comments about not having kids because they are, well, ignorant. Sexist comments are a whole other thing. This dude also tells me I should marry a rich guy so I can quit my well-paying job and focus on my  hobbies. Mmhmm.      This is like studying logic and reason to argue with born-again Christians. Or learning to speak Arabic to argue with someone who only speaks Spanish.   Don't waste your time even getting into conversations where you have to defend yourself. Logic and reason aren't really involved in some things, including falling in love and having children.    Same here. Pretty sure mine had borderline personality disorder or something along those lines. I was not a happy child. I love my grandmother and we are very close but it's clear to me that she wasn't the best mother to my mom either. If that is in me at all, no thank you. I will spare my poor unborn child that misery.   My sister seems to be doing fine with her kids so I don't know.   When I was dating a single dad I was watching his son as a favor one day. It was a hard day which culminated in the kid smarting off to me during bath time that evening. I lost it. I just lost it. Not like hitting or violence but I was screaming and out of control just like my mother. It scared the hell out of me.   My ex reassured me that all parents flip out like that now and again. I don't care. It made me extremely uncomfortable. No way.      Yes, definitely. My mother acted like my sister and I were a complete burden most of the time. I'm sure I internalized that and of course it would affect how I look at kids.   I ended up dating a single dad and both he and his ex-wife acted the same way about their kid. It was very clear that kid was an obligation and a huge burden. So that didn't help my perception either.    Someone commented "oh no is she sick?" Mom said "No she was tired and she doesn't like being in a shopping cart that long." Awesome      Ha, yeah. "Mine isn't, and neither am I."   I'd like to wrap a rope around some of these people's necks so they can't get away and then run up to them and be all up in their face and see how THEY react.   We do, but it would be nice to enjoy the park.  Honestly I should just take her anyway - if something were to happen with an off-leash dog, I've been assured by Animal Control that I wouldn't be held responsible. I just get so stressed out with off-leash dogs that it isn't worth it.   My dog is very defensive on a leash since she was attacked by two dogs last year (requiring surgery, it was a big deal). I live close to Bryan Park and I can't take her there on a leash because of all the idiots who let their dogs run loose. I don't know how she will react to a dog now and I don't want to find out. I don't get why this doesn't occur to people who let their dogs run around and run up to other strange dogs.  It's unfortunate, because my dog has issues due to no fault of ours, but I'll look like the a**hole for taking her out in public, even on a leash, if something happens.   I went through this last year. You have to think about interest rates too, if they are going to be higher by the time you have that 20%.   I put 5% down on my house and I have PMI. You can always buy something now and then aggressively pay down the principal to get rid of the PMI. With my loan, I can request it be removed when I reach 78% loan to equity value.   Jesus! Yeah, figured someone died there (obviously) but I figured it was just some gang thuggery. That is truly awful.    You'll be fine! I completely get it. I was super uncomfortable around kids when my first niece was born. It goes away. The worst thing for me was just getting over the feeling that everyone else was watching me like a hawk because my whole family knew I wasn't a kid person.   I love my nieces but they are like any other kids... They are a bit much after awhile. Luckily you can enjoy the fun parts of kids being around, with zero responsibility. And when they get loud or annoying you can take a break.   It's better as they get older and become more like, well, people.      In the parking lot behind Hardee's (on Broad across from Willow Lawn) there is some type of memorial with a wreath and flowers. I've seen it there for months, not sure how long it has been there total. Anyone know what it's for? There's no name or writing at all that I've seen.

 Hi! Sorry, I don't. The little programming skills I have is from codeacademy.  	1
 I went through all your old posts. You are clearly neither a lawyer, historian, nor an economist.   You don't understand what fiat money is:  http://us.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/26tsah/eli5_how_does_fiat_currency_come_to_exist/chunujc  This was racist:  http://us.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/26tk4f/bully_gets_what_she_deserves_after_making_fun_of/chuo0le  And this is the topper on the cake:  http://us.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/206kl2/eli5_the_gay_agenda/cg15ofs  The real bitch is, you and I should be on the same side. We both respect the Constitution, we have a similar love for history -  http://us.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1zrcs4/the_battle_of_bunker_hill_1775_charlestown_ma/cfwhy3t  -we have a similar background in economics-  http://us.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/206nka/eli5_if_war_stimulates_a_countrys_economy_why/cg09p7o  - and we both want to limit the powers of the government:  http://us.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/206i86/eli5_what_does_the_nsa_really_gain_from_spying_on/cg08eju  If only I could redirect the misplaced paranoia found here:  http://us.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1zprv6/college_grads_taking_lowwage_jobs_displace_less/cfwevm8  (re: the government is going to reinstate slavery, they're takin' our jerbbbs!)  into fighting a problem that actually exists like the crippling prison-industrial complex, the government overreach from the NSA and the Patriot Act, and an economically suicidal war-based foreign policy.  ....Come to the dark side......   The US Supreme Court upheld ACA as constitutional; therefore, by definition it is constitutional.   Go back to civics class.    I'm down    ^ This is little more than an argument for apathy. Wrongful conviction compensations are hardly above the poverty line per year. This guy missed out on nearly 2 decades, thats a marriage and a career. I hardly call that sorted for the rest of his life. And he's one of the lucky ones, the tiny minority who have the means to launch a private investigation from their cell and get an exoneration in the first place. The real problem is a systemic misunderstanding about justice: no system is perfect, but one plagued with racism and corruption needs work. We are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, not guilty until exonerated two decades later so we can get "1,000 extra murderers" off the streets.  Maybe an eye for an eye is a bit excessive, but jurors and judges might be more careful if they had to shoulder some of the cost of failure.   ITT terrible movies, and morons who don't understand good ones.   That movie is too good. Justin Long as doctor Lexus: "I don't wanna sound like a dick or nothing, but you're pretty fucked up."   4) Last thing, I swear, because this post has gone on super long and its time to wrap it up. Little victories. For several months of my life, the only reason I was alive was because I really, really wanted to see the last Batman film. There is nothing wrong with this. People like me and you don't have the normal drive to stay alive because we don't feel good normally like everybody else. We have to set up little rewards for ourselves that will get us through to our little goals. Having depression sucks, but life doesn't. I'm willing to bet that there are things that you will miss, whether its the next presidential election, your mom's birthday, whatever. When it gets hard, remember what you're fighting for.  And if what you're fighting for isn't worth it anymore, remember that this isn't forever. Whether you kill yourself or survive, the pain will stop somehow: the question is which one you will choose.  I believe that you will make it through this. I SWEAR TO GOD. I wouldn't have stayed up all night writing this stupid instruction manual for you if I didn't think you were worth the investment. What makes you worthy of the investment? You're a survivor. You have all the traits of a survivor. But more than that. You have the traits of a survivor who goes on to do great things.  Did you know that cancer patients who have survived depression have a better survival rate than cancer patients who have never tasted real hopelessness? Not only do you have the necessary qualities to survive depression, you have the qualities of a person who becomes a better person because of your experience with depression.  Do not envy the painless. Pity them. We are judged by the strength of our enemies. Unfortunately, we know the power of our common enemy.   But that's what makes us who we are.   Perhaps I can help you.  I don't want to make any assumptions, but if I understand you correctly, you don't want to die; you want to get better. Death to you would be an unfortunate if possibly necessary escape from a crippling depression.   I've been there mate. I really have. But clearly, your counselor has not.  When I was first diagnosed depressed, I had the world's dumbest counselor. It's natural to be disgusted by them. I'm disgusted for you. There is ONE most important trait in the person who will shepherd you through this disease until you have the tools and/or medication to handle it yourself: understanding. Trust your instincts. If he doesn't understand you, tell him to piss off and move on.  If I had to make a bet right now as to whether you'd make it, I'd put money that you do. Statistically, you have all the traits of someone who makes it: empathy, transparency, effective communication even just through text and to total strangers, and most of all the absolutely critical self-reflection that will push you forward on your road to recovery.  I can give you the tools, but I can't use them for you.   1) Get help (and probably medicine). In my experience, the hotlines have been worse than useless, much like your counselor. Our country's system is great at emergencies, and terrible long-term. Please, call them when things get bad. They really can help when there is nothing left.     For longer term help, consider getting a dog. A big furry one. I was once just like you. I too once said that I've regretted every decision I've ever made. I do not regret getting a dog. She saved my life every day for the most critical three years.     Which human can you rely on emotionally? If you have none, get one. Pay for a therapist. A good one. One who understands you and has time to take care of your illness, just like you would pay for a surgeon if you had cancer.     Confront the inherent denial. You and I both know that you're counselor isn't equipped for somebody like you. If you had cancer, you wouldn't give up just because your surgeon was being stupid, no matter how much daily pain you were in.        Remember, I'm not faulting you. Nobody should have to go through what you're going through.     Depression is an extremely personal enemy, the kind that knows your every weakness and how to exploit them. You're probably wondering what right I have to suggest that you go on living this hell indefinitely on a vague promise of a future cure. In fact, I'm willing to bet you've been feeling this way long enough that you can't even remember what cured feels like. And you would be absolutely correct. It would be sadistic of me to make you live an agonizing life alone, waiting to get better. So let me flip the premise: what if you had a goal? What if you only had to live long enough until you knew everything about your depression? Is that so unreasonable? If you had cancer, wouldn't you want to understand it enough to know it were incurable before you killed yourself?   Consider the difference of perspective between the two premises. One is about waiting; the other exploring. One is about suffering; the other about observing, understanding. One relies on pedantic platitudes to limit choice; the other leaves the suicide option on the table. And most importantly, one will kill you; the other will get you through this.  2) Train yourself to understand your pain. If you are going to live long enough to at least understand the way your mind works, you're going to need some effective, tested strategies to make it through the tough times, until you are absolutely confident that there is nothing left for you to do. And trust me, bud, there will be tough times. But I can teach you how to master your pain.     Here is the exercise. Set a timer for one hour, with a soothing alarm, like chimes or bells, nothing too jarring. Go into a reasonably quiet room. Sit cross legged on the floor. Get up against a wall or something to support your back. Start the timer and close your eyes. DO NOT MOVE. This is extremely important. Don't scratch if you have an itch. Don't wiggle when your bottom hurts. Don't move your arms when they feel weird. Don't even move your tongue. The only motions allowed are those required to breathe.       Does this sound unreasonable? It is. Too bad. Depression is unreasonable. Is it going to hurt? Yes, a ton. By 50 minutes it's going to hurt like a motherfucker. Don't stop. You can't tell depression to stop hurting when it gets to be too much.      But I can give you the secret to master the pain. The secret is in your mind. Think about what you're thinking about and then think about your breathing instead. If you start thinking about elephants, here's what you do: "Elephants are really great." - "I just had a thought." - "Breathe in. Breathe out."       Do not stop. Don't cheat. Your depression knows the difference. Your life literally depends on it.       What does this accomplish? First it trains your willpower. Beating depression means beating pain. It means doing the exact opposite of what every fiber of your body is demanding that you do. Secondly, it makes you more aware of what you're thinking about. You will need to know this when you're analyzing the cycles of thoughts that go through your head.      What doesn't this accomplish? Consider a situation that happened to me a billion times. I'm sitting cross-legged when, instead of a thought about elephants, I get this thought: "You're not gonna make it." These thoughts, mantras, chants, whatever you want to call them, are extremely common in depressive thought cycles. You described your mind chanting "I want to die" repeatedly. I know exactly what that feels like. Do not fall into this very easy trap: "I want to die" - "I'm thinking about wanting to die again" - "Why am I thinking about wanting to die" - "Well I'm thinking that way because I have no hope." - "Why don't I have hope" and on and on and on ad infinitum. This is the correct way to handle this: "I want to die." - "I just thought about wanting to die." - "Breathe in. Breathe out."      I'm not asking you to ignore or invalidate those feelings. I'm asking you to log them away for a later exercise. This exercise is not about deep thinking. It's about meta thinking, being in control about what you think about.      Lastly, do not fall into the very easy trap of punishing yourself for thinking. Remember, its not "I want to die" - "I just thought about wanting to die" - "Damn I screwed up by thinking" - "Damn I did it again" - "Stop I'm losing focus on my breathing" - "Damn I did it again" and on and on. There is no failure for thinking: this is inevitable. There is only the willpower to resist the temptation to continue ignoring your breathing.  3) Develop personal strategies to combat the cycle of depression. Use what you learned from the last exercise to understand how your depression works. For example, I learned that I was truly physically tired. I would stay up late crying all night. Then I would be exhausted all day and have a terrible day. Then I'd feel bad about a terrible day and cry all night. And on and on and on.       Your depression has cycles that can be demystified, identified, evaluated, and fought against. But you can't beat an enemy you don't understand, so you absolutely must identify what you're fighting against. What are your triggers? Social situations? Your romantic life? Stress? Money? Anger? Regret? Are you creatively in a rut? Are you struggling to find a purpose?       Most likely its just this: you have regular people problems intensified by an order of magnitude by your disease. In my case, I was struggling with the aftermath of a sexual assault. A common problem made a billion times worse because depression knows how to twist it into a wound that hurts every time. So any time I was even remotely bullied, it would feel like I was being victimized all over again. Here's my advice: Identify your triggers and develop strategies to cope with them until you can medically fix your depression.      What strategies work?     Magic Potion         Mix a drop of food coloring in some water. Label the container, magic anti-depression potion. Guzzle the potion as fast as you can. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it makes me feel better.    Throw your depression into the sea         Get a rock. Channel all that negative depression juju into that rock. Throw the rock into the sea. I know the rock isn't the depression, but for some reason the physical act of flinging the badness away from you makes you feel physically further away from your disease.     Fuzz Therapy         Cuddle a dog, cat, little sister. Don't have one? Go on the internet and look up pictures of baby seals. Remember, people like you and me spend a lot of our lives being sad. So much so that we often feel like we have no power over how we feel. But its not true. Even if its just for a second, you can change the way you feel. (One quick caveat, perhaps something you have already noticed. Depressed people like you and me don't have the same reaction to baby seals that other people do. Mostly, it makes us cry really hard for reasons we don't quite understand. This is positive. Crying is not bad. Feeling bad is bad. Crying is great. It helps us vent out that pain. Don't be alarmed if its not immediately joyful to look at cute animals on the internet. But do remember that you are causing yourself to have a different emotional reaction.)     Take a walk around the block. Throw yourself a celebration when you make it all the way around.     I'm saying that innocent executions could hypothetically be a result of the ruling that innocence does not qualify one for habeas relief, not that Pinholster was innocent.  Also, remember we're not talking about the appeal itself, but the right to even have the appeal heard, so by definition it relates to evidence that a jury and judge could not have heard. And remember that in the original case it was a question of ineffective assistance of counsel in the first place!  Think deeper than just the opinion. What is it like for somebody who actually has been convicted of murder? You're correct that newly-discovered evidence could be filed for post conviction relief, but who files? In the case of Pinholster, it was a brain-damaged crazy guy with no right to counsel. How was he supposed to file for relief on his own during the statute of limitations? Think about what this says. Yes, we see that you have evidence that could prove you innocent, but you were too crazy/legally illiterate to file it without a lawyer in time. Now that you have a lawyer, it's too late and you have to die. So what does this ultimately mean? Does the constitutionally mandated right to relief against unlawful imprisonment cover innocence? The Supreme Court says no.    I agree, but with one sneaky caveat. Let's not confuse depression, the sickness, with selfishness.  You have a right to be depressed, because you have no choice. It's like saying you have a right to have cancer. How about: "I know I feel bad, but I decide who I am, not depression, and I'm going to make the world a better place today."  It's easy to slip into a sort of denial. "I'll be happy if I just stop thinking about it." Pro-social work can be an AWESOME strategy for combating depression. But if it's keeping you from getting medication or solving a life problem, then its like an alcoholic who gives up drinking and replaces it with an obsessive dedication to religion. Is it more positive? Yes. Does it solve the real problem? No.  Good on you for keeping up the good fight. I wish you the absolute best of luck.   I know exactly the feeling. Crying is not bad. Feeling bad is bad. Crying is good: it helps us vent and to communicate that feeling with others.   Consider communicating that feeling in other ways: art, music, journaling. It can be just as relieving.  And if you need help, send me a pm. I'll do what I can. Sometimes it helps just to be understood.   I'm not a doctor, but I absolutely do not believe that depressive traits are part of your personality. The banana analogy is a pretty silly attention grabber, but the principle behind it comes from interviews with the soldiers who have given their lives in the war with depression. For evidence, I submit myself. If depression were part of my personality, what happened to my depressive symptoms? If some personality traits make one more akin to developing depression, why blur the line between traits that might have a link to depression (re: critical self-image) and the positive traits of the depressive personality (re: resilience, humor, empathy)? Which traits are the depression and which traits are the personality? I believe both. Depressive personalities can have a simultaneous critical self-image and the empathic drive to understand, say, a schizophrenic personality with similar self-esteem problems. These are all parts of the "fruit." I'm not saying all parts of our personality are great. Many depressive personalities have high narcissistic tendencies. But it is important to know what will go away when you've found the specific strategies to combat your personal depression.   Let me give an example: one of my symptoms was known as severe leaden depression. Leaden depression is when you feel like you have big clumps of lead on your feet and shoulders every time you walk. But for me, it was so severe, that oftentimes I would stay in bed for several days, only coming out after several days on the brink of starvation. Many of you probably have similar experiences. This is solidly not part of my personality, and I can prove it. I haven't been stuck in bed or my car or anywhere for over a year now. It went away with the depression. That makes it part of the "peel."  I see how this can be an often absurd tautology. How easy for me to say that its part of my depression, when I've already won the major battles with depression! But what about me, the reader, still in the thick of battle? How am I supposed to know what is part of me and what is part of the depression? But we don't get to choose that which is wise. Remember, on the road to the truth, the reality doesn't change; it is yourself that changes. I think the framework of the question is what most keeps you from the answer. Let me throw this out: perhaps personality AND depression are parts of you.   Let's return to the cancer analogy. I'm 5'6", and that makes me a pretty short guy. That's my body. Cancer is also a part of your body,  but there is a clear distinction between cancer cells and healthy cells: one of them is going to ruin your life and kill you. One of those problems is going to go away when the treatment is over. One of those problems is part of who I am, and if it's really a problem then I'm going to have to come to terms with it, understand it, revise my definition of myself, and become the best self I can be.  So back to the original question, how do you differentiate personality traits from depression? You are you. Depression is not you. In fact, you are what is going to beat the depression.   Sopranos   Debt dies in the US. That means that although your estate has to pay the debts you accrue, debt does not get pushed off to your relatives. Of course, funerals/burials cost money which your estate (aka whoever would inherit whatever money is left over) can elect to pay. That is to say that the cost of death can range from cheap and cremated to Nick Cage buried in a pyramid.   Thank God, the new guy is here. This is your problem now.   	15
 I meant girl mates. I am female.    gross   Tim Minchin fucking rocks!   I explained this to some girlfriends I was with on a night out-the whole night consisted of giggles about poo particles.    oh haha! Yes I get it. I made a typo error. Big deal. You wouldn't believe that I am currently studying to be an english teacher.    ewww   wrong-MOST girls don't fart   gross!   My fella is currently working away in South Korea. we often talk on skype and he tells me of the zillions of handovers he's suffers from. Self inflicted = no symphathy. Mwahaha   I wouldn't disrespect an animal that killed a human if it did so for for food or safety issues. The same rule applies to humans. I despise it when animals are killed for no reason-other than we think there's too many of them. What gives us that right to decide another being's fate? Because we are the top of the food chain?   Every being has a right to be here. dog, cat, flea, dear, fish, lizard, dear human and all the rest.   I'm sure many animal lovers will tell you that some animals can be better company than some humans.   You feel that our species is above all others. You feel that way because instinct tells us that as a surival tactic. No other reason.   It's a circulation thing. It's also a great excuse to snuggle up to your man. I'm cold, Give me your body heat now!    lol . .is that the best come back you have?   Well I'm happily not pregnant :)   and you have smelly feet   That depends . .if you're a gay man you may dissagree.   I have to sleep on his arm because he steels ALL the pillows!   Beastilality not cool!   That's because you're on her side!!!   then she farts. Right in your face! Mwahahah   meh I'm always cold in bed-my feet are like blocks of ice. I snuggle up nice n close to my man. He squeals like a girl as my ice blocks touch his flesh! Mwahahaha!   Schrodinger's cat    I doubt it . .blame the crows-evil things!   There's not enough shelter because of humans over populating the planet. Why not take a gun to your head and help a little with that problem.    The bit when the fat guy in in the bathroom-seriously made me think twice about a toilet break.    I love that feeling! The harder he comes the better!   You should try the implant. Awesome thing. I have a 5 year old. Don't want anymore for a while so use it. It's inserted under the skin in the upper arm and slowly releases and works basicly like the pill. The difference with the implant is-it stopped my periods {ha!} I don't have mood swings, It last three years. I don't have to remember to buy condoms{unless I wanna have sex with a random stranger} or take pills every day.   Oh and 72 hours afters it's removed you're fertile again. :)    She could swallow instead .. . that's what I do :)   My boyfriend does roleplay games. . .that's nerdy enough for me.   lol   very true   How would a pump blow his head off? lol   Ewww I couldn't eat those. You've put me off cupcakes now!   I don't have a dick.    do you?   that's like saying all lesbians are good at licking pussy. I can assure you they're not!   Proove it!      That was my thought. Even if he was asleep that would definately wake him up. Wouldn't it???   Ewwwww! cheesy coffee!   Thankyou that helps. :)   It's not the size that matters . . .   Ewwwwwwwwwwwww!   http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs116.snc3/16351_326846740326_713945326_9666477_343598_n.jpg  That's my fella   I dressed up as dead Bonnie   Clyde for a halloween party titled 'dead famous'   Cash isn't the original. Listen to Nine Inch Nails Hurt.    I can't whistle. It's so frustraiting. Everyone laughs at me when I try. :(   During pregnancy I randomly woke up and fancied rabbit stew at 4am in the morning. My partner refused to go shopping at that time in the morning.   I knew there was a reason why we're not together now lol!   Well, when there's a large group of girls, they tend to break down in to smaller groups. The smaller group of girls will get on fine together. But they may end up in a bitchy war with another smaller group. No man could sort that out. The groups will either fight until one is found to be superior than the other {but there will always be tension} or they will just stay out of each other's way.    lol. I can see that.   I'm female and I would agree with that to a degree. I work with all females and one guy-who happens to be gay. You can imagine how bitchy it gets!   but then gf can't breed the cat. gf sulks alot   When I'm looking for tattoo ideas I can go through the search results for hours.   When I worked in a busy club a 70 odd year old guy came up to me. He looked like an english gentleman. He said 'I would love you take you home and make sex to you'  I was freaked!  He tipped me £30 though!   They didn't need to kill the poor . .big thing   I don't think so. The boss usually sorts out the rota in advance- cover is usually only needed when people phone in sick on the day. It's a children's nursery so no meetings or office time.    I hadn't thought of that. I might do it-although I'll probably get more stick for it. :/   Really? I head differently. Damn. I wonder who they'll get as a permenant drummer then.   uk. He only got custody because at 18 years old {he's 6 years older than me} I didn't know how to fight in a court room. He kicked me out so I had to stay with family until I got my own place. I was also completely heart broken. I didn't start putting up a fight until it was too late. I'm now 23. He's denied me access most of this year, but when it goes back to court he will have give me back my weekends. One more screw up from him and I'll get custody. Our daughter is 5 years old.   They are certainly not joking. :(   I've thought about 'walking away' many times. And have come very close to doing so. But partly maternal instinct and guilt keep me fighting. What sort of mother just gives up on her child? She's 5 years old. He will tell her that I abandoned her. Not a nice feeling for her to have whilst growing up. Also social services have been involved and she has told them that she wants to her mummy and she misses her.   After the next court hearing, the current court order will be re enforced. I will get her back on weekend again. If he steps out of line again-I will gain main custody. I don't want to stop my daughter seeing her Dad. It's not my right to do so. She has the right to see both her parents.  I will always maintain that rule.   	59
 I try to count back from 10 but it's still really hard... what do you do to calm down? I get really angry like a spike of emotion, then I get angry and sad at myself for being so petty  	1
 Some by lightening, but sadly they are looking into arson for the Waldo Canyon fire. I hope they are wrong about that though.   Just wanted to say Thank You for what you guys do.   Wow, way to categorise everyone and cite an article from 2010....   We love you and your firefighters.   Well, I'm in Colorado and trying to reach out to other CO people and the people across Reddit who have specifically asked how they can help in various subreddits. It's not my fault if, when the California and Texas fires happened, no one looked to social media to try and spread a message of help. I wasn't on Reddit back then, but if I had been and I had known a way to help, I would have posted it here.   http://www.helpcoloradonow.org/   Us too, we had seen it coming back from the Garden of the Gods and thought it would be great to take the kids. Good news is that they are already saying they will rebuild. Very positive people considering the circumstances.   This is a good point, many centres are v limited on space at the moment and are asking people to call ahead to be sure thay can store/accept the offers.   if you check my profile, you will see i just learned to self post.   Doing my best, damn wait times on posting :-)    http://www.helpcoloradonow.org/      Ok, I will try that.   how the f* do I make a self post? :-)   http://www.helpcoloradonow.org/      Will do.

Denver 7   9 news websites both have lists of places you can donate to.   I think there are some Daddy issues here :-S         Haha   I know, I'm one of those women.   But that does not work with having a two and a half year old, does it?   Edit: ok, this was bugging me but it is 'technically' possible. They youngest is 8 months, the next is 10 months older at 1.5yrs and the eldest is between 10 and 16 months older and still classed as 2 years old. This would mean the mum had fallen pregnant, at least one time, the month after giving birth, but stranger things have happened!   Thank you :-)   She only wrote the answers :-)      Erm, yes it was LOL. It was also the only time we did it within that window of opportunity :-)   Yeah, you get some pretty lousy comments from people trying in their own ways to be kind or 'helpful'. Do your best to ignore them and certainly try not to dwell on any of the 'what ifs' and 'if onlys' that will be running through your head. People panic in these situations and for the most part don't even realise how offensive they have been.  You need time to grieve, I always think of my 1st baby as the angel that allowed me to have my two children today.Y   Thank you.   I'm sorry you are going through this :-(   I miscarried our 1st child at about 8/9 weeks. We had just told our family on Xmas Eve, everyone was so excited, 1st grandchild and everything. A few days later I had cramps and spotting, 200 miles from home, called the local doctors who told me there was nothing they could do, take some painkillers (because thats not going to matter now) and go to hospital if the bleeding is so heavy I pass out. Started bleeding heavily the next day, told everyone what was happening, felt like a failure for not being able to stay pregnant. Family were all upset, had some stupid and shitty comments along the lines of - there was probably something wrong with it (not IT, my baby). Called my own dr when I could, got some great support and advice, took about a week for the bleeding to stop. Talked it over a lot with my husband, decided to wait a while before trying again, two months later I got pregnant on my birthday :-) She is now 5 and we also have a 2 year old :-)   It will be rough for a while, and you will never forget it. But the pain gets easier, a little further away as time goes on. We bought a small trinket/model in memory of our baby and it sits high on a shelf in our living room, out of the way but never forgotten.   Sure, I have to say though that thinking seems to have altered slightly since I was working in medicine and that the egg bases will always be the 1st call of doctors due to the relative ease of production and costs.  The 1st link I have is from John Hopkins. It doesn't detail the list of alternative vaccines, it simply states that others are available for children with allergies. (As I said in my OP I seriously doubt any sane vegan parent would stop their child from recieving the vaccine regardless of it's base, a good friend of mine who is vegan has switched to being vegetarian for her pregnancy to ensure the baby is recieving all the nutrients it needs, she accepts the vegan way of life for herself but is willing to put her child first).  http://www.hopkinschildrens.org/Flu-Vaccines-Safe-for-Most-Allergic-Children.aspx  The link here, has a small paragraph indicating a limited number of yeast based vaccines http://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q=vaccine%20ingredients source=web cd=5 ved=0CHsQFjAE url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chop.edu%2Fexport%2Fdownload%2Fpdfs%2Farticles%2Fvaccine-education-center%2Fvaccine-ingredients.pdf ei=y2XeT6-gL6eU2wXQn9XhAQ usg=AFQjCNFM8W-5bm8Blsi1OYx9LbTH63Ed9A sig2=byz09DebXLtdphzL2CthYA  Sorry for the huge links, I am still getting to grips with my tablet.  On further reasearch the evidence for requiring/developing vaccines based upon alternative bases is waining due to incresed developments and reasearch into egg allergies and the benefits of administering vaccines to people with egg allergies outweighing the inherant risks.   The scary part is how much I have seen today supporting the anti-vaccination programs. There are some very scared people out there :-S    or fresian?   Actually, in the UK there are alternative vaccine bases for those people allergic to eggs.  None if the vegans I know have refused their childrens vaccines because of the base though.  I think a lot of the time vegans are demonised because of the extreme views of some. What about all the non-vegans who refuse to vaccinate because they are 10 years behind in the news re vaccines and autism?    Logged on to upvote everyone who correctly identified a TORTOISE in the image.   Why are people so rough on Aurora? We have been living here for three months and it is friendly, quiet and beautiful!

I lost it at 'cockshots / vajayjay pics' , but seriously, good luck with your new woman :-)   Wow, a SI_Bot fail!    Why not try Denver Zoo? Im sure they would do a zookeeper for a day package!

Wife here - he gets a slap because my boobs are not that low down!   I love that color, I used to be black cherry red :)   This lightener was designed for red/brown hair - it was a blue based one!   Ooooh, purple grey....that must have been fun to get back to a 'regular' color!   Hahaha I was too traumatized to take pics when it happened! It was bad enough for the stylist to go 'Oh MY!!' when I took my hat off!   I used a lightening solution to change my hair from red/brown to light blonde. Despite following the instructions **exactly** I ended up looking like the lovechild of Lucius Malfoy and Carrot Top (yes I know they are both guys). So, what have you done to make yourselves look better that you immediately regretted?   huge, huge upvote for you   Thats true, but he has used the phrase before in school and been warned about it. My 5 year old knows that some things are not appropriate to say i.e. calling her little brother a poo head. I certainly agree that it is by no means sexual assault.      We've been together 12 years and my husband still does this :-)   Just checked the friends facebook page (Jayme Arrasmith) and it looks like she has been found safely.  Edit: changed sister to friend.    Not the 1st time he has done it, nor the 1st time he has been suspended. Maybe he needs to be reminded about boundaries and acceptable speech again! Still think it is an over reaction from the school if the story is exactly as printed though.   Seriously? What are you, 10? 11? Mind you, you're a jerk whatever age you are if you speak to people like that.   And this is WTF because.........    I'm doing the sponsored walk in Denver this weekend in aid of March of Dimes :)   It was Smokey Hill I couldn't get into :-) Thank you though!   The same bed?    That sounds great for the kids! Thank you :-)   Thank you :-)    Thank you :-)   	74
 How can you eat so much steak in an affordable manner?   Conan O'Brien spoiled The Sixth Sense for me.  I haven't been able to watch it since.     Can I access them in America?  EDIT:  I see I can.  Gracias por su ayuda! EDIT 2:  The text is still different.  For example they'll say "perdon" but the text will say "disculpe".  But something is better than nothing I guess.   I wish I had the answer.  It's sad.  The ironic thing is that there are more blacks in college than any other period in history yet there's probably more teenage pregnancies as well.  So we're doing better, but worse at the same time.  I don't have the percentage breakdown tho.  Forgive me.   "Stop actin' like a lil bitch.  You'll be alright."   Strangely this worked better than the cookie cutter stuff.   It started with the government pushing drugs into the black communities.  It's documented and everything.  People like to blame black people like we don't come from a history of hard workers.  Insert drugs, destroy black male leadership by having J. Edgar Hoover  take down the Black Panther Party and here we are today.   Not sure I understand this.  For example in boxing a right handed person leads with his left foot forward and his left hand closer to his opponent.  Are you suggesting they box southpaw?   I used to work for Papa Johns.  Do the drivers still dilly dally and avoid hard work while waiting for orders to come out?    In the two stores I worked at the drivers would play hooky while I stood up all day making pizzas, answering calls, and folding boxes.  Also, do you know how to toss dough?   Someone needs to make a "negged" version of that gif.   Yeah it's the latter.  I already know about VLC sync.  I love it.  Like someone said earlier, close captioning is probably what I'm lookin for   Vivo en Iowa.  Hay un poco de nieve en las calles.  La temperatura es de cinco grados.  Soy originalmente de Georgia.  Por eso, no me gusta la temperatura y soy muy frio.   True.  Is there a high availability of Spanish shows/movies with closed captioning?  I know on Telemundo they have closed captions but I can't find any dvds with it.  I also can't access the captions on through my HD tv and cable box.  (but I know they work because I've seen them on other tvs)   Last time I watched a Spanish movie on Netflix it only had English and France as subtitle options.  I'll check again.   I've gotten some from there but they don't match up.  I don't know if its because I'm watching the Latin American version and the subs are from Spain or what, but its frustrating.   Puedo buscar peliculas en ingles con subtitulos en espanol pero no puedo encontrar peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en espanol.  Sin embargo hay muchas peliculas en espanol con subtitulos en otras lenguas.  Can anybody help?  I'm willing to pay.  This goes for official dvd releases as well.  Oh yeah I used both *buscar* and *encontrar* in the passage above because I'm not sure which one I should've used.    I also have a hard time finding subtitles for English movies dubbed in Spanish.  The ones I find are slightly off.  The actors are using a script so I'm sure the proper version exists somewhere.   did you give her a real chance? - no rebound, pity acceptance of relationship, sex only relationship, other. crap reasons to be with someone  It was a semi-rebound I guess. but I gave her a chance  were you attracted to her? physically, intelectually, emotionally  Of course.    what are the best things about her?  She's independent, smart, attractive, genuinely fun to be with at times.  what are the worst things about her?  She is the total opposite of me and is HIGHLY emotional.  She can be rude and cut people off when talking.  Also in most cases she lacks the ability to look at herself from other's perspective.  and she can be a tad bit materialistic.  what's her favourite thing? something that always makes her smile  Makeup accessories, Hello Kitty, coffee, tea... I could go on and on.  what was the greatest thing you've ever done for her happyness alone?  I cant single out one thing by itself.  I spoiled her at Christmas though.  have you thought about her while out with friends/work wtv?  Sure.  have you always been there for her when she was sad? have you done stuff to make her happy after?  Usually.  The only problem is since she's so emotional, she gets sad and mad a lot.  This is admittedly my weak spot because I never know what to do in these situations so I just listen and try to be empathetic.  Best thing I can do is take her mind off of it.  ever thought about marrying her? giving her babies?  Not until right before the end.  I would have kids with her.  She only wants one but I think that she was open to changing that.   Yeah she knows.  I told her when I was breaking up that I didn't think it was fair for her to be with someone who didn't care as much as she did.    Actually I was in a relationship from ages 20-27 and was really in love with that girl.  So I know what it feels like.  But sometimes I feel like I'm unfairly comparing my new girl to my old one.  But I also got my heart broken in that relationship so I'm apprehensive to let my guard down and love again.   He's not saying it because he doesn't love you.  He might care about you A LOT, but saying it is a probably a pretty big deal to him.  He would probably feel all sorts of anxiety and pressure once he says it.  I put my last girlfriend through something similar before I cut it off since I wasn't in love as much as she was.  No one should ever have to be in a lopsided relationship.  Keep in mind my actions all pointed to me loving her.  I did everything you could ask a bf to do, but my heart wasn't all the way in it.    If it's an issue to you it's probably worth bringing it up with him.   She was in love and I wasn't ready for all that.  We were together 7 months.  I feel like I did her a favor by not wasting her time any more.  But now I feel lonely and sad.    I'd reach out to her but I feel it's a selfish move if I'm not ready to give it my all.  I really wish we could be friends and I hope she's around when I get it all together but she has a strict "no contact" policy with exes.  Any advice?      **TL;DR.**  Dumped gf, right decision, help me feel better about it.   **EDIT:  I think I may actually love her.  But I'm not sure.  How can you be sure?  I feel like the fact that I'm not sure means I should leave it alone.**   Your husband is a fucking scumbag.   "Would you rather be underpaid or overrated?" - Jay-Z   Its not everywhere though.  Wal-Mart has it but Target doesn't.   http://imgur.com/a/q7b1v  It's just a start.  I got bored one day at work and ran with it.  I'm sure someone else could do a MUCH better job.  My logic was to create a basic avatar comprised of cells that I could fill in with the colors of clothes I actually own.  This allows me to get an idea how colors work together when layering.  The downside is that its very hard to get patterns (plaid, etc.) in Excel.  Also, I had to make my best guess as to find the closest color to khaki and the jeans I own.   I took pictures of my closet then tried my best to match the colors in Excel at work.   I feel your pain.  I'm in a relatively small city and I feel like I have very few occassions to show off my nice clothes.    This is funny.  I've been doing all my layering and outfitting in excel.  I created a person that looks like an 8-bit video game character and match up my outfits by filling the cells.   What are your politcal view?  just curious   Judging people solely off of their appearance.  I'm guilty of this but I don't like when others do it.   So what's the plan when you get married?  Are you expecting the problem to magically go away?  You might as well deal with it now and make the tough suggestion.   You should be.  I do the same thing, but she's only my girlfriend.  I would expect myself to be completely open with my spouse.  Some people are very private, but you're his wife and you guys should have an open-access policy.   Dude this sounds like me to a tee!  *mind blown*   I think you're overexaggerating a bit.  People don't usually get excited when a 6'10" center does a simple two hand dunk under the basket.  But when you see Gerald Green come through the paint and windmill dunk on somebody of equal or taller height then its a big deal.  Because that's pretty rare and hard to do.   I went to the store today and didn't see any.  Maybe others will have better luck.   Holy crap how did I miss this.  Thanks.  I've also started looking at albums for inspiration.   Thanks.  I will keep this in mind.   I'm confused.  Are you telling me to splash the alcohol on my face or rub it?  Or both?  Also, won't alcohol dry my skin out?   Thanks.  I read thru it and it seems like a very arduous process that he still has trouble with.  The thing about hair like ours is if you make ONE mistake its a wrap and your neck looks like a Nestle Crunch bar.  I've bookmarked that thread while I continue to do research.   ...said Walter White pre-cancer.   The Spirit.  worst movie ever.     Nice try Geico exec   What does your app provide that google maps can't?  I think either way it should be free.  I rarely pay for apps unless they're EXTREMELY useful with a slick UI.   No offense to the non-black guys.  It's just that ***I've heard it all before.***  I currently use a pair of Andis T-Outliners to cut my facial hair.  I still get razor bumps but its kept to a minimum.  Every now and then I get the urge to shave with a razor and it **always ends up badly**.  I even splurged on an Art of Shaving kit one time using the brush with the lather and oil before shaving, etc.  I followed the instructions on the dvd and  STILL got crazy razor bumps.  My facial hair is very coarse, thick, and curly.  Even more so than the typical African American's.  To put it in perspective **I can use a depilatory like extra strength Magic Shave, leave it on my face for 30 minutes (double the time listed on the container), and it will still leave a good 30% of my hairs on my face.**  My facial hairs are some tough sons of bitches.  So any input is welcome.  I'd grow out my beard if it didn't look so sparse and patchy.  Also, my beard grain goes in all types of directions so shaving with cream and not being able to see the hair is a risk I'm concerned about.  A search brought me here and I'm really hoping this can solve one of my major dilemmas in life.   There's no way to learn a language "fast."  The fastest method would be to move to Japan and put yourself in a "learn or die" situation.   SHIA THE BUFF!   I agree.  A lot of this stuff is just positive quotes and lip service.  That doesn't move me.   Just drop him off somewhere in the deep south.  Preferably Mississippi or Alabama. He'd never know the difference.   This is awesome.  I liked this part the best  But Robbins is self-taught, and his devotion to his studies borders on the monastic. **Every moment not spent refining his technique or in some way expanding his knowledge of human nature and how to exploit it is, to his mind, time wasted.**     You're in Atlanta?  I'd go to GT or Emory if I were you.  Full time to get the complete experience as well.   Tell me how I can work from home.  How much do you make?   	50
 If it helps, don't label it as "depression". Tell them what you're experiencing. Tell them you're sad more often than not, if that's how you feel. Tell them whatever depressive symptoms you may be experiencing, and tell them one simple thing - "I want help." Believe me, it scary admitting that to people you love. I told my parents at 16 about how I 'felt like ending it all', and that if I didn't get help soon, I was afraid I might actually try. When I confessed this to them, they opened up and showed me the love and support I needed, and got me to a doctor to help me begin understanding what I was going through. It's scary, yes, but you can do it.   My expected check out age was 21 - I'm 31 now. And honestly, for me, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. From 18 right up to 21, I was falling pretty deep into a drug addiction - which was going to be my intended way out. Whether it was the cocaine, the pills and alcohol, or hell, any other drug I was popping into my system at the time, I really didn't care how I went, I just wanted to go. What saved me was, as far as I'm concerned, was luck - at least in the beginning. I met the woman who would later become my wife. So happy ending, right? This is where it becomes that mixed bag I mentioned. Yes, I can say that I'm happy with my wife and how she supports me through my darkest moments. But having a check out date meant I didn't plan to have a future, which meant I never planned for my future. I didn't further my education (how I passed high school is still a mystery to me), I didn't seek a decent career, and now I'm stuck at a crap job making minimum wage. So... yeah, I'm happy with aspects of my life, but there other aspects that I wish I could've actually planned for and implemented.   I can relate. Now, I can't completely speak for how it is for you, but for me, it's because I'm aware of my depression, and out of my small group of friends, I'm really the only one who suffers from a clear case of depression - I was diagnosed clinically depressed when I was 16. My friends have all experienced depression at points in their lives, but to be depressed virtually -all- the time can be hell. Because here I am, sitting with them, laughing with them, joking with them... and all I can think is that they're genuinely happy, and I'm not. It makes me feel like I'm forcing it, faking it so that I can fit in, which begins that downward spiral into a darker mindset. If anything, I found that opening up to my friends about my depression, talking to them about it so that they understand that, 'Hey, [Echo] may be quieter than he usually is, but now that we know the reason, we understand and respect it.' My friends know that, sometimes when I go out with them, I may be in a bit of a slump, but because I can trust them to not judge me, I feel safe going places with them.  I don't know if this helps, but I hope it does.   That's one the ugliest things that depression can do to you - cause you to question everyone around you. But it's not you, it's the depression. It has a way of tricking your mind into thinking that no one cares, when in actuality, they may just be away, not have their phone on them, or possibly dealing with a situation of their own. But then again, there are the people out there who don't want to be around people who suffer from depression because they may be dealing with it on their own, they may not understand it, or - at the very worst, they may not really care. Start paying attention to the ones who DO respond, no matter how long it may take, and then mark the ones who NEVER respond - cull the herd as necessary. If they're NEVER there for you, they may not be the type of person you need in your life. They're potentially toxic, and what you need to do now is clear your mind and take care of yourself, with the help of those who care about you. And, sometimes it helps to -not- fight the urge to cry. Sometimes just getting it out helps. It helps me from time to time immensely.   Crying yourself to sleep is the equivalent of a sneeze being a symptom to a cold. You're sad, but you don't know why. Sometimes, that's unfortunately how depression works. I've more days than I'd like to count where I was doing fine, and then - out of nowhere, I just didn't want to be doing what I was doing, and would rather be at home curled up with a book and ignoring the world. Do a bit of soul-searching, explore for any causes that may be the underlying reason for your current sadness. If you have a friend you can trust and talk to, use them as a soundboard, maybe they'll be able to see something you don't because you're dealing with it all the time without even realizing it. That would be my suggestion, and I hope it helps, even if a little bit.   Agreed - and not just family, don't be afraid to ask your friends. Maybe one of them can help you out while you continue putting your life together. Sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job of it, you're just hitting a speed-bump in life. But remember, the climb to the top is difficult, but the view is worth it.  And if you truly are afraid of ending up homeless, do some research now - find shelters in your area and foodbanks. In fact - if your area of the world is anything like mine, foodbanks are amazing for the sheer fact you don't have to be homeless in order to step in line - I did a short bit of volunteer work at a foodbank in my town, and a lot of people were coming through for a free lunch simply because it helped free up funds.  But whatever you do, please don't give up.   Hopefully you find one someday. Don't give up hope just because you haven't found one yet.   Thank you for that. And I know it's hard to watch your mother cry - when my uncle and grandfather (her father) died, she was in tears almost constantly, which had me in tears constantly. So instead of talking, she just held me in her arms and we cried together. During this time of grief for your family, don't be afraid to show them that you're feeling it too.   I understand - my current job has destroyed my own ambition to work. I'd much rather just do as you're doing, curl up with something to watch or read, and just mentally slip away from the world. So this is another thing I've (trying) to get myself to do more and more - making paracord bracelets. As cheesy as that may sound, it gives me something to do, and when I'm finished, I feel a bit of accomplishment, because hey! I just made something.  I'm not saying go out and buy a bunch of paracord, but spend some of that time in your head exploring the idea of crafting something - draw, write, if you have an instrument you haven't picked up in forever, pick it up now and just fiddle with it. Do it for a bit a day, and maybe a bit longer a few days later. But what you need to do is get yourself out of this rut. And if it doesn't capture your interest, then set it down, and explore the idea of something else. Experiment. Find something that engages you, and start from there.  	9
 i really respect that. i'm definitely planning on knocking out far and reg first. starting work in august, so i'll have to finish bec and aud after i've started    2/4! you're almost done   yeah definitely. twice the first time through, then my review week again    Scheduled FAR for July 8. Doing Becker Self- Study. Thankfully haven't started full time yet, but I wake up stressed everyday. First thing I think about is, "I need to get this much done today." Sigh. Just venting. Good luck everyone else studying. Debits go on the left, credits go on the right.    crazy.. the things we can convince ourselves   are you saying you were knowingly pretending? or that you had actually convinced yourself?   have to say i agree. and LOL your username. guessing thats sarcasm   honestly this is what i think too. even when i was part of the faith i was skeptical about these people being "told" things   hey guys, so i grew up in church, and have only recently started thinking more critically. do you guys have any experiences with friends/pastors/churchmembers knowing things about you or telling you things like, "i felt called to tell you blah blah blah" or "i think god is telling me to tell you blah blah" or "i feel like you are going through this and this struggle"   basically like they were being given information about you from a higher being? do you think these people are lying to themselves, tricking themselves by attributing their own subconscious knowledge/ perception to a higher being?  EDIT:  something else i just thought of, have you ever been prayed for in tongues? do you also think these people just fooled themselves into thinking they magically pray in another language?   some of my friends hug too much. like a hug should be over the top of the shoulders. some grab me by my waist, some touch my crotch or slap my ass. i just took it, but i eventually had to confront them and explain how uncomfortable i felt with excessive male-male touching.    cereal   LOL. i ended up watching the whole video   yo keep these coming. this is one of the coolest series on this sub   kind of interesting/scary. im a male, training fighter, so i usually feel pretty safe in terms of self defense. in my dream, i was sold into sex trafficking and forced to "service" other men. the traffickers were all pretty big and strong, so when i grabbed a knife and threatened them to make me stop, they just laughed and 3 of them jumped me before i could really pose a threat. they eventually got me to cooperate and forced me to go serve a client. he was a blonde boy, and when i walked in he said, "oh boy." and he was getting ready to rape me. then his dad called him on his cell phone, so he didn't actually do anything to me. he had a dog in the bedroom and i think it was a corgi. i remember feeling so utterly broken and powerless, and really ashamed. i looked at the dog and it looked at me back, and the craziest thing was, the only person who still treated me like i was a human was that corgi.   maybe not scared shitless, but i can tell you i was disturbed. i'm 6'0, about 175 lbs, so i've really never felt that weak before. it also made me realize how scary it must be for girls. the fear of getting raped or kidnapped by a big scary man or group of men. shit   what a stud. props man   yeah if houston takes this one and harden gets some fire and confidence, game 7 away would be pretty scary  	16

I saw that lean in the trailer when it was going around that turn and I just immediately called horseshit.   I grew up around trains and railroads, I'm not even remotely interested in seeing the movie.   Dude, that is fucking awesome looking.    No, its not that backwards. TIA is cool with trans people and all that, its just more of a circlejerk towards people demanding that straight white men be shot or having their votes discounted because of the history of oppression.   It's like making fun of the Westboro Baptist church, except the liberal equivalent.   If they're short, doesn't that make them fucked down?   http://i.imgur.com/SE2Y2Qm.jpg  Does that count?

Yep, texted a few times, agreed to  a date, haven't heard from her since.   I was even being good, no dick pics or anything.   I had a motorcycle accident when I was 19. I saw her crossing the traffic, I had the right of way, she just pulled in front of me. Nothing I could do.   I lived in Florida at the time and the only thing that went through my head was "I hope she has insurance." I was wearing my helmet and it's a good thing I was because there's no graceful way to land when you flip head first over and 35 feet past a car.   Broke my clavicle and needed surgery, its a good thing she had insurance otherwise I would have been fucked for years. FHP at the hospital told me I was lucky, most of the motorcycle accidents he saw were deaths or in so much pain they couldn't answer questions.   Didn't do the life flashing or regrets, none of that. I like it better that way.   Yelling at the radio is like a national pastime.   Kinda?    This year was because there was a shit get out the vote campaign in South Florida.

Hello, would you like to hear the good news of the rendered genderless ultimate utopia?   Code be damned, that's a .jpg   But, that's a .jpg   Depression is more commonly diagnosed because of better doctor practices, the shift in general opinion towards seeing a shrink among other things that have less to do with 'life being more simple'.   Your dad probably has some depressive issues himself and solves them by getting drunk.   It has less to do with the century and more to do with the time period of you and your family's life.   Smoke until I get cancer and then call it quits. Settle my affairs, do something fun for a bit, and then goodnight.   I figure I've got until 60. 32 years to go!   ARE WE BEING REASONABLE THIS WEEK?

The problem with that, was as good as it sounds, Repubs just wanted Obama out, if they agreed before a vote they would often lose support from Tea Partyers and then have to change their tune because of support from donors and what not.   Middle ground is supper awesome in most policy, but it lacks the firepower of zealotism.   OK, allow me to rephrase, the lot of you have shit taste in clothing on women.   4 years? That's all?   "Schoolgirl" is to that, as wet is to desert.   Plaid skirt =/=schoolgirl.   Seriously, I really wanted this to be 55 year old secretary who drives a station wagon.   Yeah, I imagine a 2-1 favored candidate being removed from possibility because the other party funded the none vote.   This would actually undermine democracy even more than two shitty candidates.

The problem is they 'know' they are right.   So the problem is two-fold, they don't know they are a douche-canoe, and they're stupid.   Somebody downvoted the first comment, so i was saying that the person who downvoted, missed the joke.   I think someone missed the joke.   I'M A MOM AND I KNOW BETTER THAN THOSE STUPID SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE REPEATABLE EXPERIMENTS, YEARS OF STUDY, AND DECADES OF EXPERIENCE.   No, bitch you don't. Fuck off.   I really don't understand how people can't figure out tongue *AND* fingers.   I thought it was a bullet of one type against a target of the other.   Eh, the more you know.   I thought it was a bullet of one type against a target of the other.   Eh, the more you know.   We slammed one metal into another metal and vaporized a city.  TWICE.   They were being serious. /s   That sucks.   It really is horrible how people have to keep their own safety in mind when doing anything.    I actively try to make myself downwind, around the corner, etc, but I cannot control the goddamn wind. Smoking is not the only thing that can kill you and statistically speaking, if you don't smoke or live with a smoker, then you have more important things to worry about.   Like almost anything else.   Its just a subtle way of saying 'your opinion is shit, and I am judging you for it.'   Light could have been better. Damn time change put the sun too high in the morning and not far enough over in the afternoon. Between 1-2 it was crap.   Plus we had to fight for good spots with the 100 other people chasing it.   Waiting to see the how the video came out though.            What kind of maggot gives people gold for puns?   Example:  The bar I used to work at Served Evan Williams Green Label at $3.50 a drink. Retail A fifth is ~$10.00. IF you get 20 servings from a bottle, 3.50 x 20 = 70. That's a 700% markup. Until you factor in rent, electric, maintenance, labor (and this really depends on location) etc, that bottle is 2-3x as expensive.   The markup for anything is a significant amount, if you don't include overhead.   Ahh, drummer jokes.   Rather fuck my pillow.    27 years at my parents and I came a lot.  EDIT: Especially for those nice, attractive, wholesome, young women who go to the hall.   Accidental overdose maybe. Aderall, Ritalin, etc are considerably more safe than legal opioids or cocaine.   Having used these types of drugs, you would have to experience considerable pain before you do major damage to yourself.   Well, didn't Aston make a shitty hatchback?   I've had about half a fifth of whiskey and it made sense in the manner that you were saying that coke was responsible for many deaths.   Though, going back, I understand you were saying that legal amphetamines were responsible for many deaths, and on that I would have to disagree wholesale. The numbers do not suggest that RX amphetamines are killing remarkably large numbers of people.   You don't live in Florida, do you?   And how many tech company sales do you think happened without someone being high as a motherfucker?  Pretty sure Google got started because someone had the powdery balls to sell it to a friend.  Edit: Alcohol kills a (metric) shitload of people every year. And yet adds a considerable amount to our economy. Regulated? ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY. Banned? I don't know.   I'm not a scientist.   Belief is a strong component. Do you believe in God?   Coke is dropping in price recently. Legal amphetamines are much easier to come by these days.  	107

 I have a hard time growing out my hair without it getting for lack of a better word, gross. Been toying with the idea of extensions for awhile, and finally let go of some cash. I'm still learning how to blend them and how to make them look best, but its been fun and overall im pretty pleased with them! These are synthetic.

 I've always wanted to go to India, mosquitoes and all.    Goddamnit. *thigh.     GOD YES   Thanks for posting this, I appreciate it deeply. I'm a psych major, and I've always wondered more profoundly about schizophrenia. There is only so much I can get from a book, and it's refreshing to see someone who is so open and willing to talk about it. I'm happy you're leading a productive,happy and somewhat 'normal' life, whatever that means(: I'm curious, and if you don't mind, expanding on the voices? You mentioned three?  Thanks!

  He was trapped in the worlds own "North American Champions League". NaCl.  My sides.   r/dota2 apparently doesn't have a sense of humor.   And actually it completely counts. If that had been ranked, you would have lost MMR because of that game. And intentional feeders are far more prevalent in lower "trenches" than above 4 or 5k.   If I play 10 games in a day in the high 2k/low 3k bracket, it's almost a 100% chance that I will lose 1 or more games due to a feeder, whether it be intentional from the start or feeding from lack of skill, effort or giving up for a multitude of different reasons.  And to take a lighthearted jab at you in jest, I've won games with an intentional feeder on my team. If you're so good, why couldn't you? Just saying.   I don't think people above 4k actually realize how the 2k bracket works.  If you're playing a carry and you're farming, 70% of the time you will be flamed for not participating in the minute 10 team fights your team is stupidly engaging in, 50% of the time resulting in a teammate giving up and playing even worse.  If you're playing mid and you don't gank side lanes immediately upon hitting level 6, especially if a sidelaner dies once, 60% of the time you will be flamed and that member will give up.  If you're supporting and your carry dies you get flamed, even if its a 2v3 engagement and it was his stupidity that got him killed, and he gives up.  From what I've read, yes this happens above 4 and 5k, but it happens FAR more often in lower "trenches". I would actually bet money and highly doubt a 5k could take my account and win 10 games in a row just based on the fact that if you don't play like your teammates think you should, they give up and it basically becomes 4v6 or even worse 3v7, because the member(s) that stopped trying are essentially dead weight and benefiting the opposing team more than your own.      You're fine. What is your MMR, just curious?  Also dotabuff for that game, because it's easy to lie over the internet ;)   * http://i.imgur.com/0yhhlXx.jpg  * http://i.imgur.com/3fTaDH8.jpg  Graduated in 2012. I can't find the source, but IIRC we were ranked #36 in the country in academic level for public high schools. We were the #1 high school, both private and public, in Ohio.  To graduate with Honors you had to meet 7 out of 8 requirements. The only requirement that I didn't meet was GPA. Examples of other requirements were a passing grade in Physics AA or higher (passed AA with a D) and Calculus AA or higher (passed AA with a D), and certain amounts of other credits (for example I took Photography and Digital Imaging for an extra Fine Arts credit).  I found out three days before graduation that I was graduating. And with Honors! My senior year I was less than 10 recorded absences away from failing the entire year.      Just tried to find a match for the first time today, spent 10 minutes looking for a server.  Are they fucked again?   I bet you play on US East.   Yeah it's either AJ or Whitworth, as said below. But neither of them really have any misconceptions.   Honorable mention to Kevin Huber, top 3 punter in the league.   Reply to this comment so I see it   Do it then. 1 person doesn't win a game. If so, if you calibrated to 3k then you would win every single match until you got back up to whatever MMR you are now.  Do it if you're so confident.    I'm already the best person on my team every game. And in most games, the whole lobby.    I played as Sniper with a pocket Omni yesterday. It was essentially 3v5 because the Slark fed and Huskar got butthurt that Omni prioritized me over him (Huskar was pretty garbage) and spent the rest of the game afk farming instead of helping team fight.   We actually would have completely won if Huskar hadn't have given up. DP pops ult, Husk and I both ult her, dead DP, no push. They had one or two lanes of racks at 30 minutes, and me and pocket Omni were staving off their final pushes every time, but as I was maybe 500 gold from a Rapier (which probably could have won us the game) I finally died, had to buy back and they took the final racks. Sniper and SF are both incredibly overpowered right now.  http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1320883650   My volume was up much too high for that.  RIP ears.    they must be doing something else better than you that allows them to win games and get to that MMR.  Yeah their team probably carried them to their wins. I'm at 3k and I'm consistently top 2 best players in the lobby. The ONLY thing that keeps me from winning every game is the rest of my team. If I'm mid, my side lanes feed. If I don't play mid, the mid loses and their SF goes 18-0 and we lose in 28 minutes (and before you say you should have ganked the SF, I try to. If the mid sucks, it's incredibly difficult to execute a proper gank). Couple that with people in 3k still thinking if you're mid you should be ganking at 4 minutes and "wtf why would I gank mid that's your job", and you can see the issue.  I've analyzed plenty of my own replays, and while yes there are mistakes that I make, very few of them are game-changing in any way.   I'm not sitting here saying I'm perfect, but MMR is not an accurate representation of skill in any way. If it were, it wouldn't be a static +/- 25 based solely on win/loss. It would be based on player performance. 1 person can't win a game every time. Yeah you can snowball and give your team the best possible odds, but 1 person will not consistently win a team-based game.     If you're on the same team with them (and at similar MMR), it's likely you're also "legit clueless"  That's actually completely not true. It took me 10 minutes to explain to a South American yesterday that certain abilities (in this instance Culling Blade and aghs Laguna Blade) pierce spell immunity. And I'm at 3k. Or the stupid amounts of MoM Slarks I see every other day.  I've lost every game since calibration on this account (roughly three weeks of playing) that I don't play mid. It's obvious at the end of the game that I'm the best player, I have the best gpm, xpm, KDA, etc. regardless of win or loss. So I need to be in a core role, because a good core carrying shit supports will win games way more often than a good support supporting shit carries.    It's likely that person you think is clueless does something well that you do poorly.  Yeah, feeding.   I'm still hoping Zim comes back to us.   Can confirm. Completely blew off high school, graduated with a 2.2 GPA and Honors status from one of the top 50 public high schools in the country.    DIET Mountain Dew? That shit is disgusting.   Single player games tend to bore the hell out of me, so if I want to have any semblance of fun playing a video game it has to be multiplayer. Call of Duty used to be my crack, but it's since gotten boring. I've logged more hours on Dota 2 than I'm proud to admit, and I'm being completely honest when I say this, the only thing that makes me stop playing this game is the fucking South Americans. I'd been playing for basically the past 12 hours, with a couple breaks to eat and watch a couple episodes of something, and I just closed Dota because I lost 50 mmr because of fucking South Americans.  The game is beautiful. The players are the worst thing in the entire world. I keep coming back because I love the teamwork aspect and all of the crazy mechanics, and keep getting turned completely away because of third worlders. This game would be perfect without a toxic community (South Americans).   .papyrus   ITT: No Bengals flair because we have no idea who our best player is.

The point is that money is used by ultra-wealthy individuals and corporations/organizations to influence political legislature. And that's not okay, considering the politicians are supposed to be acting in the interest of the masses, not just the 1%.  It boils down to if you were a senator or congressman, who would you support? Ten million people who gave you nothing, or one person who gave you ten million? This is a capitalist society where money rules everything. And it's fucked up.   Actually it puts them 14th in 2014.  https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php?cycle=2014   That was just one example because the Koch Brothers were the topic of discussion.

The most harmful thing about marijuana is being caught with it by any type of authority that doesn't allow it.

When I was barely a week or two old, my psychotic aunt took fingernail clippers to my nails thinking she was doing my mom a favor.

Ollie?  *IT'S RAININ' SIDEWAYS*   Don't we always have a ton of cap space to work with, but the front office just doesn't utilize it well? We're never the team making big moves.   Yeah we just signed AJ Hawk, but even though he's a recognizable name, it's not like he's top 5, or really even 10, at his position.   The Colts have won the AFC South all but 4 times since '02.  In 5 years, that number will be 5 at highest.   For only 2 years though? And he's getting up there in age.   I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to see a Bengals flair though. Initially I thought we would be one of the front-runners for him, but hopefully we're looking to grab someone younger.   We know what we're doing (by we I mean the Bengals organization, *not* the fanbase), we're putting faith in him. Whether or not that's the right decision will be figured out in the next few seasons. I'm always one of the first to criticize Dalton but he's led the Bengals to the playoffs more in 4 years than Carson Palmer did in 7, with comparable weapons.  Cutler's been around since '06, Dalton only since '11.   You also have Tannehill in Tier 6 even though he's started 3 seasons and hasn't seen playoffs once.   Not trying to nitpick super hard, but just saying.     Tier 6 (We go to the playoffs with this guy)  Considering Dalton's led us to the playoffs 4 years in a row, even though we didn't make it past the first round he should still be Tier 6. This year's loss wasn't his fault, we were missing our first 3 or 4 string WRs.   FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME   336,072   Best against Medusa though.   I love to lane against Kunkka as Nyx. Even though the Carapace cooldown is longer than Tidebringer, if you get your timings right you're in for a lane of lols.   I completely lost it at that point. +1   Hello! I'll be in Las Vegas this coming week for the first time and love beer. Suggestions?    Troll a problem in team fights? Pick Omni.  Troll a problem for split pushing? TP 2 heroes to tower and kill him/counterpush.  He's not broken.   Lydia is a fucking bitch.   3k. Nothing spectacular. But the second I get BoTs, whether it's early or late, I turn my focus to getting kills. Even TP'ing in at the last second to get a rocket kill is a huge boost for your team.  It seems to me at least that tinker isn't just a solo hero any more, he does rely on the team around him. I don't think that makes him bad, it just reduces the stomp factor.   Valve would probably do this.    if someone ganks you before travels and take your stack, you've almost lost the game singlehandedly for your team as you're now a liability during his most effective window, he falls off a lot, and to catch up you have to vacuum your carry's farm.  That's true for almost any traditional mid hero. Gank the sniper, gank the viper, gank the zeus, gank the storm, etc. Just because there are ways to counter him doesn't mean he's bad.  Maxing Q/W in lane is extremely strong against most heroes. I've gotten more kills then I can count because of a rocket to drop them a tad, wait for it to come off CD (this works best against mids that don't run bottles), laser, rocket, rearm, rocket. It's definitely not as easy as it was before, but in my personal opinion he isn't bad.   Tinker just relies on a team moreso now than he did before. He's also not supposed to be a carry, he's a core. There's a difference. March spam defending T3's is still not something to be underestimated.  I'm 12-4 in my last 16 games as tinker. Granted, this is on my smurf account so many of the games were against lower skilled players, but really he's not fundamentally different from a Viper mid. Viper falls off late game, but it's his participation in the 2-3 hero ganks/skirmishes in the 15-30 minute range that can give your team an advantage. The way I played him, I would almost stop farming creeps altogether and consistently solo kill the heroes I was able to. This frees up farm for our hard carry, gives me ~400 gpm if I get two kills a minute (which shouldn't be hard unless you're losing or the enemy team picked a lineup that groups up early mid game and pushes), and sets the opposing team back on farm and levels because I'm constantly killing 2 of them.    Tinker was almost always weak late game. BKB completely countered him. He's a hero now that can still stomp in the hands of a skilled player, but not everyone can pick him and win a game solo. He was overpowered before the eblade/march nerfs, but I actually think he's balanced now.    It takes a lot more skill to be a dominating tinker after the march nerf than before. While that doesn't necessarily change pro play as much, it destroyed him in pubs.   My winrate as tinker is higher than any hero. He's not a bad and weak pick, but these days you can't take over a game like you used to be able to. I would go something like 30-2 in a 40 minute game before the eblade/march nerf because I had BoT, SR, Blink, Dagon1, Bottle before 20 minutes from ancient stacks and that's enough burst damage to fuck almost anyone over anywhere on the map at that time. I would just pick off supports for the next 5 minutes, get my eblade or Dagon5 and then I was near unstoppable.  You can't easily do that any more, so tinker is less of a mid-game dominator and relies more on his team for assistance. It doesn't make him bad, it just makes him less of a snowball hero.     The age of dagon/eblade ended with the nerf to march and eblade. Don't remember exactly what patch that was though.  Although I still play it occasionally. The projectile on eblade wasn't even a huge nerf, you can still 100-0 someone if you just blink on top of them, eblade and light them the fuck up, depending on the hero of course.    This needs to be answered.   We need the best DE available imo.    Did anyone else think that said RTZ and got extremely confused?   [Bengals over Broncos 23-10 Monday Night Oct 25th 2004](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200410250cin.htm)   Andy Dalton   Bengals have 2 SB appearances plz edit   Jeremy Hill. The guy only started maybe half the games last year but put up really big numbers for a rookie. If all of Cincinnati's offensive weapons stay healthy, he could get a lot of room to work with and put up even bigger numbers.   They've been the Redskins since the 30's, if I'm correct. Nobody said a word about it before last year.  It's not even an issue, it's just people causing drama to cause drama.   Why not?   But not doing any serious damage you know.   See you in a month.   I've never tried it. Do you Dc and then leave game? Or is that option not even there?   Because DotA servers are currently really shit. Especially the US ones.   I used to play CM carry when I first started out. Tranqs, Dagon, RoA, BKB, Blink, Eblade/Veil. Shit was disgusting.   Use bear as distraction...new meta    People in this MMR do not have trouble farming adequately  At almost 3k? Oh yes they do. Not all, but a very generous percentage stop cs'ing as soon as 15 minutes hits. It's not uncommon at all to see a 40 minute game end with only 2 heroes above the 150 cs mark.     [Top lols](http://i.minus.com/iSRBcJtdLyQxr.gif)   valve plz   Lol it wasn't someone in the game, the servers just choked on a massive dick for everyone.   Blink, TP scroll/BoTs, Force Staff.  I'm saying Force Staff because positioning is key throughout any stage of the game, especially post late game when items don't necessarily matter as much and it all depends all team play.   I play the game because I like playing the game. The items are cool, but since they provide nothing other than cosmetic value and no advantage for my hero mechanically, I'm not butthurt that I'm not getting any.  And you shouldn't be either, considering it's completely free to play.    What if players **had** to vote  No. It should be optional.      First punter in post season history to throw a TD pass?

Just got to this game thread. The fuck is happening out there?   What song is this?   Since nobody mentioned it: Gladiator   Don't forget Poorly Drawn Lines!   We need another solid CB to replace Newman. Dennard is looking promising, but another definitely wouldn't hurt.   Uh, he just finished his 4th year and still hasn't fixed his overthrowing problem. That's a pretty big deal.    This wasn't on Andy. We were missing 5/6 of our top receivers for this game. This game came down to Marvin Lewis proving once again he's incapable of winning big games, and also our D Line not being able to pressure Andrew Luck, resulting in the Colts offense to execute whatever they wanted. Andy didn't play spectacular, but this loss isn't on him.   It isn't all his fault. Yes he overthrows, that's the only consistent thing he's done in 4 years, but we were also missing 5 of our receivers. This game came down to the coaching staff, 90% Marvin Lewis, once again proving they are incapable of winning big games and our defensive line not being able to put any pressure on Luck, which allowed their offense to basically do whatever they wanted. I'd say this loss was only 20% Andy's fault.      Their win just made our playoff chances easier. While I'm not one to root for the Steelers in almost all situations, the win did us a favor if you look at playoff implications over the next two games of the season.   Do I think we CAN win both games? Yes I do. We have the tools and we have the talent to pull out the wins. Do I realistically think we WILL? No. It will be a pleasant surprise if we do, but the coaching staff just isn't good enough. Look at this year's primetime games and games against top teams. We get behind early due to lack of preparation, abandon the run, and rely on the under pressure side of Dalton's passing to get us back into the game. And then we get stomped to the tune of 43-17 (Patriots Sunday Night), 27-0 (Colts), 42-21 (Steelers), 24-3 (Browns on Thursday Night) because he is not the elite quarterback that wins you games.  If we lose both games and still make the playoffs, you have the Steelers to thank. Just saying.   This game was atrocious. The ONLY good thing about this game was Marvin's call in the last 30 seconds that saved us from losing. Everything else was an absolute shit show.  Dalton showed us once again how much he can choke. Our defense, albeit being quite talented, missed multiple tackles and interceptions that ended up leading to big plays for TB. The offensive playcalling was better, but we fell into the same trap at the end where we were extremely predictable. There were also many stupid and unnecessary penalties, though the ones on Green and Newman were definitely questionable.   We did not win because we were the better team. We won because we got lucky that Tampa Bay shot themselves in the foot harder than we did. If there is anything to take from this game, it's that the Bengals are still the same inconsistent team that can squeak out victories against sub-par teams and get stomped by good ones (Patriots, Colts).  I will be genuinely surprised if we don't end up 8-7-1.   These teams prioritized drafts that were aggressive early and had the main priority of taking down towers while simultaneously being good at defending their own. Their mindset was to get an advantage before their opponent, capitalize on it, and snowball to the point where they either took the Ancient or built an advantage so large that the enemy team essentially would just give up. It was objective gaming. The object of Dota is to destroy the enemy Ancient while also defending your own, not to farm heroes for 60 minutes.  If you're playing for five million dollars, are you going to play the game like Call of Duty and just kill everyone on the map, or are you going to play to win?  Quit crying.   Noticed this in both games I've played today, that when I pick a hero and go into a game I'm unable to open the shop or left click on the mini map to move the view around. I have to completely exit and restart dota in order for it to work correctly, and this has never happened to me before.  Anyone else experiencing this?  edit: I've spent time before the games watching TI4 replays, as someone mentioned below that it can be caused by spectating. In queue for a game currently, haven't watched a replay since last restarting dota so I'll update after I find a game.  edit2: Seems the big is indeed caused by watching replays. I don't want to say it's caused by spectating, as I've spectated live games in the past directly into a game and it hasn't happened.    In the jungle, if you wanted to maximize efficiency from Midas, does it matter which creep in a camp you use it on? For example early game in a Satyr camp, using it on one of the smallest satyr's will definitely give you more gold than just killing the satyr, but would the time taken to kill the biggest satyr normally instead of midas'ing it vs. the smallest satyr to get to the next camp outweigh that? Same goes with the wildwing's or wolves, do you want to Midas the main creep or one of the two smaller ones?   And as far as experience goes as well, would you want the 2.5x from any particular creep or am I just thinking into this too deeply?     IG, Vici, Newbee, they're rolling over teams with their massive amount of early push and most teams are just letting them do it.   Shadow Shaman is the core hero in this strat, and yet I haven't seen him be first phase banned in any of the games so far. I can understand not giving up a Doom or Dire Lyan, but teams are also still first phase banning Batrider against Chinese teams that hardly pick him.   And when they do first pick SS, why are teams not 2nd phase banning a DP? Unless you draft a lineup specifically tailored to defending a tower against BOTH of those ultimates at the same time, they're just going to take each tower uncontested, have more gold than you and end the game in 30 minutes because they're playing objectively. BKB doesn't stop the physical damage from both of their ultimates, if you're fighting into that you need to have a significant advantage or else you'll get ran over, and that's exactly what's happening.  The metas are different for each region. Heroes are valued differently in each region. Yes, it's starting to mix now that teams from different regions are playing each other a lot, but to me it just seems that Asian teams are drafting and banning significantly better. It seems that EU teams are drafting against Asia teams based on the EU meta, and that's not exactly what you want to do. Another example I can think of is constantly giving Universe his tidehunter, which is what wins EG a big percentage of their games.   Thoughts?    Well that was fast.   Just downloaded whatever game client update they just implemented, and I'm trying to select the hero for the three votes. When I select a hero, it shows up in the box and then disappears and goes back to the "select hero" option.  This happening to anyone else? I've closed and re-open dota and it's still doing it.  edit: Just checked the client update post and noticed it was indeed confirmed as a bug. Carry on.   To preface this, I live in US East. When I'm awake between the times of 6-10 AM, not many people are playing DOTA on US East servers so it can take upwards of 10 minutes to find a game. My ping to EU West is under 150, so sometimes I queue there to get faster games.   How the fuck do people play on this region? In the 15 or 20 games I've actually played on this region without fail at least 3 of the 9 other players do nothing but troll and flame the entire game. You don't even have to do anything to them, they'll just start flaming you for no reason. At least on US East you actually have to make some hostile action or comment to initiate the flame war.  What's more surprising is that I've always thought that EU players were supposed to be more skilled than US players. I'm no pro, I'm around 3k and the 3k players on EU play like players I've seen under 2k on US. Some of my games yesterday morning were played with some of the worst players I've ever had the misfortune of playing with.   I know a lot of people, myself included, rag on US servers for having south americans ruin games, but your EU servers are ruined by your very own Europeans.  What keeps you from smashing your computer monitors every time you connect to a game?   In the final results screen after a match you can commend or report, is there any way to commend or report after you've disconnected? I just played a game where I wanted to commend a couple people but habitually clicked out of it before I remembered.   Was playing a game earlier against a PL that was able to farm a lot more securely than myself, and we already had ways to deal with his illusions so instead of getting a BF I got BKB Basher (was up against a lion tide and shadow shaman) and was repeatedly told by my teammates than I was an idiot and BF is way better.   We ended up winning after their Tide abandoned and a few big team fights because of my BKB, avoiding Ravage and their massive amount of disable, but did I make the wrong decision? From what I've heard BF is a farm accelerator, I already built a midas and there was no way even with a BF I was going to outfarm the PL, so I got items that helped me take fights immediately.   Thoughts?   Does anyone know what games are featured in the BTS intro? When the commentators yell "He's still alive" and "They're all dead" etc.   When you're killed, say the enemy has a mythical sword and a couple uncommon cosmetics equipped; how does it decide which item is highlighted under their portrait? Is it by rarity, random or what?   Aside from the internet bill you already pay, this game is completely free. Yes, there are an endless amount of things you can buy but you are not REQUIRED to buy anything.   That being said, I would be more than willing to pay 5 dollars a month if that's what it took for Valve to implement region locked servers. Maybe not even all of the servers, you could leave the US West/East how they are, but people who choose to pay get a server called US Locked where you can only join if your IP is actually in the US for example.   I love the teamwork and strategy and everything that goes into this game, and when three out of my four other teammates can't even speak the language of the server they're on it really just ruins the experience. And I know that is true for multitudes of other players in this game.  This would probably lead to longer queue times and bigger gaps in individual MMRs between players in games, as I know it will probably be the minority who would actually pay for it, but I'd rather wait an extra couple minutes for a game than get one in thirty seconds that is full of South Americans.  Thoughts?  Edit: Looks like half this subreddit got their cereal pissed in this morning.    Not sure if this is intended, or if I'm doing something incorrectly, but I was playing a game as Enigma yesterday, had my Soul Ring in my inventory and when I would click, hold, and drag to swap it to another slot in my inventory it would activate it. I've never seen this happen before with any items, not Treads or Phase or Mek or anything.  I played a game with Tinker a little bit later and don't think I noticed it happening, although I was sleep deprived at that point and maybe I just didn't move the soul ring or didn't notice it happening. Thoughts?   I know a little bit about how to draft and run them and when, but if anyone has a good explanation or a handy link they might be able to throw my way that would be much appreciated!    Is this intended? Got LP the other night because I got kicked from a game, couldn't reconnect, had to abandon. Played through a LP game where a few people abandoned, but my team won and I didn't get credit for the win but I figured it was because of the abandons. But just now I won a game with no abandons or anything, and didn't get credit for the win.  The tooltip only says "match-making". Does Low Priority not count as "match-making", or is this some kind of bug?    Like how you can watch the D2CL, etc. in-game, can you do the same with TI4?   When you physical attack with a Deso in your inventory, does the debuff get applied before that first instance of damage or is the attack damage applied, and then the Deso debuff applied?      So I abandoned one game because the captain was a troll and picked 5 hard carries while laughing at us the whole time, and my computer froze during another game later and I got an abandon for that so now I'm in low priority. It said I have 5 games remaining, but I've played through 2 so far and it still says 5.  Anyone know why this is?   Is this true? Granted, he can't carry as hard super late game with equal farm as a Spectre or Anti Mage maybe, but if the average game time is around 40-50 minutes, isn't he still a very viable option provided he can actually get the farm? Whenever I try to pick him in CM there's always someone telling me he isn't a hard carry, but when I play him I go solo offlane and usually build AquilaPhaseSnYDeso/Diffusal/Butterfly/MKB and can literally 4 or 5 shot supports. And his ult reveals invisibles, and provides movement speed and extra gold for the whole team.  Thoughts?   Dotabuff, I'm Weaver: http://dotabuff.com/matches/579545847  I was the captain too! Solo offlane weaver, lion TP'd up a couple times for a gank because they were pushing the lane really hard and after a couple kills and a quick linken's and even quicker butterfly it was over.   I just wish I could do this in all pick or even captain's mode really. Nobody ever trusts me when I want to solo lane a weaver, even though some of my best games in unranked pubs were weaver mid.   Kind of also looking for feedback though, I played a pretty flawless game but it wasn't perfect, if some dota pro's in here have some advice for me I'd gladly accept it!  hashtagroadoutof2.4kMMR   So Mask of Madness causes you to take additional damage according to the tooltip. How does this work in conjunction with items like Blade Mail, or passives like Centaur's Return? Because you are taking more damage via the MoM, will you be dishing out more damage as well or does it not work that way?  	117

I live in Ireland and looking for a low maintenance spider thats easy to handle and is calm. Average room temperature around here is 21º celsius which I think is around 60/70 F. I dont want to splash out the cash on a heater as I just want a low maintenance spider. What would be a good suggestion for an absolute beginner? And should I raise from a spiderling?

From hearing all these heartwarming fables and tales of arachnid loyalty and bravery, I really want a spiderbro. Thing is where I live, Ireland, there isn't any big guys out in the wild. The biggest wild spiders you get here have a body the size of a large pea, and that's no exaggeration. I had a spiderbro once when I was young, Unnamed but valiant and the time has come where I want a watchful guardian, who protects me from the pesky flies of irish summer, a spiderbro like Viktor, or Gustav, a brave companion to stand tall for the summer months, but all the big busters (pea bodies) are nowhere to be seen. Anyone know how to attract a house/bath spider? (Bath spider is what I've always called them, as they always climb up the drains and chill) This would be a big help as I'm allegeric to most insect repellents, which is ironic. Thanks guys.   Oh my god this is so beautiful :') RIP Spiderbro   Most of you guys here own an arachnid so I'd just like to know why I see a lot of dead spiders on their backs with their legs curled in.

And how much times do you just have a Tiffany and Co. Box to present? [7]      Having been born and raised in Missouri, I am remarkably concerned with what happens there, as well as for family and friends in the area. Even if others have said this, it can't be said enough.    A bag of weed, a bag of weed, everything is better with a bag of weed.   I wasn't thinking about the kief [9]  I was just thinking about what I planned on rolling in, and then I would deal with that later   Trailer Park Boys references made it here before it did.   Everyone has that one friend with a bunch of lighters.    I've used a mortar and pestil (sp?) Before. It is an interesting experience to say the least. Like, I had a bag that a friend let dry out,  and it took under 30 seconds to grind this way,  and it came out joint weed fine   I was too high   First off.  What? Second off. What? No really, what?   Warping at its finest   This happens every single time I'm high. It's why when I'm at an [8] or higher, I can lay in one spot, and either create music from the natural rhythms of nature, or hear actual songs playing sometimes.   Trailer Park Boys. Fuck, I don't want to be in that trailer park   I didn't have a choice on stocking food this time around, since my parents took care of this week.

BATMAN PREPTIME!!  But seriously, if Guts were anything less than 8/10 for the reasons provided, I would be remarkably surprised. Prep time gives Batman time to form plans and such, not become physically stronger than whoever he is facing, even though he is given 6 full months of conditioning and training time.      This has all the makings of a sitcom.    I love the Jojo inclusion in this list.    Niggas. Niggas ain't nothin to fuck with    War Machine must be a faggot then   Oops.

Don't get me wrong, I like my lovable 80s comic characters, but I feel like Pym would be able to be a more consistent parallel between what has happened in the original Marvel Universe (616) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Edit: according to several people, Pym will be appearing in the Ant Man movie.    And Predator (I think) is in the ocean. Remind me why I avoid water  Edit: I originally put Venom instead of Predator. Pretty sure I fucked up the reference either way   I thought Edge of Tomorrow got renamed on IMDB   50% fact. 50% magic. 100% results. BROSCIENCE!

I love that episode of South Park   Longmire and their lovely plot writing...but seriously,  I feel like Indiana Jones and Walt Longmire would be an interesting match up   Thank you for this response, especially the last part. I talked to some of my family and friends that are in the military, and they said about the same thing. They also added that if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.   So I head into Meps this Wednesday and Thursday,  but I know I will be put on a DEP because of my braces, so the earliest I could go to basic would be late February - early March. My main questions are:  What should I look for in my contract (loans being paid back, school being paid for, mos, rank, etc)? How much of what my recruiters push is complete bullshit (they aren't focused on me getting an education, but rather they keep trying to push the possible high salary that can come with being a nuclear engineer? And what would happen If I decided to not sign my contract after passing all my physical and mental requirements (I can pass tape and am likely to get a near perfect score on the ASVAB)?   Haha I get it!   Do Stands (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure) count as powers for this? If not, Star Platinum (Jotaro's Stand) would keep Jotaro alive for the sake of Jotaro's self preservation   I always thought it worked based off of the existence of an exploitable soul that can be used to force the victim to feel the pain that they have inflicted on everyone they (the victim) have ever inflicted pain onto.  Edit 1: Victim isn't the right word, but I can't think of a better one. Edit 2: I ended a sentence with a preposition...silly me.   Question: does Thanos have a soul? Because if Thanos does not have a soul, then the Penance stare doesn't do squat.  Also I'm using the Nicolas Cage movie version, and I am not caught up on the Ghost Rider comics.   Bees on bees on bees   "Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora!"  That is the cry of Star Platinum trying as hard as he can to protect Jotaro from the swarm. I want to believe that with the power of precise movements and the urges of Stand master preservation,  Star Platinum would fend off all the bees, but I do not think he could move fast enough to protect Jotaro from a swarm of the bees stinging him. Maybe they could do the heart stop thing to prevent blood flow so the venom doesn't circulate while it gets separated from the blood cells and removed from the body,  but I doubt that would even work.    Bees hurting the bees?  ...I just wanted to be a smartass   Not the bees! NOT THE BEES!!!!!!!!!

Honestly, there are other ways of building the bonds between members that will last a lifetime. Personally, spending time around all of my fellow brothers doing things like catching dinner or even hanging out playing Xbox (not stereotypical CoD or sports) makes me feel like we are all connected beyond our memberships in our respective chapters.   I do not have any hazing experiences myself, as I'm not big on hazing people, and there wasn't really any type of initiation requirement or anything of that sort that could be considered hazing, within the wordings of both public perception and our National Fraternal Constitution.

In character, both of them would likely fight, since Wolverine as a mutant would likely be someone Alucard would hunt. I feel like most rounds would be a contest of Alucard's souls vs Wolverine's healing factor. I would give the victory to Alucard's souls and vamperic powers. Alucard 6.5/10  2. Bloodlusted: if Wolverine can chop off Alucard's head and rip out his heart on a speedblitz, then Wolverine would win (odds are about 4/10, IMO) More than likely, Alucard would go level 0 and Wolverine's healing factor would not be able to keep up with the sheer amount of injuries he would suffer. Alucard 6/10.  3. Prep: Wolverine would know what to do to actually kill Alucard, and Alucard would know how to beat adamantium skeletons and healing factor, but I would give this to Wolverine 6/10, because I think prep helps Wolverine more than it would Alucard   You mean out of his hair?

When in choir, you make all you're vowels very "tall" or "proper" sounding. If you simply relax your tone, you should get more of a pop sound, or whatever you're looking for.

Right, but he was 61 at the time and didn't need any hospitalization (or at least didn't receive any), so it was definitely less.   I was twelve, and I tried to bleed out. I cut my wrist, but I didn't fully understand just how far I had to go. Eventually I got to weak from crying, etc. to keep trying, and I gave up waiting for another day.  I also tried ODing once, but again, was too young to know just how much one must consume to actually die. I only took six (maybe more, I don't really remeber) dayquils, but that's all I really had access to. Another time I took what was left of a bottle of Excedrin migraine (like 30 pills or so). I thought I would get high, pass out, etc., but I just got sick. I mean, really, really sick. No pain relief at all, just my stomach felt like absolute hell. I decided to throw up as much of it as I could. That time I think wasn't actually a suicide attempt, but really stupid that I could have possibly died from, since I was 12 or 13.  I'm one of those people that believes everything happens for a reason. I think I went through my suicidal phase so young, because I didn't have a full grasp on just how to take ones life. Now I just have to hope that I don't go threw another one.  Hope this answers your question(:   Nice repost.   They probably do. I know people that do this, and they think it's not obvious. It is.

It's great to hear that she's an awesome person as well.  Thanks so much! Hope unifieds went well(:   I have a very similar situation. My dad is a slight alcoholic, so whenever anyone I know / am around is drunk, I suddenly get scared and nervous. My dad has done very stupid things when he gets drunk, so naturally, I get scared. For example, my freshman year of high school, he actually picked my up raging drunk (like probably 1.5 or higher blood-alcohol level).  It is a naturally feeling to be nervous/uncomfortable with drinking, it just depends on the person. I personally feel like it's just stupid. Why drink something that's going to make your weird and out of control? You shouldn't need anything to have fun, you should just get high off life and enjoy it with a clear mind. It almost turns people into animals, in my mind. They can't actually make good decisions because they're not capable of reasoning. They just do.  And, to be honest, I have taken sips of alcohol from time to time, but only so that curiosity doesn't get the best of me and I get flat drunk. I just sip on it, realize it's gross, and move on. You don't want to risk the curiosity of why people do it getting the best of you.  I personally decide to set myself apart from people whilst intoxicated, and have learned that I can't stop them. It's a hard concept to deal with, and sometimes I get a lot of anxiety about it, but I know that I can't deal with being around that stuff, but I can't stop anyone. It's just one of those things that's completely out of my hands.  I'm sorry that you have to experience this, it's really hard. I honestly wish noone would drink; it's so stupid, and people die everyday from it. You just have to accept that it's a social norm and not much you can do about it, but decide that you're not going to.   Tl;dr   It sucks, and you're feelings are totally normal, but you can only control what you do.  EDIT:  Crazy typo on BAC, fix courtesy of nomopyt   What about with the couple?   I was at a presentation freshman year of high school with my entire class, and they showed a picture of a Uterus with cervical cancer. The speaker at one point said "Can we get a teacher over here?" We all seriously thought he was going to use female teachers to demonstrate something beyond embarrassing, but it had turned out a girl had passed out and needed to be carried out.  Tl;dr  A girl passed out a picture of cancerous uterus.   Can you tell me the story?   If you're going to use my single brew Keurig, throw the fucking pod away. It's not my responsibility to throw *your* shit away.   This. Yes.   Ha, that would have been quite the twist!   Well, I'm a she, but I don't know about the other guy.   I know, but that doesn't make it any less something he/she made up to whore in karma.   I've just gotten back into dance last July since a loong break, and I feel ya. I can tell you're obviously a *very* skilled dancer, but we all have our moments(: Haha, thanks for sharing!   I ask that you reread the previous comment. I find your argument invalid.    Pretty sure this is a repost, but, regardless, it's adorable.   It's all practice. After you adjust to it more, it will become more natural and easy to control. I'm in the I-Can-Sometimes-Kind-Of-Control-It-Pretty-Well Stage. Don't worry, just keep pushing through.   You're somewhat correct. Users are supposed to take annoying, painful, etc. things they find in their daily life and, of course, blame Obama (all jokingly, of course). Redditors are not supposed the make things up, though. It's like if one were to take a picture of a flower, photoshop it to have two "heads," and then posted it to a subreddit like /r/mildlyinteresting. It would be interesting, if it were true.   Oh, I was gonna call butterface, but now...   It's okay you guys, it just fell off his ID. It can go on!   Yes.  When I was in seventh grade, I had a very stupid, very painful falling out with one of my friends, causing me to lose them all. I constantly wanted to disappear from sight and never be seen again.  That's when I decided to go into treatment. Best decision I ever made.   Already done.

This story made me want to cry because it reminded me that what I feel, too, sometimes is real, but it reminded me that I'm not the only one.  Stay strong.   Came here to post that same comment. Thanks for doing it for me.   This person warmed my heart that words cannot express. Simply amazing.  Keep fighting, it's worth it.   Listen to the song "Beneath a Moonless Sky," it explains it all.  Here's the version I like, but it's hard to make out the words, so you'll have  to look the lyrics.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3V_AWjZgEU      Wow, that's amazing!! I usually don't fall for the bright colors, but that is beautiful!! Absolutely gorgeous.      Definitely better than Elena Rogers...  But really she is *very* talented.   YAY!!! Congratulations!! We're all so excited for you! Please follow up after the school year starts and let us know how it goes!   You're amazing! Thanks again(:   Thanks so much!   Oh my goodness, thank you so much! I really, really appreciate these tips!! And I knew all the things about the oily skin, but thank you still. My problem is just that I don't hydrate enough during the day. It's a horrible habit that I can't seem to break.  Thank you so, so much (again)!!3   Thanks so much for your reply! I have oily, acne prone skin, so I'm inclined to say full coverage, but I'm worried that it'll be too... fake looking I suppose. I normally go with medium coverage, but I probably would prefer a fuller coverage. And I definitely want a matter finish.  Thanks so much!!   I'm always buy my makeup at drug stores / target because I'm fifteen and don't really have enough money to invest in good quality makeup. Now I'm very excited because I received a large sum of money for my birthday, and can invest in some good quality makeup! My plan is to go to a Mac store and just get some foundation, powder, simple things that won't use up all the money I received, but I will be very happy with. So I was wondering if you ladies and gents had some advice for me on what I should buy: favorite products, dos and don'ts, etc.  Thank you so much! xx   Found the link! http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1aenk5/a_friend_of_mine_moved_into_a_former_drug_house/   Not interested. Gerard Butler was a God awful Phantom...   Wow, that's an amazing story. Very inspiring. Thank you so much for sharing.   As a teen whose waiting for marriage, I'm honestly afraid that once I fully enter the "dating world," I'll be rejected for my choice to wait. I know that if he isn't willing to wait either, I should be strong in my decision, but sex is such a regular thing in relationships now, it terrifies me. I've been told that a relationship isn't a real relationship without sex. That terrifies me...   I can't tell you how many times I've gone on facebook before reddit, posted something I saw something to reddit, and then instantly gotten downvoted to hell.   It is? Huh, found this on facebook... Someone always beets me too it :/      These are fantastic! I prefer the third, glasses are usually not the best for headshots, in my opinion. Your auditioners want to see your entire face and what their working with. You also look beamingly happy, and it made me feel happier instantly. It was definitely a stand out.  Great photos!! I wish you the best of luck.   How stupid are people?   I love this one.   *applause*   If you go to the frontpage and click on "Submit a new text post," it'll let you.         Reynaud's is a bitch. That's why we moved to Texas. Invest in a good pair of mittens, they will save you from serious discomfort.   The photography isn't great, but as for your work, I think it's very nice. Facial expressions are good and the angles are flattering. Just, as most have said, invest in a better photographer.  Best of luck(:   The color white and grey in general (not necessarily together). I don't know what it is, but it will make a man stand out in a very sexy way.   Old Spice is fucking delicious. I am instantly more attracted to a guy who wears Old Spice.   Oh God yes. This is the sexiest thing a man can wear.   Yes. I already find you attractive.   I assume (s)he means tighter as in not sagging, but skinny jeans are not the most attractive thing on a guy (though it's usually not a turn off).   Damn, girl!! GORGEOUS3   I moved to Texas four years ago, things like this don't fase me any more.   I'm currently in high school and hoping to wait until marriage to have sex. I know that it is a difficult commitment, but I want to do that for my future husband because I know that he's worth it. I haven't entered a very large dating atmosphere, so I'm worried just in general how that will affect my dating life. Is anyone currently going down this path? Do you have any advice or stories to help me out. All entries are welcome and appreciated.  Thank you!   TIL Quakers are still around.   I've had a similar situation with "hearing" a voice. I was fourteen and upset about something stupid and I asked something, though I don't remember what, and I felt as if I heard the word "yes." I can't believe it was over something so stupid, but I've heard others say they've heard this voice. I when I found out about others, it helped me believe that I wasn't just a young, hormonal girl, so I thought you might like to know.  Amazing story, made me smile(: Thanks for sharing.   Gorgeous!   Some people actually believe that...   I cannot believe this real... Congrats, femmes françaises!   you've never made the front page...

Haha, well sorry I couldn't help you then.  	90
 Thanks. Attorney took 25% of the amount accumulated since you first filed and were denied or that *and* 25% of SSDI into the future, too?

 Scared the shit out of me.. Not the bike.  The track, being on one. So nervous i didnt enjoy it. Any advice?        The 250 i had before was great height. For reference im 5'3.  The 600 is a bit tall for me.    Helps when you link me to it ;)    I'm the girlfriend and mine is the green one c:   We're sexy    I didn't enjoy skyward sword at all. In fact I didn't like it so much I never bothered to finish it.  The controls for swimming I thing irritated me the most about it. And all the other bs that came with it. One of my favourites is MM. I can say I've beaten it more then any other one.  But anyway the point is I think I actually hated skyward sword. Wii controls in general I find too flailey and I find myself disliking the entire motion control system. Just my two cents.     Horses should be moved down :P   woo this is going to be me once i finally get my zx-6r certified c: can't wait for spring. Just upgraded this year from the 250r   how did you find the final product?

 A huge problem for many people including myself is having an invisible illness. People assume a lot of us are just using someone else's parking pass and will actually confront them about it. For me there are times where I can do things fine and other times I have to use a scooter at the grocery store because of fatigue, joint pain, POTS, or whatever else. I have gotten so many dirty looks and a few rude comments because I am young and look healthy so people make rude assumptions.         If you see someone stand up out of their wheelchair to grab something and sit back down it doesn't mean they are faking it. Many people use them to avoid more pain and because of fatigue and so on. A wheelchair doesn't mean they can't use their legs.     Another issue I have seen a bit about recently is that people somehow think it is okay to give their opinions and advice to someone with health issues. I am so fucking sick of being told I should do yoga or try acupuncture. Not that I am against it, I just don't need recommendations from people that have no idea what my conditions even are. I just read something where a lady said a random stranger on the street came up to her to tell her she was using the wrong kind of knee brace. Without having any idea what kind of knee problems she had. She compared it to being pregnant where people think it is somehow their business.      People always lecture me on how I need to just keep trying and pushing with my doctors and blah blah. Which is basically all I have been doing for the past four months. I seriously don't even have a life anymore. Somehow everyone assumes I am just not doing enough to get better. Which is absurd because it is the only thing I can do. I'm not being lazy, the collagen in my body doesn't work. Which means I am literally falling apart. Excuse me if I didn't brush my hair and go for a jog today.       But anyway, just give people a break in general. You have no idea what they are going through. If a young woman is in front of you in a long line and asks you to hold her place and then goes and sits down 20 feet away don't assume she is just being lazy and spoiled. She could have lupus or a number of diseases. Public transit is another place to look out for those things. Little things like that make a huge difference.     I'm not sure I understand what you mean.    Not entirely the most extreme pain I have been in but the most unbearable has been the last 9 months or so. I have a bunch of chronic pain conditions that I have had my whole life but it wasn't until last year that it got bad. I had to leave my job and my home with my boyfriend and dog to go 2000 miles for treatment. I may be here for a year or however long it takes to get disability. Some days I can do shit but other days I can't even put a shirt on because the movement is too painful. I am a 23 year old female and I look healthy so my pain gets downplayed by lots of people including doctors.      I have a connective tissue disorder so my tendons and ligaments don't really do their jobs. Which means my muscles are extra strained and my joints are really bad. I basically feel like I got hit by a car the day before. Every day. I have osteoarthritis, POTS, CRPS,TMJ, and autonomic dysfunction, among other things. So when I stand up I get dizzy and lose my vision for a minute. I get fevers all the time because my body can't regulate temperature as well as some other things that should happen automatically. Even trying to pee is difficult.       None of my body doesn't hurt. Even my skin and nail beds. Basically everything I do is significantly more difficult to do than it is for most people. Sometimes I can't stay awake, other times I can't sleep. Even my low pain days I have no energy.        It's not necessarily the worst pain, but the fact that it is every day makes it absolutely unbearable.       The toll it has taken on my mental health is just as big of an issue. I went insane for a while before I got antidepressants. Even with them I'm not great. I basically don't get to take part in my life.       So yeah this is by far the worst pain I have had to deal with.    My sister is 7 years older than me and I didn't start to get remotely pretty until I was around 14. So a bit of ugly duckling syndrome. It didn't help that my sister was absolutely gorgeous in her teens while I was a kid. She also got our moms complexion while I got our dads, so I am white and she looks more ethnic.       As a kid I knew I wasn't very pretty and didn't care but not looking like my mom and sister bothered me. People loved to point out how white I am, others would ask if I was adopted. I hated it.       Once I was in 7th and 8th grade I started to care more about my looks. Which was basically the same time they were beginning to improve as I was starting to bloom into the woman I am today.        During that time I also was developing an eating disorders due to stress of moving and whatnot as well as the fact that I am just prone to mental disorders. I had started cutting myself a couple years before that. But my anorexia lasted a while.      The kicker is that while I started getting skinny and pretty (not that I was overweight before) my sister got pregnant and gained 50 pounds in her pregnancy. She has struggled with her weight off and on since. Nothing extreme, she's has definitely never been plus sized. It was weird though that as the age gap between us became less significant I sort of also caught up with her appearance wise. Still white though.        For the record I no longer struggle with an eating disorder or self harm. Still crazy though.    There are way too many people like this it's absurd. I have had to tolerate so many trashy people that take shitty care of their kids. I swear they have no idea how fucked up their priorities are.   Yeah I have one dread and I need to do the same thing. I have had it for near a decade so I'm sure it has some buildup.    I'm not confused as to why he would thank her. I'm confused as to why she would be around him.   Yeah I can see how freaky it would be so much later. And thanks. I am still trying to deal with it because it was just a few months ago. It would be easier if I wasn't away from my boyfriend but I will be fine. Every period I have freaks me out less than the one before. Heh.   I thought the friend was a girl.    I was really grossed out for a second.    I beg to differ. Give Complex Regional Pain Syndrome a try.   Well its a hell of a story.    Ugh. I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I'm 23 and not ready anyway, not that it isn't shitty. But in the couple days I was passing the tissue it felt so gross. The larger pieces would hurt coming through my cervix and as soon as it stopped hurting I could feel it in my vagina. I would sit on the toilet and feeling it fall out of me was really unpleasant. I'm glad it happened early on at least. The biggest pieces were about the size of a mouse but there were only a few.       I'm sorry you went through that, especially being further along. That really must have been an awful reminder a half a year later.    When I got home that night, he apparently knew that I lied. I don't know how. But he thanked me. Thinking back on that makes me really fucking sad for her.                   The brother thanked you? I'm not sure I am understanding correctly. If that is what you're saying I am wondering why you would be allowed anywhere near him after that?   Do it. But really your body is already good.   Or you could just start camming as is. Your figure seems similar to mine from what I could see and there is no way I could lose 60 pounds. Just be healthy and learn to appreciate your body.    The part where the aunt said she wasn't adult enough to balance school and a job was so absurd. First off a high school student not have a full time job anyway. Secondly that was coming from a lady that couldn't take care of her own awful child without manipulating someone. That someone being a minor none the less. I know being a single parent is not easy but tons of people manage it. Even if she was watching her kid herself obviously she still sucks at raising a child. Considering her son won't get a job and apparently can't watch his own little sister. Doesn't sound like a very good adult to me.     I can't handle manipulative people that won't hold themselves accountable for their own problems. Guilting a responsible teenager into helping her when she knows it is negatively impacting her life and education is several different flavors of not okay.   I know this is kind of an older post but I wanted to chime in. My wrists are one of my major problem areas as well. I am looking to get some braces but I was wondering if you have found anything that helps. I was at my cousins wedding recently and realized that I can't even hold a glass of beer for a whole minute.    I'm not the person you are addressing but I thought I would chime in. I used to have a recurve bow when I was in my late teens. I never *really* got into archery but I liked to go outside and shoot my bow for a while. It was only a 35 lb draw but I usually would put it down after I hyperextended my elbow a few times and the inside of my elbow would get in the way of the string. Which made for some lovely bruising.        I was young and dumb and knew nothing about EDS at the time. I'm sure that now I couldn't pick it back up. My forearm and hands are way too weak. It's not exactly an arthritis friendly sport. Haha. I'm sure it's great for some of you though. I wish I still could. But I will have to stick ballet and such.    I'm all about the pan-jolele. Haha. My banjolele definitely has its wear and tear on it, it's an Oscar Schmidt and I love it, I would highly recommend it. I actually put steel guitar strings on it and it sounds even better.          I got my EDS from my mom who is Hispanic and Filipino. Her skin is pretty fair and soft compared to her siblings. Her features are a bit more round than mine and I turned out white like my dad while my sister didn't. Genetics are weird.   Very nice. I play a banjo ukulele myself. It's strange but I seem to keep running across so many young women online with eds that all happen to be super cute. The whole fair skin and little face thing really works for us. Haha. I have noticed a lot smooth facial features as well as opposed to sharper ones like myself though. It's weird.    My cymbalta lowers my sex drive and makes it more difficult to climax. Narcotic pain meds also make it difficult for me to climax as well as get aroused in the first place (the cymbalta on the other hand doesn't do that).      Pretty much the same basic response as others in this thread. Not sure of your gender. Female here though.          Before I was on meds I also had a hard time reaching orgasm until I got a better understanding of my body and my sexuality. I eventually had a partner who was very well rounded sexually and intimately who basically taught me a lot about my body and I learned to relax enough that I could have a better time and an easier orgasm.        Being in chronic pain makes us tense, especially when it comes to contact with others.We are also very used to ignoring how our bodies feel.       I'm not sure exactly where your dilemma stems from but I have learned a thing or two about sexual function through experience as well as research. I am also very open about sex so feel free to PM me if you want. If you are shy about the topic I understand, but nothing will phase me. Ha. Good luck.    At this point I have no kind of medical equipment like crutches or braces but I am hoping I can find some that will help me. I think getting around would be easier if I had crutches but I definitely can't have much strain on my hands or wrists.        Hopefully I can get some braces sooner than later. My wrists and elbows could really use it. My hips are the worst but I don't know how much braces would help. That and hip braces could cost a ton and on top of the other ones I would look like a robot or buzz lightyear. Haha. But I just really want to get to a point where I can function.       I am new to all this and still going through the process of finding all the doctors I need and getting my diagnoses. I am curious about the platform crutches but any advice or insight is helpful. My pain is just so bad. I am working on getting all my medical needs met so I can have my life back. And I am beyond ready for that to happen.    Yeah I have been wanting to take a ballet class. But I am in too much pain at this point. Once I get better pain management I will probably take classes again. I grew up doing ballet so I am already fairly familiar proper ballet posture. I just worry that it's still not what my body should be doing.    My mom always does this thing now that I am an adult she feels the need to buy me things despite not having much money. When I don't want her to buy me anything she gets upset so no matter what I end up feeling guilty.        My dad just never talked to me when I was young. Now he gets seriously sad when I don't want to spend time sitting at his house doing nothing for the weekend.          Not sure what I'm being punished for.    Apparently the way I dress. Lately I have had a lot of people be concerned or confused and ask questions. It also pisses a lot of people off and they assume I have some kind of weird need for attention. It's really strange when random strangers are more worried about my appearance than I am.   Paper cut. I legitimately have a paper cut scar on one of my thumbs.   This is a small one but for some reason sticks out in my mind. A friend of mine hosts a trivia night at a bar and another friend and I go play every week. Every once in a while the first friend will recycle questions from several trivias ago. There have been a few that he has asked a couple times but there is one in particular that is something like "What musician is also a popular designer of neck ties?". I feel I should add that I am a 23 year old female and the friend I play with is a 50 something male. Every time I answer Jerry Garcia and every time he argues with me. But then I am always right because those neckties are fairly common.   I generally do wake up exhausted. I usually just get six hours of poor sleep every night.    I just use melatonin for sleep and that's all I need. Amatryptaline made me want to jump off a bridge.    Even 100 mg makes me loopy and tired.   Gabapentin makes me sick. I can hardly take 350mg. I can't imagine taking 900.   Yes.   Yeah I am very familiar with weed and have tried it all. It doesn't work for my pain. Best case scenario it does nothing but give me the giggles, worst case it helps some of my pain and amplifies the rest, or it just gives me a severe headache. When I was younger it used to give me hives. Really just not my thing. Unfortunately narcotic pain medication actually works for me unlike many of us.       Ah. Well if she is into it then I suppose you should stick to it. Ha.   You're plenty attractive, but it's weird that you're using photobucket stIll.   Your stature is large enough that you could use to put on some muscle. I also recommend boxer briefs. Tighty whities don't really look good on anyone.    Some of your pictures aren't very flattering, others are absolutely stunning.   Not a fan of the second picture but yeah, you know you're pretty.    You look like an action figure.    Your eyebrows are nicer than mine. And I'm a girl. Kudos.   I'm not usually into blondes but it.looks great on you.    I just think a lot of people fall into places in between those.    I like the hair. Not so much the facial hair. Can't see your facial structure but you seem to have nice features. The shirt is a bit of a turn off for me but if you're into it then rock it. Despite the shirt I say 7/10.   Personal preference I guess. The people that are attractive to the normal social standards aren't generally the folks I find attractive.       Also when it is only 1 through 10 I feel like decimals are important because the round numbers aren't specific enough. Probably because I have chronic pain and am all too familiar with the 1 through 10 pain scale which I think is dumb.   Looks good. Cute face, I find Asians attractive. You look young though.       7.5-8/10   Nice facial structure, smooth features. Like the other person said, kinda plain but only ar first. Upon further inspection you really do have nice features. It's just so subtle. Which is cool because you have a lot to work with and could try lots of styles with hair and hats and glasses and so on. I think you look good.      At first glance 5 or 6/10 but you're actually more like a 7.5/10 at least. And then personality would play a role. You have a serious case of husband face. Which in my opinion is a good thing.    Too pretty.    Haha. I'm like 5' and 130. But yeah, you are probably pretty chill. I'm not much of a social parasite myself. Haha.    If you don't already know that you are horribly cute that would be dumb. At least an 8 by looks alone. Mor or less depending on personality.    Very handsome. Hard to say but you are *at least* a 7 but could easily be a 10 depending on perspective and personality.    You will learn to cut yourself some slack. Not only because you have to, but because chronic pain makes you incredibly strong. I am 23 and know how you feel, some mornings I can't get my shirt on because I have so much muscle pain. I'm still getting there. Some days I am bitter and angry because I shouldn't have to go through this. But as time goes on it becomes easier to except.        I had to go on leave from the job that I love after finally getting my life together  and go back to my hometown 2000 miles away leaving my home and boyfriend so I can try and get a diagnosis. I have been here for about three months and it just keeps looking more and more grim. There is not really treatment good enough that I will be able to go back to work so now I have to apply for disability  which could take years.       I can't say it's not eating away at me on the inside, but I am fighting it because I have no other choice. At the same time I know I am strong and it will only make me stronger. I'm sure the same goes for you. It's okay to be disabled. It sucks. But it's okay and we will still have fulfilling lives, it just takes a little extra fighting.        From what I have seen people with chronic pain are some of the strongest people out there. You will be okay even if it does seem so.        If you need someone to talk to for advice or support or even if you just need to rant/vent/bitch about *anything* feel free to PM me. It is really nice to talk to people that actually understand.    Yum! Thanks!   I don't think I know of anyone who goes too often.    Yeah I'm about to be diagnosed with ehlers-danlos syndrome. Most of the treatment is preventative and just treating the symptoms. So there are no great solutions.    Yeah I can't exercise until I see a PT and find out what I can do without causing more damage to my body.   Isn't tramadol a narcotic?   Maybe. I'm waiting for my diagnoses of ehlers-danlos syndrome and have most of my pain because of my tendons and stuff.    No, I'm back and forth between Seattle and Idaho. So there are plenty doctors. But my actual home is New Orleans.    Thanks. I have realized they take me more seriously and trust me more if I bring my mom with me.   seriously.    Yeah I smoke occasionally but it does nothing for the pain.   Yeah I'm familiar with the risks. I'm just at the point where I would like to function for a while.    All I have is chapstick.    Oh my god you just made me realize that I had a dream where I was eating chapstick last night.    I don't know why someone downvoted you. If nothing helps but the meds I would much rather deal with a chemical dependency than not be able to walk down stairs.    Likewise. I'm just past the point where I can handle it emotionally.   Yeah I wish the non narcotics would work for me. But at this point I don't even care and will take just about anything that will actually help. Waking up some days and not being able to put on a shirt is not okay.    Yeah I have tried several things and some of them help a tiny bit but my pain is so severe I can't do anything. My doctors know I had to quit my job and travel 2000 miles to get treatment and be near my family to support me. But I have been dealing with this level of pain for so long that I can't handle it anymore.    I am on cymbalta and gabapentin. Gabapentin does nothing and I think the cymbalta might even make it worse but it keeps me sane. My mom was sick of me being in pain so she took me to an urgent care and they gave me tramadol which I liked because it didn't really make me high. I am still waiting for all my diagnoses to happen so basically all my doctors are doing the bare minimum.    How am I in so much pain at 23? How am I supposed to live with this much pain and no pain management? I can't even keep up with people twice my age. I want my life back. If I were a doctor I wouldn't want to give me a regular narcotics prescription either, and personally I would rather not be on them long term. Being stuck on pills to function would suck. But you know what sucks worse? Not being able to function. I just want enough to get me through the day. The kind of day where I can go to the store *and* even take a shower. I don't even care about having pain, I just want it to be low enough that I can feel like a person and do person things. I don't get the point of this, why do I feel bad for wanting the pills that help? Is it wrong? Am I supposed to just stay in pain? Because this makes me feel dirty like a drug seeker.    I add decimals when I answer. The difference between a 6 and a 6.5 can make a huge difference for those of us who are so familiar with pain.   I'm one of those idiots that just freezes. Almost every time I am in a threatening situation I just don't know what to do. The only exception is if there is a kid or something. Then it's like that where I don't think and just act. I am completely useless when it comes to protecting myself.    I needed some pain medication for legitimate reasons but failed to procure any legally today before a road trip I am on. My uncle gave me some of his. So that. I'm also not wearing my seat belt because I need to lie down. I'm so hardcore guys.   Yeah, one of those shitty hairstyle magazines.      I was just thinking about this. About how many people are so healthy. Mainly because I don't know what it would be like to be healthy. But there are so many things that could go wrong, and that one thing that goes wrong sets off ten things to fuck up, and so on. And then you can end up with these two things going wrong that together cause another side effect. Then there's a ton of other things to get fucked up.         I have also noticed that most people with serious health problems tend to have other unrelated health problems. I suppose that is just poor genetics though?    CAN WE PLEASE START REFERRING TO FEMALE MASTURBATION AS JILLING OFF?!??! I NEED THIS.   Have you ever delt with anyone with a vomit fettish? I have been trying too see if it has come up in this thread. When I was in my teens I had a yearly summertime fling that was into that. I never really did any of that with him. There was sort of an incident but it wasn't his idea. I feel like that kind of fettish isn't all that uncommon but at the same time I haven't seen much of it. You would think that it would be at least as common as a poo fettish.    I wish we did that in the US. I would be totally ok with getting my ass hit for being bad rather than being stuck in a cell for a few days.    That's my cousin.    I would like the hair if it weren't for the muscles. It could work with a lean rock climbing body type. But buff + ponytail = Fabio. I'm sure you could model for the cover of romance novels though.   I know but he is saying I am one of those girls that thinks it's cool to be all hardcore and wear Metallica shirts. Which is not what I do. It seems everyone in this thread is more worried about my style than I am.      I am just confused because when I was playing bluegrass for a living my style seemed like no big deal. I feel like someone would have told me that I am a shitty hipster or if I was wearing a Metallica shirt.   I believe in equal rights but I try and avoid feminism and preechy people in general. Just because I like my armpit hair doesn't mean anything.        I don't think labeling people is really a fair thing to do and personally I have many influences so there is no single category I feel comfortable being placed in.      But when it comes to my fashion sense there are a lot of hippie influences including belly dance and fire dancer kind of apparel. Most of my friend groupe is pretty punk rock so I do a lot of that. I really like the 90s punk style.         So I am whatever that's called.   Most guys I hang out with don't care about that sort of thing. Many people have realized it is a stupid thing to care about.    No thank you.    What vest?   Thanks.   Ha no. I was working as a musician for a while and a contortionist sometime during then. Then I got a job working at a dog rescue which was amazing and I may go back to that if I can but I stopped working because of health problems.    Ha. No way. I can hardly braid.    I am. I'm half white half not.   No, I did a few months ago and he just shrugged. Besides, I don't care that he doesn't shave his armpits. And considering the last couple women he dated he doesn't really care about that sort of thing.   What do you mean?    Haha. I do what I can .   I'm not really any of those things.   It's a waste of time for something so unnecessary. I like my body hair and so does my partner.    The piercing look?    That's the thing. It shouldn't be gross for girls and not guys. It all happened during WWII because all the men were off at war the razor companies started advertising to women. Which is a silly reason to shave. I think my body hair is feminine.    Securious.   I don't even know how that site works.   Yeah I am quite fond of my nose.   They're good live. Not really my thing though.    I think I have one of their patches. I saw them a while back.    I'm not interested in most dudes so it works out. I don't fuck guys that expect me to shave my armpits. Haha.   I really want to know. Haha.   That's ok. I have had bangs my whole life and have kept them because I have a tiny forehead. Ha.   No more sore shoulders!    I hate metal. As a matter of fact I am a bluegrass musician.    I'm not sure I get it...   I have a bunch of health conditions. One of my diseases causes all my tissues and ligaments stretch and tear so I can't really exercise besides swimming and I don't drive so I don't have much opportunities to go to a pool.       And with all the chronic pain and fatigue I could give a fuck less about the couple pounds I should lose. I like my figure anyway.    I hope not. Haha.   Hahaha. Yes.  	112
 Sorry I rushed it            How much dose weight fluctuate? Dose it depend on the person? It seems like I gain 3 lbs. here and lose 2lbs. There and I'm trying to lose weight not gain it.                              Is his name zack by any chance ?      What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the NAvy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top snuper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with my precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak, I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't and now you're paying the price you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead,             How do you stop shin splints from hurting or how do you prevent from getting them I don't know why but I get them pretty bad to point were I can't walk.         I was wondering if there are benefits to running in the cold,I have recently just started running and it seems easier for me when it is cold outside.   What do protein shakes really do after a workout and should I take them in the morning or should I even be drinking them if I'm trying to lose weight?   How do you feel after the first couple of days after cutting all the foods you love that aren't so healthy out of your diet? And is it possible to get withdrawals from soda?   Iam currently struggling with my weight and I started to get control of it by joining my schools lacrosse team,but some days I just feel like giving it up and saying I don't care how I look when  I am truly lying to myself and I have gone on so many diets and list weight only to gain it all back and I know the   bullying at my school won't stop unless I lose weight.so if you could comment what motivates you to keep going.

 Great little post and yes, we are not our anxiety! :)  I suffer with anxiety...and have suffered with depression, bulimia, self-harm. My greatest achievement to date is setting up my new blog called [The Unmarked Road](http://theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com) which aims to support people currently struggling with similar issues and helping people see that there is hope and a chance to live a normal life.   Dani xx   Hi Jkwazz. I'm sorry to hear you are struggling. When I came off anti-depressants, I had the worst withdrawal, even though the doctors said you can't get withdrawal from these particular drugs. I am not from the US so I can't help in that respect, but I thought I would message you anyway incase you needed someone to talk to. I have a blog called The Unmarked Road in which I talk about y experiences with depression, anxiety and a whole heap of other stuff. You can contact me privately through it at www.theunmarkedroad.wordpress.com if you need some support.   Dani xx  	2
 I apply anti-perspirant right after getting out of the shower. Definitely helps a lot.   What a brave mama. Just goes to show how much emotions animals truly have.          I'll splurge on foundation and eyeliner but never on mascara. I find a lot of drugstore mascaras are just as good as the high end ones!    I just came back from the vet and they found about 7 bites on her. They gave her a week's worth of antibiotics and she's looking good so far. Thanks for the help everyone :)    My cat was playing in the backyard today and the neighbours cat crawled from under the fence and started chasing my cat. She got really scared and ran inside but it wasn't until later that we realized that the other cat bit her twice on her butt. We applied some polysporin but she is walking sort of funny now. Both my cat and the neighbours cat are up to date on their vaccines.   We're taking her to the vet in the morning but I was just wondering if anyone could provide any info regarding what to do otherwise? It's my first experience with a cat bite. Kind of panicking right now :(    Kristen Stewart and Kristen Stewart       Canada doesn't use pennies anymore so technically, it isn't worth anything.    Which pizza do you take off first?   My cat loves watermelon, too.. But can only eat it if I chew it up for her.   	12
 Moves. It's tracks your movement in the background and tells you how many steps you've walked, run, cycled, and driven. Works both with internal accelerometer and GPS, so it works just as well walking around town as it does on the treadmill. It gives you a map of all the places you went and you can tag them (it recognizes businesses, and you can save your home, work, etc). It's nice to see at the end of the day what my normal activity was. I went to an amusement park a few weeks ago and found that I walked a total of 7 miles just walking around the park. It's also very helpful when you were drunk downtown the night before and don't remember which bar you left your tab open at.  **tl;dr Moves: a step counter on crack**   I use SwiftKey on my iPhone. Love it. I mainly like the dark keyboard.   Totally agree with all of this. I pay the $10 for Spotify Premium because it gives me access to 99.9% of the songs I would want to listen to, on my phone at all times. It allows me to not have to load my 30+ GB of music onto my phone too, so it's a major storage saver.  Also, the premade Spotify playlists are on point, and the radio is way better than Pandora IMO.   This is an American chocolate eclair pie.      I'm 25 and in a college town. What I see at the bars: babies. Babies everywhere.   Virginia   Music of life*  Silence, my brother.   I'm a developer but I need a second one. The issue where I am is that the companies can't even find developers to work for salary, so finding someone who will reliably work for free or even pay into a startup is next to impossible. My area is full of investors and coworking spaces and everything else a startup would need to succeed, but extremely lacking in people wanting to join startups.  I know what you mean though with business people looking for devs for their ideas though. I had someone hit me up once with his idea, which I though was good but not interesting to me personally, but he pretty much asked me to build the whole thing.   That would be a helluva lot easier if we didn't live hours apart. I try to get up there as often as I can. I do my best to talk to him and he seems to feel comfortable coming to me when he has an issue or when mother has done something, so that makes me feel better.   If I could take my brother in to live with me, it would make me a million times happier, but there is zero chance of that happening. I'd have a better chance of convincing my mom's husband that my brother is in a bad situation and that they need to get out. My step-dad is so easy-going though that he just deals with her shit without seeing how bad it is.   Thanks for the input! I've been trying to keep a good line of conversation open with my brother (we live far away from each other) and make him understand that he needs to do his best to not let the things our mother says and does get to him.   That's what I was afraid of. She reacts extremely defensively to any and all criticism.   Hi all. I'm new to this sub. Someone over in /r/sociopath said I should check it out. I am 100% convinced my mother has NPD; I won't go into the details this time. As a result, I've been diagnosed and stuck with ASPD.  My question is related to getting her the help she needs. I'm in my 20s and have been on my own for years now, so I can just ignore her, but I worry about my kid brother. He's 14 and he's already starting to show the traits for ASPD or other empathy-based personality disorders, and I'm convinced it's because of him growing up with our mother. I don't want to see that happen to him.  Has anyone been successful in getting help for their narcissistic parents? Unfortunately, she's been successful in turning most of the family against anything I have to say, and my diagnosis reinforced that within my family. I'm unsure of how to bring it up with any family members without them telling me I'm crazy or overreacting or something of the sorts. I just really want her to get better so she doesn't fuck up my brother for life.   Am I the only one who thought that was an elephant?   Precipice has always been one of my favorite words to say.   Sanguine, my brother.   August Rush   This is painful to read.   And this is why women live longer.   Hi. I've recently been involved with Startup Weekend and formed a team, but it fell apart after the event (as many are apt to do). Since then I've been attempting to find founders to make this a thing, with no luck. How did you find people who wanted to work for/with you and who were actually willing to put in a serious amount of commitment?   That convo goes like this:  "What are you up to?"  "Nothing"  "Oh cool, let's go do xyzthingIdon'twanttodo"  "No, you misunderstand. I'm doing nothing. Leave me be."   Netflix.   This makes me uncomfortable.   I just want to point out that this is not an issue only affecting big cities. I live in a small town with relatively decent people and it still happens. Not nearly as often as this video portrays, maybe once a week or so, but it's still an issue and it still makes walking around downtown uncomfortable sometimes. I can imagine this is happening in every town all over the country. Thanks OP for the post and raising awareness.   Does dogecoin mine off the graphics card like BTC? I have a spare Macbook but I assume I can't mine with that. I'm prepared to buy a computer solely for mining. What should I be considering before making this purchase? Thanks!   Oh shit. I'm still on 1.4. That might explain it. This is what I get for not keeping up with things. Sigh. Thanks!   My dogecoin wallet has been syncing for close to six months. I thought maybe it was slow internet, so I moved the computer to my office, which is gigabit, and it's still syncing. I've left it alone for three months and it's still going. Please help!   Why are fat people offended when we call them out on being fat? I don't get offended when someone tells me I'm short. Jeez.   tl;dr A guy gets out of jail and reunites his old band buddies.   Thank you so much for doing this! I was actually in Harry Potter World in Florida over the weekend, so coming home to an AMA by you is great!  So many questions for you already, I hope you get to mine.  Harry Potter was such an integral part of my growing up, and I'm among the many many 20-somethings that followed the series from the first three books and on. As a fan, when the credits rolled on the Deathly Hollows Part 2, the feeling of "it's all over" was overwhelming. How was it for you when the last movie was finished and the series came to an end?   I'm sorry but the fact that you said "prolly" instead of "probably" just made my year.   I try to be normal in a relationship. I think being open with the other person about my antisocial traits helps that happen. I slip up sometimes.   Empathy is when something happens to a person and you feel bad for them or feel what they are feeling. Things happen to other people, even people close to me, and I feel nothing. This doesn't mean I don't care about them.   Why would not find things funny?   I mainly only sleep with men (I'm female), but I wouldn't be opposed to being with a woman.   Therapy got me to be self-aware and the help stopped there.   Web design.   As I walk slowly back to the car I think: I hope it does.  My favorite line in the whole thing.   How old are you?   In my state you could lose your gun rights, but that's the only negative I know of. It's also very expensive. It's not like a prison where you don't have to pay for it. It gets billed to your medical insurance and you could end up with a very large bill.   In women, borderline and ASPD get confused for each other.   I've never cheated. I'm actually extremely loyal in relationships although I imagine I could hide an affair with little to no effort and be successful in it.   I don't say "bye" on the phone. I just hang up. In person I hate when my friends want to do the whole 'let's hug goodbye' thing and I'm all, 'I'm gonna see you again in less than 24 hours, why are you acting like I'm going away forever?'      This should be the norm.   This is my favorite riddle to ask people. Glad to see it on here!   It's OK. I'm also 25, with the misfortune of living in a college town. The young people trends are horrendous and make me feel super old.   Oh great. It's a yik yak of a joke that's probably from reddit originally. We've come full circle people.   Woah, did you just finish Journey?   I'm 5'2", so yes I could be a very tall hobbit. I'd be ok with that.   Not trolling, and way to only discount a portion of what I said. At the time this article was written, the CDC was still saying we weren't going to get it in the US at all. The operative phrase in your post is "so far". Just one confirmed case is still a start to them happening more and more here. Ebola has an average infection rate of 3 people per infected person, and with an incubation period of up to 21 days, the possibilities are at least mildly troubling.  In a fast-building story like the Ebola coverage is, an article published two weeks ago, let alone two months ago, like this one, is irrelevant.  Do your research.   I think self-diagnosis would take hours of research (actual, medical journal research) and an extremely objective look at yourself.   I dream every night, and very vividly. Sometimes I lucid dream.   What you're saying makes a lot of sense. It's more of a possession thing. When I have someone like that I'll try not to hurt them because I wouldn't want them to leave and not be mine anymore.   That's actually the reddit tagline. When the founders were tasked with creating reddit, they were literally told to create "The front page of the internet"  Source: Without Their Permission, but Alexis Ohanian  /u/kn0thing, correct me if I'm wrong.   This is always somewhere in my initial explanation of reddit to people who don't reddit.   It's what I do already.   Come on, let's go and play.   Not as pricey as some others on here, but once I put my then-bf's Corvette key fob through the washing machine. Ruined it. Cost $250 to replace. He didn't speak to me for a couple of days.   Sometimes I eat lunch right before someone invites me to lunch somewhere else. So I eat a second lunch. But I can't just go and sit there and eat a snack. I have to make it look like I was super hungry still, so I eat two full lunches and then want to kill myself and my food baby.   Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show.

Being that you're aware of the issue and how it makes you act/feel in society and in personal relationships, are you trying to get better? You say you're seeing a psychologist; do you see a therapist for CBT or anything? I've found that I'm extremely frustrated not having the capacity to have normal human interactions and I'm wondering if you experience the same frustrations.   Can you help me to understand why you think this way? The dog gets fed and watered and walked and taken to the vet if he's ill. I don't harm him. I just don't pay attention to him other than his necessary needs. So why am I am awful person?   Well played, OP. Well played.      Dude, every time a guy finds out I'm a redditor, question #1: "haha, yeah, how much of that is on r/gonewild?" Um, none of it. Fuck.

 Im just saying its not okay for guys to force themselves onto girls and if thats what happened it should be reported and he should be punished for doing it not oh she was drunk so it was okay.. its not okay ever.. And if thats what happened it would put the OPs mind to rest about his trust for her knowing what happened. OP I hope you can sort it out but its a horrible position to be in :(    So its okay for her to be pressured into sleeping with the guy? I'm not saying that's what happened, I'm just trying to work out if she was taken advantage of, or if she cheated at her own will.. He doesn't have to beat the guy he can just threaten to report it to the cops and see what the girls thinks about that maybe she was forced and was too scared to say anything the whole thing seems odd to me.   Good I hope it all works out for you which ever way the story unfolds its just for the time being and things will get better in the future. Good luck!    I would beat the shit out of the girls brother then tell her your gonna take him to the cops for sexual assault and see if she sticks to her side of the story? Otherwise if she backs out she made the decision to cheat on you and this will never leave your mind..  	4
 A rough looking homeless guy approached me at the bus stop in the city, I figured he would ask for spare change or a ciggie - he instead asks me "what's a lovely girl like you doing in a dump like this".

I was on a school camping trip and we had gone snorkeling one afternoon, our guide for the day can't have been more than 5 years older and was smoking hot. I wasn't a huge fan of breathing out of my snorkel so I was slightly panicking. When I saw from my underwater view that everyone was perched on a rock resting I was stoked. I was even more stoked to see that among all the perchers was the smoking hot guide in a wet suit that hugged all the right places. I "accidentally on purpose" grabbed his junk as he helped me climb up onto the rock. I was 12.

There was a time someone wasn't happy with our policies (her bill was very much overdue) she was yelling and swearing for approximately 19 mins straight and after telling her my surname (she asked) she completely lost her shit...."what kind of surname is that?" blah blah blah and questioning whether I was "even a New Zealander" - that stung a little bit.    I organised it for her, no worries there - just would have been nice to take ownership of her own error.   A customer had accidentally paid her bill twice, she lets me know that she wasn't aware she had an automatic payment set up and stated that she was a busy teacher ("grappling with reports etc.") so she picked up the invoice and paid it without thinking. She suggested the "system" should be clearer to remind her about the automatic payment. The bill clearly states she has an automatic payment in place and that she does not need to worry about making a payment....no wonder she's grappling with those reports...   woot!    hahaha exactly!    I heard you bleed heavily for 4-6 weeks after giving birth..is this true??   Hmm ok it's similar to when you're busting to go to the bathroom for aaagessss and that feeling when you finally go and you kind of shudder from the relief...kinda like that :)   Lunchtime.

 I might get in a lot of trouble for saying this but the Lord of the Rings trilogy.   I loved the films and the whole new generation of Tolkien fans it inspired, and I love the books for sure, but for me the films are just much more enjoyable. The Hobbit, however, is a whole other barrel of dwarves; the films are watchable enough but I don't see them surpassing my affections for the book anytime soon :3  EDIT: Misspelled 'Tolkien'...awkward...   Seconded with Fight club, in fact I just said that somewhere else on this board.  EDIT: Just realised it's you again, mega awks :p   As a psychology person, it'd be remiss of me not to say anything by Oliver Sacks.  Even for those going in to psychology without plans for going into clinical or abnormal psychology, or I guess for anyone really, his books and his writings are just brimming with humanity and such respect for people and how we all variously experience the world. Definitely a strong role model for me throughout my time at university, and definitely influential on how I view a number of different aspects of the human experience.  Just such a lovely, intelligent, and witty man, everything he writes, and every documentary he features in, is a pleasure to read/watch :3  EDIT: a word EXTRA EDIT: Hey I just realised you mentioned Oliver Sacks in your post anyway, OP. Rock on.   Yeah, and after loving the film for so long, dare I say I was actually a bit disappointed when I got around to the book :-\   Seconded. I made it through, I appreciated bits of it. What more does the universe want from me   Me too, I wish I reread more books, and there are a couple that I do go back to over the years (The Hobbit, Jane Eyre, a book I read as a teen that meant a lot to me) but for the most part I just see that as time I could be spending on new titles.   As with everything, I feel guilty about it :p   Threw up in my mouth a bit and wished I hadn't clicked, 10/10   That's adorable. I chuckled heartily   I've always felt pretty guilty about the amount that I not only sleep talk but sleep shout, actually, I pretty much only sleep shout... If I'm shouting angrily at someone in my dream then chances are I will shout it out loud too, waking us both up. It's become so routine (happens at least once or twice a month, usually more often during periods of stress or whatever) that we just accept it by now. I'll mumble a quick "sorry" and we'll both be back asleep again in seconds.   I've also hit him in my sleep a few times, usually pretty hard, I always feel really bad about it, especially seeing as I'm normally half awake as I do it, and realise just as I thump him that whatever I was fighting in my dream is actually just my sleeping SO. The first time I did it was only a week or so into our relationship, felt so so guilty about. I'd done the shouting thing before with a previous partner, but the hitting is a recent thing (I must sound like such a terrible person now, omg, he's pretty chill about it thankfully and teases me about it).   I'm honestly not an angry person or anything, IRL I'm really normally passive and quiet and would never hit anybody and rarely shout, nor do I tend to have particularly violent dreams. But if I do have them, chances are my boyfriend is gonna get hit or sworn at.  (Damn, he's tolerant, I'm going to go hug him right now...)  EDIT: Mostly it's just me yelling at dream antagonists to "F*CK OFF!" or some variation on that. Such rage, where does it all come from? Oh parasomnias, amirite?...   Ok, from what I can glean from Googling "Dune graphic novel" there was apparently a graphic novel made following the Lynch film...so, not so much of the book itself I'm afraid. But I must admit I'm curious to see it. io9 has a post from 2010 that's supposed to link to where it's hosted online but it doesn't seem to be there any longer... :(  Anyone here know anything about this? I'm so curious...   Guys...there should totally be a Dune graphic novel...  EDIT: Wait, there apparently already is one?! In which direction should I throw my money so I can own a copy?   This struck a chord with me...   "He IS the Kwisatz Haderach!"   Hey, I like the sound of that, maybe it's just because I'm so attractive I'm intimidating? Yeah, that'll be why ... *sobs heavily*   *something something* "just like your Mum" *something something*   I audibly "awwwww"-d :3 Are the two of them now friends? :p  This is precisely how my terrier would react; one time she picked up a mouse in a field that jumped out in front of her, froze in shock, and dropped it immediately. She used to be terrified of my gerbils :p      Are you a wizard?   She's basically a female Eric Cartman   I was expecting her to make him carry her perishable goods. This...this was much worse...   These are so gorgeous, thanks for sharing   It has some pretty blue eyes so there's that I guess...?   I will! :D I'm just finishing up another project this weekend but I feel that it's definitely time I turned my attentions to something inspirational and Dune related. Maybe I'll start a thread asking for quote suggestions? :   I know right? Who thought a colouring book for kids was a good idea?! http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/02/post_2.php   Don't worry it's completely SFW   Dude, harsh   Subs like /r/BeautyDiagrams and /r/Makeup are great but they seem often assume a level of pre-existing knowledge and familiarity with makeup, fashion, and beauty that not everyone (certainly not me at any rate) has.  Does anyone know of anywhere a totally clueless individual could find tutorials and advice, pitched at a sort of Explain Like I'm Five level? Basically for those of us who grew up without feminine mothers or sisters to explain all this stuff to us, and have since been muddling a long like idiots :p     They don't like women, they don't like people in other subreddits, or anyone who isn't into Red Pill ideology. A lot of the time they talk like they hate other men...I don't think those guys like anybody... :-\   You are not alone   I have sex dreams from time to time, like a regular person I guess, and they don't particularly bother me, unless they're particularly hilariously awkward like with someone I know. I always just think, "yeah whatever, it happens".   But then I have these dreams which aren't exactly sexual so much as...**completely adorable**, like I'm snuggling or just kissing with someone I know, and it's so tender and loving and PC and sweet, regardless of how I actually feel about that person IRL. And those are the ones I wake up from feeling a little bit guilty and awkward about, not the scary crazy sex-having dreams... :X   Hahaha...aw man... I wasted my one turn on a goddamn Hello Kitty bag... :(   Oh oh! And while we're on the subject, spot popping or squeezing videos, am I right? /r/popping Hell yeah.   I moved into a new flat in August last year and oh GOD the lighting in our bathroom is so bright and the wall space is basically three quarters mirror  at face height and I will spend minutes upon minutes.  Basically I'll tell my boyfriend I'm off to brush my teeth for bed but I get distracted and then half an hour later he'll have to come get me from there, my face all beat up and swollen and he'll be all "not this again god damn" and I'll have made tiny invisible or imagined imperfections into ugly marks that are gross but every time it is WORTH IT.  Edit: a word   Aw man, the compliments! The compliments make me feel like a princess :3  "Time for your facial spa treatment, my your skin is so radiant!"    Yes yes yes, I got into it because I have a friend who's really into it and she suggested I watch a couple, so we talk about it sometimes, though I watch only occasionally myself these days. But yeah, it's the sort of thing that'd be really awkward to explain if someone walked in on you watching it...   Good choice. Also Heather Feather, if you find that you like the RP type videos, she's such a sweetie :3 they pretty much all are, actually   Yes, thank you, I love this site, such a good read   Oh man, this is just making me really sad, if anything :( especially when she mentions that she lives with her parents, they must be really worried for her.  Also, ew, my vagina just about clamped shut reading this.   Please deliver! Like, maybe this isn't the most popular comment ever but each one of us is a person who really frigging wants to see this picture!   This happened once to me! I was such a superstitious kid, unlike now, being a super suck-the-fun-out-of-everything-mega-skeptic, and I had lost a bag of mine, a Hello Kitty bag, for those who care. It was gone for days and it was bugging me so so much and I had turned the house top to bottom looking for it. I must have been about 10 or 11 and I thought "meh, maybe if I just focus on it really hard I'll be able to do some kind of remote viewing psychic voodoo or whatever".  Sat down and thought about the bag as vividly as I could and then the cupboard in our hall came to mind, equally vividly, the very first location that did come mind, too. Sure enough it was there, someone else must have tidied it away as I certainly hadn't put it there and it was completely an unlikely place for it, this was where we'd normally put things like phone books and stolen IKEA pencils, you know, hallway junk, but not bags.  Needless to say it never happened again or anything similar, as cool as I thought it was at the time and as hard as I tried to repeat it. The brain's a big place that remembers stuff you may have explicitly forgotten and we have plenty of unremarkable experiences in our lives, so...yeah, probs just a neat fluke/coincidence. But it totally rocked my 10/11 y/o mind.   This is a lovely idea, maybe I'll try live my life more like that's actually the case, thank you :)  (Side note, I think I've heard a similar thing before, like, what if everyone else is just you, but living out a different incarnation, I don't know if that makes me feel comforted or lonely)   Aw man, sorry to take things off topic but one time in high school we marathoned the extended edition LOTRs. Started about 10pm and finished the next morning. No one was allowed to sleep, one of the nicest memories I have from that time :3 Such a great time...  But yeah, enjoy the mini series. I keep meaning to check it out myself when I find the time, report back with findings!   Adorable :D great job   So tempted to make an inspirational cross stitch sampler of this...   Thanks everyone for your comments, it definitely seems possible to convert someone :p might just show him this thread and see what he thinks :3   Yay, that's reassuring. I wouldn't see why they'd be any more bitey than any other type of rodent. My aunt, who is a vet has always said it's hamsters she dreads dealing with the most in that regard :p    British person here, I don't think anyone referred to Queen Elizabeth's Mum as "the Queen's Mum". But her 'title' was "Queen Mother", so maybe that's what threw you off...?     Hang tight and I'll try find some Youtube or other sorts of tutorials for you to try! (scurries off to have a look)  Edit:  Ok so here's a few things I've found...  **Bracelets** Friendship bracelets are very inexpensive (for materials you just need the string/floss) and quite sweet, plus there's a lot of scope to make a custom, personal pattern or two, plus there's instructions for making them everywhere online:  - http://www.buzzfeed.com/mackenziekruvant/15-summer-camp-style-friendship-bracelets-you-can-make-right - http://friendship-bracelets.net/tutorials.php   **Misc. Tutorials**  - http://www.allfreejewelrymaking.com/Monthly-Jewelry-Favorites/Top-100-DIY-Jewelry-Patterns-How-to-Make-Bracelets-Necklaces-Earrings-and-More - Craftster is a great website and community, hopefully you'll find something suitable in this list of tutorials, and if you need help then the forum members will probably be happy to offer advice :3 http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=386275.0 and http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=396187.0  Hope those are a helpful place to start, OP, sorry I didn't find loads of stuff, but I hope you find something to suit your crafting skill level and the sorts of things your girlfriend likes. (Also, don't forget to let us know what you end up making!)   Also 800g?! I was aware males could get big but, wow! :O   Sweet, that's a whole bunch of cool information, I hope I can one day be in a situation to use all those rat care tips :3   Aww, yeah my Mum has said that if I get rats I can't take them home to visit her :p But then she always said we'd never get dogs...and now we have three, so...   Hi there :)   I would love to keep rats; goodness knows I've spent hours pouring over pictures and videos of them online, or researching the cages, food, supplies etc. I would buy for them. They seem like such smart, funny, lovable pets and I want so badly to adopt a whole bunch of them. I love keeping various animals and have had a variety of healthy happy pets over the years but have yet to have a go at keeping rats.   My only real problem, however, is that I live with a boyfriend (for now and the foreseeable future) who is very much staunchly against the idea of keeping rats. Together we currently have just the one pet, a Syrian hamster, and we both love her to bits. We're always talking about all the animals we'll own one day, he's just as pro-let's-get-a-whole-bunch-of-animals-to-live-with, as I am, but whenever the subject of rats comes up, he adamantly refuses to entertain the idea of getting any.  Hamsters/Mice/Gerbils/Degus/Chinchillas/Guinea pigs/Rabbits etc. are all fine: rats seem to be the only rodent he has a problem with. Reasons he's given so far include: "I don't like their tails" (yet mice tails, which are pretty much the same are fine?), "They're vicious and more 'bitey' than other rodents", and "They're too big" (yep, way bigger than a degu or a rabbit, sure...).   Obviously I'm not going to force the issue, and if he truly doesn't want rats in his home then I won't force them upon him, but his reasons against seem so trivial and I would so love to keep rats...   **TL-DR** Does anyone here have any experiences of convincing the reluctant ones in their lives that rats are adorable? Were you yourself once anti-rat and if so what made you change your mind? Any input welcome, really, he seems currently immune to all the cute rat pictures I can throw at him. Appalling. :p   Out of interest who is the narrator for the audiobooks?   Yeah using lip balm makes you need lip balm (I'm definitely reliant on it)...but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a huge sinister money-spinning conspiracy, it's just a pretty much accepted annoyance    I'm entirely new to this but so far as I can tell I think it's mostly done free hand, though molds and stencils can help you get certain shapes. I can see why a beginners' kit would come with a mold to make things a bit easier getting the general shape (I still found I had to 'sculpt' in quite a bit of definition freehand).   Aw shucks, thanks :)   How did you know?! :p Jabbed one of my fingers quite hard early on, after that I was a bit more careful, and 'only' had a few more lighter accidental hand stabbings...   Thanks, I mean, with a kit I couldn't go far wrong, to be honest :p  Although the instructions could have been a bit more helpful; I had no idea what sort of density I was meant to be aiming for, I stabbed away for hours and hoped for the best, really :)   Thank you, and yes I am feeling better :) I have a whole lot of work to do at the moment but you better believe I'm instead choosing to spend my time searching for needle felting supplies instead!   Thank you :3 I'm quite pleased with how he's turned out, too. Totally going to try make needle felted versions of my pets now...  Edit: missing word   So very very many :p I'll must admit it did feel a bit wrong stabbing a tiny fluffy bunny...   Thank you :D   I wasn't feeling too well yesterday so I decided to treat myself to some craft supplies including a little needle felting kit by Dimensions. It was pretty fun considering I'd never even considered trying needle felting before :3  I totally want to do more!  (Also here's a few more pictures if you're interested http://imgur.com/a/u8Osj#0 )      Also here's a few more pictures if you're interested http://imgur.com/a/u8Osj#0   I wasn't feeling too well yesterday so I decided to treat myself to some craft supplies including a little needle felting kit by Dimensions.

       How does the maintenance records look? that is very important for a car with 100k miles!   I am looking to purchase this honda with 39,000 miles for about 13k the auto check looked good except it was used as rental at one point. Still the price is really good and the mileage is very low any advice ?  	4
 I wish you all the best - keep trying and don't be afraid to change things in your life if you feel you need too.  	1
 Any photo of her?   Looks like she's under good care. She'll grow up into a supreme overlord of your house in no time! :D   I love the way you phrased that. Thanks for bringing her to safety.   This looks like an aquarium ad! Awesome shot.  Also way to get his nonchalant side. Very photogenic.   I was hoping he would suggest ways to get him to stop but he was like "meh, if it makes him happy why not let him?"  Btw 10 weeks! Must be so tiny and cute. She may grow out of the habit though since she's just a babe. I hope for your sake she does. The claws have left may scars around my ankles.   Oh is that what it's called? XD That's really cute. I should get my cat a mini rolling pin plushy.   I won't lie and say I know what that feels like. I lost my grandpa to lung caner a year ago but I imagine hearing this kind of thing about my parent would be something quite different.  If you can't talk to your friends, feel free to talk to us in detail. Or if you're in school, your school counselor perhaps? Online help goes only so far and it'd be nice to have someone listen to you in person.  I'm not sure what kind of words, if any, could bring you solace. But know there is someone who's willing to listen.   While it's not for everyone meds changed  my life. I no longer feel suicidal or cry for no reason. I hope it works out for you!   I'm glad you're still with us.   My (almost) 10 year old cat still does this. He sucks on his arm so it turned that part of his fur brownish colour (he's greyish white overall with lilac points). I was concerned about possible skin conditions but the vet said there was nothing wrong with it. :s  But damn. 10 years! I don't know why he keeps doing it.   Nicely done! If you distress the leather it'll look even nicer. Love the eye makeup. I always thought Drogo looked ultra fabulous with the smokey eyes XD    Look at that magnanimous smile. Methinks s/he must speak with an elegant Oxford accent.   This deserves to be a race. Could you imagine going into a random cave and running into a horde of creatures with faces like this. Bone chilling.   I love the mod versions too but I think I'm gonna stick to vanilla until I get sick of it. Skyrim is beautiful on its own.   Oh I thought it was Tommen... But is it a whole lot different from a kid dressing up as Danny or Jon? Aren't we assuming that this is insulting because Peter Dinklage happens to suffer from dwarfism?   I'm not sure why you're under the fire so much for saying this. I too feel this way. I'm sorry OP has to deal with this mess but at the same time my heart goes out to the poor woman who chose to end her own life. So yeah I totally get where you're coming from.   "I have no idea why those walking snacks built this but it sure is handy! *awww yeah. That hits the spot.*"   I love her coat! Gold and black. Very houte.   She's adorable. Love the one where she's sitting next to you.   The costume looks beautiful. My favourite part is the hair. Hands down. Well done!   I love this kind of feeling. Why do you think it's a bad idea though?   The cat looks pretty challenging. I myself have no carving skill so any attempt to replicate something like this would result in pumpkin slaughter.   Man that game kind of frustrated me with donuts (I forget the currency name... those in-game purchases) so I quit early. Wish I had seen this before I quit!   Seriously it's not fair... If you have nice eyes, you should at least have some kind of deficiency elsewhere. Goddamn full lips, six pac bod, beard... THIS GUY IS CHEATING alert the mod.   Dammit now that's all I can think about. :(   Hugs. I love her coat pattern and white socks. I'm sure you and your mom made a loving home for her. Hopefully she'll be having a lot of fun with other kitties in heaven until you guys get to see her again.   I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want... But if I find you, I'm going to give you a big hug and buy you a beer because you're an awesome person. Your son is lucky to have you.   That's some dedication. Looks great! Are you gonna do the rest of the house sigils?   Now here I was expecting an NSFW photo of Lydia. Shame on me...   Man it looks almost like someone put a picture of him in the artsy photoshop filter. It looks awesome. Great job!   Your mom is really talented! I know brain slugs are parasitic aliens but damn they're cute.   I can appreciate people having different tastes in fashion but your bf sounds like he needs to back off a bit. I really like your inspiration photos! It wasn't anything to be embarrassed about. If he means a lot to you I hope you have a good conversation with him and tell him how he makes you feel. I mean, I'm not a big fan of how my bf dresses but I limit myselt to recommendations.   I'm sorry it happened to you. Putting that scumbag behind bars probably won't make things entirely better but I'm glad you're on your way to healing. Many hugs.   Any plan to colour it? It looks great!   Gnar has the cutest walk.♥   Congratulations!!   I'm sorry you lost them. I lost my grandpa last year to lung cancer. I was 25 at that time too.  I doubt there's the right way to grieve. Cry if you want to. Occupy your mind if you think you're falling too deeply into your emotions.   I'm apparently old enough to take up burdens of an adult but too young to enjoy privileges that such burdens entail.  I'm 26. Come the fuck on.   That'd be awesome. Also, being able to make friends with people as long as I talk to them long enough.      I'm sorry to hear that. :( I thought working for a big IT corporation would be exciting but I suppose like all things in life it looks glamorous only from the outside. But I bet knowledge in engineering opens up lots of possibilities. I hope you find your passion one day. Preferably soon.   Aside from my room, IKEA. Maybe it's that nesting syndrome mentioned in Fight Club but fuck it, I love it there. (I also loved playing the Sims... This probably has something to do with that to.) The country I'm currently living in doesn't have an IKEA and it's killing me.   I wish I told my grandpa how much he means to me and how grateful I am that he was my grandpa before he slipped into a coma and died (cancer). He was one of the few that believed in me no matter what.   Robin Williams so I can watch his old movies again. I can't watch them anymore because looking at him makes me miss him so much.  I lost my grandpa (to whom I was very close) to cancer but given the circumstances my aunts are in I'm not sure his being alive would benefit him a lot. He would be stressed out. Probably get cancer again.   Happy Birthday.   While I'm not a man I too feel really down on my birthday. It's like I'm getting older while getting none the wiser.  I wish I studied harder in my university so I could've gotten into law school. That way I could've stayed in my home country. Would've helped me retain my self-confidence too.   I've actually been writing a thriller for quite some time. I used to write like crazy in my university years, whenever inspiration hit me, but now this job has drained my creativity.  What about you? Any career you'd like to pursue?   I actually thought the premise of Resident Evil was pretty good (not the movie; the original game series). A pharmaceutical company wants to create a monster biologically engineered for wars but the success rate of the virus turning a human into a super soldier is pretty low and turns the failures into zombies. Maybe they won't have the hunger for human flesh, though. Hmm...   I still listen to AQUA. Barbie Girl, Dr. Jones, My Oh My. They're just really cheerful and fun to listen to.   Exactly! I'm studying law and frankly I'm a bit sick of it. I wish I had the balls (though I don't have any physical ones to begin with) pursue my dream of being a professional novelist. "Write on the side" they said, "you can always publish a book while working a different job" they said...   This post was tagged serious. Grow up.   Call me naive and idealistic, but I don't want Canada to change like the US did after 9/11. Proper precautions are necessary, but taking drastic measures seems like saying terrorists can indeed affect us with violent coercion.   I posted the link in one of my comments below.  I think some people misunderstood my comment/link as a cry for attention. I just wanted to show OP my cat. :s   I work at a law firm during the day and attend grad school classes at night. I have no idea what I want to do with the degree. I was hoping I would know by now.   Thanks. It's actually a he :D   Well I didn't post the link because I wanted attention but people seem to think I did. OP has a really pretty cat and I wanted to share a photo of my cat with him/her. I'm a little shocked my good intentions were taken so wrong.  As for the link, [here it is](http://imgur.com/5it7hIJ).   I try not to do so since that annoyed the shit out of me.   She is beautiful! It kind of hurts my ego because I'd like to think my cat is the most handsome cat in the whole wide world...  Edit: Wow so much hostility for just posting a link to a picture of my cat. Link removed.  Edit2: The link is back up in one of my comments below. Again I'd like to clarify I didn't want to steal attention away from OP or want people to affirm my (jokingly said) statement about my cat being the most beautiful.   Or something like "ovulation setting" which can be turned on and off so you can be in complete control of your pregnancy.   Gamer (with Gerard Butler).  I really loved the premise but the ending was total bullshit. I feel like the showdown in the end was so hackneyed and implausible. Why would a CEO risk fighting someone who's proven his physical strength in countless battles? Also what's the point of manipulating someone's mind if the person could just overcome it with the force of will? Also the part about the brothers (I forget the exact name; underground rebels against Michael C. Hall) was pretty lame.  You can't bring down the entire system by just killing off the head guy. You have to slowly affect the system and convince users to drop it. Not sure if a 2-hour movie can show all that, but that would have been the better ending.   Since a lot of people have already said philanthropic stuff, I'll say something very trivial but satisfying: winning a very dragged out League game through teamwork. Wish I could meet my team members in real life and give them a highfive.   Some people hate saying "this restores my faith in humanity" but fuck that, it really does make me believe in mankind more.   "Bender we love you"  "Shut up baby, I know it"  Futurama seemed like it really wanted to make "I'm back baby" popular but I've always liked this one better.   You set us up! I was preparing for the worst for a sec. But I forgive you because you have a cute dog and I too love RDJ.   Haha I wouldnt go as far as calling them assholes. they just don't know much about the condition. But yes I agree the family environment doesn't necessarily help me in this regard.   I didn't mean ONE absolute purpose. Until recently I wanted to go down a certain career path but that is no longer the case. I used to live with a drive. Now that's gone I feel empty.   The importance of LGBT rights.  I'm currently working abroad in Asia. I was born in this country but emigrated when I was a teen and earned Canadian citizenship.   It's mind-boggling how LGBT rights are pretty much nonexistent here and people have no idea how offensive they can be when they talk about the LGBT community in a certain way. I've actually had pretty heated arguments with my family members living here over this subject and got into a fight almost. I myself am straight, but I have gay friends back home and my blood boils up whenever people preach all sorts of nonsense. e.g. all gay men will act on their attraction to anyone and will try to rape straight guys. SERIOUSLY?!     Haven't played it in a while but whenever I play Diablo II I appreciate its structure and style every single time. Too bad the successor didn't live up to my expectations...   A purpose in life. I feel like all I do is existing. The bare minimum  Edit: thanks for great advice guys. Appreciate it. I'm not looking for a grand ultimate purpose. I'm reevaluating my career choice and the goal I was pursuing for like a decade just disappeared. So yeah that's why I said I wanted a purpose in life.   That's pretty exciting though.   I'm also doing a Master's degree (in law). Working during the day and studying in the evening have worn me out actually.   I'm sorry about your ex's baby. It's too bad you guys broke up. Best of luck to you in the Marines.   Depression (*May differ from person to person): I can't will/pray/force the condition away. I need meds to function properly. For some people counseling does wonders and they seem to have been cured of depression but it's not for everyone and for some, like me, depression is a lifelong condition with no cure. I make do with meds and they've kept me on the level well enough so I can work and enjoy life to an okay degree. I'd be a train wreck without them.  Actually my family has been the worst to me, not friends or people who know me less.   I think I like law more as an academic subject. I just don't think I'll enjoy working 12 hours a day, barely getting any sleep, stressed beyond imagination, to get a brief done, etc. It seems like work never ends for lawyers. Some people are cut out for this kind of challenge but I'm finding out I'm not quite that sort of person.   Thought I would be a lawyer by now (age 26) or on my way to be one. I do work with law but am not a lawyer, nor am I sure if I want to be one anymore. It's not the end of my life but I do feel hollow after losing a goal I was following for more than 10 years. I don't know what to do with life and feel like I should've felt this way back in high school.   Already did. She kicked ass.   Now that I think about it that's true lol. I think I got sad because I was thinking of my own grandma.   I don't know you but I'm proud of you and happy for you. Congrats!!   Yeah I think Uma Thurman was a great choice for Poison Ivy. Her lines were the main problem. "Curses!"   I love his meltdown in that review so much.   Is it the one where the initially grumpy grandma sacrifies hereself to save the family? I watched the movie as a kid and that scene made me so sad.  Also the teenager couple all bloated in the searing hot springs traumatized me.   I'm sorry you can't act on how you really feel. Even though I wish you could date someone you find sexually attractive, I think you're wonderful for valuing the life you have. You have my respect and admiration.

I had planned on majoring it (convinced by my dad) so I took the pre-req's. I'm glad I learned the basics of economics but I performed poorly and ended up majoring in something else. My overall GPA suffered a lot.   "What's it like to live in Canada?"  I'm working abroad and I miss home every single day.I love being asked about it.

I'm a lapsed Catholic and I'm sympathetic to both religious/atheistic sides. One of the things that Reddit does and makes me sad is extreme hatred to anyone who believes in the existence of a God. Sure if that person is forcing others to follow his belief that should be pointed out but if faith helps that person be better, live a good life, treat others well, etc. why not just embrace the fact that a religion can do some good? :s   My god I'm so happy it turned out great!

 Lol I saw a dude posing with a dead deer. Like...I guess that's cool. Then I get dudes posing with guns and/or their car. Classy.   That's...that's amazing.   There is a communication breakdown here. She clearly does not want you running with this girl. Has she explained that to you? What she's doing is punishing you for running with this girl in an effort to get you to stop, when she should just explain how it makes her feel.  If she did something similar with a guy, how would you feel? If she point blank asked you to stop running with the girl, would you?  A lot of people in the thread are calling her a bitch and a jealous cunt and I really feel like it's unfair. Every relationship has to deal with jealousy to some extent. You need to talk to her about this.    I really like your quote, "There is strength in solitude." Lately I have been focusing on being okay with myself and learning how to deal with my emotional issues on my own. When I tried to open up to others, I never felt like it did anything and I ended up just regretting opening up. I kind of had the epiphany that in the end we are alone, but that I was okay with it.   Ugh the same thing happened to me when I was making a little cat cave with super thick yarn. My hands were totally destroyed and my damn cat wouldn't even go in it! AJDKSJFS   Aha best gif ever!   Ahaha my mom does this all the time. My grandma and me are in a war with my mom against bad photos.   Okay, so I think there's three options here.  1.) She doesn't realize feminist is not the same as feminine.  2.) She believes feminism's goal is to feminize men or make them more like women.  3.) She actually understands feminism but doesn't agree with it, and believes it makes men less masculine.  I just kind of stared into space for a bit and then went back to work.   My dad is hilarious about this, because if we ever go out to eat or something he asks me if I know how to get there, and if I say no, I'll just look it up on my phone, he immediately launches into this extremely detailed list of directions and it's gotten to the point where I just let him finish and then punch the address in on my phone lol. I'm not going to remember all of that information anyway.   It irritates me too because whenever people find out I'm an atheist I feel the need to say that I don't hate religion. Atheism takes up literally zero time in my life. I just don't believe in God and don't have a religion. But the stigma is that I hate religion and spend a lot of hours on /r/atheism bashing Christians and Muslims.    My mom believes this and I don't know how to convince her it isn't true. She said her legs got bulky just from walking her dog...   My ex was horrible about understanding my anxiety. We would be in public and I would start getting extremely anxious, so I would say I think I need to leave. He would be confused, say that I didn't look anxious, and proceed to continue doing whatever we were doing in public (shopping or whatever). Then I would say, I need to leave, I'm leaving, and he would get all butthurt and claim I used my anxiety as an excuse to not spend time with him. Sigh. Hence the ex part.   Yeah that's...possible. I assume it was just a misunderstanding of what the term feminist means haha.   Not supporting equal rights for women, so manly!      He is crazy hot. And couple that with his awesome sexy voice? Umf.   Aww. My mom says the same thing to me. I got divorced recently and she tells me all the time how happy I am and how the "old me" is back. Pff. I'm still lonely as hell and just cause I got divorced doesn't mean my depression just disappeared.   My advice is to throw yourself into something to keep your mind off of things. I bought a bunch of video games because when I was married I never, ever spent any money on myself, and at night if I was feeling alone I'd throw myself into a game. Also I drank a lot of rum. Things will get better :)   And then the next day when you're wearing no makeup, "Are you sick?"   It does feel like people who are overweight get this bad rap of being a grumpy person. Or, if an overweight person happens to be grumpy that day it's all of a sudden, well, she's grumpy cause she's fat. It's kind of bullshit.   It just makes no sense the amount of hatred people can spew over someone's freakin' weight. Like I went on /r/fatpeoplehate and was just floored. People waste time over this?   Not to even mention the double standard of fat dudes vs. fat chicks. Like one of the friends I was hanging out with was an overweight dude, and even he was getting in on it. No one gives a shit if a guy is overweight, and if the overweight dude can't get chicks, it's because girls are shallow, but if an overweight girl can't get dudes it's her fault because she's fat. UGH!    Right? The whole situation was just bizarre and made me sad.    I know, all I could think about was how I would feel if I were in that position. I sort of mentioned that, and they said, well, you aren't fat and you don't complain about not getting guys. It's like...I think you're missing the point.  I just really want a group of awesome girlfriends damn it! At least I have TrollX.   It is. Especially because they are older than me. I sort of called them out on it, and said something like, who cares if she's fat, and they got really defensive are started saying, well, she has a bad personality too. It's like...what the fuck.   Basically I started hanging out with some friends of a friend, and one of them is pretty overweight. As soon as she left everyone started talking about how fat she was and how she can't expect to get a guy looking like that. It was pretty obnoxious...they talked about her all night, these people are all close to 30 so it was pretty sad.   I probably won't go out with them again.      Aw thanks for the support. I don't have a lot of female friends so it's awesome to be able to go on TrollX. Everyone is so supportive and cool.   I do believe that a relationship could work if both people were invested. But I think it's super rare. Especially as people get older and grow apart and change. I don't know. I guess I'm not holding out for some great relationship in the future, because I feel like I worked really hard in my relationship, and in the end it didn't matter because he didn't want to put the effort in, you know?    Haha no you're right. At this point I'm sort of like, meh, is it even possible for two people to remain faithful to each other. Especially since around the same time my parents started having issues with possible infidelity on both sides. And I guess my dad creeps on young girls on Facebook. Like wtf. I just hate getting older and everyone you think is so amazing turns out to not be...   That's true! I think most girls assume you would want them to be snippy about your ex. But I can relate, my mom still talks shit about my ex even though we've been over since October. And she keeps trying to set me up with weirdos lol.   Aw, well I'm sure they were just trying to be supportive, even if you weren't ready for a relationship yet.    Yeah, I personally doubt that it's possible. But I was recently cheated on so I'm bitter.    Aw that's sweet.   Hey, I'm looking for new friends too. I'll try to make it Friday! I haven't been to 42 Lounge in forever.   Lol my brother does the same thing!   Me too! Honestly he's just going through a lot right now. He really does have a good heart. He's just...I don't know. He will figure things out eventually.    He's... Going through some stuff. So I forgive him for being a little crazy. He still treats me with respect. I just know he is extremely depressed and his way of dealing with it is to have sort of extremist philosophies.    My brother, who believes in similar things red pillers do, 100% does not believe lesbians are real. He admits gay men exist, but he claims no woman is a lesbian. And if they do engage in sexual activity with a woman its either because one, mental illness, or two, male attention.   Sigh.    You too!    I'm sorry you had to deal with that. My best guy friend from high school opened up to me about his wife being physically abusive, and showed me bruises. It was insane. I was friends with her as well and she painted this picture that he was this verbally abusive asshole and then he shows me evidence of her physical abuse... Like wtf.   I told him to take a video of her abusing him because it was so constant. He stopped talking to me because she was apparently jealous of his interaction with me. I hope he's doing okay.    He's older, late 20s, she's 19 or 20 I think. Either she's young and naive or he's lying to her about having a job.   He is really good at lying. But whatever, I don't have to deal with that shit anymore!    Woo-hoo! Awesome job girl!    WOW. That is incredibly depressing.   My ex doesn't even have a job haha. But somehow attracts younger girls? I just want her phone number so when she realizes what a fuck up he is we can go out and get drinks together. Nothing like bonding with a girlfriend over disdain for a mutual ex lol.    Lol my ex husband does the same bullshit. He told me all about the new girl he claims to be in love with. You know what I don't want to do when I fall in love with someone? Text me ex. Ignore him, what a fucking tool.    Her face isn't horrible, she just needs to lose some weight I think.    I second this, need to know where you got your awesome ottoman.    I second this, need to know where you go your awesome ottoman.    Thanks for the advice. My divorce pushed me in a lot of ways to put myself out there and socialize more. I had so much anxiety initially, especially when going on dates, but now I'm noticing that's subsiding which is a huge relief. I'd like to get back to the point where I only had situational anxiety.   I think you're right about finding a guy who isn't depressed. My ex fed off of my moods and would be down when I was down, and it wasn't helpful.   I find that when I get depressed, my body and brain tell me to lay in bed to make it feel better. My strategy now is to get out and do things, to fake it, like you said. This has helped me a lot. It's hard to fight against that feeling though. A mantra for me had basically become "I can't" so I think in many ways my fight now is to just convince myself that I can.    I just wondered because I suffer from anxiety and depression. I believe that's part of the reason why my own marriage failed and my ex decided to cheat.   It makes it hard to date because honestly I don't even know who I am without my depression. I get down on myself thinking no one wants to be with a girl who has depression. And even if I meet a great guy I think eventually he won't like me because of my issues.   That's really interesting. How are you doing now?    We got married too young and for the wrong reasons. We had a rocky relationship from the start, we realized we were not all that sexually compatible, and essentially were just bringing each other down.   I stuck it out because of pride and not wanting to admit I made a mistake in getting married. I only divorced when I found out he was having an affair with my best friend.    That flex photo, yummy.   Yes, moar please.   This reminds me of a guy I knew once who was married and had a ton of affairs with women he met online. His wife found out about it and decides to sleep with one guy for revenge. Husband goes ballistic and kicks her out. His excuse was that "it's different for men, men never get over infidelity."  Like dude, you were banging 10± chicks behind your wife's back. God that guy was a piece of shit.    It makes zero sense to me too. I'm always thinking, you can't jerk off to a woman and despise them at the same time. It's not right!    People will find any way to judge you, regardless of what you say. I opened up on here about my husband having an affair and I got a few weirdos who told me it was my fault. It sucked but the majority of the comments I received were very nice :)    We absolutely should because I missed it! I'll bring dessert :)    Honest? He claims he has a fit body. He's either a liar or entirely delusional.   You aren't everyone. It simply isn't helpful to everyone who is suicidal. Most times there is absolutely nothing you can say, the only thing you can do is be there so they do not harm themselves or take them to a professional.    Yay! I'm going to PM you.    Hey! I'm looking for new friends to hang out with. I recently got divorced and realized how little friends I have. I'd love to hang out with other women who are redditors and have similar interests.   I don't mind if you're attached, but I'm single so I would love to go out with someone to meet guys! I'm looking to just have fun at this point in my life.   I want to get outside more and do active things but I don't know a lot of people. I like hiking, exploring, geocaching, etc. I love beer and trying new kinds, exploring different bars and restaurants.   Hope to hear from you!   Wow. That's absolutely excessive. Is there anything good about him that would keep you around?   My ex was very controlling and would get mad at me if I went out with friends, guy or girl. So I stopped. After five years of being together I had dwindled all of my friends down to one. It sucked.    None of this sounds normal honestly, or healthy. He sounds like he is insecure and wants to control your life by being emotionally manipulative.   It might be mild now, but what happens if in the future he asks you to stop hanging out with your guy friend altogether? He doesn't sound like he has YOUR interests in mind at all.   Personally, having had experience with this type of guy, I would get out of that relationship. In my experience these guys only get worse over time.    Now that I think about it, that movie is completely fucked up. Wow.    This is one of those people who goes around talking about how fucking random and weird they are all the time.    Wow what a tool.   Oh my god. That is so fucking hilarious and so sad at the same time.   That sounds awful. I hope she gets the help she needs.   I don't believe people in a great relationship cheat. If someone is cheating that relationship has a lot of problems.    Well, he admitted to the affair, but covered up a lot of details about it. It took me a few months of sleuthing, talking to the woman who he cheated with, talking to her husband, to really get a picture of what really happened. And I'll never know for sure. It's a messy business.   The other big factor for me was that they didn't use a condom. So they risked pregnancy and stds. They risked my health. All to have an affair. It's just gross.    I don't see what I did as punishment at all. I just don't want to be with a person who has an affair. For a lot of reasons. But my decision was about me and how I could be happy. Not about punishing him.    There was a period of about a week after finding out about it that I was still weighing my options. I asked him some details about the affair (instead of coming clean he lied about a lot of the details and hid the fact that it happened multiple times rather than once), he looked at me, disgusted, and said, "When are you going to get over this?"   I realized then that he did not realize how much he had hurt me, and he never would. He would never be the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I made my decision and I'm happy about it.    Honestly it's quite complicated. There are a lot of details about the cheating that I won't go into online. But it was a combination of factors that led me to my decision. Why he cheated, who he cheated with, where he cheated, how many times it happened, what he thought while he was cheating, did he have remorse or guilt after before I knew about it.   Then there is family and how they responded. My mom, who I'm close to, was livid. She said I could never bring him to her house ever again. Word spread throughout the family and everyone despised him. I would never be able to bring him to Christmas without it being a huge awkward moment for all of us. I regret telling my mother now, but maybe it was for the best. It is important to me that my family love and respect the man I am with, and that wasn't true anymore.   In addition to that, it was how I was feeling in the marriage prior to the cheating. I was massively depressed and never felt like I could rely on him for anything. We were both starting to realize how little we had in common. We went to therapy, and realized how terrible we were at communicating with each other. Honestly it was a mess before the cheating.   Despite any of that, for whatever reason, finding out he cheated was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. And I'm thankful my life is good enough that getting cheated on (so far) is the worst thing to happen to me. But it's hard to explain why it hurts so much. I don't think I really have an answer for you.   Some nights I feel lucky I was cheated on because it gave me the courage to leave a marriage I wasn't happy in. So I don't know. We were both unhappy. But it's hard to really be honest with yourselves in a marriage when things aren't working.    Yeah! I'm sure he thinks the same of me lol. But every day it gets easier and I think I'm at the point where I don't regret being married, it was an experience that taught me a lot.    Ew. Ew ew ew.    Seriously I got wet just looking at them.    Hm, I'm not sure if I believe that, but I don't believe my relationship was healthy at all. I think we were both just young and resentful of each other for tying each other down too soon.    Good on you. Single life is not that bad. I love how much freedom I have now. It is a tough road so I hope you have friends and family to be there for you. But it's not as bad as staying in a relationship with someone who cheated.    I think it was a lot of reasons, I could write a book about it honestly. Let me just say this, I am divorced now and my sex drive has returned.   I think it was mainly one, I was severely depressed, for whatever reason. I would literally not self lubricate and so sex was painful. Two, I just wasn't attracted to him anymore. He was really emotionally manipulative, incredibly jealous and would get upset if I went anywhere without him. Three, we were never really sexually compatible to begin with. I love dominant guys, he loved dominant girls. See the problem?   Lots of reasons. Mainly issues of compatibility. If I could go back I would never have gotten married. I was young and dumb and believed in true love and soul mates.    He was, yeah. I think he seriously thought if he cheated and then told me about it, I'd be all over him and the sex would improve. He was kind of dumb.    If it makes you feel better, I moved across the country to be with someone and it was the worst decision I've ever made! I regret it still.    Dude that's me! If we lived in the same city we could go out together lol.    It's never too late! Get in shape and fuck all the people.    I'm 24 too! Yay. And I'm depressed about this thread :(   I'm realizing this now at 24, just got divorced. I'm just gonna have some fun dammit. I don't want a relationship. Here's to divorced women being slutty!    I admit that you're right about her face haha. Especially next to Amy Adams.   	83
 That's such a good way of putting it. I've just been searching for so long to find someone who really cares, and wants to know me for who i am.   You're not alone, man. I wish you good luck, and I know that there are people who care about you. Don't forget about them. I guess it's comforting to me to know that it's not a personal flaw that makes me like this tonight, it's something that the world just happens to do to a person at the worst time. I hope we both get through it, and I want you to know i care about you, i don't care what flaws you have, I guarantee there are happy people who have worse. So don't blame yourself.   shitty repost, nice             It's definitely a karma whore, just look at the username of the second post   zip lock bag. Done.   eighth grade, I had this old woman in her 70's who taught philosophy. The class consisted of her lecturing for an hour and a half (she used to be a college prof.) and everyone playing games and sleeping. I usually tried to pay attention, but it was on and off.    One day she decided to have a "philosophical" discussion, I forget what it was about. Anyway, I had an opinion that differed from the rest of the class and her (mainly because it was the only one she had taught them) so I took my side and tried to explain it. After some back and forth, she looks to the class and says "I know not all of you are as stupid as him; does anyone know the right way to think about this?"     And of course nobody raised their hand because they had no idea what we were talking about, but it still made me feel pretty bad.   Force quit it... oh wait...   ... This question wasn't made for me...   I AM NOT TELLING YOU YOU ARE WRONG. I am simply telling you that you should not tell me or anyone else that they are wrong. God is a very complicated answer, in fact its the only one that's stuck around for several thousand years.   Nah, just in general when you're comment specified at the beginning. If you said a purple god that rides horsies in manhattan had been disproved, I would say cool. But saying god in general/religion is wrong, thats not the same.   Okay. Well then I'm not going to tell you you're wrong. But you said it would appear. If there are conditions such as "this only shows its existence if it makes sure it can't be proven to exist" (which is okay,) then WHO THE FUCK AM I TO TELL YOU YOU'RE WRONG?   I can walk up to you on tuesday, put my face in your ass for the entire day and see if I tasted the rainbow. If not, you'd be wrong. Prove god's not in my heart (soul, spirit, all that good stuff n stuff) And why is the burden of proof on me? i'm not the one telling you I'm right. You're the one telling me I'm wrong.    :) Having a conversation and having someone listen is different. And i'm not saying god is the only one that can listen or change a heart. People can do that, i hope. But What I'm saying is you shouldn't trash my faith by calling it a lie when you can't even prove you're right.   How do you know they're not real? Who are you to tell me I'm wrong? I'm not trying to convince you you're wrong. I'm not telling you you're wrong. I believe you're wrong. But who the fuck am I to tell you that? You have no authority. Stop acting like you do. Prove to me he there's any shred of a sign that he doesn't exist. then you can tell me what to believe.   That's a cool way of looking at it. What gets me is /r/atheism. They post thousands of posts trashing my faith, but blame religion for being oppressive, corruptible. Of course it is. /r/catholics aren't calling atheists fucking stupid. Who are they to say they know I'm wrong?    I think it's however someone wants to define it, it means so many different things. To me, it means that this universe did not just poof out of the butt of an atom during the big bang. Well, i mean that's certainly possible but that it wasn't just a coinkydink. And besides. My life is very fucked up. God is the only thing on this planet that has taken the time to listen to me.   I don't think it's a scientific fact that they don't exist. We just haven't proven their real. If someone had a reason to believe in it, who are you to tell them they're wrong??   ORLY.   True.   tax breaks for the rich create a crappy economic system. agreed.   I want to be black... I don't think it's going to happen.   Agreed.   propaganda.   PROVE HE'S NOT. RIGHT NOW. GO.   Right on the country part.   SHHHHHHH.   True. I guess it's just personal preference. I know a lot of people that say it should be abolished, but there's not really a good way to do that. And I couldn't possible take notes in print, it'd take waaay to long   Lol, watchoo talking bout yo, weed be the SHIT. Ain't not effecting mah nothun.   Prove he's not real. Right now. GO.

 I have great friends, an amazing boyfriend, all that jazz. It doesn't matter, I still feel lonely. They all care about me and love me, yet, I still feel so isolated from everyone. I hate this. I absolutely hate it. I'm a teenager, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, not trapped inside my room wondering if they mean it when they say "I love you."   I cut. Today in PE a very bad cut started bleeding again. I got it to stop bleeding, but not without a few girls seeing. Someone went to the office and told them about my situation. When I was called into the counselor's office, I wasn't scared. I'm there quite often because I happen t hang out with all the self harming and suicidal kids at my school, along with my boyfriend. Until they told me what someone had said. I denied it all, but it didn't stop them from calling my mom... And CPS. When I got in the car, she wasn't mad, but she said I need to "work on myself" so now I am only allowed to have my phone one hour a night on weekdays,  four hours on weekends for a month. Usually, this wouldn't be big deal, but lately I have been going through a whole ton of shit that I don't want to talk about with anyone but two certain people, and now I really cant.  How do I deal with this?   I know, I know. It just was a spur of the moment.    I'm a freshman      I have done that so many times. Eventually, I stopped being cautious. When out with friends, I'm known as the "dare devil" because if I see a car coming, I don't move. If there is a bridge, I walk on the railing, hoping I fall off.   	6

 I search "appetite" in /r/keto and all I get is everyone barely able to meet their calorie goals because their appetite is gone.  I have PCOS, which my doctor tells me really sucks for appetite as it's usually more active in ladies with PCOS than those without.  My doctor also fully supports my journey with keto.  Mine's as ravenous as ever.  And keto foods are so calorie dense.  I've tried all the tricks: green tea, water, loads of greens, coconut oil, etc...  I don't have cravings, though, I just am always hungry. I'm also tired all the time.    Right now I'm trying eat around 1400 calories/day, but frequently go up to 1800 or 2000.  Maybe 2 hours of working out every week, a mix of strength and walking on an incline. My usual day of meals is as follows:  *Breakfast*: almonds and string cheese (about 400 calories worth)  *Lunch*: Greek salad with EVOO and red wine vinegar + gyro meat or chicken  *Dinner*: 80/20 beef with vegetables (either as a taco salad or with cauliflower).  *Snacks*: Handful of almonds, spoonful of almond butter,  pan fried queso blanco, a few strawberries   I usually hit my macros pretty close (even accounting for the increased calories).  I'm not losing weight.  Lost the initial water weight, but nothing else, which I am attributing to my going above the calories I should have.   Note: PCOS is linked to lowered BMR.  My doctor told me BMR calculators probably won't be accurate for me and that I should have an RMR test done.  This will happen as soon as I save up the money for one.   Introduction: Been on keto this time around for about 3 weeks.  Lost 7 pounds in the first week, stalled between 221.8 and 220 for the last 2 weeks.  Minimal exercise (maybe 1-2 hours/week), trying to stay under 1600 calories/day but usually going up to 1900-2000. Do IF 4 days/week, with 16 off/8 on. Measurements have been a consistent 38-35-46 since week 2.  Have PCOS with IR and am on 1000mg Metformin/day (recently reduced from 2000mg by Doctor's suggestion).  Doctor suggested keto for weight loss, plus I find it easy not to eat carbs. Tracking food religiously on MFP.    **Keto foods are so fucking calorie dense** and I hate 85% of vegetables!  I will eat cauliflower and cabbage until I'm stuffed, but that's honestly up until the carb counts of the vegetables start to get high (2.5 cups of cauliflower is about 7g net carbs according to MFP).  I'm not going to give up, because I want to be healthy (not just skinny) and get pregnant.  But I just wanted to rant about how I never feel full unless I go over my calories!    Currently cutting back on diet soda, hoping that will help.      Found Jamie Eason's 12 week program.  I'm obese, been going to the gym and trying to count calories for 3 weeks with very little results.  I think I need more structure, as in a defined meal plan rather than being left to my own devices.  I'm pretty good with strength training.  Do you think an obese person can do this program with only 3 weeks of strength training experience?  I need something to kick my ass and tell me exactly what to eat.   Doing layman research of my own, I can't find anything online that explains **why** it's so difficult.  I just find articles about BMR in women suffering from PCOS, weight loss studies, etc... affirming that it *is* more difficult for PCOS women to lose weight.   Stats: 25/f/223lbs.  Exercise: 25 minutes cardio (interval running) + machine weights MWF.  Goal: get fitter and slowly (but eventually) get to 160lbs.  My diet isn't 100% clean, but it's definitely mostly clean.  I'm also the pickiest eater imaginable, and I don't think a diet has to be full of foods I detest.  I hate eggs, but I eat them in the morning with salsa because it masks the taste.  I hate beans, and I hate most nuts (but not nut butters).  I'm having a hard time topping 100g of protein per day.  I know I should eventually have around 120g, but I'm just working on 100g right now.    I love fruit.  If I have 2 pieces of whole wheat bread/day and a few pieces of fruit I don't have cravings for anything worse.  I measure everything religiously.  I just refuse to go over 1600 calories/day.  I'm not lifting heavy since I'm just starting out.  I'm getting the "going to the gym" routine set first because if I shove myself in the deep end I'll get discouraged and give up (as I have so many times before).  **Am I going to just need to eat less fruit and more meat?**  Typical day of eating:  Breakfast:   * 2 eggs with a little cheese, 2 slices of bacon, salsa, and lots of vegetables (2 egg muffin cups), 2 clementine oranges  Lunch:  * turkey sandwich (whole wheat bread) with homemade oven roasted turkey (4 oz), kale chips, 8 medium strawberries  Dinner:  * Either burger patty from 1/2lb raw 80/20 beef, 1.5 salmon burger patty (from seafood counter), 4 oz chicken, with some non-starchy vegetable  Snacks:  * 2-3 of the following per day: apple with (pure) almond butter, grapes, a little turkey, 2 clementines, kale chips   TL;DR: Not eating enough protein.  Without nuts and beans, how can I get more clean protein in?  Just eat less fruit and more meat?     I've tried C25K in the past, I've tried every recommended method of trying to run.  I've run really slow, moderate pace, outside, inside, treadmill, track you name it.  My heart rate always got up to 187bpm within a minute of running.  I haven't run in probably 18 months.  In those 18 months I have started and quelled a battle with anxiety.  I've been on Celexa for 8 months now, and have not tried to run in those 8 months... until yesterday.  A little background: husband and I started eating healthy, tracking food, and working out one week ago today.  We both have confidence we are going to make it this time, and are taking it slowly, one day at a time.  Yesterday was my leg day.  I did my regular leg routine and just planned on walking with my husband on the treadmills for 30 minutes.  I got bored after about 2 minutes of walking and decided to try a light jog, hesitant that my HR would shoot up and I wouldn't be able to breathe very well.  Quite the contrary! My HR was at a max of 167, and I did intervals of running (90 seconds on, 2 minutes off).  I wanted to cry.  I'm now convinced I am able to run and will eventually be able to run a mile for the first time in my life.   When that day comes I will be bawling in the middle of my gym.  I feel like we're really going to make it this time.   This is for my husband. He's a pretty big guy, and we have been eating healthy, tracking cops, and going to the gym every day this week. Since starting, he has put on 10 lbs. I wouldn't believe it myself if I didn't see it.  The second day we worked out he hurt his elbow (tennis elbow) and I know muscle healing can cause water retention. But really? Ten pounds worth?   I'm taking him to a doctor asap to get bloodwork done and make sure this regimen is ok for him, but due to work schedules this could take up to 6 weeks.   Any advice? He's just a little discouraged.   Typical workout week: Monday: walking 30 mins + arms Tuesday: walking + legs Wednesday: walking Thursday: walking + legs Friday: walking + arms  Abs are done every day except Wednesday.      I started Starting Strength today.  I tried out some squats before attempting to use the bar just to check my form and I realized I can't squat to parallel.  I will either come up on my toes or fall backwards.    I don't want to nix squats completely until my strength improves for me to be able to get to parallel.  I've read some places that doing kettlebell squats can help.  I just did no-weight squats facing the wall to make sure my form is correct.  Has anyone else been in this situation before?  Any suggestions on how to proceed from here?  I plan on continuing the SS workout, just supplementing barbell squats with kettlebell or something similar until the form is right.   I'm a dieting guru.  I've tried it all, failed at it all, and now I'm extremely discouraged.   I just finished day 5 of whole30, where basically for 30 days you don't put anything artificial in your body.  It's paleo, but doesn't allow for paleo hacks either (like paleo desserts), and no artificial sweeteners, limited fruit intake, no dairy or legumes, etc....  I'm so pissed off today.  I hate greens, I hate vegetables, I don't think this is ever going to work for me.  I've had food issues since I was young.  When I was 3 my parents found me eating Oreos in the pantry after they were fighting.  I have half a thyroid, PCOS, and had my gallbladder out in January.  Since the surgery I have gained 30 lbs.  Those of you who know anything about hypothyroidism and PCOS, losing weight is extremely difficult.    I have tried every diet you can think of that doesn't involve food delivery.  Weight watchers, keto, Atkins, low fat high carb, and now paleo.  I'm sick of being disgusted with my body, but I'm also sick of the dieting mentality I'm stuck with.  I even tried giving up the diet mentality in April but ended up gaining 10 lbs because I didn't deny myself anything.  I'm at my wits end.  The only time I have ever had success in weight loss was when I wasn't even trying.  I would eat a #1 from McDonald's every morning, walk a mile on campus to get to my classes, then eat a McDonald's cheeseburger (the tiny ones) for dinner.  I never denied myself anything, but I was on Zoloft, which killed my appetite.  I would go out to eat and have two bites and be "full" (nauseated).  I dropped 50 lbs in 8 months doing this.  Only downside is that while the Zoloft killed my appetite, it killed my personality and sex drive, too.  I'm currently in counseling and have discussed my issues with food, but simply depriving myself of things leads to me bingeing later, even if I try to acknowledge and think through the feelings I'm having.  I've tried CBT, I'm on anti-depressants still (Celexa), along with medicine for PCOS and hypothyroidism.  I don't know why I'm putting this here. I don't know what I need from you, /r/loseit.  I just know that I had to tell someone my feelings. Maybe I've convinced myself I'm never going to lose the weight, never going to get pregnant, and live a miserable life because of it.  When I was at 170lbs in 2010, I was the most content I've ever been in my life despite having zero personality.  I loved my body and had confidence.    TL;DR: I've tried everything and am close to giving up.  I don't know what to do.   Edit: Thanks for all the encouragement and advice.  If you want to add me on MFP my username is lefoll.  I have taken what everyone has said to heart and am not going to give up.  I may not stay on the whole30 wagon for much longer, but I'll be making wiser choices and I'm going for a walk (at least) tonight.   I've read /r/fitness 's FAQ, I've read multiple articles on strength training, from both bodybuildling.com and other sites.  I get the basic breakdown:  Powerlifting: low reps/high weight Bodybuilding: mid reps/mid-high weight stabilizing: high reps/low-mid weight  I'm obese (5'5", 25yo, 225lbs) and cardio has never been good for me.  I'm an absolute beginner.  I've read things on 5x5, I've read starting strength, etc... but I'm still clueless.  I had a trainer last year who worked me out on the cable machines, but in all honesty I'd rather work with dumbbells/barbells.   I plan on watching lots of videos before I join the Y on Friday (payday).  Any other suggestions?  I'm currently eating 90% paleo (2 meals/week where I don't eat paleo, and even then I don't eat rice/pasta/bread).     Back in January, [the Houston Chronicle announced](http://www.chron.com/business/article/7-Eleven-fans-might-thank-heaven-for-Houston-4168335.php) that 7eleven was looking to come back to Houston.  One of the stores is off 249   Grant, which showed up on 7-eleven.com.  Now the store no longer shows up and it seems to be staying a Chevron.  Anyone aware of the goings on in regard to this?   I worked for a company for 10 months and had a company-matched 401k  they set up for me.  Now that I am no longer with the company, can I do anything with this money?  How do I go about transferring money to an IRA from this 401k if it's associated with the company I used to work for?   I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2006 at the age of 18.  Since then I've been off and on Metformin 4 different times.  As soon as I get up to 1500mg/day, my stomach just rebels.  It's horrible. I get pale, cold sweats, and have to be near a bathroom at all times.  In 2011 I lost 50 pounds but have gained all of it back.  My doctor suggested trying Metformin ER again, since I'm eating healthy and working out to no avail. For the last 12 months I have been attempting to eat very low carb but fail at every turn. Now I'm just eating lots of  vegetables and meats with fruit for dessert.      My husband and I have been (casually) TTC for the last 12 months with nothing.  I have a period every month, but my insurance doesn't cover any fertility specialists so I can't get additional testing done at this time.  I'm currently on 1000mg/day but the dosage may go up in the future.  If I do go up, should I fight through the symptoms? Do they get any better over time?   I'm not on anything else, no Spiro or BC.    Any opinions on this? Any successful weight loss stories with Metformin?    I got a new job that I start on Wednesday.  I'm leaving my current job with a wells fargo 401k, but I'm not sure which 401k my new company will pay into.  Will they pay into my existing 401k set up by my current company? Or will I have to transfer the funds into a new 401k?         Any suggestions on keto popsicles? I've seen suggestions online for coconut milk, which I plan on trying tomorrow afternoon with some strawberries.  Anyone else have any keto (and lower calorie) popsicle recipes or suggestions?  Seeing as how popsicles are mostly fruit-based I'm at a loss.   My husband and I have been discussing this as we've been watching through all the seasons lately.  The set and character's outfits make it seem like the show takes place earlier, but there are pop culture references and modern tech.    Some more things that lead us to believe it takes place earlier is that all the veterans have fought in WWI, not WWII, and the KGB still exists.  The KGB was dissolved in 1991.  Archer's Dodge Challenger looks like the old Challengers, regardless of new tech.  Guns are also very accurately portrayed, there doesn't seem to have been a modern gun.  There was one Barrett M82 and a TEC-9, both of which were produced in the 1980's.  We always look really deep into these things.  I mean, it's a fictional universe, yes, so this is pretty much ridiculous.      I'm talking the kind you can cook at your table.  I know the Gessner part of Spring Branch has a lot from yelp, but the reviews are all over the place.  I also am the whitest of white and know absolutely no Korean which I've heard can be a hindrance at some particular establishments.  As long as the staff and I can communicate to get food on my table, I'm good.  I also have never had Korean food before, but I like trying new things even if I don't like the taste. The experience is good enough :)   So I recently discovered my love for making crochet accessories.  Scarves, necklaces, bracelets, etc... but I don't have much of the softer yarn that many people prefer for scarves and the like.  Are there any crochet projects that yarn like the Red Heart Super Saver skeins are good for? My husband calls it squeaky yarn because if you knit too tightly with it, it squeaks. It's rougher and itchier.  Patterns or just ideas are welcome :)  I haven't jumped into amigurumi yet, but plan on doing so soon.        I was prescribed Lortab for painkiller after my gallbladder removal surgery.  For the past couple days since the surgery I've been staggering my meds (taking 0.5 mg Klonopin and 20mg Celexa at 5am and Lortab at 8am) but today I took them all together.  Then stupid me looked up the drug interactions between my meds and Lortab and now I'm freaking out.  I keep trying to tell myself if there were any danger my surgeon wouldn't have prescribed Lortab or told me to keep taking my meds but of course my inner voice is not helping.  And today's the first day since my surgery day that I'll be alone at home since my husband goes back to work today.  Anyone had any experience with hydrocodone and anxiety meds? Or just some reassuring words?   Backstory: currently being treated for anxiety and depression with medication and CBT.  Has been working wonders.  Before starting treatment in October I had missed work because I couldn't get myself out of bed, usually a day a week.  My boss has been great up until now about it, not requiring any "excuses" and letting me work from home.  Now I have gallbladder disease which has led me to multiple ER visits and a surgery that's coming up soon.  I'm just afraid that this will be the last straw and I'll end up jobless.  I really love this job and am working my butt off from home when I do stay home.  Any advice? Maybe it's my anxiety getting to me, or maybe my fears are legitimate.  I guess fear of the unknown is a big thing for me.   I nominate Brown Betty.   Where the fuck did Jennie, Strax, and Madam Vasatra come from?  They were there for A Good Man Goes to War but they never got an introduction other than "a debt is to be repaid."    Was this covered somewhere and I missed it or is it one of Moffat's "clever" attempts at foreshadowing timey wimeyness?   My newly prescribed Klonopin to help my anxiety until my Celexa saturates in my system has been working pretty well, until this morning.  Never in my life have I had to leave work because of anxiety.  My main trigger is my heart rate and the thought of dying alone.    So last night I ate way too much, which happens about once a month.  I was up with stomach pain, puking, and general discomfort for 3 hours.  So I called into work saying I'd be late, no big deal.  I take my medicine before I leave for work (2 hours late) but I can already tell it's going to be a bad day.  On my way to work I can't stop checking my pulse.  It's fast.  I get to work, sit down, drink water, and it's still fast.  I do my breathing exercises, I try to distract myself with work and it's still at least 120bpm.  This just keeps the negative feedback loop going on in my brain.  So I call my husband, because he can help calm me down sometimes.  I do everything I've been taught to do and nothing is helping. I decide Klonopin hasn't started working yet so I try to wait it out for 2 hours while having a panic attack.  No dice.  My boss is out of the office basically 10 minutes after I get there so I jot him an email saying for personal reasons I have to leave for the day.  I tell my coworker I can work from home if anything needs to be done and I pack up my shit and head out the door.    My heart is still up to around 105bpm, which is better, but still not ideal.  My brain has stopped working that stupid loop it does so well.  I think my Klonopin is working now.  I've just resigned myself to the fact that all that discomfort from last night has my HR up.  No chest pains, no shortness of breath, and my doctor says to just wait a couple days and if it's not back down to come in.   I FUCKING HATE THIS.  I shouldn't be in danger of losing my job but the doubt in my mind is always going.  Yesterday was perfect.  So perfect.  No anxiety, lots of fun, no worries.  Then fucking bam... today.   I've searched rigzone but can't find anything that fits his lack of qualifications.  I've sent him tons of job listings that he doesn't particularly qualify for but they may overlook as he has some experience with unrelated electronics and structural design (1 year).  We live in one of the perfect cities for this but have no idea where to start.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.      This includes withdrawals from pills.  I took 200mg of Zoloft for depression 2 years ago and it eliminated my personality and my appetite.  I lost 50lbs on it (which was good, I was at 220) but I was a shell of my former self.  The withdrawal was nothing like what others have experienced. No brain zaps, no shakes or sweats, no vomiting, nothing.  It was just normal for me.    I tried Zoloft again recently for my general anxiety at a lower dosage (started at 25mg and upped to 50mg) but it actually made my anxiety worse this time around so I just stopped taking it.  I'm going back for a reevaluation tomorrow.   Background info: We are newlyweds (8 months) and bring home about $52k after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc... We have $30k in debt.  We have only my 401k which just kicked in last month. We rent an apartment and are moving to a less-expensive one in March when our current lease is up.  We own our cars outright, and as of right now my student loans qualify for income based repayment.  The minimum payment required per month is $0, since we file taxes separately.   We have no savings. We spend frivolously, convincing ourselves we'll be fine and we have the money to buy ____. Truth be told, if we have any sort of financial crisis my in-laws would probably help us out, but I don't want to get to that point.   I'm considering attending Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University in January because I'm so desperate to have an emergency fund and save up for a down payment and other things.    Our biggest struggle is that our rent eats up the first paycheck of the month and then some. We live in a city where the cost of living is pretty low for the US, so finding that cheaper apartment isn't difficult.    I'm curious if any resources really worked for you, or any advice you have for us.  Did anyone try FPU? I'm aware that FPU is biblical, but I'm more concerned with the results than anything else.  Not to mention my husband and I are (somewhat lapsed) Christians  Thanks for any help.   For me, it's either when they pace someone in the other person's blind spot or riding their ass.  I don't have that much trust in other drivers.   No sex-ed is the best sex-ed!      I've been attempting keto for the last 6 months but can't really get the hang of it.  I have metabolic syndrome and a voracious appetite, so eating what I want on keto hasn't been beneficial with the calorie-dense foods.    Today I started eating every 2.5-3 hours, having no more than 200 calories.  This has satisfied my desire to eat all the time, as well as helped me stay under my 1300 calorie limit.  Anyone else have to do this or something similar in order to keep on track?    I've heard for the last 6 months that my appetite will go away, just wait it out.  Never happened.  I'm not willing to wait anymore, because I've gone 6 months without losing a single pound.  Granted, I haven't gained any weight, but going to the gym 3x a week and working out with a personal trainer once a week... I'm not happy at all.      Let's share our shame.      So I have borderline polycystic ovaries, but none of my blood tests reflect PCOS symptoms.  I have hirsutism, though, so my RE put me on spironolactone.  I'm also on synthroid, but that's unrelated.  I'M SO FUCKING EXHAUSTED. I'm on 100mg spiro.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I saw one of the side effects listed online is fatigue, but this is ridiculous.   Okay, so basically since I went to college in 2006 I haven't been extremely involved in churches.  I would go about once a month.  Since I got married 7 months ago my husband and I have been once.  I want to be involved in a church but both my husband and I have a hard time being involved in a church whose services we really don't enjoy whatsoever or a church we disagree with on our big points.  We talked about this last night and my husband describes himself as a lapsed Christian.  He believes what Christianity teaches overall, but he can't find a church that meets his needs.    First of all, we're in Texas.  Lots of churches I've been to here are preaching that homosexuality is horrific and anyone not heterosexual is essentially going to hell.  We don't share that belief at all.    Second, the whole evolution thing.  We are *not* YEC's, and we'd like to find a church that embraces science and evolution instead of being apathetic or strongly YEC.   Third, the layout.  We're so over singing 3 songs and hearing a preacher tell us stories from his personal life that somehow connect to the message of "Jesus saves" that he's preaching. My husband really enjoys the liturgical side of worship even more than the message itself.  Basically my husband and I want a place where we can get into the Greek and Hebrew of the message, getting more into the context of the passages and knowing what was really going on at the time and what it really means.  We believe the Bible in its original languages is infallible. We are neither Calvinist nor Arminian, we are Lutheran in that sense, but we don't need a Lutheran church.  We just don't want someone that will shove either Cism or Aism down our throats because we don't find that important whatsoever.  I've looked into home churches in my area and I found one and have messaged the pastor about these issues, but I'm willing to bet that his answer will not be what I'm looking for.  Any suggestions?     I got a tooth extracted today.  That would be it for me.      OK so I use MFP to track my calories.  It essentially "nets" my calories so that my net consumption is 1350 calories.  That is, if I burn 219 calories, my food calories will jump up to 1569 calories.  Should I still just stick to 1350 and have those other 219 be deficit?  I want to lose weight healthily and I'm not sure if not eating those 219 will hinder anything.    In late march I had a debilitating panic attack.  I was dizzy, heart rate was up, I was pacing for 3 hours straight.  I went to the ER and got diagnosed with an inner ear infection.  Vertigo along with anxiety are very common symptoms of this infection, so I kept having mini panic attacks due to my loss of equilibrium.    I went back on 12.5 mg of Zoloft, as I had been off it for 3 months when the attack hit.  Ever since then I've had GAD, being on the brink of an attack all day, every day.  Recently I started working out and went off the Zoloft and lo and behold, no more anxiety at all.  It cooled down to about 85 the other day (for Houston that's a nice day) and I closed my eyes walking outside and felt genuinely happy for the first time in over 2 years.    Pretty sure the Zoloft and sedentary lifestyle was causing my constant anxiety.  I just wanted to celebrate this on this subreddit, which has been helpful in these past 6 months dealing with this shit.   I got one on Sunday for my birthday and I'm desperate to make something.  I've made mousse, but I'm pretty burnt out on that dessert.  I don't need dessert recipes. I've been looking online but found one or two threads on low carb friends, but I knew all those recipes.   Thanks!   I've had an iPhone since the release of the iPhone 3.  My iPhone 4 hardware has started crapping out, with the home and lock buttons being unresponsive half of the time, and the camera being faulty. I was looking forward to the iPhone 5 but now that most of its features are standard on other phones, I'm not as excited.    Anyways, I can hold out for another month or so with my crappy iPhone, assuming the Note II comes out in mid-October.  I'm just very new to looking at phones for hardware and new with the Android OS.  I like the larger display the Note offers as well as the pen.      But I'm not sure I'd be utilizing it fully as it was intended.    I appreciate any help.   Back story:  I was on 200mg of Zoloft (for depression mostly) for 18 months and weaned myself off under a doctor's supervision, as I was a zombie and it was driving my then-fiance away. I had some major panic attacks for the  first time in my life starting in March of this year.  For about 2 months I was having them 3 times a week.  Then they waned down some to only once or twice a month, after going back on ~12.5mg of Zoloft again.  I think this was a mistake, as I wasn't under a doctor's supervision because I didn't have insurance at all.   Today was one of those times where I had a panic attack for a good 3 hours. Even the calming manatee didn't help. I think I may have unevenly broke my pill last night and took too much, but I just felt extremely lightheaded, my vision was all fucked up, and I felt especially disconnected from reality.  My brain was not working right and it freaked me out.  I couldn't think of the words I was trying to say, I wasn't making the connection with words I read in emails and on paper.  It's like, I knew the words but the information wasn't making it to my brain. The disconnect is what gets me the most.  I don't feel like myself anymore.  I feel disconnected for the majority of my day and I feel on edge all the fucking time. After today, I've now got an enormous headache, probably because my brain was working overtime today.  So today I made an appointment with a psychiatrist for the first time.  My old GP originally prescribed me Zoloft but now I've had enough.  I need an adjustment.  I need to feel normal again.  I just don't want to keep feeling like I'm going down the rabbit hole into insanity anymore.   F, 25 yo, 5'5", 193lbs.    I just started CrossFit yesterday.  I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it, even though I felt like I was going to die towards the end.  The workout was scaled down.  I was reminded, however, why I've not stuck with working out before.  About 5 minutes into any vigorous workout, my chest starts burning.  My heart rate is pretty elevated but my doctor says it's nothing to be worried about (175 max).  I've breathed through my nose, through my mouth, breathed deeper, but nothing seems to alleviate this.    This is ultimately what stopped my previous work out attempts.  About 2 years ago I got to week 3 of C25K but couldn't progress farther, despite doing week 3 for 2 months straight.  The chest burning was too much. I noticed last night a bit of wheezing for about 30 minutes after the workout was completed.  Could this be athletic asthma?  Or am I just a wuss and need to push through it? I plan on visiting a GP in the next couple weeks, but I wanted to hear some opinions.   I just got a full face wax for the first time and the poor woman had to tweeze for 10 minutes after the waxing itself was done.  I usually pluck my chin and any other hairs I feel but it's been getting out of control lately and my self esteem is suffering.  I still have to sit here and pluck the ones that were recently plucked.  Anyways, how do you deal?      I am a workout beginner.  I've tried to go do cardio at the gym before but I get bored.  I feel this sort of program will be more beneficial to me as it requires actively tracking progress.    The thing is, I've never lifted weights before.  Ever.  I feel CF would help me learn how to lift properly and be a good program to get involved with, but is CF for beginners as inexperienced as myself?   Stats: 25f, 5'5, 194lbs.      All we know, as confirmed by some [obscure article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19258348) on BBC's news site, is that it's airing in September.  The only source I've seen saying it's 1 September is some blogspot post and other articles that say BFI attendees say 1 September was confirmed.  If you're going to claim it's a specific date, please include some legitimate source, preferably a BBC or Steven Moffat confirmation. I'm just very skeptical of this date that's being thrown around.   Title says it all.  I had a GP since birth who I recently left because he started charging a monthly fee.  Long story, but when I was with him I expressed an interest in seeing a psychiatrist.  He told me not to, because of certain tactics psychiatrists use vs. counselors.  He didn't want someone trying to get me on a cocktail of medications when I really only needed one and some good CBT.  So now I'm running out of Zoloft and I need to get my dose readjusted.  Do I go see another GP and tell him/her my situation and ask for a reassessment of my medications?  I'm on 25mg of Zoloft.  Without my meds I'm irritable, on edge, and anxious.  If I break my 50mg pill unevenly and take more than half I'm anxious, lightheaded, and can't stop zoning out.  I know y'all aren't doctors and I need to see one, but I just need some form of feedback so I'll know what to expect.   Do they offer sugar free flavorings? I'm currently sipping a peach sprite zero and am thinking its full of sugar.          Do you put heavy cream in your tea instead of milk or just drink it plain?  I'm an American and I used to drink coffee but the caffeine has started making me jittery and exacerbating my anxiety.  I know cream + coffee = greatness but not sure about tea + cream. Specifically Earl Grey.   Never fails. Just need to vent. I have to get up at 5:45am so I can get ready for my first day at a new job. Been tossing and turning since 1am, managed to get 30 min of sleep but otherwise laying here doing nothing. I'm not even very nervous, compared to other fits of anxiety. Just can't sleep. This always happens, and my first day goes by in a fatigue haze.  I can't take energy supplements bc they exacerbate my anxiety. Blah.   Thanks for listening.   UPDATE: THIS JOB ROCKS! The orientation this morning was extremely boring, but I love my boss and the few coworkers I've met so far.     I guess amenorrhea is a very common symptom of PCOS, but it's never been that prominent in me.  Mine comes **on average** once every 30 days.  Sometimes it's a little later. Sometimes a little earlier. But it seems most on here talk about how they go over 3 months without having one if they're not on BC.   On that same topic, I know I should ask a doctor the following question, but I'm working on getting short term health insurance at the moment.  Because my periods aren't irregular, does that mean I'm fertile? I figure me getting a period every 30 days or so means I'm ovulating once in that time period.    Feel free to discuss you periods in this thread, and thanks in advance for any answer to my question!     I'm tutoring a student in calculus III, offering a refresher course for him to re-take it in the fall.  He's an engineering and physics double major, and he loves applications of math vs. pure theory.  He's only taken mechanics, no pure engineering courses yet.  Obviously basic mechanics can be used with the basics of vectors, but when it comes to directional derivatives, gradients, and curl I'm having difficulty thinking of applications that he could realistically do.  I have a BS in math, so the theory part really interested me more.     Usually I tutor people who are struggling with coursework. The guy in tutoring today is definitely a high achieving student, he just had a bad teacher and lost his zeal for the subject. To make things worse, in trying to secure a job with his father's company. I've been commissioned to reignite a passion for math, something that I don't know if I can do. I always second guess myself. Right now I'm worried that I'm not prepared enough, that I won't be able to meet the expectations, that I ultimately won't get the position I want.   Thanks for listening.    Okay, I started keto April 15.  I've had PCOS for about 6-7 years but haven't taken my medication.  Recently I fell off the wagon after having absolutely no success on keto and actually having it exacerbate my anxiety.  I've been eating still lower carb than before keto, but only because carbs have started to frighten me.  I had one bout of a high-carb meal and felt extremely hyperglycemic.   Anyways, basically what happened through my 75 days of keto was I lost the initial water weight the first 2 weeks.  After that I had nothing.  I was fluctuating around the same weight (193 lbs) the entire time, no matter what I did.  I went to /r/keto for help multiple times, resulting in me trying IF, fat fasting, water increase, weight training, everything.  Nothing was working.  So when I fell off the wagon I decided to start taking my Metformin again.  It hasn't caused the digestive issues it had before, thankfully, but I need some motivation.  I need some inspiration.    TL;DR: Keto didn't work for me the first time for 75 days when I was unmedicated.  Now I'm back on medicine but I need to hear some stories from ladies with PCOS who have had success using keto and Metformin to lose weight.      Anyone else have any type of anxious feelings upon waking?  Mine is only after waking from a nap, and it's gotten to the point where I"m afraid to take a nap because I don't want to feel like this.  It just happened again and it sucks.   I already feel better.  It's so wonderful to be able to air what makes me anxious to a compassionate professional! I've already got some things to help me out if and when the anxiety creeps up on me.  So ready for these weekly sessions!   I either put it on too thin, where I need 2-4 coats, or too thick, where it looks awesome but isn't dry after 20 minutes (still a little goopy).  What am I doing wrong?   Also, can clear polish substitute a top coat? I can't afford to buy a good one right now, so should I use the clear or just forego top coat until I can get a legit top coat?   One would think I'm wired perfectly for keto.  I have PCOS, I'm insulin resistant, and I'm chubby.  Nothing else has ever worked before.  So here's my story.  As per my stats in my flair, I started 4/15.  First week, lost 12 pounds of what I'm assuming was mostly water weight.  After the first week, nothing. I tried IF, fat fasting, cutting artificial sweeteners, upping protein, upping fat, weight training, light cardio... you name it, I tried it.  I was drowning myself in water every day.    Then, about 10 days in my brain became foggy.  Researched it on here, upped my potassium via V8 low sodium, lite salt, swiss chard, cream of tartar, and avocados.  Met all my electrolyte goals on MFP but my perception was still off.    Then it happened.  This change in perception, along with the dizziness and light-headedness, caused my anxiety to skyrocket.  I've never had full-blown panic attacks until the beginning of May, when I started having them almost every other day.  I went to urgent care walk-in clinics twice, got put on beta blockers, but I still *felt* wrong.  I saw the world differently than I had before.  Even my regular GP couldn't give me an answer as to why I was feeling like I was, so I made an appointment with a therapist.    Friday, June 1, after feeling utterly miserable anxiety-wise for the last 40 days or so (the requisite amount of time it takes the brain to adjust to ketones), my husband took me on a date. Long story short, I cheated and had about 40g net carbs.  Figured I'd wake up the next day out of ketosis and feeling miserable.  I woke up the next morning, sure enough, out of ketosis.  But there was something different.  **I felt normal** and I was perceiving the world like I used to, no more dizziness or lightheadedness, no more postural hypotension.  So I went on the internet and realized that in some people with serotonin deficiencies, keto can exacerbate anxiety like nobody's business.  This increase in anxiety was causing me to stress out, which is why (I assume) I wasn't losing any weight at all.  So I'm sorry keto.  For my own mental health I can't continue this.  Don't worry, I'm not going low-fat diet or anything, I think I'll just try paleo for a while.  You know, adding in vegetables with a higher net carb count, maybe increasing my carb macro to 15% while increasing my cardio a little.  I'll still hang around here for food inspiration.  *I'm just not willing to sacrifice my sanity for 20g carbs per day. I'm now just sticking with under 50g.  Some might still consider this keto, some may not.*   **TL;DR: After 7 weeks of keto, my anxiety had skyrocketed, I was foggy, and I wasn't losing weight, despite my efforts to change all of these through advice sought on /r/keto.  Had a minor cheat Friday and felt normal for the first time in 6 weeks, researched, and realized those with serotonin deficiency can have anxiety exacerbated through extremely low-carb diets.  Upping my carb count to 50g and wanted to post this in case someone in the future has a similar problem.**    Edit: **I just wanted to share this in case anyone ever goes through it as well, they can see what happened to another person.** I'm not saying keto is unhealthy (quite the contrary), I'm just saying it doesn't *always* make anxiety and depression better, and it *can* have some adverse side effects depending on your body chemistry and the medications you're taking.     Thank you so much for the kind words and encouragement.  I love /r/keto   I mean, being suicidal isn't a qualifier for every depression case.  I've actually got a little hypochondria and have a fear of death, but every time I come across something about depression on reddit, someone mentions how they want to kill themselves or how many times they've tried.  I never have and I never will, I just have a serotonin deficiency that causes depression.  It's kinda weird that I feel alone even on the /r/depression subreddit.   I'm sick of spending $11 on a pound of Bob's almond meal at H-E-B.  I make holy grail pizza at least twice a week.  I'm a newlywed and can't afford to spend that much on almond meal.  We have a crappy food processor and  are really busy so I'd rather just buy some and not make my own.  Free/cheap shipping would be awesome, too.  Should probably mention I'm in the states, if you didn't catch that by the H-E-B   Hey all, long time no talk.  Sorry I haven't been as active here as I used to be, but life caught up with me.    Anyways, I have a question and am not good at brainstorming these things on my own.  My husband has felt the calling to work in a ministry of some form since shortly after he became a Christian.  Recently, however, he's become very disillusioned to working in an actual church due to the politics that go on.  He doesn't want to deal with the bigotry of individual people, the limitations of what he can speak about so that he doesn't upset some people, the emails after a sermon from some upset congregation member, the list goes on.  This can extend to foreign missions, too, but he's been pretty clear that with the gifts God gave him, he's pretty sure the call isn't for foreign missions anyways.  What are some other roles that don't require specific denominational affiliation, don't require answering to hundreds of people, yet still allow him to get his M.Div and spread the love of Christ through his actions and responsibilities?  The only thing I could come up with is a chaplain for a hospital, which he expressed some interest in.  I just thought I'd get some feedback from you guys and gals since our brainstorming sessions have ended up empty.  Note: while we're trying to volunteer our time through our church and other things, this needs to be a paid position, one that pays enough to contribute enough to raise a family on (along with mine).  We don't expect it to pay a lot, but we're hoping more than the $23k/year youth ministry positions we're finding in the ELCA and LCMS.      I've been on keto for 5 weeks now and, following the initial water weight, have not lost another pound. I'm consistently under 20g carbs, am drinking enough water, am meeting my macros and calorie goals, have tried IF, fat fasting, and cutting out artificial sweeteners.   I've measured myself and haven't lost any inches. I'm literally the same place I was after losing the water weight. If I had lost the 10 pounds spread out over 5 weeks this post wouldn't be here.   The only way I'm not perfectly meeting my macros is on the net carbs. I'm usually under 20g, around 10 or 15.  I eat spinach salads every day and broccoli at night, so I'm getting enough veggies. I'm on a probiotic and multivitamin.   What gives? I have insulin resistance and PCOS, so this lifestyle should be perfect for me. My sugar addiction is gone but the weight won't come off at all.   The only thing I can think of is that I should try the last resort: working out. My nemesis. I've never had good endurance or diligence when it came to working out and I was put on beta blockers this last week so it worries me a bit.   I just need advice. I've posted my food logs before and adjusted my macros as advised. They're never perfect by someone's standards but they're pretty damn close.   Help me, /r/keto. You're my only hope    I've been on the /r/keto diet for a month now and have realized how expensive it can be, with all the meat and produce purchases.  I plan on going to [Canino](http://www.caninoproduce.com/) on Saturday to pick up some veggies, but I've also heard just hispanic markets in general are good for meat and veggies.  Which ones are the best and can cater to someone with extremely limited Spanish skills?  I went into a carniceria once looking for slab bacon and got looks of confusion from the butchers there, and I'd like to avoid that in the future.   My husband has a psychological addiction to a pot-like substance.  We got married in March.  I have been asking him to cut back for a long time, for probably 18 months now but my prodding became serious in the past 2 months.  Every time we get into a discussion about it, the topic always turns to why I don't like it, and how my reasons aren't enough to warrant him quitting.  He can see himself doing this for the rest of his life.  He claims if pot were ever legalized, he'd use the real stuff.  He claims to use this fake shit because of work and other legal issues.  He doesn't smoke around me, he's granted me that and I'm grateful for the compromise.  He smokes before work, on his lunch break, and he smokes after I go to bed while he plays video games.  Now, this isn't to say I don't understand, I was the exact same.  I smoked this shit for 2 years before a new blend gave me the worst anxiety attack of my life and I gave it up.  He made a deal with me to only buy a certain amount every week and he's broken that in the past 2 weeks.  He always has excuses ready, like he was sick and it makes him feel better so he smoked a lot one day, a fight we got in stressed him out so he smoked a lot that day too, etc…  I don't like it because I don't want his life to revolve around this substance.  I also don't want to deal with the financial repercussions if, God forbid, one of us loses our job or something happens.  It's getting to the point where I'm paranoid about him going behind my back and breaking the compromise by getting cash back on debit transactions in order to go buy this stuff without my knowledge, despite his promise to include me on all substance purchases.  The ideal situation would be that a) I just lose all concern about this and b) he stay within the boundaries of our compromise for financial reasons.  He was raised by an unbearably nagging mother, so any time I seriously get in his face about this he just shuts down in order to shut me up.  That's what worked with his mother and it infuriates me.  I don't want to annoy him and be on his case constantly; I don't want to be his mother.  TL;DR: Husband is addicted to pot-like substance, denies its control over his life. I'm getting paranoid and would love any advice to break me out of this paranoia.  To be completely honest I just don't want to care anymore, but I have a history of anxiety and I have a hard time controlling my thoughts.    Thanks for the advice, everyone.  This post may have come off as a "help me convince my husband to stop or tell me what to do to make it go away." I meant it to be "I know my thoughts are irrational so can someone please give me some advice to deal with this better?" 4nonymo was the most helpful in this.  Many of your points have been brought up in our 5 fights about it and they've all been successfully resolved, but my anxious and nagging feelings remained.  The only course of action left is for me to go get some form of therapy to help deal with my mental health.           25/f, in case it matters  My anxiety used to be just very occasional, seemingly mild panic attacks.   Then one day in late March, I took a nap after dinner and woke up to the most horrific panic attack of my life.  It lasted 3 hours, then I finally went to the ER.  They said I might be dehydrated, and then eventually discovered an ear infection.  Apparently the nerve that goes from the inner ear to the brain, the one that causes dizziness with this, also goes to the part that triggers anxiety.  So I had to deal with anxiety and dizziness for the next 10 days or so.  I also started /r/keto around the time my dizziness subsided.  Ever since mid-April I've had this constant mild anxiety, where my resting heart rate is 85-105 bpm.  I have random dizzy spells.  I've been off Zoloft for 7 months and ran out of lorazepam during my ear infection, and I can't get another script for a while due to a medical insurance snafu.    My anxiety is in the form of hypochondria and doomsday thoughts.  I can't drive on the freeway after work because I'm terrified of an accident.  I'm constantly checking my pulse.  I have anxiety when I wake up from naps, so I don't nap anymore.  It seems that my depression is no longer wreaking havoc over my life, just the anxiety.  It's driving me crazy.  I've tried l-theanine, but I'm afraid to take it too much because of the hypochondria.  I'm picking up magnesium on the way home from work for both anxiety and digestive issues.    **Could this still be due to the inner ear problem? What should I do? Any luck with OTC supplements??**   I've posted a couple links in the past few days that have my daily recordings of food, and a few people said my macros are off and I'm not getting enough protein.  So I went out and bought Jay Robb's chocolate whey protein powder, 1g net carbs per scoop.  Fucking shit kicked me out of ketosis.    ***FOR THE KETO ANALYSTS/EXPERTS:***Does it **really** matter that my macros aren't up to par all the time? I'm getting more fat than anything and staying below my carb ratio.  My protein is about 75% of what it should be, but I'm not getting all the way up there because I get really full really quickly.  [First tracking day](http://i.imgur.com/QLqmB.jpg)  [Second tracking day](http://i.imgur.com/eSIBq.jpg)  I'm just extremely frustrated, because I've been doing everything right and I've been stuck around 193 for the past 2 weeks now.  I'm a woman, my body shouldn't be comfortable at this weight.  Maybe I should take a walk tonight or something.   [I posted yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/to4ch/first_day_of_tracking_all_of_my_food_would_like/), asking for feedback of my first fully-tracked food day.  I tracked again, and I can't seem to get enough protein.  I ate a mass amount of shrimp for dinner and even then, not enough.  I want to stay away from protein powder, as I have a difficult time drinking disgusting things and I've yet to find one that is tasty.    If I have to, I'll buy protein powder.  What are some other ways of getting in some more protein?  [Here's my food log from yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/eSIBq.jpg)  **I really appreciate you, /r/keto, for being here for me when I need your help.  Which is most of the time.**   I've had mild depression and anxiety for the past 10 years or so (since my teens).  About 7 months ago I weaned myself off of Zoloft, because I wanted to feel emotions again.  I wasn't very anxious until I had an ear infection recently, which somehow triggered my anxiety.  Now I have a constant mild anxiety regarding my health and safety.   Anyways, I've read that 5-HTP is a good natural supplement that helps with mild anxiety and depression and was wondering if anyone uses it while doing keto and if there are any adverse side effects?  I have a theory as to why my anxiety has creeped back up and the weight hasn't been coming off easily: serotonin.  I think I'm serotonin deficient and there are studies that show that serotonin deficiency has an adverse effect on weight loss and weight control, and 5-HTP has shown to increase serotonin levels.  I used to get the serotonin from eating carby foods, because I was a sugar addict. I would feel awesome as I was eating sugary, carb-laden foods, but about 10 minutes afterwards would feel physically miserable from hyperglycemia (I've got PCOS and am insulin resistant).    EDIT:  Thanks to everyone for the advice! I decided to give L-Theanine a go and got a bottle.  I took one about 30 minutes ago (6:25pm CST) and am already feeling **MUCH** more stable, especially given that my hypochondriac anxiety was very mild to begin with      It's really encouraging to see people losing 20 pounds in the first month.  But it's also frustrating to get through my own first month and only have lost 10 pounds.  I've basically plateaued since after the first week.  I've had a couple of cheat meals (one being yesterday), and it seems like it takes my weight forever to get back on track even though I'm pissing dark pink on the sticks and have smelly breath.  I posted a comment not too long ago about waiting to exercise until I'm down some more weight, but I decided with my current frustration to change my mind.  I'm starting some light weight training tonight with my husband.  I'm giving up most of the artificially sweetened things that were staples of my beginning keto diet.    I have to remind myself that my progress will probably be slower than others', since in the past 18 months I've lost 50 pounds and gained 30 back.  I know yo-yo dieting has an effect on speed of weight loss, as well as my PCOS (and, therefore, insulin resistance), hypothyroidism, and IBS.    One thing I will say for certain that I'm very pleased with: my sugar addiction is gone.  It was so bad before I got married and started keto that about twice a month I would have this enormous craving for cookies or cake and go to Wal-Mart to fulfill my desires.  For those of you with insulin resistance and former sugar addiction, you know this craving was basically insatiable.  You'd go, eat half the carton of oreos (or even the whole carton if it was a particularly bad one) and then feel like death was coming afterwards.  Now, I have that deathy feeling even after a small cheat.  I get tired, my eyes go cross, my anxiety creeps back up on me.  It's horrendous.  This morning, for example, I feel like death and an overly inflated balloon.  I had one of my sister's famous brownies yesterday and I felt like hell the rest of the day.    So even though I'm frustrated at my lack of success, thank you, /r/keto, for curing my addiction.   I want to pre make bacon for breakfasts every week, but the bacon from my work cafeteria is so much more superior than my bacon. Theirs is thinner, crispy but not too crispy. No fatty ends. I've tried a bacon press, I've tried the oven. Nothing I do works as well.   HELP!  Edit;  I think I discovered the problem. Even though I'm not buying "thick-cut bacon", it's too thick.  I think I need some specialty thinly sliced bacon.      I’ve had chronic constipation for as long as I can remember.  It’s been the black spot on my life that I can’t seem to get rid of, and now that I’m doing keto religiously, it’s gotten worse.  “Rabbit poops” are an apt term to describe my predicament up until a few days ago.  I’ve barely defecated since Sunday, so today after work I’m going to pick up a glycerin enema.  I eat a carbmaster yogurt every day, so I thought I would be getting all the probiotics I need.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  DISCLAIMER: **Don’t recommend fiber.**  It just exacerbates the problem by increasing the volume of my fecal matter.  That is, it clogs me even more.  My doctor has said to stay away from psyllium husks, benefiber, and even flaxseed meal because of this in the past.      **EDIT** Thanks for all the advice!  I"m going to try the coconut oil in coffee in the mornings, but tonight I think I'll use more... uncomfortable and temporary solutions.  I need this out of me because I've gained 3 pounds and am bloated as fuck (*not* from water retention, I can tell)    Background: I live in Houston, big metropolitan area, low cost of living (especially in the ‘burbs).  “Poor” credit score due to stupidity by my husband and myself with college credit cards, getting it sorted out, though it will take a while.  We currently rent an apartment here, spending about $1300/month on rent + utilities.  Two questions:  1. If we can’t get approved for credit cards, will we get approved for a mortgage  2. If we could get approved for a mortgage, would we be better off buying a house (probably $125k or less) or should we just stick with an apartment?  Which would be better for us financially (in a broad sense since I’m not sharing any more financial information), renting or “owning”?    I bought a pack of these at HEB because they were cheap and beef, but I realized I have no idea how to cook them without many carbs.  My grandmother made these for me growing up occasionally, but she made them fried with gravy like [the pioneer woman](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/08/fried-round-steak/) and I'd rather not bust out the almond meal or any other keto carb alternative.  Any suggestions?            I woke up this morning (10am) with a slightly elevated temp (98.9 for someone with unmedicated hypothyroidism due to marginal blood work and maxed out insurance).  30 minutes ago it had skyrocketed to 101.4.  I thought it was just a hangover from the double jack and diet I had last night (first drink since starting keto), but when the fever hit I was convinced it's something else.  I can't keep anything but smart water, vitamins, and aspirin down and I'm having the runs (TMI, sorry).  It's currently a birth-control induced shark week, as that may be important.  I've been in ketosis since 4/17 and have lost 10 pounds.  My husband is out getting me sugar free jello to try to keep down.  My question is this: **What should I do?** Since I'm in ketosis, I'm not retaining water so I'm afraid I'll get dehydrated.  Should I just sacrifice for the sickness and eat some carbs? I'm feeling absolutely miserable and honestly can't afford to visit a doctor other than a free clinic, so I'm coming to the keto experts first.  Again, I apologize for hounding r/keto with questions today (all 2 of them).  EDIT: Thanks for the responses.  I ate some tyson chicken nuggets (5 of them at 15g total) and am waiting for sugar free jell-o to set.  This was a couple hours ago so I feel better now and the sticks are saying I'm still in ketosis.  I'll be drinking the broth.   He's 6'2 and around 360, but he's seen the scale go up 5 pounds in our first week of weighing (3rd week of keto).  He says he's always hungry and is in ketosis all the time (I've seen the stix).  I figured since he's a big guy he doesn't have to watch his calories *that* much, based on what I've read in this subreddit for the past 3 months or so.  He also claims to be tired and hungry all the time.  He drinks about a gallon of water every day, salad for lunch, meats and cheeses and veggies for dinner. Usually skips breakfast bc he doesn't have time as he likes to sleep as late as possible. He has a couple sprite zeroes a night.  Meanwhile I've been losing on the diet faster than I've lost before.  Any advice?   This is for the husband, not me.    He's a pretty big guy, 6'2 325lbs +.  We started keto last week and he started drinking more water specifically today.  Before today he would mainly stick to diet sodas or flavored sparkling waters ([these](http://www.amazon.com/Sparkling-ICE-Variety-Flavors-17-Ounce/dp/B003OZYVE4)). He said he feels fine otherwise and is in hardcore ketosis but his pee isn't diluting.  It's still dark, as if he's dehydrated.  Will it take a while for his body to properly hydrate itself? There are no other signs of renal failure, but I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem.      I'm bored at work and have been looking up different low carb bread options and need some opinions.  I loathe oopsie rolls.  I'm not a big egg fan and these taste too eggy for me.  I'm planning on trying [almond buns](http://cavemanketo.com/2012/02/15/faux-bread-quest-holy-grail-almond-buns/) tonight, and am excited because everyone has said in the comments that they taste very buttery.  Minute muffins are okay but I have IBS and they... slow things down even more.  Too much fiber can have adverse affects, even with extreme hydration.     Back on the wagon, bought some more ketostix to keep myself motivated.  However, I realize the importance of being well hydrated on keto and so every time I try to use the ketostix, it registers a color between Neutral and Trace.  What should I do? Decrease water intake? Increase fats (even though I'm pretty much hitting my macros every day)?  I'm just frustrated from not knowing if I'm in ketosis.    Disclaimer: I don't notice the acetone breath and dinosaur sweat pee, even when I did keto before and my ketostix registered a dark purple just after waking up.  I don't know why I can't recognize the other signs of ketosis, so honestly those physical signs don't really work for me.   Back story: I smoked Spice (fake weed) for about a year, every day.  I quit thankfully, and don't even smoke trees as I'm afraid of its effects on me. I recently had an inner ear infection that left me perpetually dizzy and anxious for a week.  I got over it and have recently weaned myself completely off Zoloft and Ativan.  I finally feel like I'm getting back to normal, but I'll have spells where my perception feels off.  Like I feel a little lightheaded, I feel like the world around me is wrong.  I see everything normally, it's just a feeling in my head.  It's *almost* enough to trigger mild anxiety, but not quite enough.    Has anyone else experienced this? I figure if it's an effect from coming off Zoloft and Ativan then it might get a response on here.  Even if it doesn't apply to you, hey, you're awesome.      I obviously have a food addiction, most of which is associated with carbs.  I tried to start keto back in November, did it for a week, lost 10 pounds then gave up for some unknown reason.  Did the exact same thing in December.  I'm now realizing if I would have just sucked it up and suffered through the first couple weeks, I'd probably be down 30 pounds (or more) by now, but because I lacked the willpower necessary (and was a lazy fuck who made excuses), I'm still where I was in November.  Thankfully I haven't gained any since then.  Take this lesson, newbie ketoers, that if you stick with it you'll have progress pics to show off in just a few months.    As for me, I've set goals for myself (a generous 8 months to lose 40 pounds).  I've discovered that I can like eggs if they're topped with salsa from my work's cafeteria. I've asked my new husband to encourage me to eat keto-friendly desserts (chocolate mousse... YUM) and have started parking in the garage across campus from my office so that I can get off my butt and work more.   Sorry, just needed to get that out there.  I'm starting fresh. Not putting a lot of pressure on myself.  Working through this carb addiction. Gonna be hotter stuff by my birthday in September.   If this doesn't belong here, please direct me to where I should post this.  There are just so many ent subreddits that I'm just clueless.  First, my back story:  I have anxiety and depression.  The anxiety isn't constant but was recently exacerbated by an inner ear infection.  For a span of about 18 months between 2008 and 2010 I smoked "legal" substitues.  Yes, I know about how unhealthy it is and I quit after the newer blends were giving me panic attacks.  I recently convinced my new husband to switch to real trees, but I'm afraid about partaking myself with what happened before with the legal stuff.  I know they're completely different, but I'm still concerned.  That being said, is medical marijuana prescribed for anxiety and depressive disorders?  I've read about long-term smokers developing anxiety, supposedly because of the long-term use.  I don't live in a medical state, but I figured the best way to get a somewhat scientific/medical answer is to ask:  Is medical marijuana prescribed for the relief of anxiety disorders?  I know it's used for depression.    I appreciate you, Ents.   I've got anxiety, but thankfully my Zoloft keeps it pretty much under control.    Friday night was hell for me, though.  I took a nap after dinner and woke up to what I thought was an immediate panic attack.  Rapid heart rate, the urge to get up and move, and a feeling of uneasiness lasted for **3 hours.**  I was in hell, so i had my husband take me to a non-hospital ER.  I was diagnosed as severely dehydrated, hooked up to an IV, and began to feel a little better.  Then the doctor finds what he thinks is a bacterial middle ear infection.  So I've been dizzy and my slight fever hasn't gone away even with antibiotics.  I went back to a regular doctor today.  She says I have a viral inner ear infection, explaining my dizziness and my fever being unresponsive to antibiotics. She gave me an EKG to see how my heart's doing, and just noticed a slight raise in HR (108 bpm), which usually happens to me when I'm sick or in pain.    I've still been having very mild anxiety spells, though, followed by 30 minutes of me obsessively checking my pulse every 4 minutes or so.  Probably doesn't help the situation.  Does anyone know if this can be caused by the dizziness I'm experiencing?  Also, I've been having panic spells lasting about 3 minutes after I wake up, and I can't stay asleep for more than 90 minutes at a time.  My doctor couldn't explain this but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this.  TL;DR - Inner ear infection causing dizziness, had mild panic spells (lasting max 30 seconds) since ER visit on Friday.  Mild panic spells for 3-5 minutes after waking.  Anyone else experienced this before?   I'll start this out by saying I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been truly suicidal.  To be honest, I have a pretty good life.  I have a job with a major energy corporation, albeit a contract position.  I got married a week and a half ago to a wonderful supportive man who adores me. We adopted a kitten a few weeks ago.    But my fucking job.  I loathe it.  I'm basically a data entry drone.  They're gradually giving me more responsibilities, but they haven't given any hints that I'll be offered a full time (salaried) position.  I'm an incredibly efficient worker and I finish my work pretty quickly (unintentionally).  When I finish my work, I'm sent home.  I fucking hate it, because as a newlywed and someone with student loans, I CANT AFFORD TO BE SENT HOME.  But I also can't slow down my work speed, I already have tried and realized I just can't.    I don't want to go to a job where I have to interact with people.  I want to work from home.  I have incredible potential and know that I should be doing more with my life but by not getting an internship in college I royally screwed myself and am stuck at a soul-sucking job day in and day out, where my contract could end any day.  Not to mention I have had migraines the past couple months, and have missed more work than I should.  I got a talking to by my boss last week about it.  But yesterday she decided to come in hacking up a lung and now I'm feeling feverish.  It's just a shit ball rolling down shit hill and I just want to be out.  I'm sure most of us know what the job market is like right now; it's nearly impossible to find a job with limited experience.  This is my first professional job and I've only been there 3 1/2 months but I want something new.    I don't know where I'm going with this... I just want a new job.  I want to work from home.  TL;DR: I'm too efficient at my job. I've been sick quite a bit recently and my boss just got me sick again, but I can't afford to miss work.  I want a more rewarding job, or to work from home, but the job market sucks.  My life is going well but I just feel like this job is sucking the life out of me.   I have generalized anxiety disorder and when I'm particularly nervous I seem to have trichotillomanic tendencies and pick at the tails of my eyebrows.  I'm getting married on Saturday so currently my eyebrows are sparse and my makeup artist will have to do some miracle eyebrow work.  We all know about the biting nails, chewing lips/cheeks, playing with hair... what about the weird things?      I've been working with data entry for the past 3 months.  I liked it, then I started getting more responsibilities, involving dealing with billing depts of other companies.  I am a nervous wreck when I'm on the phone with someone I don't know and it takes me about 10 minutes to write an email that should have taken 30 seconds to compose.    I need tips on dealing with this business anxiety.  I can't be successful in the business sector if I'm like this forever.      Did you go out to eat? What did you eat? Was Valentine's a cheat day for you?  I started my festivities the night before, where my grandmother gave me a bag of mini-Snickers(curse you, grams!).  I had 4 over the course of a day, enough to kick me out of ketosis.  But I powered through after that without another cheat.  I fasted all day because of that then for dinner my fiance and I made [green chili and jack chicken](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/green_chile_jack_chicken.html), [fried "rice,"](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/fried_rice.html) and [low carb brownies](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/brownies.html).    If you miss fried rice, you need to try that recipe for low carb fried rice.  It's amazingly delicious and so easy.        I was prescribed metformin a couple years ago. The first time I tried taking it I had unpleasant digestive issues. My doctor promised me that I would lose weight, but I couldn't bear those side effects. I restarted keto on Tuesday and started Metformin again simultaneously. Not only do I not have keto flu or the digestive issues, I don't crave carbs. Last time I tried keto the cravings were way too strong and it was taking a toll on my stress levels.   I last weighed myself on Sunday and I was 200.4. I weighed this morning and I'm already down to 196.8! I have never lost weight that fast before, even when I tried keto in November.   I implore you to take your Metformin. I know the pills are big, chalky, and disgusting if you don't swallow them fast enough. But those side effects I can handle and are worth the increased rate of weight loss.          I hope I'm using those terms correctly...  Salaam!  Let me just start by saying I think Islam is a beautiful religion and I consider Muslims to be my religious cousins ( [borrowing from the familial relationship spoken of Christians in Scripture](http://www.openbible.info/topics/brothers_and_sisters_in_christ) ).    Could someone explain why veils are worn? Would it be comparable to a Christian wearing a cross necklace, as an outward sign of devotion to God?   There isn't much about this topic in the Bible except in the Pentateuch (Genesis-Deuteronomy) and an exerpt in [1 Corinthians 11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2011:2-16 version=ESV).  The verses in the Pentateuch are dismissed as ancient Israelite traditions that were done away with after the resurrection of Christ.  The 1 Corinthians excerpt is usually boiled down to 1st century Roman society, where a married woman always had her hair covered as a symbol of devotion to her husband.  A married woman who had her hair uncovered (or down) in public was seen as dishonoring her husband by acting like an unmarried woman.  I'm assuming the reasoning for wearing veils has nothing to do with honoring one's husband, as there were a few girls in hijabs at my middle school.  This leads me to believe it's an outward sign of devotion and honor to God (Allah).  Thank you for your help!    We've all seen the threads asking about good Christian music.  Something my friend and I love to do is recall really bad Christian music from our childhood and laugh about how cheesy it is.  Some examples:  [Mary, Did You Know? by Mark Lowry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0WIJw8JVeU)  [Screen Door by Rich Mullins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcvBsNcIzu4)  [Creed by Petra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bofa9mQa0)  We also laugh about Butterfly Kisses.     **And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.**  I guess it never struck me before, but this verse is saying love trumps even faith itself.  Faith is on what so many Christians nowadays rely.  I can't tell you how many times I've read 1 Cor 13 and for some reason, today, this jumped out at me.    	117
                Definitely one of the best pictures I've seen on this sub.               I'm afraid it's just a gif I found - no idea what the source is :(                                                                  [Source](http://www.playvid.com/watch?v=44L7FogJoZp)                                       Big smile. Great rack.            Yup! Just how I like them, nice and thick :D   Ok, thank you both :)   I was just wondering if it's possible to change the titles of posts in a sub that I mod?  Thanks            Thank you :)   I'm really not sure mate but I do hope so!      I agree, not sure why a separate sub is needed for them, I'm sure they'd be welcome here!   Gifs are welcome at bimboxxx, but they must be of a hardcore nature, which is the purpose of the sub :)   Hi guys,  Over the last few weeks I've added quite a few shortcuts to my toolbar at the top of the table, and I was just wondering if there's an option to make the shortcut toolbar thicker, so that all my shortcuts fit on it, rather than having to scroll left and right to find them?  Thanks for any info   Ah ok, I'll post in there, thanks :)  The source code would be double dutch to me :D  Thanks for the help :)   Thanks mate, is there a manual or faq somewhere that I can find out how to do it from?? I've gone through all the preferences and can't find it!   As far as I'm concerned, Alia Janine is the best tit fucker out there, and so I wanted to share my favourite scene of hers with you all. I honestly had so much trouble deciding which section to make the gif from, but in the end I chose the part where her tits are all wet and slippery. I realise the gif is quite large, but I didn't want to cut it down anymore!  [Here](http://spankbang.com/1jrr/video/cumblastcity+mrs+janine+big+boobs+blasted) is the full, incredible video. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I do :D      Hi guys,  I'm currently using the RES, although I don't know if that has anything to do with my question! Basically, I've now gotten to the point where I'm subbed to quite a number of different places, and was wondering if I can make the grey shortcut bar at the top thicker, so that all the shortcuts are there on the same line, rather than having to click left and right to find them.  Thanks peeps   Cracking figure, and she's gorgeous as well! Nice post :)   "Hope is a good thing. maybe the best of good things. and no good thing ever dies."   Sorry it's just a gif I found on the net :(                                                What I love is that she has huge tits, but also a slim waist. Great proportions!                                                   The dress on its own would be amazing, but those thigh high socks elevate it to new levels!! Fantastic picture :)   Rosanna Davison I've been told.            Fucking love it. I'd kill to have my face buried in those monsters!            Yeah I love that girl's figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	183
 My name is Inigo Montoya.   You Killed my father.   Prepare to die.   Hell no it's not. Things eventually get better at some point, so knowing that helps. Thanks though   Back a while ago my catch phrase was always "See you on the flip-side" or "Maybe in another life." What people didn't realize was i was borderline suicidal, so those phrases had a whole deeper meaning to me.    But things are kinda ok now. So i guess this is the flip-side.    Look. Buddy. I get it. Some monks up on a mountain top yelled out some crazy chants and now you're supposed to save us from the dragons. It's your destiny. But let me tell you a little secret; i've always known I would be a shop keeper. It was decided when I was very young I would run the village shop. You could say that's *my* destiny.    Now, just because I knew my destiny, does that mean I was given all I needed scotch-free? Hell no. I had to work for it. No one taught me how to manage books, or keep inventory. I had to learn, work hard, and it's the time I spent working that made me into a great shop keeper; not the so-called "destiny" I was given.    So listen here, buddy. I don't doubt you could be the hero. But me giving you these weapons for free? That's only gonna hurt you in the long run. The monks ain't gonna make you a hero; only you can do that through building yourself into the best possible warrior you can be. By working hard, and training. I get it, I get it. I may seem like a jerk, after all what kind of impact will having to work for four gold coins make? Well, not having to work will make you lazy. Let me tell you friend, it's a slippery slope. Soon it's four coins, then it's walking around enemies and cheating your way through dungeons, and suddenly you find yourself in front of a dragon trying to *cheat* your way out.   So trust me, when you take the time to earn the money for this here broadsword, you aren't just buying a broadsword. You're buying character.  	4
    Tim Hortons on West 10th and Trimble    Sweet. He's in Vancouver now. Lucky us.    This is a fantastic source, thanks so much.   Thank you!   My sister believes that at some point Canada had a climate similar to one at the equator, before the Ice Age. I know that Canada has sub-tropical and arctic climates but I can't find any information to refute her.   Is it possible that at some point in history northern part of North America had a desert or rainforest climate?   Ay Ah ah ah Ay!   The earth is 3 million miles (5 million km) closer to the sun in January than in July.     	9
 Do tattoos blur or fade or disintegrate with time? Are there any tattooing misconceptions that you would like to clear up?  	1
 Does anyone know the font that used?   Actually there are some studies about that depression might be hereditary, its source is mesencephalon which is a part of the brain, it has various nuclei about motion, vision etc. Also it has something called Basale Ganglia, their degeneration causes to the Parkinson's, also there are studies indicates that ganglia's some problems which are hereditary, might prepare the foundation of the depression.    	2
 How many girls' bedrooms do you see vs guys? Because thinking about it right now, there's a pretty even number of male vs female people in my life who live in extremely messy environments, and same for people being cleaner.   Honestly, this is not the first time in my life that I have cleaned my entirely too messy room to this point only to let it get out of control again, but I don't have an income. $10 a month is too much, let alone $100 or even an apartment of my own. I hope that I can keep it clean this time. I know it's early to assume that this is how things are going to be, but just getting my room this clean is a huge success. It'll be an even bigger one if it still looks like this in a month.   I've been diagnosed to hell and back with a hundred different things. Only recently have I found a diagnosis and treatment that is actually helping. Depression has been a major one for a long time, but briefly my doctor thought maybe I was bipolar. Last year, I was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder and have been getting treatment for that, and there's such a difference. I've found meds that work, and therapy that works, and I hope this is the start of the rest of my life.   When a guy lives like a pig, it's "why do you live like a pig?"  When a girl lives like a pig, it's "why do girls live like pigs?"   Good luck!!!!   I get it. I lived in that mess for two or more years. I was too embarrassed to have people in my room, let alone ask them to help me clean it. I just couldn't take it anymore.  If it's too much to ask for help, at least at the point it's at right now, try and clean some of it on your own. Maybe not all in one day, or even two. Just clean one small area and keep that neat, then move on to the next.   I could not have done it without the help of my friend. Every time I tried on my own, I would just stare at the mess and get so overwhelmed. I didn't know where to start.  The best advice I can give is to start where you are going to be the most often. I started with my desk, then my bed, and then I just worked my way around my room until finally it was all done. Also, do it in short bursts instead of all at once. We started by doing 20 minutes of cleaning, 10 minutes of break, and by the end, I was able to work for longer and longer. Adjust the amount of time to something you're comfortable with (as long as it's not 5 minutes of cleaning, then break forever) and just remember that having a clean space will make you feel better and is something you can control in your life!   I've heard it before in the multitudes of therapies I've been in, but it's worth repeating because it is very true. I am in a better mood when the area I'm in is organized.   Thank you. And believe me, there have been pizza boxes and all kinds of gross food things in here. I hope you can find the motivation to clean, too. It helps a lot, having a clean space, even if it's just a clean space to mope in.   One of the reasons I got rid of the carpet for the wood floors. So much easier to clean, but damn if dust doesn't build up if you don't keep after it (which obviously, I didn't).   I was wondering what part gave it away. Thanks!  (also hell yeah delicious food)   I'm not falling for this twice.   Are you talking about the ancient TV? Hahaha.  I play N64 games on it because it looks better on that than it does on the huge flatscreen out in the living room.   We clearly aren't talking about the same Daniel.   Depression has a way of ruining everything in your life. It's not just being sad, it's being apathetic and unmotivated. I have very little energy for basic day-to-day activities and this took a lot out of me.   lmao  you know what's really funny??  that's actually something daniel would do   I can't stand having a bare room. I love all the stuff I have in my room! The problem is when I start keeping stuff I don't actually love and just can't throw out.   holy shit! yeah hey!! it's been a while, damn. i can't believe you remember what my room looks like.   my room is clean. who is this though??   Will do! :)   This actually really, really does work. I would watch that show, even just commercials of that show, and think, "That's going to be me one day."  Then I decided, no, that is NOT going to be me one day.   WHAT THE HELL   It took a lot of effort and honestly, a few times, I just wanted to sit down and quit. I was just so tired of living like that, it sucks. I've lived in that mess for far, far too long. I just had to remember how much better I'd feel when it was finally clean, and how much easier it is to upkeep a clean room than it is to clean a room that is this disastrous. It didn't hurt that I had a friend urging me along to keep going and helping me out.  If I can do it, I bet you can do it too!! Just take it one corner at a time!   I haven't had time to screw it up again, check back in a week.   i got that poster when only the first movie was out okay!! honestly the first one is still enjoyable if you ignore the next however many that came out :P  and thank you!!!   hell yeah!!!!   Thanks! :)   It didn't have doors before, and I can't afford to buy some... then I realized a shower curtain was perfect :) I really like it! I happened to have everything except the curtain rings, which cost $1.    Apparently it duplicated some images while uploading. Sorry about that! Don't know what happened.  This took two days and a good friend's help, and I'm so relieved to have space to walk around. And a place to sleep I don't have to be ashamed of!      When I was about 14 or 15, I downloaded a song from Kazaa and now I can find no trace of it even existing. I googled the lyrics, nothing useful came up. Everything else I remember is in the title.         Basically, I moved out of an apartment back home and somewhere along the way, my favorite set of dice got lost.  Recently though, my car was broken into... I was really upset, they actually stole a pewter DD figurine that I was going to paint and a pair of sunglasses (that was it though... so weird), but when I was going through the car cleaning out the broken glass, I found my old dice and I was so excited I started taking pictures.  So something good came out of something bad :)  	34
 Will do! I have been limited to my phone for Internet access, I'll upload it to cuberutor as soon as I can!   People. People are shit.   I once told an adopted kid at least my parents loved me enough to keep me...   My father threw my sister out of the house for burning a pizza. She was 21 at the time, just graduated, and was looking for a job. She was forced to move in with our older sister.  	4
 It all depends on the day for me, some days i think they show that i am strong and how brave i am for living my life with them. other days i just find them repulsive.   drink.   Thank you! It's not really appreciated where I go to school, where uggs and northfaces prevail over everything    Thank you very much!  I'm flattered :D   No problem :)   you fool, just your style and your body type makes me smile. not to be creepy or anything, i just think youre attractive   When i'm feeling punk rock: http://imgur.com/KE2FuXnsolbBoW34AGDoL#1  When i'm feeling indie  http://imgur.com/KE2FuXnsolbBoW34AGDoL#2  A night out:  http://imgur.com/KE2FuXnsolbBoW34AGDoL#0   youre beautiful O___o   that's just terrible, kids are so mean. I wish more people understood what cutting means and how its just as bad as someone with a broken arm. you should care that theyre injured. not taunt them   i am on fluxotine as well! i only take 10mgs a day, and it has little to no effect on me   I am on non addictive medications which I believe is the best for young adults. So many kids are abusing pills that it isn't safe. Of course many non addictive medications aren't as strong as their addictive relatives, which sometimes poses a problem   That's a good point. We are becoming more self aware of mental illnesses. I've also noticed it becoming a "trend" in young teens. Could anyone attest to the same?    I love that show! I'm doing that this summer along with The Little Mermaid and Young Frankenstien   I'm so sorry, adults sometimes don't react like they should    i guess i have a lot of questions; let me start out with how you feel about young adults being put on anti-depressants, and how social media affects young adults with mental disorders. you can PM me if you wish   Sorry! i guess i misinterpreted what you said! i just dont like upseting people :)   i wish they would have just ignored mine? what show were you in?   can you tell me your opinion how why it is more common for young adults in america to have mental illnesses than it was in the past?   Thank you so much!   I'm so sorry :/   the look of disappointment hurts me the most   No problem :)   That's fair enough, judging based on the story should be the best fit    you dont sound mean at all! i've been doing plenty of research and was just wondering if anyone is this sub would like to be apart of it.    As my title said, I have a paper for class that i have chosen to do my paper on. I want to understand why depression and other mental disorders are showing up more and more recently in high school/ college students. Any help would be greatly appreciated.    you really should. They work for YOU and only YOU. if you tell them that you want to keep it confidential and are open and willing to talk about it with her/him than he/she must not tell anyone by law. I've tried keeping things from  my therapist but i found its much better for both of us if i just tell her   sorry, no need to be sassy. i just didnt want to mess it up :(   im so sorry your mother has reacted this way, do you have a therapist? my mother was crazy until i had someone talk to her and explain the right and wrong ways for her to act around me   exactly. its ridiculous that she enjoys hurting your feelings. I'm glad you have people in your family who support your feelings    why? i'm 14 years old, was diagnosed with depression at age 11. My family has a long line of depression running through the family, I've witnessed my cousins suicide, ive attempted suicide, i'm on medication and making final adjustments on those meds, and im a recovering self-harmer. why couldnt you take me seriously just because of my age?   hold on to him, try to find other sources of help (i.e therapist, friends, realatives) because nothing lasts forever. (not trying to be morbid, i just want to help you)    aha, even though i've been a redditor for over a year now, i'm still lacking a lot of knowledge of how things work. I'cm not exactly sure how to approach it/ where to contact them/ etc.   Should we suggest to the mods that we get some?   :D thank you, it means a lot   I have another story i'd like to share, when i was in 8th grade i had fallen asleep in English class while we were watching a movie. A few boys who sat near me thought it would be really funny if they took red pen/marker and drew lines all over my wrists and legs. I woke up to bouts of laughter from the people around me and as i looked down i saw crimson lines everywhere, I ran out of the room and went to the bathroom, once i realized they were just marker i began to wash them off. By this time one of the councilors had heard of what happened and came in to help me wash off. As we were cleaning she said "i cant seem to get this one off!" i turns out she was trying to rub off one of my actual cuts and i had to explain to her that i self harmed. I didnt get into any trouble, but it was truly the most embarrassing time of my life    any time, i'm here for anybody and everybody   exactly. your beliefs are yours and no one should dictate you on what you think.    tangents are fine! Its rough when people assume i try to "kill myself" or "cut" for attention because i'm the exact opposite. I'm in theater so when we are changing of course you're going to see some old scars. That's not me trying to cry for attention, that's me trying to live with the mistakes i've inflicted onto my body. I've been ridiculed countless times about my view on how i live with old scars. I see them as something i cant change and i refuse to be worried about them. They are there and if you see them its nothing you should need to worry about.   i went off on a tangent as well, oops!   i've been in therapy for a year or so, and we're slowly figuring out what it is, this helps when i have to explain it to people   I'm so sorry that happened to you. From what i've read i feel that your boyfriend cares a lot about you, I'm glad you have that in your life. He could help you immensely.    I've read it so many times! I think its absolutely fantastic   that's absolutely terrible. Try to remember that she isnt the only opinion in the world, she could say the worst things, but i promise there is someone out there who is saying that exact opposite of you :D   Understandable, tons of people go through this. I am an open atheist in my house but my parents aren't very religious. Just remember you are in control of YOU and no one can dictate what you believe in   that could work, i dont know how to use flair, but if someone could explain it i'd be happy to do it!   thank you so much, it was a dark time in my life, but i've grown from it   that has to suck. I get really angry when people try to tell me praying or god is the answer. I usually yell back!   thats terrible, i cant believe someone would do that as a joke! And thank you, i'm a lot better now, it was almost a year ago, i'm attempting to recover   im so sorry that happened to you,   she shouldnt act like that. How does she think that will help you? public humiliation isnt the way to go  	49

If it's pre-donation and usage of the donation, they will be put on our permanent deferral registry and wouldn't be able to donate anywhere in the country. Huge red mark.

HIV and prion diseases are totally different beasts.    I worked as a phelbotemist at a blood center for awhile, basically every potential donor has a long questionnaire that includes questions about potential sexual lifestyle hazards. If you are a male, have you ever had sexual contact with another male? Medical supervisors review questionnaires and anyone deemed a risk is permanently banned from donating. It basically relies on honesty because I've seen people who are gay donate (I don't know if they're sexually active or virgins or what).    Why only white lesbians?

EEEEEEEEEH YOOOOOOOWWW!   I totally see your point, I think the reason it's often called "feminism" is because while men do have some issues in our society, women have more "catching up" to do in terms of social equality. For example how women weren't always allowed to vote etc.   It's often named in terms of the group that needs uplifting.

 I did not mean to make you feel worse and I'm sorry that I did. Because I suffer from depression (low self-esteem/lack of self worth/self-flagellation), I try to help anyone that I come across who is more vulnerable than I'm at that point in time. This is such an effort. I wish I could be there to hug you,  honestly do.   I have been through similar painful situations and there has been someone or the other who has helped me. Talk to someone who is close (physically, emotionally, or both) to you. Sometimes you don't even need reciprocation - you just need to be listened to.   Finally, I know this wouldn't make sense to you, as it wouldn't to me if someone else where saying this when I'm feeling like this - this one too shall pass.       A roller-coaster in which I always seem to be lost in the past or in the future, never living the moment.   Tigers. They are the most beautiful animal/thing on our planet.   I just shared my experience. I think that you should not expect people to change just because you want them to.   The ratings are really good. And the guys behind the fantastic podcast "The Skeptics Guide to the Universe" also think so.   Does anybody think that there is a movie deal behind this?      I don't quite understand. I have seen the USA flag used in costumes, hats, sporting apparel, etc. There must be more serious rules. On the other hand, in India, if you are using the flag for anything other than what it is, it is dangerous.   I don't see the codependence part in your post. I am in a codependent relationship for the last two years and at many times I have felt that I should really get out of it. I guess it is my fear that I won't find anyone else that keeps me going back.   When I try and imagine what it would be like to be my parents or my friends, I flinch at the thought of how disappointed they must be with me. :/   This approach is what I'm gravitating toward, I think.  	12

I can barely sum up any interest or energy in most of the things I do, but learning about language and how it's formed by, and helps shape, sound patterns/morphological processes/syntax etc. is the only thing that really reminds me of the fact that I can still feel excited about something, even though my attention is sporadic at best.   Language!   Hey, guys.  I have almost non-existent social skills when it comes to meeting new people and one of the largest barriers I frequently come across is that I can never initiate conversation with anyone. I've been at uni for almost two semesters now and I have still yet to develop a proper social life;I have only really been able to talk to one other person out of all my classes at uni.  I barely see the friends I do have, and I can almost go whole weeks without speaking to anyone but my aunty. So I was wondering if any of you guys know how I can overcome my fear of talking to strangers?  Thanks heaps.   I found out that there is a group of non-pulmonic sounds in human language called ejectives which are pretty much sounds formed with little explosions of air afterwards; try saying 'p' but really forcing it out. I reckon that the fact that some language somewhere uses these as a  part of their everyday communication really awesome.^^^^ihavenolife   I dip my dick into a vat of soup to check if it's warm and 94 cats claw it off.   What was this man's name? Christ, everyone has a name.  Where had he lived? On a farm as I had? Did he too cherish memories of wide,clear sky reflected in small diaphanous ponds and welcome the calm blanketing of darkness on his fields after sunset had burnt itself into his retinas at the end of each day?  Had he also shared a million small moments with his lover, knowing things that only they had experienced? Had he held his lover's hand as she died of sickness as I had? Had he too broken the hope of his children when he'd explained where she'd gone?   Is this why he was here?  Is this why he fought? For the same reasons as I do? Was he a broken man seeking solace in the face of this indifferent beast of war?  Did he dream of the feint chatter of wind-chimes before an angry,unforgiving horizon? Is that what kept him restful during the cold nights and their symphony of artillery barrages, when the only light to be found was in hellish flashes against a choked,pitiful landscape?  Had he also seen men wail before the arms of death as they clutched their organs as offerings? Did he fear silence as I do? Had he heard the breathless rattles of men seeking comfort from the impatient embrace of non-existence as they bled their life and memories onto the mud?  My chest tightened as I watched him splutter.   If I was still the same man as I had been I would have left him to be found by his comrades. He would have lived.  But his eyes were too familiar, they begged with a pathetic fear akin to my own. What right  do I have to decide the fate of another wretched creature such as myself? What grand scheme directed these dire circumstances between us?  I felt my empathy curdle and lose its hold on my thoughts.   Because he was not like me.  And so I shot him.    My book.   I have a fucking language to invent, multiple cultures to write about and an entire bloody world history to create not to mention actually writing the novel, and here I am on Reddit writing about these things and not doing them.   Yeah,that's probably it.   As I was getting towards the end of school I was getting more and more worried about missing out on the 'normal teenage-life milestones' that and so I probably figured "Hey, that girl was friendly to me earlier, I should have a crush on her. Maybe then I'll achieve what's expected to have been done by my age and become normal."  Pined over her for sometime but never really talked to her or did anything, and now I'm still holding myself to the fact that I missed my only chance to actually overcome my fear of women and be accepted into the wider 'class' of those who can establish intimate relationships with the opposite sex which in turn exacerbates my awkwardness and fear which in keeps me from allowing myself to even consider dating properly.   I'm now pretty much proper fucked when it comes to women and socialising in general. It's funny how one simple decision can fuck you over in the longer run,eh?   To be honest, I don't really know. Kind of a fear of being put on the spot mixed with general beta faggotry.   Refusing an offer to be kissed by a girl in high school whom I later developed a crush for but didn't have the balls to ask out.   Two years later and I still haven't kissed anyone. Fuck.   Just let the poor cunt know that he's not getting anywhere  and to stop messaging. It's clear that he's oblivious, so just do him a kindness and tell him to go elsewhere. Many guys that are perceived as creepy are that way because they haven't properly learnt how to identify when they're over-stepping these kinds of social barriers,and so continue to press.   Your grandfather seemed like a profound kinda guy. Thanks, I'll definitely be considering this metaphor the next time I feel shitty.   I also feel the same. The only time I'm ever talked to my friends about how I feel is when I've been very drunk, and I felt I alienated myself from them even more so by doing that.  I also have made a plan to kill myself, but I keep putting it off for arbitrary reasons. For instance, I was planning on doing it next week sometime a couple of days ago, but now I've ordered Rome 2 so I've decided I'll wait for that to come and the off myself.  I really do hope you find someone who's willing to talk to you.   I'm glad it made sense to someone. I agree with you on the stigma towards depressed people in our society, especially towards men. It's almost as if we're told as men that emotion is something you hold within yourself or express to, in limited circumstances, only your loved ones, and if you hold too much emotion, you're overreacting and being a woman.   Combining this perspective with my sleight build and short height makes me feel almost feminine in the eyes of other men, and this weighs down heavily on me.  Thanks for your words and welcome to the sub!    Yeah, it's fucking shit. And you're making perfect sense, this is exactly what I think. I have no idea whether it is actual depression being tricky with me, or whether I'm 'forcing' my self to feel what I assume would be how a depressed person feels.   I think seeing a therapist will, in the long run, help both of us realise where to attribute these emotions to, whether it be legitimate depression or otherwise. I'm going to recommend you see a therapist, not because I think that that mine will necessarily help me, but because I believe everyone should be entitled to a chance to change their lives. Whilst my chance may have well abandoned me, I'd like to think that yours hasn't.  Keep on keeping on.   Thanks for the reply; the community here is awesome.   I have a hard time conveying emotion to people, even my family. I always feel that it isn't my place to burden them with my emotional problems as they've already got their own.   I find myself thinking like this with my counselor,too. I think about how many people's sob stories he has to sit through and how that must weigh down on his patience.   For some reason I have this notion that men are not supposed to give into their emotions and seek help, and therefore I mustn't be a man and mustn't have a valid reason for this pain. Your response has offered me a different perspective to what I'm used to, thanks. I don't often open up to people (only when I'm considerably drunk) so the outpouring of good advice and care in this thread has confounded me.   Holy shit. This is almost akin to how my emotions are at the moment. I can go from feeling incredibly bitter one day to mildly depressed another to pretty much empty some other days. I am never fully incapacitated, but I'm always slightly off-centre enough that it impairs me socially. I also feel the same overarching desolation, it really sucks.  I really hope you beat it,man. At least one of us has to.   When I was younger my mum was really sick. In an effort to cheer her up,my little brother consolled her with these wise word as he was sitting by her bed:  "An old frog jumps into a pond. Splash."  To this day she still thinks that it was incredibly profound.   Don't really know where all the paperwork is due to the fact that I've moved house twice since then, so I have no idea whether it'd still be under warranty. I also don't know what the real problem behind the card is, all I know is that my PC highlighted that there was a problem with the graphics driver in the event centre, and also my event log shows multiple Kernel Power event-41 issues.   Sweet, thanks. Another question (sorry), should I upgrade my CPU as well? It's an i5-5700k, I think. Edit:2500K, not 5700K   Cool,760's seem to be pretty cheap atm. Also, does a GPU having more memory necessarily make it better than one with less? Is that a stupid question to ask?   Hey, guys. So I've had my GTX 560Ti for about a year now, and I've been noticing some problems.  My computer will crash randomly whilst playing some games, and when I check my event log, it tells me that these crashes are due to a Kernel-Power Event.  On further investigation it appeared that my GPU was the cause behind these crashes,so I've decided that if they continue, I'll probably have to replace my GPU. Question is, which GPU should I buy if I choose to do so? (keeping in mind I'd prefer to upgrade in performance as well). Or should I spend money on getting my GPU fixed instead?   Indifference.  I believe that one of the greatest achievements in human evolution is our development of empathy. To know that so many people in the world do what they do without any consideration of the experiences of others and how their decisions may affect others, without even the tiniest shred of empathy, really unnerves me.  And to think that (at least Western) societies could become even more apathetic to the lives of even those who are closest to them, is especially worrying. I mean indifference isn't some modern construct endemic to modern society, but I believe it could become almost a virtue of our age. It's the universe's position to be indifferent to our plight, not humanity's.   What is the deepweb? I've heard some talk about it, but I don't know whether it's a joke or not.   Because it would imply that they were some sort of whiny bitch, and in the eyes of most men discussing personal strife is seen as weakness. I mean,shit, look at the some shitstorm female cutters get, could you imagine if a male revealed that he was slashing up? It's fucked, and part of the reason why I don't cut despite the fact I am in a fair amount of emotional strain. *edit: I spek gud england   The world of my novel. I could go on for ages talking about the various nuances of Othenai culture, and the formation of various political organisations. No one ever really listens,though. ;-;   Yeah, I have skype. Pretty sure the name's the same as my Steam:Chezzprinn   I will, as long as I am comforted by the knowledge that you, the finest specimen come to be produced by humanity's long and arduous evolutionary journey, will carry forward our race into neo-liberal paradise!   2edgy4me. Please take your edginess elsewhere, you're too hardcore for this thread.   Ain't no stopping it now,mate.   I have a feeling the Chinese are the villains in Battlefield 4. Correct me if I'm wrong.   I have to say I still haven't gotten over it. Hell, I wasn't even bullied that much but it has had an enormous effect on my life.   I can't do anything without hearing the voices of people who had mocked me. I alter my own actions and social responses by what I assume they would think appropriate for me to do. I think of myself as lesser, as a creep, as something that doesn't fit in. It has driven me to contemplating suicide almost daily and has drained meaning from my life. I've become a needy,nervous bitch of a man; exactly how they had presumed I'd turn out.   I haven't talked about this before, sorry if it comes across a little dramatic.   For Emma,Forever Ago-Bon Iver. Especially the song "The Wolves", gets me every time.  	50
 I don't know,I wish I could experience true love once in my life,that's basically all I dream of :(   He knows about my feelings,maybe not the full extent of them but he decided to talk to me less and less after going like "thought i loved you but turns out that i don't" so,yeah. I wrote a 10 pages or something letter to him,not ever sending it even if i wish he would read it,haha.  edit : idk if it was clear but I was talking 'bout a guy I actually know and stuff,not the one I play pretend in my head with. It's too sad to do it with the one I really love I guess so I picked another target for it.   forever waiting for people including the love of my life ( unrequited love again ) to send me a message or something on whatever social networks I have,going from pages to pages on wikipedia,pretty boring stuff really !  yeah,it keeps me going somehow,going uphappy but not dead atm haha   I legit think my only talent is spending 6+ hours online everyday and it also works as a hobby tbh ! I've also been doing hair and make-up on me and as a small source of income for a few years.  	4
 Thank you so much!!    It does help, thank you very much!   I have never thought of that - I'm already on reading books on makeup and color theory and following real working professionals online but never thought of practicing on friends/family.  When you said get a job at a store/counter - let's just say Macy's... I can get a job there without a certificate or license?   I was also looking at that too - I wanted to be sure that it is the real deal as well.   I'm looking for an online school that I can afford to enroll in and receive a certificate/license.  I was wondering if there is one... if so, what would you recommend??   Amazing colors!!    Gorgeous! Love the color!      Correct me if I'm wrong...  Please tell me if I'm being vague. I will try my best to clarify. I saw the sidebar and NYX was fallen under drugstore HG Master List.  I know they sell it in CVS, Walgreens, Ulta Beauty, etc. but I feel most of their products are excellent in quality and it is affordable. Do you think it could count as mid-range? Why or why not?   I would just keep checking back. I usually order at NYX online and believe me, I know the feeling when there's a specific item out of stock and the frustration kicks in.  I also follow them on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It just is easier for me to keep track with them. Hope this helps.  	10

Anyway, I think she's doing good, LB got the nerfhammer and Kassadin the permaban, so along with Fizz I think she's top tier AP assassin atm, especially since she got a buff last patch.    Is it even a yordle? He seems pretty big for one, doesn't he...  Also, the monster-thingy that's attacking the village, is it just me or does he look a lot like Vel'Koz?   on the left there is the summoner that you get earlier. since you get flash last, flash goes on f.

 What would be the point? He's a politician. Shit he says doesn't matter.  Might as well be a dirty joke.  But, if I could get him to say something and mean it, it would be along these lines:  "Fuck you, Netanyahu, we are taking back our foreign aid and leveling your country... and Kim Jong, your'e next you fat piece of shit."   I've had lightning strike about 40' from me and don't remember feeling heat but it rattled me hard enough to knock me off balance and made my ears ring for a while. You must have been like 20 feet away! Go buy a lottery ticket!   Someone has to pick up the convo and turn it into some kind of pissing match. Might as well be you, eh?   has anyone else noticed that ____ owners in particular drive like assholes?  I've noticed that people driving expensive vehicles in general act more entitled to the road than the rest of us poor bastards. On the other hand, it's pretty obvious when one of us poor bastards quits giving a fuck and will just slam into your nice ride for the hell of it. It's not like our rust bucket is going to lose any value.   _____ drivers appear to drive as well as you'd expect from someone who would be proud to overpay for a _____.  Give me a fucking break man. Do people really think like this or are you two fuckwits just bullshitting with each other to pass the time?   Edit: After reading some of the comments telling me I shouldn't be concerned, that it's "none of my business", and that this post is "creepy", I have to wonder what the hell has happened to our society. Ever seen a news special on a kid who fell down a well, or who was kidnapped? Were you concerned? How is my daughter's and my concern for this victim any different? I grew up in this town and remember it as a close and caring community, but it was no different than anywhere else in America at that time (the 1970's). We cared about each other and were unafraid to check on our neighbors. I'm addressing the critics here, what the fuck is wrong with you?  This sub is notorious for being snobbish, and represents modern day Austin adequately in that regard - full of it's own first world problems and devoid of empathy for anything but a trendy tragedy.  It *is* sickening. The things that have made Austin unique have been disappearing at the same rate at which overpriced condos downtown are being occupied. This is an eventuality, an inevitable and inescapable result of the overpopulation by the human race which diseases our planet. As downtown grows and the sprawl expands into the countryside, we'll witness the last of traditional values leave this city in search of a return to normalcy.  Personally, I moved back to Austin to re-live some of the times I had with my father as a child, back when Ben White was a four lane road, if that. Now it's 100 feet in the air and 10 lanes wide, and the roar of that traffic can literally be heard for miles. I'm here to build better systems for both the public and private sector, and feel that I contribute to what progress is being made in a big way. One day I will no longer be able to handle the side effects of this progress and I too will pack up and leave in search of a plot of land to call my own, far from the crime and noise and hypocrisy plaguing any city.   So where was this picture taken?   This has almost nothing to do with your uterus or abortion or religion. To split the issue up by listening to that rhetoric is counter productive, but it does serve to point out their methods, which is a good thing to observe.  Instead, it might benefit you to look at it this way:  Hard line republicans want more babies out there so they can force more religion down more people's throats so they can have more slaves to pay taxes and more overpriced junk from their corporate cronies.  So they can have more money.  It's that easy. The more informed people are of the larger agenda, the less likely these assholes are to succeed. That they have been abusing religion, perpetuating mythology to benefit themselves and only themselves, is painfully obvious these days. Instant global communication for the masses has brought this into the light and then some.  Simply put, these people have nothing to offer the human race in terms of progress which makes them nothing more than parasites. Playing in to their hand by raising hell over individual issues completely distracts from the unity needed to get rid of these people outright by nailing them to their own crosses with the letter of the laws that this country was founded on.   vee vee might be an asshole sometimes but those comments are usually articulate and well thought out. yours was basically a vitriolic and ignorant shart of a thought aimed at a political party for nothing but their political affiliation.  you asked.   Most parking lot attendants look homeless as it is.   They should use that technology to power Austin with all the bullshit pouring out of the capitol building.   Gainfully employed is an antiquated term used to describe living above poverty, and you know it - just as the word "theory" is used in such rhetoric to ascribe doubt to an established truth.  The fact that you like my screen name says a lot about you as well. It was coined in response to a shill pretending that our water supply should be privatized by foreign interests.  Religious foreign interests at that. Good ol' capitalism at work for you right there.   Keep teaching your kids and grand kids stupid shit. That's what will get you in the end. It will have nothing to do with euthanasia.   The only thing we don't know for certain is what drives evolution this far.  That's what the *theory* in your sentence is about.  Aside from the altruism I should display, if I were to meet you I'd probably strangle you. Then, you'd have no kids.  Theorize about that.   Take a walk off the beaten path between your XBox and the nearest GameStop, and you'll find that the world is quite different IRL.   The article is definitely light on details. It's not like they are going to go around releasing information about the dead guy that might imply innocence.  I'm sure if there is anything that can be dug up on the victim it will surface once the "investigation" is complete.   then this story title is only useful for propagating hatred of police.  That depends on your perspective, doesn't it? Some people will read that title and automatically believe the guy got shot for a good reason, while the rest of the waking populace that has ever had an interaction with a fucked up cop is entitled to their opinion as well.  Personally, I don't need a sensationalized title to make me feel any less safe around cops. The experiences I've had with the police have taught me all I need to know about them.   First of all, you are Reddit, too.  Second, this is a major source of consternation because cops get special treatment and we probably won't hear much more about it other than the sound of a rubber stamp of approval.  Third, if this were just some guy with a CCW, he'd be dragged through the national media and defunct legal system like Zimmerman.   One can always hope. Unfortunately it is never in the interest of the PD to convict one of their own. It's always better for them to cover things up, make the cop look like a hero, and downplay the whole incident.  I will be truly surprised if we hear anything to the contrary.   And people are pissed about a donut ad.   Definitely relieved. I had a wierd mixture of excitement that I might get to see more Calvin and Hobbes, and then a sinking feeling that Macaulay Culkin was going to have a starring role.   Wish I could just blow away anyone who I "felt threatened" by.  Wait, no I don't, because I'm not a psychopath. I tend to work out differences with others through rational discussion and informed debate.  I'm reminded of a story about a fast food place being held up by robbers. The robbers had knives and one of the employees had a pistol and a CCW license.  The employee overheard the robbery from back in the kitchen and debated on pulling out his gun. He sat for a minute and listened, and the robbers were gone with a few bucks and otherwise without incident.  He could have ended those people's lives right there in front of everyone, but he assessed the situation and reacted in a logical manner.  Just because you may have the legal right to shoot someone dead does not constitute a good reason to do so, and just because you "feel threatened" does not mean you are in any danger or automatically grant you that right.  ---  The cop says he felt threatened so he shot someone. That's probably all the "facts" we'll ever get.   That whole "procedure" where mentally ill people are all thrown by a judge, not a medical doctor, into tiny rooms together to torture each other instead of being treated.    I can't say why we interpret more clashy chords as sad or spooky; that may just be society. My theory is that they set you on edge just a little bit more.  I wonder what the evolutionary purpose, if any, would be for this? I wonder if there are any subconcious cues in "clashy" sounds that relate danger to us. Like the sound of a gorge, the doppler effect sound of water rushing down the side of a waterfall. Wouldn't that sound look something like a trainwreck on an oscilloscope compared with one of these pretty sounding major chords?  If there is a lion killing a pig in the jungle half a mile away, it's probably not going to sound like a lion killing a pig if you can hear it. It's probably going to sound distorted. The more distorted and dischordant a sound in the jungle, the more my curiosity would be piqued, if for nothing else to rule out danger. That is to say, if it's far away and bouncing off of trees and rocks for hundreds of yards, I think those waves are going to overlap to create a cacaphony.   By contrast, closer sounds are easier to make out, and I think the amount of processing necessary to identify the sound as a threat or not is going to be proportional to how recognizeable that sound is.  I think our love for music stems from a survival instinct common to any organism with a nervous system capable of responding to vibration.   Just what that part of town needs. Another 2,000+ people on the road. Good luck with that traffic problem and all that. I think these building owners should be paying to alleviate that problem. We all know a 900 sq. ft. flat up there is going to cost $2000 a month. That building will rake in 5 million dollars a month forever, and hardly any of it will go to easing the congestion they cause.  I am all for development, but it just bothers me to see things like this with no real plan for the consequences.  I love living in the sticks and I hate driving to town. I wish my truck had missle launchers on it, or at least a PA system.  Austin is all grown up now, but the kid inside me will never lose his appreciation for quiet, starry nights. This place is going to look like Los Angeles in 15 years and there is no stopping it.  So sad.   Boycott petty entertainment. Problem solved.   Once you start working on cars you'll also base your buying decisions on how easily acessible engine parts are. For examle, had I known I was going to be replacing an AC in and F150, I wouldn't have bought the #$^@#$% thing.   What a deluded mind. I don't doubt that SWAT faces some pretty serious assholes on a fairly frequent basis, but to compare the local meth gang to the Taliban is nothing but a blatant attempt to garner support for creating para-military patrols in our streets.  I'm all for nabbing bad guys and locking them away, but lets be adults about this. No-knock warrants resulting in one death is one death too many. Now this shit happens how often? We hear about the police tazing/beating/neglecting/choking/shooting/running over some innocent person to death on a daily basis in this country. People's gardens being destroyed by what amounts to a gang of gun nuts with a grudge who are no better than the worst of criminals.   Police brutality is at an all time high. Or is it?  Wake me up when these sonsabitches are all wearing cameras.   Not to mention midnight raids of hospitals and firebombing of schools, and all that acid getting thrown in everyone's faces.   Texas Brine really screwed the pooch on this one. I wonder how big this thing will actually get. Wouldn't it be worth it to send dynamite down in there in order to have it collapse all at once instead of sucking up a house at a time or whatever?   Yahoo has always struck me as some whiny parasite that feeds off of other websites in some convoluted and misguided way that screams for attention. It's like an overbearing, nerdy cousin constantly injecting their uninformed opinion into the conversation.  Yahoo is largely irrelevant in my life and the only time I use their site is to search for things that Google can't find, and 99.9% of the time they can't find it either.  The only time Yahoo matters in my life is when they excrete 1000's of tech jobs they couldn't support and all the sudden the market is flooded again with everything from java developers and dbas to project managers and help desk techs.      *No gators were harmed in the making of this film.  **Unfortunately the nearby towns have been evacuated.  ***Because Texas Brine.   I generally avoid goading condescending trolls into presenting such specious rhetoric but sometimes find it necessary in order to expose the contempt such utterly worthless narcissism has for humanity.  More and more descriptive labels are being put on our food and there is nothing any PR can do to stop it. Move on to some other critical aspect of survival to exploit before people see you for what you really are and you have to answer for your despicable manipulation of the ignorant and disadvantaged.   Why are you trying to bait me into some stupid GMO argument?  All I want is better labeling. Maybe you could take a look at my other comments in this thread before trying to put words in my mouth.   The labeling will reveal only what is required by law, obviously. Organic vs GMO, is a false dichotomy, a construct of industry and profit. If this can of tuna came from fish caught off the shore of the Daiichi power plant, or this avocado has been treated with 100% organic cyanide, or this steak was grown in a tube in the labs at Dow Chemical, I am going to want to know at least enough to where I can do an amount of research to adequately determine the probability of safety, or at least err on the side of caution.  Any new law should go that direction rather than make some political point.    Sadly most people dont give a fuck, and since I do then I have to assume I am being treated like someone who doesnt care and remain cautious.   We have the right to know what is in our food and where it came from.  This is one of the most frustrating non-arguments out there. This should be inalienable. My concern is not with some random food producers profits. My concern is for the safety of my family. Any eftort to undermine my decision making abilites with regard to food safety  constitutes a bodily threat and will always be viewed as such.   The downvotes are a sad indicator. What you are saying is what I failed to verbalize to begin with. Thank you.   What a stupid thing to say. Someone died here. Grow up.   Fried cod is what I'm craving. I haven't been in years, but The Fox and the Hound if Ft. Worth and Houston had fried cod fillets the size of your forearm. For $11.99 I was able to get three of those monsters put on my plate because I was such a regular and good tipper at the one in Houston. Love that place.   I've never enjoyed the tiny fish they serve there. I'd be surprised if any of them were over a pound live.   Assuming you are still in Seattle, and thus homesick, here is why I love Texas:  You can drive for hours out on the back roads of west Texas without passing a soul.  You can drive 80-85 MPH on I-10 from Houston to El Paso and probably not get pulled over.  You can go deap sea fishing in the Gulf or you can catch monster cats in Livingston or Amistad.  You can tube the cool spring fed Comal and Frio rivers when its hot.  You can pack up and head to Lubbock or Amarillo to catch a snowy weekend when its cold.  Beach, beach, beach.. Port Aransas is where I want to retire.  More BBQ joints per capita than anywhere in the world. I just made that up but it's probably almost true.  Live music all over the damned place, all the time. Booming industries, great paying IT jobs.  Enough TexMex joints in a given city for you to eat well, eat different, and eat cheap 7 days a week.   I started out laughing at this like an insane child and then just ended up sobbing. I'm going back to sleep.   Since radioactive water is leaking into the pacific and groundwater is contaminated in the area, can someone tell me exactly how this could get any worse?   1. If knives were more dangerous than guns then law enforcement would carry knives instead of guns.  2. If you are in public you have no expectation of privacy, hence the term, "public".   Glad you are presenting arguments.  1. More evidence is good evidence. For example: cops routinely confiscate phones and cameras and delete evidence. I can't imagine that's because the video would portray anything but the truth, or help determine the truth.  2. We already live in an Orwellian surveillance society. The FBI and NSA spy on innocent people and have been for years. There are literally cameras at every street corner.   This is a) why people shouldn't feed deer, and b) why people shouldn't feed deer.  I live in Austin and deer are all over the place. They are in people's yards where kids are playing, and parents think it's cute.  Deer are well known to harbor disease and parasites that can infect humans. Many wild animals do. So do house pets, but ringworm and that gondii parasite are treatable to varying degrees. Lyme disease is not well understood, and if you know anyone that thinks they have it or has been diagnosed with it, you'd stay away from the wildlife too.   I get it. Take the fucking deer.  Confiscate cell phones and delete shit from them? WRONG.   Thank you for the insight. Until today I did not know that the private sector was involved in this. I have to admit that I am a little shocked by that.  I hope that one day our tax dollars go to a functional enough law enforcement agency to allow for responsible and efficient interdiction of unfit parents without private interests even being given the opportunity to place profit ahead the interests of abused children, or innocent parents for that matter.  This type of thing is an isolated incident and is capitalized upon by the anti-CPS crowd to point the finger at a system that I believe largely helps the children in it's care despite the occasional bad press.  I am sure there are some very upset parents out there who are mentally deficient enough to feel that their children were taken from them unjustly despite the rulings of the court. I am also sure that the courts have unjustly ruled against parents, although certainly not nearly as many. Unfortunately there is no simple solution to these problems.  One can only hope that effective oversight will be a priority.   Can you ask him how people with no source of income could possibly wind up as even candidates? I might be missing something, I didn't see where these people were well off, but there has to be some checks there.   TXDoT says it has no money for this project – and lobbying for funds could take decades.  Settles that.   Sorry, but the CPS are backed by "the cops".  CPS needs a wash, that's for sure, but giving control over that organization to an already arguably corrupt and trouble-ridden arm of the law is just asking for more problems than we can predict.  	51
 I have been thinking about communicating thoughts and emotions through feeling with other people, and I realized something. We may never truly communicate and empathize, so long as we depend on 26 letters to hurl our thoughts into open space.   but what was on the back?  	2
 He's Gregory House. He lied about the not being a mD thing. Everybody lies.   Actually kinda helps    Maybe once I'm not using all my will trying not to put a fucking knife in my chest, I'll worry about finishing my PhD or working on that six-pack. Thanks, I hadn't considered the fact that not being my normal awful fucking self might require effort.   Not in the same way, but yes. Hundreds of medium sized cuts on a small area over months left me with the same feeling. Oddly enough, nerve damage makes tattoos in the area hurt more, for whatever reason  A lot of us have been there I wager. While I can't say going to a hospital or clinic is a bad idea, if you won't, an EMT I spoke with about a similar incident told me to at least use butterfly tape to seal it closed. It will heal without it, but may stay open for a few weeks while it does so, and the scar will be wider if not taped.  Take care Knyburg, and hang in there   For doing awfully in school, for not making the most of my opportunities, for being awful and unattractive (and for thinking that while lying in bed instead of working out), for being so angry at myself and so depressing, the list just goes on  I don't know, I've never had anger problems with anyone else. I can be patient for ever with them but me... There's just too much hatred there not to get angry.  	5
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpVUMuLLqug Enjoy some relevant tunes while you're having a read.   boy, does he. reading this paragraph really struck a nerve with me and i read the rest as if he were a self-pitying manchild begging for attention.  I don't want or need attention. Isn't that the point of demanding isolation? I'm more-so sharing my experience with depression.   "Too smart" for the game of counseling. yeah, i thought that too when i was twelve years of age, but then i grew up.  I experience a combination of: derealization, depersonalization, and dissociation. I don't feel like I'm a person anymore and haven't really for quite some time. Interactions with people don't feel "real" to me, almost like I'm watching a movie. Even as I write this, it feels like I'm watching someone else write down their thoughts.. not my own.    As for "too smart for counseling?" I pretty much see it as form of mind-reprogramming/manipulation.   you're really not. in this regard. you think you're uniquely depressed? c'mon  I've never said I was "uniquely depressed," but my mind is a pretty strange one. I've been called delusional many times before for sharing this.. but Ready for it? **I wholeheartedly believe that I have transcended multiple levels of a quantum universe and I have personally seen multiple levels of an inter-dimensional reality.** I don't believe I wake up in the same dimension every day and thus meticulously catalog the location of objects in my mind before I sleep. I have had books  appear in my room on numerous occasions that "shouldn't have been there." I don't read.   And people. I can suck energy out of people.   well, you actually tried killing yourself in the past. the fuck you expect from family? evidently they really DO care about you.  Yeah, once ten years ago. I've explicitly stated numerous times that I'm no harm to myself whatsoever. I have kept my promise for 10 years, if they can't trust me as a man and human being I don't know what to say. **Where's the quality of life is people de-humanize you to the point that you are treated differently for something you did 10 years later?** If the four people I am close to don't even trust me, how is there any quality of life worth living? I know they "care about me," but that doesn't mean they have a right to continually violate the small 10x10 place of privacy I have in this world.  "I assured them that if I were to do anything, I guarantee there'd be no way I'd ever be found." you're a real piece of work. how considerate of you to leave these terrible ideas in your loved ones heads.  After having the first conversation with them about "not having wanted to live for 10 years", I continued going on with my daily life. Not a single thing changed, from my perspective. After being woke up multiple times in the middle of the night and giving no indication I was going to harm myself numerous times after, I began getting poor sleep. When someone wakes you up sometimes multiple times a night over fireworks, it gets to be an extremely hostile environment. I'm 24, not 12. I think it's a fair statement to say "I'm not going to shoot myself with the gun I don't have at 9:30 at night."   Also: in the days after talking to them and stating "I haven't wanted to live for 10 years, but am no harm to myself" they tried to have me involuntarily institutionalized and they have since done so numerous times. Thankfully they can't do shit.   maybe you should take a break from the internet  Have done that, spent May-first week of July off the internet. Sat in a chair outside, did nothing else.   take a look in the mirror (figuratively)  Have done that as well, for 10 years.   get some exercise  Did you miss the part about me walking 17 miles? Exercise doesn't really help. Getting more sun doesn't help.   **In a sick, fucked up way I enjoy the isolation more than I'd enjoy a social life.**    	1
 I am not a lying camera whore.   I didn't put lotion on that part of my body and washed my hands thoroughly straight afterwards   I know right! nobody touched my shoulder that day though!   	3
 Never the right time.   We’ve been friends for four years. Since we first met in Fresher’s week at University, you and I always got on like a house on fire. I don’t want to sound patronising, but you were a little nerdy back then. You were a lot nerdy. I’m pretty certain you were a virgin. Something about you, though, I liked instantly. There was a click.  Over the years, it was pretty widely known that you had a crush on me. All your friends teased you, and shamelessly tried to embarrass you in front of me. It worked- I remember you squirming and looking uncomfortable when they brought up during drinking games how you’d masturbated thinking about me- often. I have to admit- I loved the thought.  Years passed and it was only after the break up of a long relationship that we were both at a friend’s birthday party- it was the end of summer, we were camping by a lake, and the sun had gone down. Everyone was sitting by the campfire by the lake and I was pretty drunk. We’d had an amazing day, hiking up the hills, twenty or so twenty somethings playing in a giant outdoor Jungle Gym- an amazing outdoor BBQ and then finishing up with drinking and having a good time by the lake.   It was dark enough that we couldn’t really see. You were sitting on the damp grass, laughing at my tipsiness. Our skin brushed as you teased me, gradually getting closer until I was on your lap. You’d definitely changed since we first met; taller, broader, and your skin was still tanned from the last rays of summer sunshine. One of the first things I noticed about you was your hazel eyes and sandy blonde hair.   As you pulled me on to your lap, both of us dizzy from alcohol and carefree, I could feel your hardness through your jeans and pressed against my thigh. I wrapped my arms around your neck and we kissed. We kissed for what could have been hours. You were an exhuberant kisser, definitely keen, and my ego welcomed the confidence boost that you always brought. The ease of being around you was amplified by the mutual sexual chemistry. I wanted you then, more than just a fling, although I didn’t know it well.  As a friend stumbled across us, we laughed it off. As I swigged from the cheap bottle of fizzy wine I was nursing- a collossal 5.5% if I remember correctly- I couldn’t keep the smile off my face as  one of my best friends throughout our University career- my housemate, the birthday girl- shrieked in hilarity and delight as she twigged what was happening.  To be honest, I didn’t care that people laughed. They thought it was drunken antics.  That was the first of many times. We began to spend nights together, although never actually doing the deed; the first time I touched you bare, you came in seconds. I still didn’t care. It was exhilerating that you seemed to find me so irresistable.   The next time, it definitely wasn’t seconds. Even thinking about you in the cold light of day made my heart skip and every time I saw you, my worries went away and lifted. I guess I kind of think it’s the stuff soulmates are made of.  I soon learned you were seeing someone. I backed off; I wasn’t ready for another relationship, having just come out of one myself. It hurt a little, and I was confused why you weren’t holding out for me- I would have done for you. Your friends were equally as confused. “You’re all he ever talks about,” They’d say. “It’s always been you- We don’t know what he’s doing”. Regardless,  we both ended up in separate long term relationships, but we kept in touch, as friends- although don’t think I didn’t pick up on your ridiculous flirting and flattery each time. You shouldn’t talk like that to someone when you have a girlfriend, you know. But I didn’t stop you.  A few years later, you became single again. I was still in my relationship, but it was failing. I began to think about you. A little more often than I should, and at times when I definitely shouldn’t.   You came to see me a few days ago. You’re still gorgeous. You drove for over an hour just to say hi, because I was absent from work and a little poorly. You said you were worried about coming to see me because of the feelings you might reignite. You later said you were right to be worried.   You have another girlfriend, but you were touching me as though I was yours. You pulled me onto your lap and I remembered the first time you did that years ago. Your face was far closer than was appropriate but you weren’t moving away. We could too easily have kissed, and I don't know what would have happened then. I’m glad that I was at least a little more in control, regardless of what was going through my head. I laughed it off. You didn’t like that. And don’t think I didn’t notice you were hard then too.  What you don’t know is how now I can’t get the image of you screwing me out of my head, against the wall, hot and hard. We’ve never actually got down to it, and the build up of over 4 years is taking its toll. I don’t know if you’re playing games or if your feelings are real and you can’t keep away, or if I’m just a tool to inflate your ego every now and again. How am I supposed to know?  I still think you could be my soulmate, but I’m not sure I’ll ever find out.    	1
 You sound a lot like my brother. He's 20 and he recently asked out a girl for the first time. He got rejected. He's very insecure and the rejection left him saying things like "I'm not meant to be in a relationship" and crap like that. Unless you think getting rejected won't take a shot at your self-esteem, I would "work" on yourself more.    	1
    I wouldn't really know what to say to help since I tend to suffer from the same type of crippling social anxiety. I try not to think about it on the grounds that there's nothing I can do about something that's already been done and that thinking about it will only do me harm.   On the contrary, I have a very healthy relationship with my dad. He is the reason for my introduction into geekery. When I was kid, I would stay up late with him to play Super Mario World or watch Batman movies. I don't see him very much now that I'm away from home though.   Somehow, this doesn't surprise me. Every time someone doesn't use their turn signal, I want to kick them in the face. Especially when it ends in me needing to slam the brakes on the highway because they think it's ideal to merge directly in front of a car without signaling.   Get drunk.  The sad thing is that that really is the only time when I feel like I'm not being suffocated by my own introspection.   "Deoxygenated blood is actually blue cause our veins are blue too." "Aren't eggs a dairy product?" "Can penguins fly? I mean, they have wings."  All by the same girl in my introductory logic class. And I'm going to a supposedly "good" school.  EDIT: I forgot another one from my biology course. "If saliva breaks down starch, then why is it that a fry doesn't just disappear when I lick it?" I don't know. It's a close tie for whichever one's more stupid.   I promise I wasn't burned in a fire. I'm definitely okay-looking.  It's not like I seek out men that ignore me. It's more like they show an interest in me and then immediately drop into "I don't care anymore" mode once I express interest back. Not really sure why that happens.   I gotta finance my 'Vette though.   More like /r/shittyadvice. I don't really get how it's the business of my friends to know what my SO thinks about my body.. \:   I was a little puzzled about that too. Most of the excuses would always be things like "I have a headache" or "I'm too tired" or "I'm already tired from studying for orgo/chem. Not tonight." Guess that's what happens when you go to a school where most of the students are pre-med.  	10
 Aurey already had 9k subs, Chad just 54 xD   Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. I guess we'll see what will happen :) PVP was fun, they just did the PVP event after which Sethbling moved out the border to a million blocks diameter, but I thought we were all talking about the vanilla server. There has been enough minecraft lately. Four Mindcrackers were playing Crash Landing, there were three duos playing Diversity maps (plus B-team a few episodes), there was Survival of the Fittest, there was Color of Infinity... PVP maps are fun, absolutely, but I thought we were talking about the "dead" vanilla server. I see this as two separate things.   I think, as far as Mindcrack even needs to be saved, they have already taken down the world border. The activity seems already increased since Halloween and the reveal of Chad as being the new Mindcracker. A lot of people are already getting back in the game and this will only increase now that the world border is gone.   Thank you! :)   Where can I find this?   Lol that preview for the next episode! Nice episode guys, glad you found the temple at last :)   Yeah me too. I was like: "where did they get all the wireless access stuff for the ME network?!"   That explains everything. I was already wondering whether I missed an episode or not.   Right now /u/brighteyes890 is in first with 8 votes :)   Yay for our own opinions :-)   Whatever, at least it's far away. That's my point.   Permanently gone.  edit: Out of sight until Kurt grabs it. Seth set it out a million blocks away.   Oh my, Chad and Vechs. Please no.   I live in Nijmegen so both Arnhem and Utrecht are easily accessible for me. My only problem is that I'm at my parents' house almost every weekend, which is not even near Arnhem or Utrecht. :( Maybe I can fit it in somewhere, let me know if this is becoming a thing and you have picked a date, okay?   [Did you downvoters need a source for that?](https://twitter.com/docm77/status/531418337423949824)  edit: First of all, this post may seem strange later tonight but the above comment was downvoted a lot before I added the source. Second of all, I am wondering why /u/jlim201's post wasn't downvoted. That's all.   Millbee: *oh baby, a tripleeeeee!* Can't get that out of my head. Not really a meme though.  Maybe Bdubs testing out his first fireplace followed by burning down both half his house and a part of the roofed forest.   Doc is also maybe releasing a Mindcrack episode tonight.   Yeah okay your idea already sounds more reasonable ;)   I just noticed this and I don't really know if it's intended or not, but it bothers me :P I just searched for a post from last week which contained a suggestion, so I used the link flair search option on the reddit here. When you click on Suggestion, it will also show you all Survival of the Fittest posts. Is it possible to change this? My guess is that it has something to do with the pink color of both flairs, it's exactly the same. If not, ignore this, I guess ;)   There has been a similar post but I can't seem to find it. Maybe it got deleted already, but that person had a similar idea. He said the server should be online one day per week, which I highly disagree with. Now the difference between your and his post is that you're not taking down the server for the rest of the week (and maybe pick a daily time?) but yeah. I don't think you can "force" them to get online at a certain moment. It would disturb their recording schedules, also for other series, because they are all busy with a lot of things besides vanilla server. If the guys (and girl) feel like it, they should definitely play on the server, not when we want them to.  edit: [found it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/2lgznw/suggestiontake_the_mindcrack_server_offline_for_6/) OP didn't add the Suggestion link flair.   BEFORE IT LAYS EGGS   GTA and Mario Kart, nice thinking :D I enjoy these   Oh that bathtub duck game thing, goofy stuff like that! :D   My part in this, although most of these, if not all, are probably already mentioned:  * Gmod! At least Prop Hunt and TTT. * Race for the Wool!! Sips + Hatfilms vs Lewis, Sjin, Duncan and Simon * Octodad (I miss this Duncan and Kim!!) * Civ would be nice, Civ 5 or Beyond Earth, I don't really have any preference * Hearthstone by Rythian * Some sort of survival minecraft with QA? * Minecraft bingo? That was really fun with Lewis and Simon, maybe try this with a few more people!   And the bees are also outside the station. I really like this series so far :) I tried to play this map but I got really frustrated because of all the mobs. It's probably better if you're with a few players like they are. They are now at the part where I gave up :P Yeah I know, I gave up rather quickly   I'm gonna watch all of this as soon as I get home. Had an exam this morning (which went horrible) and have been studying all day yesterday. :(   It sounds a lot like the meatballs like we make them. He uses breadcrumbs but you can also use biscuit crumbs or something like that. Only thing I don't use is the milk! I can tell you they are delicious :)   No, sorry. I tried considering it but all I can see is problems for the Mindcrackers with scheduling. Not even for Mindcrack vanilla, but also other series, especially when they pick another day every week. God knows when they record group events like Gmod, MK8 and Speedrunners. This might mess up their complete planning. You're talking about 30 people that you wanna have on the server around the same time. It's not even possible for them to be all 30 in a UHC.  Besides the recording, there's the obligatory part in it because they "have to play at that moment". If they don't, it's another whole week without vanilla content. We already barely have any content, let's not take away the time for them to finally record something. Why can't people just be patient for a Mindcracker to publish a certain episode for a series? All we want is more, more, more but the Mindcrackers are also human beings with a social life and choices and wishes. If someone doesn't feel like recording a bit of vanilla content, I'd rather have them wait until they feel like it than record it anyway with a sad face and sad voice.   Ooh I missed Chad's episode :o Gonna watch it in a bit.   Generikb. Found his Beecademy videos first, subscribed to him because I saw he did more Minecraft videos, started watching Mindcrack somewhere during season 4.   Implying each and every Dutch person on this subreddit uses an Arkas flair and implying each person with an Arkas flair is Dutch   Yeah, well.. I go to university and I wanna finish this year so I can graduate etc. ;) I am still perfectly on track with my cum laude but I wanna keep it like that. I watch streams and later videos during holidays etcetera, and also weekends. But not during the week.   Something entertaining to wake up to every day. I live in the Netherlands, a total different time zone than most Mindcrackers so I go to bed when it's ~6PM at the East Coast. I basically miss "your" whole evening with uploads and streams but I get to watch it as soon as I wake up :D   Someone mentioned Blood and Bones in the comments on the video, might be interesting. Or maybe pick up ME3 again but this time together with Etho?   Hi, it's me, the person with no PayPal. I just discovered it's actually really easy to work with PayPal so I made one and linked it to my personal bank account. Waiting for 2 more days so I can complete that process and then I'll probably subscribe to him on Twitch and/or become a patreon. :) Chad is actually one of the few Mindcrackers which I watch *very* frequently. :P I only miss his streams every now and then because I live in Europe and he starts streaming when it's 3AM here. But I often watch them back from his Twitch page :D   Take your time, Doc. Your content on both the Mindcrack server and in your own World Tour world will be awesome anyway :) Just come back to Mindcrack when YOU feel like it, not when we do so.   Awh man I tore up while listening to Aurey's episode :(   Maybe not Vanilla but they have been very busy with Survival of the Fittest. At the moment, Generikb is off to Spain with his wife for the week so you can expect minimal to no content from his channel. Maybe they'll get back to B-team action when Etho finds the mesa deed. Bdubs gave some strong hints in his latest episode.   yeah. I'm not sure when he said he would be doing a Road to 10k every two days, I think it was one of the episodes of last week. But I know he was moving and he also mentioned a few things on Twitter. He also had internet problems.   Millbee moved and got off his schedule. He said yesterday that there will be videos again today/tomorrow. IIRC he also once said doing the Road to 10,000 every two days instead of daily. I expect a Road to 10,000 episode tomorrow :)   This is my favorite so far, well done!! Amazing!   I am a complete fail at this but here's my attempt at drawing a [spooooooky reveal](http://i.gyazo.com/912a8ada8403cba6da62867c6f25a000.png)   This should be way faster now with Gendustry like they are doing now on the farm. I also want to make a base sometime and let it run off of bees completely but I have waited for a mod that could actually make it possible without all the grindy problems like there used to be. Now with Gendustry this is easier than ever. All you need is a buttload of power (which pack doesn't have Big Reactors?) and a lot of redstone and glowstone, which IIRC are also bee products.   I was trying to breed bees with Forestry and needed some help on something. I found Generikb's Beecademy and subscribed to him, not knowing that it was just a short series. Fortunately he also played around with bees in one of the FTB series so I watched those episodes as well. Then I kept watching his series (and later also the Vanilla episodes) and so I got to know BdoubleO first (of course) and later on the others :)      And now a bit more serious reaction. I have to write a scientific article before next Friday about our project of the last three weeks but I can't find any motivation :( I have an exam on Friday as well which I still have to start studying for.. Ugh :(   Haha yeah, exactly. I also think ABBA caving would have actually been funnier than just a race for the diamonds. I really liked the concept of Generikb's bedrock drag race :D   Yes I know because I watched the episode. But I was wondering why it was titled 'Sorry Pause!' while I was still watching yesterday. ;-) Because it is really sudden and at the end of the video. They were already done but Chad had really nothing to apologize for, until the lava bucket and the destroyed diamonds.   Thank you :P   It was fun but I wouldn't do it too often. :) And now related to today's videos, I have been laughing out loud at Chad's and Pause's co-op. I couldn't figure why Chad's episode was called "Sorry Pause". Maybe because he won? But he didn't win. Oh man and then that lava bucket!   Poor Millbee, although you probably could've used another picture of him than the one on the Mindcrack wiki.   I believe Anderz is going to as well.   Yay, thank you!   To be honest, I'm glad he didn't. His red hair is definitely a part of him now, his signature. Don't you dare to change this Chad! :P   At the start of the stream he tried to read some of the usernames in the chat and mine was one of them, he got it about right. But I don't blame him, my name is difficult to pronounce for non-Dutch people.   I have been smiling since the reveal, I am really happy for him :D   Happy cake day :D Were you on that picture he showed?   ~~Whoops I almost accidentally clicked report instead of reply..~~  Yeah, I don't have these either. I'll see what I can do because it's getting really frustrating that I can't support my favorite Mindcrackers :(    I don't know either, IIRC it's a subscriber only thing by Twitch. Whenever you subscribe to a channel it is possible you get some extra custom emoticons. I am not subscribed because I don't own any of the payment options that Twitch uses (I think I should though) so I can't tell you :(   Yeah and I can't stop laughing at his reactions to each and every subscription and donation. It's that sound it makes which makes him jumpscare slightly every time :D   His stream is only 3 minutes in and so far he has pointed at the camera whilst looking serious, right when I was yawning because it's 1AM.. Perfect timing.. and he immediately said he would never pronounce any username correctly after a donation/subscription. He attempted to read some from the chat (why do I keep typing Chad?) and got my name right lol! This is gonna be awesome :)  edit: I see the twitch icon in the side bar for Chad still has to turn orange! But thanks for the flair mods :) I'm sorry I forgot to use the OMGChad flair, was too hyped. I have been very bouncy the last 24hrs since he revealed himself.      Try /hqm edit and shift click the quest. That way you can manually complete it in the cheat book. Then just throw it away (or store it somewhere until you run into a similar issue) and maybe throw away the flux capacitor too if it is a consumption task. :-)   Aw man too bad! I really liked how the first pumpkin looked like with the details from the Jack o'Lanterns and sideway pumpkins. Well done :D   Only 2.5 weeks late, but Beneficial NewcumberChad :D   I don't think there will be a spoooky_ghost flair, just an OMGChad one, which I'm going for as soon as it's available.   If you translate his name it means "good sand"   No you were not. I was really excited and cheering out loud when he revealed his face. I have had several theories in the past week, including Chad. It had to be a newcomer. Although it would have been a huge prank like Generik wanted to do sometime, I had never believed he would've managed to. I thought for a while that it might be the person that donated the highest amount of money during the marathon, but this went on for the whole week and this would never be possible in 24hrs. BTC was also an option but he was way too busy, he started a few new series lately. It had to be a newcomer and Chad has made the switch to YouTube with gmod, Mario kart, diversity etc etc. I am really happy for him :D   It was, read his tumblr post :)   I like Chad's montage :D His cat prank is so epic! And he actually rebuilt the whole barn, my god. He sure made the Mindcrack server alive again as well, I hope it stays this way! :D I predict a co-op of Aurey and Chad bringing back the barn soon :)   Seems legit. Can't wait though, finally no longer undecided :-)   I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS HAPPY IN MY LIFE!  edit: waiting for an OMGChad flair   Refresh ALL the things!   I can see you don't, your username seems Dutch. (Hi, fellow Dutchie here)   My boyfriend started the Netflix series House of Cards and he really likes it. He keeps telling me he does :P So maybe check that out as well!   What if your reddit username was ghost...   OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH   Every time I see a Free Talk Friday thread, all I can think is: where did my week go?!   I also think it has to be someone from the server because he gets around the server SO easy, knows exactly where to go. Anderz was really fast but the ghost knew exactly where Anderz was.   Thank you. I thought I was going crazy, I remembered it the other way around of what /u/ThinWhiteMale said :P   Haha it's okay. This is awesome anyway!   Oh my god I quit when it said [Herobrine joined the game](#spoiler) lol   Don't witches drop glass bottles or sometimes even potions as well? I know potions are a rare drop and the witch has to be drinking one, but glass bottles are not a rare drop from witches either. 27 items! :-)   Denial post? :D   Yeah I know, so Aurey was too early   Aureylian was too early as well, am I right?   True :P edit: oh and YOU TOO!   I didn't even realise this until now, oh man! But that would mean both Etho and Juicetra should die first. I bet that'll be one (or two) hell of a fight(s)!   Dat flair though. The mods are really into hypeing (hyping? spelling?) this.   Oh man, I was like YAAAY B-TEAM! but it didn't take that long until NOOO ETHOOO   Ah, yeah I watched his complete Diversity 2 series with Guude and commented on a regular basis, not every episode. I don't like Gmod Slender but I'll try and watch more TTT and Prop Hunt :D It's just about finding the time since I'm in the middle of my exams.   I don't have a credit card or PayPal or whatsoever you can use these days to donate/subscribe on e.g. Twitch, same goes for Patrons. I would LOVE to help out :(   I would like to see some facecam action! Let's see how they freak out from some sort of random gunshot nearby :D Also what /u/Marscall already said, some sort of episode marker.   You are really close to Bdubs! B-team!! :D Or is it his lookalike?   They would have to ask the Flan's dev.   Thank you. I am now on Mhykol's server and that one's okay. Just my own internet crashes every now and then but I can connect and play.   I can't seem to connect to BTC's fan server. Is it whitelisted or is it my connection?   Lol I hadn't even noticed the banner until now. Bad person . I like the downvote hover warning and the News flair a lot :)   Hmm must have been episode 1 then :P   Anderz killed Keralis. The death messages are confusing but left person shoots right person ;)   I thought I had read that Juicetra is near Generikb   Yeah I think so too.. :( So far I know Anderz throws grenades at Keralis because he hears him go mental with the gun in that house. I still don't know who was in Anderz' building though!   I have watched Anderz and Keralis now and I can confirm Anderz was throwing the grenades at Keralis. He was also the person that went mental with all the shots Anderz was hearing.  I am really curious as for who took away the thing Anderz put near the door! (Forgot the name) Because it was gone. That was probably what he heard instead of what he thought was the bear trap. Speedy was miles away according to the maps.  	103
 This one and /r/cringepics are in the same vein for me. They make me feel better about any and all bad decisions made during my life.   I work at a health food store that offers a prepared food section. We have a lot of ridiculous complaints, but the worst I've heard most recently was a lady who was gluten-free by choice, not by medical necessity, who was mad that we offered ANYTHING with gluten in it. She thought that we were not upholding our standards as a so-called health food store by offering items with gluten, and that we were helping people kill themselves by selling gluten products.   Now, I'm gluten free by medical necessity and I understand that it is very frustrating to find good gluten free food, but seriously, she was acting like she's the only person in the world. While instances of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are rising, most people can eat it without any harmful effects. If our whole store went gluten free, we would lose like 90% of our business.   I consider myself a nice person, but sometimes when I'm ringing difficult customers up I think some of the most horrible thoughts imaginable about them. Working in customer service causes me to scare myself.   I like that you phrase it like, "I *did* 6 years at OG," as if you were describing doing 6 years in prison.   most prettiest girl their is  BLEECCHCHH   TALK LIKE AN ADULT HUMAN. Why would anyone ever think that that is charming?!   While that sounds awesome in theory, I feel like a lot of people would end up puking and/or copulating on the equipment. Haha   First of all, don't tell me what to think about my experience. For your information, he *did* continue to make sexual remarks to me and about me the whole time I worked there and even when I went back as a customer when I got a better job.   Secondly, the question itself was EXTREMELY inappropriate at the time he said it, regardless of whether he continued to make sexual comments thereafter. Common sense should tell anyone that that is not an okay thing to ask someone in a work environment. It's not like we were great friends anyway--he was just a coworker with whom I was friendly *at* work, not outside of it. If he asked me that in an office setting, he would have been reported immediately and there probably would have been some sort of punitive action taken against him. Unfortunately, however, behavior like that is all too common in restaurants (as evidenced by the study posted above), so nobody blinked an eye when he made remarks toward me.  If you missed it, I linked the American government's definition of sexual harassment in the workplace, and my story clearly fits the description of sexual harassment. He cornered me in a room, alone, made an unwanted sexual advance, and asked me if I would have sex with him. I'm not sure how that could be considered anything BUT sexual harassment.   It was an unwanted sexual advance in the workplace so...yes, yes it was  Here's a [source](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm) for you   This list is amazing! Kudos to your friend!  Definitely try to go to all the places in the Fairmount/Logan Square area!!! Fairmount is basically my favorite part of Philly. (Although the Rodin, Natural History Museum, and Barnes Foundation aren't as awesome as the PMA itself).  Old City is lots of fun to just explore, but I usually prefer going when it's warm out. Elfreth's Alley and National Mechanics are a must! And the historical sites are cool to pass through as well.  Also, it's not in Center City itself but try to go to Chestnut Hill. It's super historical (they even have cobblestone streets still!), there are lots of beautiful houses around there, and there's tons of fun little shops. Plus, it's right near the Morris Arboretum, which is objectively the coolest place ever, even if plants aren't really your thing.  Enjoy your time in Philly! :)   When I worked as the takeout girl at a restaurant, I had one of the kitchen workers (whom I knew was casually hooking up with one of the waitresses) come up and ask me straight up, "Would you lay me?"  When I was appalled and said no, he asked me if it was because I was white and he was black. I couldn't believe it--there were lots of reasons why I wouldn't "lay" him (I didn't know him that well, I only thought of him as a friend, we were coworkers and that would result in a lot of awkwardness, every time I walked into the kitchen I saw him making out with another coworker, and many more), but the fact that THAT was why he assumed I didn't want to sleep with him really blew my mind. I kind of avoided being alone with him after that...   Former 2 year old girl here, I can confirm that scented chapstick is delicious   This is pretty much unrelated but I first read "any man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand elephants" as "any man knows that his penis has the memory of ten thousand *eggplants*" so that's kind of a funny thing   it is one of those cases where it is a hitler fighting a stalin, hitler is pretty objectively ideologically wrong, but stalin uses a perverted ideology that is good in theory, and while stalin may be the better of the two, you know, it is still fucking stalin.  You just perfectly described it. I'm definitely, proudly a feminist and was raised to be such, but a some feminists here and on Tumblr take it TOO far and are simply mean and unforgiving to people who don't understand all the new terminology feminist and queer scholars have coined to describe certain groups of people, acts, etc. The way I see it, you need to show patience with people and try to reasonably discuss these issues. If you're respectful, you're a lot more likely to get the person you're talking to to see things your way (or at least to be respectful of your opinions). But some people believe that people who don't fully understand feminist beliefs don't deserve respect at all (which is absurd because it completely undermines the whole basis of feminism--that all people are equal and deserve to be treated thusly). When people ask them questions they'll answer with things like, "I don't have to educate you, go figure it out yourself."   I understand that maybe they wouldn't have the time to write out a full explanatory response, but at the very least I think that, if they posted something that leaves a lot of questions to be answered, they could simply link to a few resources to help the person asking questions to understand. The hostility I see from people (and which I have even experienced when asking other feminists questions about their beliefs and about terms I haven't yet encountered) turns a lot of people off from a movement which overall, I so fully believe could be beneficial to everyone. Makes me sad, man :(   It's not even that your post is poorly worded, it's just that not a lot of people know what "doxing" or "copypasta" or a lot of the other strictly Internet-culture terms you used mean. No need to be hard on yourself or anything! :)   Exactly, the girl on the phone was obviously really scared when they finally pulled over to meet with the police officer, but she held it together so well while they were still driving. Kudos to her for sure.   I actually came here to recommend those two songs as well! Personally I prefer 10,000 Emerald Pools, just because it's a lot more relaxing. Love the harmonies.   I start a lot of my sentences with "so," and my mom hates it. Most of the time I don't even realize I'm doing it, but I definitely understand why it's distracting.   I just found out the other day that the athletes in my school don't have to pay for their textbooks if they've been recruited. Granted, there are tons of really great athletes at my school, and probably many of them are great students as well, but let's take our football team, for example. They suck. They are terrible. Yet they have amazing scholarships, they get new workout clothes from Underarmor every WEEK, they get free housing, free textbooks, free meal plans, and they get special treatment all the time. I feel like I work hard and contribute a lot to my student body in different ways, yet I still have to struggle to pay my way through college. And there are lots of people who have to drop out or take out hundreds of thousands out in loans to get through college. That makes me really, really mad.   ~capitalism~   Beautiful design, but yeah, I totally agree that they would be great banners. This design would be wasted on currency.   If you have any friends who are into dystopian novels and/or women's rights, I'd definitely say *The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood. It's my all-time favorite book, and it's a classic.   (It's also my personal belief that we should have all kids reading it in school because it directly ties to some of the reproductive rights themes we see in politics today, but that's just me)   I used to use the face washes and toners you get at a normal convenience store, but that was drying out my skin too much and wasn't really helping. Then, I tried oil cleansing, which worked alright but not well enough for me to warrant going through that process every day (it would take around half an hour including cleanup--it was really messy--to do altogether).  Then I read about these microfiber washcloths from Norwex that wash off makeup, dead skin, dirt, etc., with just warm water, so I started using those in the morning. After I'm done scrubbing away all the dirt and dead skin, I just put a thin layer of Aveeno lotion on my face and neck. I use "Simple" brand wipes at night just to get any makeup or dirt off before bed. And occasionally, I give myself a facial if I notice a lot of blackheads or if I'm having a breakout.   Most of the time it works! Around the time of my period I get a couple small pimples, but other than that, this plan has kept my skin looking pretty great! It's cheaper and less wasteful than everything I've done in the past, plus I'm putting fewer chemicals on my skin. My face does feel a little oily on occasion, but it's nothing that's too bad.   Ugh, I'm with you. So sad I won't be able to go. Good luck!   A lawyer?   I hope this isn't real. They're threatening the newspaper, which is definitely not okay, especially considering the police's heightened political status.   Our First Amendment rights are put in place for many reasons, one of the most prominent being so that newspapers can print opinions (like those shown in that political cartoon) without retaliation. By threatening to sabotage that newspaper through intimidating people into not supporting them, the officer who wrote that letter is directly threatening the cartoonist and editor's First Amendment rights.  Edit: Also, did he seriously just refer to that cartoon as a "slur"?? Does he not know the definition of a slur?  	24
 Why were they willing to wipe out all life on a galactic scale to keep The Flood from spreading? What would have happened had The Flood been allowed to spread?            You'd think it defines a person's entire being.   I use [this laptop cooler](http://archive.benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content task=view id=688 Itemid=66 limit=1 limitstart=2), and it helps a little, but my laptop still get pretty hot to the touch (only on the speakers above the keyboard, which is where I assume the processors are).   According to Core Temp (a program I use to monitor the processor temperatures, the highest I usually go is about 65-68° C. I don't think that's really gonna damage the computer, but I also use a couple of high-end programs (mostly for video editing), so keeping it cool would help a lot for that. Plus I just hate the feel of a hot laptop, especially in the summer.  I'm really strapped for cash so I can't buy much of anything to help. What can I do to at least mitigate this issue?         I can barely convert a 5-minute video file without my processor damn near hitting 90° C (it's Intel Duo Core if that matters). I'm scared my computer will burst into flames (hyperbole alert) if I try to convert a file that's one or two hours long  Any advice?   Since I spend 12 hours a day in a room with no light (I live by myself, in the basement of a two-story house), eat crappy food since I never have the energy or will to actually cook, never have friends over, and I go outdoors maybe once a week, only for 3-5 minutes at a time.     Plus the fact that every day is pretty much just me doing anything I can to keep from going insane and make it until tomorrow without losing my shit. He said that sounds like the life of someone serving time.    And I think he's right.    Depression is a prison.   Instead of right clicking and going down to "Properties" (even though it's really just right click, up arrow, enter, but still).  Just discovered this accidentally.      It will automatically add it to your reply in quote format.   Please be nice if I'm retarded and everyone already knows this.   The people in the rodeo aren't a threat to the bull, and the bulls aren't attacking people for food, are they?  Also, how do they keep the bulls so docile before they're released?   Prove to yourself, that is.                  I use a PC, not sure if this is an issue with Macs.   Just wait until I press Enter, you piece of trash!   To start, my laptop is a Dell Precision M6400 workstation. It's pretty powerful compared to the average laptop, so I expected a little bit of overheating here and there, but it's really bad now, even with my CM Storm laptop cooler.  I recently replaced my charger and battery (thanks to help from r/techsupport), after I had been using a lower wattage AC adapter for a while (because the original one died). The replacement adapter was only 90W where as the new one I just purchased (and the original) were 210.  When I was using the 90W adapter, the computer didn't overheat as much as it is now, which, ironically, is the reason I bought the new charger to begin with. I thought the stronger adapter would lessen the overheating, but it's actually gotten worse.  I haven't been doing much. Using the internet with 4-6 tabs open, no embedded videos (like YouTube and the like), no high-end programs idling in the background. Usually only Notepad, Windows Explorer, internet browser, AIM, YIM, Task Manager, and uTorrent are open at one time. Sometimes iTunes as well, and the CPU usage is consistently remaining extremely low (low single-digits). Despite this, the  laptop is hot to the touch (on the speakers, which are located [above the keyboard](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/09/m6400-precision-dell.jpg)). I've also got 99.9 GB free on my C drive and 49 free on my E drive (capacity 465 GB individually).   [Here are my specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png).  How can I keep my laptop from overheating?  Thanks.         I use either a program called "Any Video Converter," or "4Videosoft MKV Video Converter."  The converted file (usually to MP4, so I can watch it on my Xbox 360-- usually being converted from MKV or AVI) always ends up way bigger than the original file. Is it the program? Is it the video types?         Why don't Calvin and Hobbes just alternate between making up rules that contradict the most recent rule made up by the other? How does anyone ever win?   http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/09/m6400-precision-dell.jpg  I'm having a problem finding an AC adapter, though. This one:  http://www.discountelectronics.com/product?product_id=6631 product_model=302  Is the one listed under "Dell Precision 6400." However...  http://www.discountelectronics.com/product?product_id=4505 product_model=315  This one looks exactly like the one the laptop came with, and the first one is definitely not the one the laptop came with.  What do I do?  **NOTE:** I posted this last night, but got no responses. I apologize if re-posting so soon is against the rules, but I need this fixed as soon as possible.      http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/09/m6400-precision-dell.jpg  I'm having a problem finding an AC adapter, though.

What do I do?               Anyone who's taken it/is taking it, how did it affect you?                        What do these options, found under Power Options -- Advanced Settings -- Processor Power Management, mean? I tried Googling it, but I had a hard time understanding how people were explaining it since I now next to nothing about advanced computer hardware.  Could someone possibly put it in layman's terms for me?         Obviously, being a major secret means you probably don't know the true story, so most responses will probably be in the form of "The real reason _______ happened," or "What really happened at __________."   And when I say it "goes out," I don't mean that my modem/router doesn't pick up a connection. It still does, and I'll stay connected to my wireless network on my laptop, but web sites won't load. However, if I have something running that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (like Xbox Live, instant messenger programs, torrents, etc.), they will stay connected to the internet (i.e., torrents will still download, I can still send/receive IMs, can still play games online, etc.).  When this happens, nothing on my router/modem changes. All the lights are lit, and it shows that I'm connected to the internet.  Does anyone know why this might be happening and how I can fix it?   How can you owe this amount, and all of a sudden you owe less?  Sorry if this sounds stupid; I know next to nothing about finances.

I can already stream music that's on my laptop, and listen to it on my 360. How would I go about doing the same with video?  Thanks in advance.   When I use VLC media player to play the .m2ts/.ts files I have on my computer, it just shows "00:00" no matter how long the video is. I also can't skip back and forth through the video with the "Forward/backwards five/ten seconds" commands. It doesn't do this with any other video format.  Is there any way to fix this? The files I have are very big (1 GB at the smallest), so I want to avoid having to convert them to another video format if possible.  Thanks.      I use the term "herp-derp" in the title because, like always, I try to use humor to heal the situation, but it is serious.  The only way I can describe it is this: I feel sadness and depression like everyone (I've been really depressed for about ten years, but that's not the most important part), but... when I feel (or SHOULD feel) happiness, it doesn't feel like happiness. It feels like a different type of sadness. Stronger and more pronounced. Like I'm going to cry, but I **know** it's not from being saddened or depressed.  I feel this when things in my life are going perfect and couldn't be better. Right now is a good example. I just came into some money, I may have finally gotten some anti-depressants that work, and I have literally nothing in my life to worry about.  So why do I feel like sobbing? Why does this happen EVERY TIME that I should be jumping for joy and grinning ear-to-ear? Is this normal? Is there something wrong with my brain that triggers a "sadness" reaction to a "happiness" stimuli? Can this be fixed?       Lol  Like that.               I have a couple of hobbies that I really enjoy, which are video games and video editing. Right now, I have nothing to do for the rest of the night, and instead of indulging myself in either of these activities, I can't find the will to do much other than pace back and forth across the room or sit on the edge of my bed literally doing nothing else.  Sucks.            EDIT: Or really, any type of numerical or letter label that isn't what it appears. For example, different mediums have given varying representations of the "S" on Superman's chest. In the 1978 movie, it's described as the coat of arms of the House of El.                           I've been trying to wrap my head around this concept for a long time, and I got nothin.  Help me out.   Nature generally does its best to give a species good reason to continue reproducing, right? That's why sex feels so good, why we're attracted to certain people, etc.  If that's the case, why is childbirth so painful for women? Isn't that completely counterintuitive to what nature usually dictates? It could essentially be a logical reason for women to NOT want to give birth-- nature usually makes sure to, at the very least, not give someone a reason to not reproduce.                  Apparently, the word "Theory" is closer to the typical use of the word "Law" than "Theory."         Me: Squidward. Monotone voice, little tolerance for people acting silly for no reason (i.e., SpongeBobs), constant -_- facial expression  What about you?   I'll focus on the [Patterson-Gimlin film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOxuRIfFs0w) a little bit, plus some basic zoology. If I'm wrong about anything, or you disagree with something ambiguous, feel free to say so. I don't necessarily believe everything I list below-- I'm just taking what I've heard and throwing it out there for you guys to go after in any way you see fit.  For:  * The alleged suit used in the P-G film has never turned up, even after 45 some odd years * Many men have claimed to be "the guy in the suit," and their stories all contradict one another (although honestly, fake or not, this might be expected) * In the P-G film, the alleged creatures has arms nearly as long as its legs, completely unlike a human, even one in a suit * Some claim that if you look closely at the forehead, you can see the crest moving up and down, which would be indicative of muscles and skin, not rubber * Some claim that Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin simply did not have the resources to pull off such a massive, long-lasting hoax * Some claim that the alleged creature seen in the P-G film walks in such a way that would be almost impossible for a human in a suit to replicate  Against:  * A minimal breeding population of large primates would have to number in the thousands, and if that's the case, there's very little chance that they could escape detection, especially for this long * Primates do not swing their arms when they walk like in the P-G film * There is no fossil evidence of anything that would fit the description of what we know as Bigfoot or Sasquatch * Bodies are never found, nor is fecal matter * Nests, colonies, etc. are also never seen or discovered * Apes do not hibernate during cold winters, and as a result, it would be nearly impossible for a Bigfoot to survive an entire northwestern United States winter   How do you all feel about it? Fake? Real? A guy in a suit?  I've seen cases made for both sides, and I wanna hear what the members of this subreddit have to say on the subject.         But it's not why you think. Well, it might be.  I used to be the type of guy who would talk to random good-looking women in public at the drop of a hat. You know "Hey, how you doing?", make small talk, attempt to get phone number. I was almost always woefully unsuccessful, but I generally didn't get discouraged.  Anyways, eventually, I realized that I had to draw the line at some point. So the fact that I had very little success, plus the fact that I know I'd make a shitty boyfriend anyway, made me decide to stop coming onto women at all.  Anyways, I was walking home from the store today, and I saw a cute chick. She wasn't super hot or anything, but she'd have been worth talking to if I didn't have my personal decision not to do so. We were both standing at the corner, trying to cross a busy intersection, but the traffic took a while to slow down enough for us to get across the street.  Of course, me being stupid, I couldn't help myself.  I said "This intersection could use another stop sign, couldn't it?" and smiled slightly. I don't know why I said it, but I do know that I had absolutely no desire to try and sweet-talk her.  But nobody told my brain, apparently. Because at that point, she agreed and laughed, at which point we were both able to cross the street. I walked back the way I was going and didn't pay her any attention, but I felt sick to my stomach that I didn't take the opportunity to hit on her. This was over an hour ago, and I still feel like crap.  tl;dr- [This](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rbso0/) is what happens if I interact in any way with any attractive woman ever.  Fuck you, scumbag brain.  **EDIT:** Well, at least I can use this situation to confirm that I'm definitely forever alone. It's good to know.  You're okay, scumbag brain.   These videos are clips that I've recorded from my television with a capture device.  Not only am I a little (read: a lot) over my head with the sheer number of files I've recorded, but they also are all in 1080i high definition. My computer isn't built to play that type of video smoothly, so watching them at all is a chore and it's almost impossible to do so without significant skipping.  Does anyone have any advice for how I should go about this?  Thanks.            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnophilia  Ask me anything that you can think of about this. Nothing's off limits.            I live in the Philadelphia area and just want a psychiatric assessment and medical diagnosis. I don't need therapy or counseling or anything.  I tried using Google, but I couldn't find anything. Maybe someone who's more experienced with this can help.      For example, a police officer. Say a cop pulled over a woman because her car matches the description of a vehicle they're looking for. Turns out, wrong car.  The cop flirts with the woman and gives her his phone number (not taking forever to do, so that he can get back to patrolling), all while being recorded on the dash cam. Would he be reprimanded?         Plus, I got a good laugh from the doctor after the procedure. I told him I understand why they say you shouldn't drive, but I feel like I could walk home or take a bus. He responds, "Well, some people get drunk and think they can beat up Mike Tyson. That's how you sound right now."  I couldn't help but laugh out loud.      I've never blacked out for any reason, and my last girlfriend used to black out randomly... it sort of piqued my interest, because she'd always be able to tell me right before it happens.  Educate me, Reddit.   I mean the type of depression where you rarely feel any semblance of happiness. How does it feel to be "cured"? What's it like?         Apparently, one can be arrested for animal cruelty if he/she cooks or attempts to cook a cat or dog, but not other animals such as lobsters.  What's the difference? Am I missing something?   I have this constant paranoia that something strange happening means I'm coming down with dementia or psychosis.   I'm no psychopharmacologist or anyone who'd be considered halfway knowledgeable in this field.  I have to take over-the-counter sleep aids for my insomnia (which I haven't been "officially" diagnosed with-- I just know I have trouble sleeping without sedatives), and I have been doing so regularly for at least two years.  The maximum recommended dosage of diphenhydramine HCL (the main active ingredient) is 50 MG. I took 100 MG all at once about two hours ago (my body's built up a tolerance). I feel slightly sleepy.  I don't want to keep doing this because I feel like it could become dangerous (although I haven't started hallucinating yet, which I understand is the main side effect of an overdose).  If I get treated successfully for depression, will my insomnia wear off too, if it's a result of depression?            There have been certain times where my success rate increased/decreased in a certain environment (or maybe based on some other deviation).  Ask me anything.      I'm speaking of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City.  The combat system I mentioned is how the game engine allows you to dodge and counter enemy attacks in real time with specific animations for doing so, as opposed to having generic "Block" and/or "Roll" options.  Which next-gen games have combat systems like this?  Thanks.   For example, I wear jeans like lots of people do, but I only wear black jeans.         Background info:  I'm not a virgin, although I have only had sex with one woman (multiple times). I think she wasn't very good, because I didn't feel anything at all whenever we had intercourse.  She gave very good oral, but no matter how close I was to the point of orgasm/ejaculation, I could never cross the threshold so to speak. I never came. Not once.  As for the title, yes, I specified "while awake" since I have frequent wet dreams.  I also don't masturbate, but I get aroused and horny like one would expect. I watch sleep fetish porn (I have somnophilia-- a fetish for sleeping/unconscious women).  I found some really good material tonight after I started to look for more since I couldn't sleep (that's gotta be ironic somehow). While I was watching, I was getting closer to the point of orgasm than I usually get while watching porn, but I still didn't think I'd cum.  Then, all of a sudden, it happened. It was (obviously) a feeling I'd never experienced before, and it caught me off guard. I was basically going O_O the whole time.  Ask me anything.

I know Watterson has said that he doesn't think of Hobbes as either a doll who comes to life when only Calvin is around, nor a stuffed animal who's only real from Calvin's perspective. But I see evidence that, in my opinion, **Hobbes is a stuffed animal whose personality, in the sense of Calvin's imagination, represents Calvin's moral, rational, conservative side**. I'll explain why below.  Throughout the entire Calvin And Hobbes series, Hobbes doesn't once address Calvin's parents. This is because Calvin, essentially (according to my theory, which I'm by no means citing as fact), is both Calvin AND Hobbes. He can't talk to his parents as "Hobbes" because he's too busy being "Calvin."  Speaking of Hobbes interacting with people other than Calvin... not even Calvin's **duplicates** acknowledge Hobbes' existence. You would think that if Hobbes was a real tiger in any way, shape or form, Calvin's clones would be able to talk to him and view him as a real tiger.  Also consider this-- whenever (even though it rarely happens) we see Hobbes writing, his handwriting is eerily similar to Calvin's. This is what first tipped me off that "Real tiger" Hobbes and Calvin are basically the same person.  Hobbes also disagrees with a lot of Calvin's plans, but goes along with them anyway. Hobbes actually likes girls, unlike Calvin, but yet he's still the First Tiger and "El Presidente" of GROSS. Many fans have speculated that Calvin secretly has a crush on Susie-- perhaps he expresses this through Hobbes.  Some might argue, "Don't you remember how Calvin said that Hobbes can climb to the tree fort where they hold their GROSS meetings, and Calvin himself can't?" This is a good point. As silly as it sounds, I honestly think Calvin just throws Hobbes up into the fort, which would explain how he can reach the fort "without climbing." When we [actually see](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/07/26) Hobbes attempt to climb a tree, he's unable to.  Hobbes also shares many of Calvin's opinions and "knowledge," despite the two being so different on the surface. Hobbes helps Calvin cheat in class at least once (despite Hobbes being morally upstanding for the most part), he does his homework and gets the answers just as wrong as Calvin, if not worse (once answering "Atlanta, Georgia" to a subtraction problem), and he believes in Santa Claus.  You'll also notice that Hobbes almost NEVER refers to Calvin by name. Everyone else in the strip does-- Susie, Mom, Dad, Miss Wormwood, Moe, even the principal of Calvin's school. But not Hobbes. Because why would Calvin refer to himself by name? Calvin, however, *does* refer to Hobbes by name on a regular basis.  Like I said, I know a lot of people might feel like I'm "devaluing" the strip by formulating and writing up this theory, and you're certainly entitled to that opinion. But I'd ask that you don't drag this post down by making excessively negative comments.  Thank you.   I also am not a virgin, and I have frequent wet dreams (they don't even have to be sex dreams when my body decides to unload while I'm sleeping).  I feel the need to make one of these every time my body reminds me how strange I am by making me wake up wet and sticky.  Ask away. Nothing's off limits.            My friend just told me that an attractive woman was working at the store across the street from my house. I had to loan my Debit card to my dad (long story), so I only had three bucks in cash. I needed bread anyway, so I figured I'd buy a loaf and make a move while I paid for it. In, out, easy.  I get to the store, find out that they're $3.39 each (but also buy one, get one free, so eh). After asking the attractive girl in question and realizing I didn't have enough cash, I had to go back to the house and grab 50 cents in quarters.  I figured it was okay, though. She held on to the loaf of bread, so now I have an excuse to get in her line as opposed to another one. I grab another loaf of bread and wait in her line.  Then one of her co-workers opens another line. I offer to let the person in front of me go first so that I could stay in the line I was in, but he had a full cart and I only had one loaf of bread. Then I tried to use the "But [attractive girl] has my other loaf of bread. She's holding it hostage," and gave a forced laugh.  Her co-worker, totally oblivious to what I was trying to do (understandably-- she had no way to know), cheerfully said "Oh, that's okay!" and took the first loaf of bread from the girl I had gone to talk to. So now I was stuck in this new line, and had to leave the store without even coming close to making a move, AND I looked kinda stupid/poor/both for not having more than three dollars in cash on me.  **tl;dr-** Went to store across the street to talk to hot chick and buy bread. Didn't have enough for bread. Had to go back home to get more. She ended up not even ringing me up.            Possibly misattributed, but a good quote nonetheless in my opinion.               Is this indicative of how ancient man perceived right-handedness as "normal" and left-handedness as uncouth?   I watch sleep fetish porn (i.e., porn with "sleeping" girls being fucked), and in at least half of the videos I've seen, the guy tricks the girl into taking sleeping pills, which promptly knock her completely unconscious within about 3 minutes.  I take sleep aids every night for insomnia, and not only do they not put you in a state of complete blackout to the point that a man can ravage you sexually without you awakening, but they take at least a half hour before you even START to feel anything.         I went to the store and noticed an attractive young lady working the cash register. I smiled at her, made small talk, and paid for my items. As I was leaving, I doubled back and asked if I could take her out for coffee. She smiled and said yes, but seemed hesitant.   I told her that she didn't sound as if she was sure of her answer. Then, sort of randomly, she said "This is kind of inappropriate..." I asked her how so. She quickly changed the subject and said "I don't even like coffee!"  I calmly told her that she didn't have to actually get coffee if we went out. At this point, she said "Sure, we can go to Starbucks one day." Almost as if she was trying to get rid of me. But she said yes, so I asked for her phone number. She asked me to get it from one of my friends who had been in the store with me, but who had left before I doubled back to talk to her.  I could tell something was wrong, so I just told her I'd come back later.   My friend was waiting outside, and he said he'd hook me up.  Sure enough, later that night, he came by later, along with her and a couple other people. We hung out for a little while and played cards, but eventually, me and the girl got in an argument because she said something about her boyfriend. I took exception because I felt that she was wrong for saying yes to me when I asked her out if she's with someone.  She claimed that she "liked my approach" so much that she just instinctively agreed to go out with me. I was confused and a little annoyed, because I felt like if you're with someone, you don't just forget that you have a boy/girlfriend. You just say "No thank you, I'm in a relationship right now."  I felt like I was being led on unfairly.  What think, Reddit?      This is the first time in an extremely long time that I've ever felt un-depressed for a long period of time. I had five friends over-- nothing huge. It wasn't a giant party or anything. But they smoked and drank (I did neither-- you can have fun without those things), we played cards for a little while... hell, me and one of the girls got in a little bit of an argument, but by the end of night, we hugged and made up (at her request, even).  Anyways, through all my rambling, the point is that I had fun. I'm not a social person. I would never call myself that and neither would anyone who knows me. Being alone is usually the only time I can say I'm close to being happy, and I think that this probably applies to a lot of people here.   What I'm saying is that you might, just might, have a good time if you hang out with the right people. If you don't like to have jokes played on you or to be ribbed/talked about by your friends, even in a sort of friendly way, don't put yourself around those types of people.  Find guys (or girls, or both) that you get along well with and who won't start any problems. People that will be mellow and won't ruin your good time. People who will make sure you're enjoying yourself and not let you stay depressed.  tl;dr- Socialize with the right people. There's a good chance that you'll enjoy yourself, and you won't feel depressed.      She's constantly nice to Calvin, she wants to spend time with him and lets him in her house even though he almost always treats her like crap.  I can't believe I didn't realize this sooner.   The only thing I can remember is a huge blizzard we had in Philadelphia in the early 90s I think. 36 or so inches of snow.  I didn't care because I stayed in the house all day anyway.   I listen to mostly rap music. I live in "the hood." I know people who sell drugs (and I know a little about the drug game). I've stared down the wrong end of a revolver and was once the owner of a shotgun (although I never had to so much as load it).  And I'm also a huge internet nerd. Ask me stuff.   What is it about the look-- the glasses, the professional attire-- that satisfies so many men?   http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Homophone?s=t  *a word pronounced the same as another but differing in meaning, whether spelled the same way or not, as heir and air.*  * Lichen/liken * Undue/undo      My first "girlfriend" (although she'd probably say otherwise since the relationship was so short) once saw a good-looking girl around my age working the register while we were shopping for clothes. The girl I was with knew that I have no qualms about making small talk with hot women in public, so we had this doozy of a conversation:  * Her: Don't talk to that cashier when we get to the counter. * Me: And what if I do? * Her: Then I might have to cut her eyes out. * Me: O_O...  So of course, when we got to the front, I talked to her anyway. I didn't flirt-- I was just making small talk. "Hey, how are you," that sort of thing. I even made her laugh when I remarked about Mondays being terrible or something or another.  Anyway, the girl I was with leaned up and whispered in my ear, harshly, "What did I tell you?"  I didn't say anything. I was laughing hard on the inside, though. Then I decided to give her a test, since I knew she wasn't one for public displays of affection:  * Me: Put your arm around me. * Her: ... no. * Me: Do it, or I'm gonna start talking to her again.  At this point, she put a death grip on my arm that I will never forget. I was shocked, amazed and flattered at the same time.  I also knew I had to break it off with this crazy bitch.               My roommate is on the phone right now with some girl, talking about "taking care of her" because apparently she's sick or something. So far, he's lied about his age, height, and relationship status (he has a "girlfriend" who he cheats on regularly).  I think if I wasn't making this post, I would have leapt up and screamed "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" by now.  If I'm on a diet (especially an unwilling one), don't eat sweets around me.   I was in math class about 6 or 7 years ago (I was around 16), and I sat behind a girl I really, really liked. She was very pretty, but she was actually a grade ahead of me, so I was even more scared to talk to her than usual. One day after the bell rang, she started talking to one of my (few) friends, and when the girl I liked looked at me, I knew my friend had told her I liked her.  She walked over to me, and of course, my heart was ready to leap out of my chest. She asked me with a smile, "Do you really want to ask me out?"  I said, "Yeah, but you'd never go on a date with me..."  She responded, "How do you know if you don't ask?", still smiling.  I hesitated, looked into her eyes, and sighed. "Would you like to go out with me?"  She continued to smile and simply said, "I'd love to."  I melted.         I've signed up for FetLife and joined this group:  https://fetlife.com/groups/6837  But I figure the more communities I find, the better my chances of finding a woman with whom to fulfill this fetish.   I can't find anything on the site itself (or the Wiki page-- I am very new to the site in all fairness, however).  Has anyone met someone on FetLife, or know someone who's done so?  Thanks.      My doctor prescribed me a brand of anti-depressants about two months ago. The first few doses were small, so my body could acclimate gradually. Taking it for the first time made me feel high (in a psychoactive way, not in a "The opposite of low, I'm super happy" way). Didn't make me feel "un-depressed," though.  As my system got used to the effects, they lessened until I stopped feeling anything from them at all. I was still depressed, even taking doses that were four times larger than when I started (40 MG compared to 10 at the beginning).  I stopped taking them cold turkey about a week ago because I couldn't afford to pay for them anymore. I feel no different now than I did while I was taking them, nor compared to before I first took them.  I'm looking into counseling, which could lead to better treatment, but I've been depressed for like 10 years. I'm convinced it's too late for me, so I shouldn't even bother.  Thoughts?      A representative just came to my door, gave me a gift basket, paid me a $20 "incentive," and bought me and my roommate pizza for participating. Everything seemed absolutely legit-- he left plenty of paperwork explaining everything, a business card, didn't make us pay anything or ask for personal information like a social security number.  Ask me anything.   I find myself having to create the same post multiple times if I want more feedback on it. This would avoid that, especially since doing so sometimes gets you bombarded with "REPOST" comments.           	170
 It could be the reason. It's cool though, thank you for your concern :-)  	1
 Reddit, I have noticed more and more that old people just CAN'T DRIVE!! Even my dad is becoming a horrible driver. He drives through stop signs and is generally reckless and my grandma doesn't know how to maintain a steady speed, braking constantly for no reason. What are your stories about old people driving? Do you think they should retake a drivers test?    I imagine cat people are a little more introverted and therefore, go on the internet (and post about their cats), whereas dog people are more socially active and go out instead of go on the internet.    I don't think her experience would make it less special for you. I had a similar experience with my current boyfriend who had never kissed anyone, but i had. When you're in the moment, those things don't matter that much.    A first kiss is very special, especially with someone you care about, but it could turn out awkward if you don't quite know what you're doing. Practice makes perfect.    I grew up with a single mom. She was an alcoholic and I am an only child. By the time I was 12, I had learned how to forge her signature, pay bills, do groceries, clean the house, do laundry, wash dishes, make dinner, and be a nurse. Who needs parents anyway...?    Society has a serious problem.   THIS! On to the Legend of Korra??   I am happy to report that I am still with the person I first had sex with. No regrets   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Mt2E1M6dUandfeature=related    Wow dude. Sorry, but I cannot muster up any sympathy for you.    I think the heart makes it obvious enough   She might have been testing you. It was manipulative, but I think she may have wanted to see if she could trust you.    Do you know what the music is from? I recognize it, but the name escapes me.    I don't get.   My mom died when I was 14 years old. She was an alcoholic and prescription drug addict. And I'm sure everyone has heard "Your Mama" jokes. I realized early on that my tragedy was not going to change what people say and that they won't understand what it's like to have a dead mother. All the time people say "Your Mama" jokes and even my friends sometimes forget that my mom died and they will say them to my face. What helps me is to realize that people are stupid and they won't change. When they do say the joke to my face, I wait until they are done and then, with a smile on my face, I remind them that I don't have a mother. Almost every time the person will feel guilty and say sorry and the jokes are over for the day. I don't have a problem with the jokes, I just feel like the honesty will remind them in the future to be more aware of their audience and I think it works. It's worth a try in your case. It's kind of like seeing the funny side and saying something at the same time.    In all seriousness, I think http://www.themaidofhonorguide.com/ will help you get started.    YES YES YES http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyqUj3PGHv4      *arrangement, spell-fail. unless they want an arraignment for having a creepy foot fetish   Well, I can say from experience that the mother probably has had a huge influence in how your daughter feels. I lived with my mom for most of my life. My mom hated my dad too and I grew up thinking I should hate him. I learned later that a lot of things my mom said to me were only half-truths. I don't know the whole story with you, but the mom could have something to do with it and your daughter is a teenager now. You rarely see her, so she can easily use you as a target for her anger. Teens are nasty sometimes. Is there anyway you could collaborate with your daughter's mother to work something out? It seems like you aren't on good terms with her, but in the interest of your daughter, maybe something can be worked out.    This has a resemblance to the island depicted in Harry Potter.   ostentatious    It does seem rather silly.  	22
 Thanks. I had heard a theory that if you already have enough serotonin then neither 5-HTP nor l-tryptophan will help. In fact if they convert to  serotonin then you may end up with too much and not be able to sleep, hence causing insomnia. I guess it works for some and not others.       When I can't sleep I find that I MUST get out of bed for a while or I will just lie there awake all night long. CBT treatments will also recommend getting out of bed and going to another room so that you don't begin to associate bed with being awake. It is possible that you managed to get into a light sleep and were then woken up but light sleep on its own is not very refreshing.   People who have sleep apnoea apparently find it hard to enter REM sleep. There is a possibility that is happening with you as you are unsure if you are sleeping or not. See if a partner ever notices you not breathing or snoring. If you snore and it stops for a while that can be an indication as well.   I used to get music repeating around in my head - it is infuriating. I eventually got rid of it with a very silly sounding exercise. When ever I noticed it I would think 'STOP' and push the music to the outer reaches of my mind. It took a while (a few months?) for it to completely stop but I have not had that issue for years now.    Has anyone tried these? My initial reactions are hopeful but I am the same with every new thing I try. They often fail within a few days suggesting that I am just getting the placebo effect due to the excitement. It would be good to hear from others who have experience or opinions.   You may want to try 5-HTP and or L-trytophran which are both available at health food shops. They both convert into Serotonin which is then converted into Melatonin at night. Commercial Melatonin comes from a cows brain and may not be as good as that produced by your own pineal gland. 5-HTP and L-T are the base building blocks of Melatonin and so may be better.  Commercial Melatonin is also very strong. A healthy adult male should produce about 5-25mg of Melatonin from the pineal gland. If you are taking 1 gram at night then that could be 40 times more than is expected. A book called "Reset Your Inner Clock" describes in layman's terms how having too much Melatonin in the blood when you wake up can shift your next nights sleep onset time by up to an hour. I would hypothesise that going to sleep too early may result in insomnia. cet.org are developing a micronized form of melatonin that mimics the natural cycle of melatonin produced by the pineal gland. Melatonin never worked for me - I am now trying 5-HTP and L-T but I am taking L-T in the afternoon as it seems to make to too buzzy if I take it just before bedtime.   Are you sleeping now your parents are back?    I saw a TV programme years ago about sleep paralysis. A lot of artwork from the 16-17th century depicted demons sitting on the chests of people lying in bed. That is derived from people experiences of sleep paralysis.   There are two nodes at the base of the brain near the spinal cord that control waking and sleep. They are meant to act like a switch so that you are either awake or asleep. In people with sleep paralysis they both stay on, so the person is asleep but thinks their dreams are real.   It sounds scary, I am glad I just seem to have insomnia and not that. Sorry not much use but I found that TV programme interesting - it has stuck with me for a decade or more now.   Magnesium is supposed to be a relaxant and I have found that seems to be useful over the last few days - that is all I have been taking it for. Magnesium Taurate is apparently the best absorbed but Magnesium Citrate is also meant to be good - Magnesium Oxide has a poor absorption rate. It apparently works by pulling Calcium out of the muscles which helps them to relax. If you are doing heavy lifting then it may help with the aches and pains and also help your mind relax.   I also have also heard that Melatonin does not work for some people but does work for others. For those is does not work for then the base building blocks of 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan convert into Melatonin. I found that 5-HTP kept me awake at night and so I am taking it at lunchtime to increase Serotonin levels. Serotonin should then be converted into Melatonin at night. It is too early for me to know if this works for me yet.  All of those are sold in health stores as supplements and so may be useful. They are cheap to try and maybe you will have some luck with them. Good luck!     Could you let me know why you think the article is 'bullshit content'? It looks at 9 scientific studies to form an opinion. You may disagree with the derived opinion but that doesn't make it a 'bullshit content'. If you think the quality is low then I would appreciate your reasoning as to why so that it may be improved. Thanks.    sting from a single source, but I do mind posting bullshit  Sorry, I am new to social sites and haven't figured out how to use them yet. I will try to take what you say on board.  	9
 **"Platform" lyrics:**  **verse one**  Neon lights on the dust on the ground on the bus  Dirty roads makes that scarf wrap a must  Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app  Data mine my mind like a diamond in the ruff  **chorus**  Platforms here's a train of thought  Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought  I'm gonna say what else have I got  Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not.  **verse two**  If oil is the god then the cranes all pray  The crude is so rude  It makes the people pay  On the side of the road men make money  A flower for a dollar man  He wants a family  If I rose to power  It'll be a bouquet  Emoji a smiley  And say I'm OK  The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day  And talking is cheap  Coz they make it easy.      Thank you for the useful info and for your constructive comment.   First of all, please make a change in your diet.  Eat more unprocessed, actual foods... i.e. fresh fruits and vegetables.  I like to drink a strong roasted dandelion root tea to soften stools and to cleanse the liver.  Also you can try ginger to aid digestion; I do not, however, know of any laxative or stool-softening effects in ginger.   okay, fair point. my family maintains a small organic farm, and yes, we do use pesticides. but they are formulated to be safer than those normally used.   so my wording was a bit off. teavana teas have been shown to contain dangerous levels of pesticides, and i have actually felt a nauseating, toxic sensation upon consuming some of their teas. now i find it practical and even necessary to be discerning, but i realize there are many people who have desirable experiences with tea regardless of the product’s ‘organic’ status.   alright r/tea, question time.  what are your thoughts on organically-grown and processed teas? are they frivolous luxury, absolute necessity, or complete nonsense altogether?  personally, i tend to go for the organic stuff; this habit arose after having several not-so-pleasant experiences with (teavana) teas grown using pesticides.  sometimes, though, i feel as if i’m missing out on some great tea experiences because of strict standards and a reluctance to deviate from any product that lacks organic certification.  what are your thoughts?   also, if you don’t mind me asking, where does one purchase a ‘top-shelf’ fukamushi?   let me know what you think!   :) a few months back i purchased a pound of organic fukamushi from Den's Tea, and i tend to agree with this assessment. my only question is... how does the extra steaming affect the leaf's health benefits? obviously the leaf becomes more particulate with the fukamushi process, but does that indicate any damage to the leaf's nutritional integrity?   i personally prefer fukamushi for its grassy overtones and particular cloudiness. just curious what others prefer between these differently-steamed Japanese greens and why.   hello, i am going to be posting a simple preference-based question every few days just to help myself and others flesh out a greater understanding of the subtle-*teas* inherent to the world and culture of *camellia sinensis*.  so, for round one, the questions arises from the japanese tea tradition.  do you personally prefer the delicate freshness of a traditionally-steamed sencha or the heavier, more robust cloudiness of a more thoroughly-steamed fukamushi-sencha?  why?  	11
 Was thinking the exact same thing   Actually that would be pretty cool, I would buy the shit out of that   It sure is summer   CoD in a nutshell   That's groovy   What if is not dead and just waiting for the right moment that someone gets close enough out of curiosity to take a bite out of its face.  Just sayin    The power of Christ compels you   Lemme see that booty   What does GoT have to do with this?    http://i.imgur.com/TS833b2.jpg   Maybe, time will tell  	11
 I havent read the packet yet. I did download it. I was just very cautious and ran like 5 virus checks   I actually do think your right. I dont know. /u/afterbang , whats the official play on the field?   hmmmm. Yeah, I dont know about Halsey. I love her as a character and of course theres the war crime arguement of "Is she truely guilty or does the ends justify the means?". I personally believe, with you and many others, that its ONI (or more specifically Paragnosky) that has it out for her. The UNSC sanctioned the S2 project to fight the war on Insurrection. It just happened that they were able to also fight the oncoming Covenant war that Halsey knew a little bit about. I dont think she should be treated the way she is during SpOps but now that she's all sorts of pissed at what the UNSC has made her 'babies' into, I can see her working with sects of the Covenant willingly.  As for John, I can see him pulling a "Look at my Service Record and then get back to me if you want to stop me" move and going AWOL to 'revive' Cortana. I mean really, he's had her from the beginning of his MJOLNIR suit days. They have done so much in they're days and she has been the only one who has truly seen how bad some of the shit he gets in is. She has been his only TRUE companion so it's no wonder he will do anything to revive her.  Sorry if this was long but I am just in a typey mood   I honestly think AWOL is a legitimate option at this point. I mean really, Master Chief is one of the highest ranking people in the UNSC. Who's gonna stop him?   What my Uncle came up with was that its possible he could meet up with Grey Team (Cole Protocol) and they could help him considering they are long distance long term recon   One of those questions that will never be answered. I've often wondered myself too. Also, with eating ,and hygiene. Hmmm.   Alright. I will give the Win on this one to you and accept I'm wrong. Stupid misinformation in my head   Hm. I know before Naomi is given her set of MJOLNIR in Glasslands, she is in an ONI Uniform but shes a S2. I dont know. Maybe its all in my head but I swear that S2's never get rid of their armor. EVER.   No, I meant S2. The S4's, when out of armor, can wear normal clothes.   Okay not the fact that its a reminder but. I dont know. I figure he'd be so driven and fueled he wouldn't need a constant reminder.   I like your idea very much sir. I didn't really bat an eye until This would explain why he is carrying her chip, as a reminder of what he is fighting for. And then i just went: "Wooooooooooooah there."   Im saying that H5 will be released ~Nov-Dec 2014. We'll get leaks all throughout April-June of next year and maybe a few minor this year.   At the end of H4, he does take off his armor and most of the S2's without their armor, keep on their undersuit at the least.   My speculation on that: What MC is holding in his hands is Cortanas AI matrix chip, the thing he constantly pulls out of his helmet back. Deep inside the roots of that chip are the core functions and properties of Cortana. Using this and the possible abilities of the Librarian and other live forerunner species, its very possible he is going to get her restored.  My theory for the librarian: If MC so chooses to go the Librarian route, she will fix Cortana but she will have the same AI life expectancy. She will still have all the memories from before her corruption on the FwUD(So she forgets all that happened during H4). She becomes full again and he starts to turn back to UNSC. **Further offshoot** He comes in contact with Kilo-Five, Grey Team, or Linda and Kelly and works with them to get himself back into the UNSC without high charges.  With a Forerunner: He gets her restored but she's unstable, but permanent. She has the occasional splurge to have John help the Forerunners return to glory but past that she can keep a steady head and maintain her ideas.      I have to ask, how is gmod? What does it take to run? I thought about buying after watching a few Pewdiepie videos. Now that I'm hearing about ODST's in it I'm excited.   The middle of the Sahara? But if, as everyone assumes, he has gone AWOL or on his own, he would go to Earth. He'd stay away from most of the UNSC superbases.   The Librarians hideout was Earth I thought? or was it that she banished the Didact to Earth?    From what I understand its a darker color. Its possible considering the Kilo-Five series.   You just went full retard.   I would like to apologize for being a no show. My mom (Im only 16) dragged me to this party so I could babysit. So I am very sorry for probably ruining the plans.   Sure. Send me a request GT Troop4921 please.I ll be on later on tonight   My theory is the following: 1. The robe is to hide his identity from the community just for the ad. 2. He's obviously gone slightly AWOL so also to hide from the UNSC. 3. If he's gone AWOL and since Cortana is dead, his suit cant be readily fixed and repaired.   Thank you! Makes me smile everytime.    Alright starting with Halo Wars. Get on and message me Troop4921   w00t! thanks:D    Hey guys, AC here again. So, I have never 100%ed a game. EVER. And I really want to.

Im not the best either but ill 1v1 you a bit       Yeah,its called a phone    Thank you. I will now scour these for a good story i can send her    Yeahhh, her and I both have sex drives that are just out of wack. Hers is ALWAYS through the roof and mine is just high. Again why I said I may catch some flack is cause of my age. And I understand what your saying in the first paragraph.   So I am just going to hope this belongs here and alot of you might raise hell against me but here goes. I (m16) have had this girl(also 16) thats been my FWB for at least a year and a half now. We always make deals to where we even out who owes who what blah blah blah. Well recently it came to me oweing her a story of her liking. Well, she isn't dominant but she likes bondage-ish stuff. I'm not into that but I am keeping my promise. She likes rough, throwing around, tied up, and her not recieving much pleasure but being teased with what she does get. Again, not my style. So if any of you guys know some good stories I could send her in place of my (very poorly written) story please link it to me and I would be more than grateful. Also, ideas for when we do mess around in the future.  EDIT: We're not physical FWB. If you saw me, youd understand why. We skype and phonesext alot.   Hey Ill be on here in a minute Troop4921 is my GT and im working on Dominion master commendation   thanks. would also help if my game didnt crash every 5 seconds lol. really cant wait till my birthday so i can offload alot of this crap on my laptop (i.e. games and photos). I will talk to all three of you the moment I get membership and ill be ready to kick ass and take names in game   Hey guys, I'm considering getting a RS membership again. If I did decide to become member again, would anyone want to quest and such with me so I could get back into the swing of it all?   Okay so I found this subreddit and was very happy to! If we are writing our Halo RP stories then I will start.

Hope somebody enjoys this:)      I could help possibly    You still on?    I kinda want to start playing again(On the 2007 servers though) but idk about membership. While I love the game, on my laptop its just hard to run. When my birthday rolls around here in a month im getting an External Hard Drive that I can offload all my games(Skyrim, FNV, Fallout 1,2,BoS, Amnesia, MariO, and Surgeon Simulator) onto so that I have more open memory and my RAM increases to run RS faster.   So I've been playing RS since ~2006 and I kinda cut off two years ago. I got rid of membership and still have ALOT of membership items and idk if theres a specific place I'm supposed to put this but I'm willing to sell almost all of it. Pretty well over its just a bunch of gear, some farming stuff and other misc. items I haven't and probably never will use. Get ahold of me on here and Ill trade with you in game:)    I dont know if its good for scrip but Rampage: Minigun Mayhem, if you get gold or past, its pretty good loot/xp/scrip   Okay so I would love new races (ie. Castithian, Endogene, the race that Torc is) and an extension of what happened to the Stratocarrier. Like better explanation. I understand just even more story to it would be nice. Agreed with top comment of multiple breakdown/buy. New-ish vehicles or more customizable vehicles. More variety in enemies. DEFINITELY A GRAND EXCHANGE/MARKET. Anyone else have some variation on my ideas? Oh, and one of the things a couple of friends of mine came up with; like an addon pack of nerdy armors such as ones that look like Samus' armor from Metroid, Isaac Clarke's armor from Dead Space, Master Chief's armor from Halo, Storm Trooper from Star Wars, and other generally nerdy gaming armors.   I don't use medic primarily but I do have my "Plague-healer" class which I have a BMG primary and Infector secondary with an infector grenade. It comes in handy, really, only on co-op maps and minor arkfalls. The group I play with often has at least one of us on the healer role and I'm normally stuck in that role. My standard though is an assault class however. It just depends on the person I guess.   lol i get it now    GT: Troop4921 Ingame:Astin Craktair   Stage 4 Data recorder is at Top Notch Toolworks just on the edge of the garage if anyone wanted to know.   its saying no results:((    Hey guys its me again. I will possibly be starting an Xbox360 clan. Anyone interested in joining? It'll be rather oligarchial leadership wise and we'll help everyone out as much as possible. If you wana join, shoot me a message on here, XBL @ GT: Troop4921, or in game my name is Astin Craktair. Just hmu if you wish to join or youd be willing to help!   Is that GT or in game?    Nice name? lol ill be on in a minute    Sorry, not with that type of grammar.   I'm playing Defiance on Xbox 360 and Im currently on main mission:Ulterior Motives. If there is anyone that wants to team up with me and help me it would be much appreciated! Message me on XBL @ troop4921  	57
 I'm pretty sure they'd take you anyways, you'd just be in debt afterwards :P   My kitten does that too! I haven't got a clue why, though.   Something like this triggered my fear of deep/dark water. I was 11 on a vacation with family in Florida, we rented a boat to go snorkeling. I swam maybe 50 feet from the boat, when I felt something stinging. I looked down and there was jellyfish all around me. I completely freaked out, and almost drowned. Still have nightmares about it.   I do the exact same things! But I eat my boogers because I enjoy it. It's nice too, because I rarely get sick.    No white after Labor Day.   Thanks for the reply! This was very useful, I looked it up and she does seem to have many of the symptoms associated with this.    Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely try cleaning out her nasal passages, just to see if it makes things a little easier for her. I don't think the kibble was too large, as she has no trouble eating pieces of meat bigger than the dry food. As soon as I have extra money I am planning to take her to the Vet, but until then I'm trying to take care of her as good as I can :)     	8
    Underwear means panties, bras, and socks in this case.   I only wear underwear for one day. Every so often I change them twice a day. Bras usually once a day, but never more than twice. Socks get changed every day.  I wash them either when I run out of clothes or the laundry basket gets full.  Taken from Askmen. I was a little shocked to discover how some of the men admitted to wearing their underwear a few days in a row...      So, in class we recently read Medea. For those who don''t know it, here's a quick summary: Jason leaves his wife, Medea for the chance to marry a princess. He owes all his success to her (Years ago, Jason had to get a Golden Fleece to prove himself to a king, and Medea basically did all the work for him) so she felt very betrayed. She spends the entire play wondering how to take her revenge, and decides she will kill both their children solely to hurt Jason, and leave the city to escape.   The professor asked who we felt was responsible for the death of the children, Jason or Medea. I thought it was obviously Medea. Jason was an asshole, but Medea is the one who purposefully killed her kids to get back at him. To my surprise, a good number of my classmates (all female) answered that Jason was responsible for driving Medea to the edge. If he hadn't treated her so poorly she wouldn't have been in the position to feel she needed to murder her children for revenge.   I just sat there in awe. I couldn't believe a class of adult women weren't blaming the person who took the knife and physically murdered her children. No, it was the fault of Jason for pissing her off. A few choice quotes I remember...  "Jason obviously wasn't respecting Medea and she felt she had to act out to prove herself."  "If Jason hadn't left her none of this would have happened. He's just as responsible for the deaths of his children as his wife."  "Maybe Medea is the murderer, but Jason as good as killed his children when he left his wife."  Next the teacher asked us if we felt Medea was evil. The female students mostly agreed she wasn't evil, she was just hurt. Jason is the true evil one for driving her to such extreme actions.   A few male students did say they felt Medea was more responsible, but Jason did have some of the blame. A few other female students didn't say anything, so I am hoping they were too stunned to speak, as I was.  It's true that in the ancient Greek world women had very few rights, but Medea's actions are all on her. I wonder what response I would gotten if I had turned the tables and said, "I bet Jason only left because she sounds like a crazy bitch."         Before I start my story, I have to explain something. I've never been afraid of dolls. I was allowed to watch Chucky movies when I was little, and I'd go to bed in a room full of dolls without the slightest bit of fear. I've also had some really creepy dolls growing up and they never caused me any discomfort.   My mom bought this doll at a flea market around 2009 for me. She said the lady she bought it from let it go for a measly $10. This was $90 less than she was asking for, and apparently she didn't take a lot haggling to agree.   That night I put the doll in a corner and went to bed. Right away something was off. I didn't like the fact that the doll was looking right at me. As I said, I love dolls and I have literally dozens of them facing me all around my room. But for some reason, this one was unsettling. Finally I fell asleep.  I dreamed that she appeared beside my bed. She didn't move or say anything, but it was a very unpleasant dream. Of course when I woke up she hadn't moved from where I placed her the night before.   Later that year I moved out of my parents' house and took the doll with me (I took most of my dolls with me). You're probably wondering why I didn't leave the one giving me the willies behind. It was because I thought I was being really silly. And I didn't want to hurt my mom's feelings. It was really a nice doll and she thought I would like it.   Anyway, the doll was putting off the same vibes in the house I was renting with roommates. I eventually put the doll into my closet because I learned she didn't have to be staring at me to make me uncomfortable; she only had to be in the room. It didn't help. I imaged the closet door slowly creeping open at night while I slept.   The roommate situation didn't work out (nothing to do with the doll though) so I moved back in with my parents. By this time I was used to being creeped out as I slept so I just put the doll in the corner there she stayed for a few years.   Only it got a little worse. I began hearing voices whispering in my room. I could never make out what was being said, but it would always happen when I was trying to go to bed. I kept having that same dream where I would look over to the side of my bed and there she would be, staring at me. This kept up until 2013, when I moved in with my boyfriend.   My boyfriend *hates* dolls and flat out forbade me to bring any into his house. He calls them creepy demon portals. So I left them all with my parents. I didn't have the dream anymore and I didn't think of the doll again until this summer, 2014. My boyfriend had to leave the state because of a family crisis for awhile, so I moved back in with my parents.   When I entered my room, I didn't notice anything funny. I didn't really notice any of the dozens of dolls around my room. I just laid down and went to sleep. For the first time in forever, I had the dream again. This time I heard the whispering in the dream, which I never had before. It always occurred as I was going to sleep, but I didn't hear it once I had drifted off.  When I woke up I noticed the doll was gone. Very concerned, I asked my mother what the deal was. She said my grandma had stayed over and slept in my room, but was so creeped out about the doll, she asked my mom to move it into another room. So the doll was now in my sister's vacant bedroom. (My sister was living elsewear.)   This part really freaked me out. I always thought maybe the voices and the dream were products of suggestion. The doll was creepy, so thinking of her created voices in my imagination and some bad dreams. But why would that happen when I hadn't even noticed the doll was missing? I hadn't been thinking of her at all when I went to sleep. Another big red flag is that my grandma was creeped out by it too. I've collected dolls since I was little, and my grandma had never before had an issue with any of the dolls in my room. Just the Native American doll.   Here's a picture of the doll:  http://i.imgur.com/5cP0eAj.png  I tried to do some research on it, like if it was mass producted and if anyone else found them creepy. I can't find anything at all.   One last thing I should add: I never named the doll. I always name my dolls. It's just that I've been a little put off by this one, so I never bothered to name her. My boyfriend joked that she's probably just annoyed I didn't give her a name.       Having just watched the movie, I was going through imdb's forum page for it, and came across this:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067093/board/thread/112869960  Basically, since Fiddler has more 1 ratings than other musicals like Oklahoma and West Side Story, it's because antisemitics gave it a 1.  It just reminded me of Tumblrites claiming anyone who didn't like 12 Years a Slave was racist. Nope, there is no other reason to dislike a movie than that.  For the record, I loved Fiddler, but still. Fucking stupid.   My cat is 17/18 years old, and she was declawed about 15 years ago. (Not my fault. I was 10, so I didn't make the decision myself). She's been driving me insane from her avoidance of the litter box. I had to completely replace my living room carpet and replace it with hard wood so it would be easier to clean. Even my vet couldn't give me much advice besides trying different litter.  I recently learned declawing can cause cats to do this. It certainly fits with the time frame. All of this began shortly after her declawing, although she used the litter box more than she didn't. Now, she almost never uses it. Now that I know the cause, is there anything I can do to make it better for her?   The vet said sometimes people put their pets down for their litter box issues, but that's out of the question. I won't put my pets down for anything besides serious illness.                  Yes, I am using the Nattlebane. I stand in front of the roots and slash at them, but nothing happens. Any ideas?   At first I thought it was because he was the son of a lord, but that can't be because all recruits of the Night's Watch leave their pasts behind and begin on equal footing.          If the things didn't sell, stores wouldn't carry them.   I'm sure everyone has heard about how bad they are for your vagina, so what's your reason?   I'm in Ohio, if that matters.            I'm sure you've seen it on TV. These women carry babies to term (or nearly to term) without showing signs of pregnancy. No missed periods, no weight gain, and no belly.   I have to say what shocks me the most is how fast these women start worrying about the baby that just fell out of them without warning. I can understand if they love the child later, but how do they jump right from worrying about themselves to worrying about a baby they just learned existed?   If it were me, I'm not saying I flat out wouldn't care if the baby died, but I would be far more certain about my own health. After I was stable, I might ask, "Oh, and how did the baby turn out? Is it okay?" But in this show they begin showing concern almost right away. The psychology intrigues me.    Anyone remember these?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_%28TV_series%29  I remember watching these in elementary school. I loved them! I'm 25 now, and I admit to watching them still. Many of them are on Youtube, and I even bought a few of them in VHS form from the library when they were selling everything that wasn't a DVD. I've also picked up a few from Goodwill.   My favorites are Monster and Weather.   I'm 25 and female, if that matters.   I have very weak enamel, so I buy those bubblegum fluoride rinse bottles and swish it around in my mouth after brushing twice a day. Does this help or is it a waste of money? Thanks.   We have the unpopular opinions threads, let's do the opposite!      Please note that I only mean vet services such as emergency surgery and other things like that, not routine services like vaccines, neutering, etc.  I would agree that you should only adopt a pet if you can afford to feed it quality food, take it to the vet for routine procedures, spend time with it, etc. All of this can affect the quality of life for a pet greatly.  But for shelter animals, millions of them die a year. A much smaller number will ever need surgery or medical attention beyond what's routine. I just feel like it's better for those animals to spend their lives with a good owner and be put down if it gets cancer than to spend their short lives in a shelter because the owners who might have adopted them decided not to, because they knew they couldn't afford hundreds or thousands in emergency vet care.  In an ideal world, I'd agree that you should only adopt a pet if you have thousands to spend on it in emergency care. But as it is, many adoptable animals are dying in shelters anyway. May as well give them a chance until they get a chronic or expensive disease.  Am I making sense? I did have a late night last night, so if I need to clear anything up, I will.            I seem to remember Hermione's parents being in Diagon Alley in one of the earlier books. Is that something my brain made up, or does anyone else remember it?  Also, what if a Muggle born student had been in the Triwizard Tournament? Would their entire family be unable to come watch?   I've been playing this game for going on 15 years, and of the possible random events and diseases to get, I have never seen any of the following...  -Alkali sickness in an animal (only death)  -Beriberi  -Consumption  -Gangrene (I even left injuries untreated to see if I could get it)  -Lockjaw  -Malaria  -Rabies  -Water poisoning  Anyone have any info, or anything else to discuss?         Admittedly, this was a several years ago, but I'm now looking at it in a new context.  I was 20 years old taking some technical classes with other adults. One day we were learning PowerPoint, so the teacher had us make a slideshow on whatever we wanted. Now, you know how most classes start out with an introduction session? Tell everyone your name, age, why you're there, how your family is, etc. Well, a good 3/4 of the class had kids. I noticed when we were watching the presentations at the end of class that virtually all the parents had made slideshows on their kids. It struck me as odd that not a single one of them did a show on any outside interest besides their kids. Now, I'm not saying my show was great; I did mine on the last imperial family of Russia, which I'm sure bored everyone to tears, but at least I had a hobby as a history lover to do a project on.   I mentioned this to my mom when I got home that day in amusement, and she said, "Well, they probably didn't have anything else to make a project about. Think about it. Since they're in a technical school trying to get skills they've probably been working crappy jobs and trying to raise children. They likely spend most of their time working and parenting. Not a lot of time for outside interests there."  That just hit me as being so sad. Now, I'm not saying every single one of those parents had nothing else to do a project on. I'm sure a few of them were like, "I'm doing a project on my son, he's hilarious, this'll be awesome! And more interesting than doing it on my stamp collection!" but I'm willing to bet a great many of them had nothing else.   I had to buy new supplies for her since my parents need those for their cats, but I am taking one of her mouse toys, so at least that will be familiar to her. Anything else?               It's been brought to my attention that sometimes I will utter something under my breath, but when someone mentions it, I can never remember what I was saying. My boyfriend said I also use a very strange voice when I do so. The best way he can describe it is a horror movie whisper.   Might be relevant: I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was very young - around 10 years old. I was on Paxil for 13 years, and am currently on Effexor.   Anyone have any insight?   I've noticed this in many threads lately.   Person: I think pedophilia is probably just an orientation like heterosexuality or homosexuality. They didn't choose it and it isn't unnatural.  SRS: Shitlord! You think it's perfectly okay to rape kids! You think "child" is a gender!  Person: No, I didn't say it wasn't morally wrong or shouldn't be illegal, I just said that it's another natural orientation that pops up. That doesn't mean it should be acceptable in society, though, no one is saying that. Feelings are different from actions.  SRS: Benned! God, what is it with Reddit and being tolerant of child rape?         These are all paraphrased:  (How do you feel about the fact that your son, since he was born in the 80s, probably received no anesthesia at all?) "If I didn't see it, I don't care. He was fine when he was brought back to me."  (You don't own him or his penis.) "I beg to differ. Until he's 18, his penis belongs to me."  "I'm sure it hurt, but I bet it was nothing compared to how giving birth to him felt, so he shouldn't complain."  "Circumcise them all! It's what men deserve for the amount of raping they do." To be fair, this might have been a troll. There wasn't a single person, even pro-circ people, who didn't jump on them for this one.  And the worst one, IMO, just from the ickiness:  "I had my son circumcised because it just looks better." (Isn't it creepy that you care how attractive your son's penis is?) "Maybe, but I just want him to be sexy. Sex is important to women."   I know these threads are common, but each one offers hours of entertainment!      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ-9zcThs0I  Last I heard this was being expanded into a full movie, but I've never heard anything else about it.    Walter Mitty Syndrome is when you daydream about yourself being in another life as much as or even more than you pay attention to your real life. The name comes from a short story where the main character thinks up exciting scenarios for himself in his head when he's bored. I don't think it's a formal diagnosis, but it's a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder, and it's something some depressed people tend to do also.  I just recently realized I've done this for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I would daydream about a life where I was happy. I'm almost 25, and I swear I do it more and more as time passes. In my current fantasy I am happily married with children and money isn't an issue. I get to travel anywhere I want and live however I want. It's scary sometimes how often I find myself in my fantasy. Sometimes I don't even know I'm doing it, it's like it happens on its own. Much of the time I wish I could just slip out of myself and into the fantasy forever.   My boyfriend regularly brushes with mouthwash as if it were toothpaste. Does it clean about the same, or is it a bad idea?    I want to have a study/source on hand about men circumcised in adulthood and say sensitivity is lessened. The more scientific, the better. Anyone have anything?      This happens after exposure to semen specifically however I have not really experimented enough to determine that this is the cause.  The core of my body just involuntarily tenses up and twitches repeatedly for at least 30 seconds.  What is this?            I go to Windhelm, and I can't find Ulfric. I've tried waiting until pretty much any hour of the day but he won't appear.   Also, Galmar Stone-Fist won't talk to me. He just tells me I don't belong there. Am I missing something?   http://www.nashp.org/sites/default/files/Adult%20Dental%20Monitor.pdf  This site seems to say Ohio offers some dental services through Medicaid, but I have to idea how to go about doing that. Ohio's Medicaid site lets you apply for medical, but says nothing about dental. Can anyone give me a lead?  Oh, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I just didn't know where else to go to ask.            Both college and work tend to make me even more depressed, since I'm going to college full time, and I also have to work. I feel like I have no time for myself, and I'm so miserable that there's hardly any point to being alive because I am getting no enjoyment out of anything. Right now since it's the holidays I have some free time, but it's just going to start up again next month. Anyone else who hates working and college have any tips?   People under 18 are legally considered children, and therefor cannot vote (except in one city in Maryland that has a 16 voting age for local elections), drink, drive in some places, smoke, or sign contracts, etc. Even if an individual proves mature, they still are not given any rights until they turn 18.   So why are teenagers considered mature enough to be treated as adults when they commit a crime? The undeveloped brain is used to deny them privileges adults have, so why doesn't the undeveloped brain argument keep them from facing adult consequences?       I only know a small number of them since I am a newish player, but the "To Kill an Empire" quest along with the ones preceding and following it had a lot of twists and turns and was pretty entertaining.    He died and I want another one.   I don't have any expansions, just Skyrim.   I was on r/morbidreality, and there was a video of a soldier stepping on a landmine and losing both his legs and an arm. In the comments, people were talking about how for many soldiers, after stepping on a landmine the first thing they want to know is whether their genitals are okay. Their limbs come second. A few other men commented and said they'd rather lose their legs than their genitals.   As a woman, I would rather lose all my sex organs than my limbs. This includes vagina, clitoris, uterus, everything. Am I just an exception or do most women agree?   Let me just explain my feelings. I know I only feel like I want to die because of my depression. I know if I was mentally healthy I probably wouldn't feel this way, but that doesn't change the fact that I am completely miserable and this probably won't change.  I've had depression ever since I was 9 years old at least, and was put on Paxil at age 10-11, and am now 24 years old. It takes the edge off and I've had some happy moments but overall, living is exhausting and I've yet to see how it's worth experiencing.   Right now I'm in college for history. I know job prospects in that area are pretty much nil, but it's one of the few things I enjoy. Despite liking history, I hate college. I'm doing it because without it I'll likely be working fast food the rest of my life (which might happen anyway). Despite loving history, I hate going to college. It just makes me more depressed and exhausted. Throw in having to work at the same time, and I'm failing to see the point in my continued existence. I have to do something I hate for years in order to try to secure a better future that I don't think will be worth living anyway?   I guess my point is that when I mention this, people just say, "Well, you only feel that way because you have depression." Yeah, that's probably true. But so what? If I decide to live my life and die a miserable old woman, at the end of the day, I was completely miserable my whole life. Does it really make a difference that I was miserable because of a mental illness? I don't think so.   Please understand, I'm not typing this on the edge of a 5 story building about to throw myself off. I intend to finish college since I've already worked so hard at it. I just think it's unfair to say someone is "only" feeling suicidal because of a mental illness. Those feelings are still very real and I don't see the point of a continued existence if that person is through being miserable and wants to die, even if it is caused by mental illness.  One final argument: Yes, mental illness can be treated, but not often cured. Even if it's being treated, it's still there and still having an affect.    I have a cat named Lydia who's about 15-17 years old. Besides being a bit skinny (she always has been) she's been in good health and acts the same as she always has. It's that she's getting so old I know it's coming.  Lately I've been very anxious about finding her dead, or coming home from college on the weekends to learn she's died. I even freeze up a little when I see my mother has called or texted. I know no one ever knows how long their loved ones will be around. She could die tomorrow or she could be around another few years; there is no way of knowing.   I am only 24 years old, so Lydia has been part of most of my life. When she goes, I honestly don't know if I could go on. The silly part is worrying about it before she's even sick or showing signs of illness. She seems as healthy as ever, but I'm still twisting myself into an anxious meltdown. Anyone else in a situation even remotely close to this?   I can't seem to understand it.   I'm of the opinion that if you had lots of money, parenthood could be enjoyable. You'd only have to be there for the good parts. Don't want to get up in the night? Hire a nanny. Don't feel like cleaning poop off the wall? Nanny. Kid being a bastard? Call the nanny to take him away.  I'd be open to having kids if I could have a nanny. That way, I only have to see the kid when I want to.   Is it 40/1 divided by 8/5, or 40/8 divided by 5/1?  http://imgur.com/a9SHDZz                  He's pink, I'm brown.  http://i43.tinypic.com/5oflgp.jpg  http://i40.tinypic.com/rlkxfs.jpg  http://i41.tinypic.com/2ryh575.jpg  (Beginning here I accidentally switched the colors. He's brown, I'm pink)  http://i39.tinypic.com/24y0ql4.jpg  He then said, "If you want socialist medicine, get out of this country." I mentioned the USA already had some socialism with the roads, police, schools, libraries, etc. His response? That's not socialism, since not everyone pays in. The best part is when he agreed with the distinction of socialism and communism I put up, but it was still wrong somehow. And of course, how Sweden no longer has socialized healthcare.  What's even better is that another person who claimed to be pro-life chimed, and was okay with people with pre-existing conditions not getting healthcare because it'll drive up HIS costs. I guess it's true what they say. Pro-life until birth. After that, screw you.  I only got half the conversation because I copied it for my friend to laugh at, but decided you guys might appreciate it.   A few weeks ago I had a colposcopy. If you don't know what they is, they take a chunk out of your cervix with this bastard: http://www.wemed1.com/catalog/ob-tis.jpg  Predictably, it hurt like hell. They don't numb the area at all, they just take a chunk out. This is to test for cancer cells after an abnormal pap smear. After this was done I felt like I had to vomit and actually dry heaved a little. I had never felt my stomach react to pain like this before. I got very pale and the doctor made me lie down for awhile. As I was expecting, a few days later they said I needed some of my cervix removed using LEEP. http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/loop-electrosurgical-excision-procedure-leep-for-abnormal-cervical-cell-changes  They basically take a hot wire and slice through your cervix with it. After the terrible colposcopy I was understandably worried about the pain. The doc said, "Oh, don't worry, we use a local anesthetic. Now, even though part of your cervix is gone, you'll still be able to have children. Preterm labor might be an issue, but-"   I interrupted, "I know you use an anesthetic, but I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder, and after the miserable experience with the colposcopy, I am a nervous wreck knowing this is coming up. I'm even nervous about the anesthetic injection. Can you sedate me somehow?"   She answered, "We can get you a Valium. Luckily, you don't need all your cervix for pregnancy and childbirth, so removing some of it won't hurt too much in that category."  I wanted to talk about the second colposcopy that you need a couple months after LEEP to check up on everything, and whether that would be more or less painful since the cervix has already gone through some trauma. She gave short answers on that, but kept going on about how pregnancy and childbirth would still be possible.  Here's what annoyed me: Couldn't she see I was way more interested in the level of pain I had to expect, and how I needed some sort of sedation, even mild to calm me down during? I wasn't asking questions at all about pregnancy or birth, but that's what she kept going back to. I understand that might be what most women want to know, and that's fine, the doctor should discuss that with them, but that isn't what I needed info about.   The kicker is that I am not even fully childfree. I am open to having a kid someday (just one), but the pain and anxiety facing me was much more immediate and real than childbirth complications.      I can't decide between these:  1) The feeling of dread simply living can give you. Remember that feeling in your stomach you'd get as a kid when you know tomorrow you'd have to go to the doctor and get a shot? Sometimes I get that feeling just knowing I have things to do the next day.  2) Rumination. Living through a bad experience once is quite enough, I don't need to think about it years after the fact.  3) Maybe this is more anxiety, but I can't handle things. Something that would only give most people mere annoyance for a couple days will turn me into a hyperventilating mess. Inconveniencing others will make me feel so guilty I'm sorry I exist.      I knew already he was pro-circ, but I still considered myself a fan because I think he's funny and I agree with him on a lot of things, especially religion and politics.  But on his show tonight, Real Time With Bill Maher, he interviewed Billy Crystal and the topic of circumcision came up. Bill said things like, "Aren't you glad you're circumcised? Foreskins are so ugly, they ruin porn."   I am honestly not sure if I can continue being a fan or not. I've sent him a polite Twitter explaining that he should educate himself on the matter, but I am not naive, I know he isn't likely to read it. I just hope enough of his fans can write and maybe he'll take notice. He prides himself on being pro-science, maybe he'll change his mind with evidence. But I sort of doubt it. He's kind of an ass, I acknowledged he was an ass when I was a big fan. Then again, he does say the USA should be more like Scandinavia, and Scandinavia is having a lot of pushes to ban RIC. He could notice.  Anyway, if you're a fan, write him.   My boyfriend mentioned this happening twice in his life (that he's noticed) during an especially big BM. Is this kind of thing common?   I know this is a common question, but there's always so popular and I love reading new ones!      A store near my house has a donation box for clothes and shoes type things for the Special Olympics. I threw a bag of clothes into the back of my car and drove over there. After I tossed the clothes in a saw a blanket sort of wadded up in my trunk and decided to throw that in too.  After I got home mom informed me she laid that blanket out in the back of my car to transport a goat to the fair. Afterwards she wadded it up and threw it in the trunk to deal with later.  I hope they don't think someone did that on purpose to be an asshole.   * I'm sure we've all seen it on shows like America's Funniest Home Videos. Someone videotapes their kid attempting to pour milk or juice into a cup on the floor and they end up dumping it everywhere. I've never found it funny in the slightest. If you've grown up poor you know how expensive milk and juice can be. Not to mention having to clean that up, but it's mostly the expense that bothers me. I've always been annoyed by people who waste expensive things like that.   He supposedly had an extra face on the back of his head, which could neither eat nor speak, although it could laugh and cry. Edward begged doctors to have his "demon face" removed, because, supposedly, it whispered demonic words to him at night, but no doctor would attempt it. He committed suicide when he was 23.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Mordake  Apparently there is no real record of this guy existing, but I wonder if JK Rowling got her idea from this.   I'm not in a situation, just curious.      In 2009-2010 I tried going to school to become a nurse aide/patient care technician/phlebotomist. I've never really had an interest in any of that but I was being pressured into going to school. It was a disaster. I was successful at becoming a nurse aide, but I hated every part of it. The rest? It was miserable. I felt like no matter how hard I studied I couldn't grasp it and forget actually sticking people with needles. I could do it when my aunt (a nurse) showed me, but in front of the teachers? One issue was that I knew one teacher had no confidence in me, so that made it worse. Well, I dropped out because I was failing anyway. But that's not what's bothered me for 3 years. Yeah, I failed college, but a lot of people do that. The hard part was that I just wasted thousands of dollars of my parents' money. They might think I'm ungrateful, but I spent 3 years being unable to look at my books because I felt so guilty, and they made me feel so unintelligent. They sat under my bed but even knowing they were there bothered me.  Well, I threw away my workbooks and the textbooks I have in my car to take to Goodwill tomorrow. I doubt they'd be assigned now, but they'd make good reference books for someone. The fact that I basically threw thousands of my parents dollars out of the window will always bother me, but at least I feel like I can move on now, especially since I'm attempting college again this fall, and this time, it's something I actually have some interest in. And I'm paying for it. Even if I fail again, at least the financial burden will be on me.       http://24.media.tumblr.com/a530f210b1949b342d7d560bd6c5aa14/tumblr_mrjg5yKTiE1ryeto5o1_500.png  That's the best part.   -You know you get your money's worth at a buffet.  -You stay warm in the winter.  -You're more difficult to kidnap.  -You get to take disability carts from people who are actually disabled. (I saw this happen once)     First, please understand that I started out on the "Zimmerman is guilty" bandwagon, but now I don't think I'll ever have enough knowledge of what happened to have an opinion on whether or not GZ should be in jail. But even when I was 100% on TM's side, I thought calling him a child was a stretch. Yes, I understand that he was legally a child, but he was physically an adult and a match for GZ. I feel like people who say GZ "killed a child" only want to make it sound like he allegedly stalked and shot a 10-year-old.      http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1jtfzx/usharou_explains_why_a_mens_rights_movement_is/  Someone types up a few paragraphs about where they think sexism came from and why MRAs aren't necessarily opposed to feminism. Okay, you can read that and agree or disagree, but the SJA I found in the replies is entertaining. The name is putitintheface...  -Someone says MRAs aren't worth it and neither is the quote. Okay, fine. But then we have...  No it didn't. It's a load of biotruths bullshit that ignores reality in favor of painting a picture that reflects ridiculous beliefs.  Biotruths! I knew this would be fun right away. How dare you say men and women are biologically different! I wish these SJAs would understand what a biotruth really is. A biotruth is this: Women were mostly mothers in the past, and they're made to give birth, so all women should be mothers now because that's all they're designed for!   Know what isn't a biotruth? Explaining how sexism came to force women to be homemakers because that's what women generally did, so society figured it worked and didn't let women do much else.  Then this:  I've been involved in this debate long enough to know that it's bullshit. It's not my job to educate every frothing moron who stumbles onto the internet.  Not my job to educate you, shitlord! I don't come to the internet to discuss things!  Then someone said this:  So you can't defend your position? Noted.  The SJA response?  I don't need to; my position is like a fucking bunker. It's fortified. There are tanks all around it. At the center, buried deep, there is reality, preciously providing all the information necessary, being examined and re-examined by clever people to make sense of it.  "I don't have to defend my position because I'm right! Stop making me debate, I don't like it!"  It was awesome.      So you don't get the "exceeds daily budget" crap?   I've shown goats at the county fair for several years now, and I always bring the babies that will go on sale in a few weeks to see if I can draw some early interest.   The first year I didn't have any babies to sell, but I saw parents picking up the kids (meaning baby goats) of other stalls and actually letting their children hold them. What would make someone think it's okay to pick up an animal that's not yours out of a stall and let your child that is way too young to hold a kicking baby goat handle them? I even saw many kids **drop** the goats. Luckily I didn't see any injuries but goats lets are fragile and can break easily within the first few months.   The second year I put up a sign. It was my first year having babies there and knew what to expect. The sign said: *Petting is okay, but do not pick up the goats!* Guess what? Parents completely disregarded the sign and lifted the goats right out of the stalls.   The third year, my sign said: *Do not touch the animals!* Again, parents didn't listen. Their precious toddlers wanted to handle the babies, and that's all that mattered, I guess.   The next year, I brought dog cages with me and put the goats into the cages, then put the cages into the stalls. I almost expected parents to open the dog cages, but they surprisingly didn't. It's ridiculous that I'd have to go that far.   It didn't only happen in the goat barn. I saw children running behind draft horses (and a kick from one of those hooves can easily kill someone), kids pulling the tails of pigs, etc and their parents either not caring or telling them to stop only once, but not doing anything when the kid did it again.   I understand the game's in alpha and this could be fixed, but it really annoys me. I can tell my workers what I want done, then have to wait 10+ minutes for them to finish building. It's even worse when your prison is finished and you're just watching everyone go about their day. It can take an hour just to go through one day. I know there's a speed up option, but I could swear it doesn't make them go any faster.               http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1hh3hs/would_i_give_a_woman_who_just_hit_me_a_good/  It's like they can't tell the difference between "I'll hit anyone back who hits me, even a woman," and "I love hitting bitches! All women deserve to be hit because I'm a man!"   I recently took a temporary job at a trap shooting competition. About 1/3 of the people hired are obese. It isn't easy work. There's a lot of walking between sites in the hot sun, picking up shotgun shells, moving trap sets as well as packing them up and unfolding them again, plus a lot more. It isn't unusual to have 12 hour shifts. I started getting a little irritated when I saw most of the fat people start complaining about how their legs hurt and how they had to sit down for a minute. It always left the skinny people doing most of the work while the fat people sat around the benches and talked about how hot it was and how much they hurt.   Today I nearly reached the end of my self control when the obese girl I was working with announced her legs hurt and she had to go home. They agreed she could go home. This left me with all her work as well as my own and I snapped at her, "My legs hurt too, but I'm not going home."   She shrugged and said, "You're skinny though. It isn't as hard for you to walk around in the hot sun and move around on sore legs."  I retorted, "Well, if it's really hard for you to work because of your size, maybe you shouldn't take a job where you have to get up off your ass once in awhile."  She teared up and left. I feel a bit bad, but damn it, I'm not being paid extra to do the work of two people.   I've seen it. I'm sure you have too. Among all the celebrating good fathers, there's the few people or posters who want to ruin it with things like: This is fathers day! All you deadbeats out there better hop to it!  Do we see this sort of thing on mother's day? Do we draw attention to women who abandon their kids? No. We thank the mother figures in our lives for all they do. The father figures do just as much and don't deserve to have their day used in this way.          http://www.tumblr.com/blog/feminismisaboutwomen  It could be satire or a poe, but either way it's hilarious.   My boyfriend's house has been having plumbing problems. The toilets tend to back up and won't flush. The water does go down within a few hours, so I got my boyfriend's okay to use the toilet. He said as long as there was just one flush it should go down.  So I go in there and empty my menstrual cup (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cup) into the toilet, like you're supposed to do. I flush. The toilet fills up with water. The blood is still in there, looking gross. I tell my bf, but he says to just shut the lid and it would go down in a couple hours. But what we didn't know is that his dad had called a plumber, who appeared less than 20 minutes later. The plumber checks all the toilets, including the one I had just used. It was still filled with water and period blood.  It was obvious whose it was, too since my bf's mom is post-menopausal. I'll never be able to look his dad in the eye again.   Nothing makes me stop listening to someone's political argument faster than this, maybe besides defending it with religion. Can't have gay marriage, I might have to explain to my kids what a gay person is. Can't have legal pot, someone might offer my kid a joint.   Why do the rest of us have to stop living because some people think their kids might lose some innocence?    http://lybio.net/tag/garfunkel-and-oates-the-college-try-lyrics/  The lyrics are there if you don't feel like watching the video. It's about a "modern heteroflexible" woman who thinks she's bisexual until there's a vagina in her face.     Two years ago I was working as a waitress. One of the other waitresses went to the bathroom, so I said I'd take the food to her tables when they came up. One tray came up, so I took it to a table with a woman and a little girl. I put their food down, and the girl said, "Thank you."  Before I could reply, the woman says, "Honey, you don't have to thank her, that's her job."  I've seen plenty of parents remind their kids to be gracious, but I'd never seen this before. I bet the kid doesn't say thank you to anyone now thanks to her mom.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/07/coverflip-maureen-johnson_n_3231935.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular  Men being afraid to read "girly looking books" is pretty stupid, yes, but some of these books would have no reason to look the opposite way. They wouldn't work. Here are just the ones I read:  Game of Thrones - This one works, actually. It's ugly, but it works.  Stardust - This one works as well.  A Clockwork Orange - Why the hell would this cover have a woman on it? I know they're pretending the revised titles were written by the opposite sex, but they don't give any indication that the story's changed. ACO is about a sociopathic man.  Carrie - A girl is viciously bullied and gets blood dumped on her at prom. Why would she be smiling and happy on the cover?  Shutter Island - Yep, a book cover with a peaceful island view is what I imagined for a mystery novel about mental patient abuse.  Lord of the Flies - This makes the least about of sense. A bunch of children stranded on an island turn into anarchy. We need a picture of hands with a smiling pig thing.       In 1989 my mother worked at a pet store. She was 25 years old, and I was only months old. While my parents worked my grandparents watched me. Well, one day my mom was cleaning out cages when this middle aged man walked over to her and asked how she was. The questions started out general but got more and more personal. Mom was busy but didn't want to be rude so she just gave short and vague answers.   Eventually the man bent down and whispered to her, "You aren't being very friendly to your customers. I know you have a baby, maybe if something happened to her you wouldn't be so standoffish to your customers."  With this, the man got up and left. The manager found my mother so shaken and upset and after he learned what happened, he insisted on calling the police. Nothing ever came of it, and mom couldn't recall having seen the man anywhere before. She never had me at the pet store at the time so he couldn't have seen me there. He also knew I was a girl, so that's an extra bit of info he knew as well.   Mom only worked at the store a few days after that, she quit and found another because she didn't feel safe with him knowing where she worked. Apparently for quite a while after the incident, my grandpa kept his rifle within grabbing distance when baby-sitting.   One stereotype of a depressed person is the ability to write, draw, paint, etc with talent. Anyone else here not like that at all?  I can't draw a straight line. Paint ends up everywhere but on the easel, and I have no imagination for writing anything. Now, I can sort of write. I've kept a fictional diary for almost 8 years now. I always did okay with reports in English class and things like that. But I have no imagination in which to improve my average writing skills. While I read Harry Potter, all I can think of is, "Good lord, how did this woman think this up?"       We've all heard of people who won't take no for an answer when trying to get you to hold their baby, but apparently the opposite is true also.   I was on peopleofwalmart.com (yep, don't judge) and one picture was a baby in a carriage. The carriage had a sign hanging on it that said "Please don't touch the baby." In the comments someone explained hospitals usually give signs like these to parents with preemies because their immune systems can't take a lot of fight yet.   From the other comments I gathered it was common for people in public to come right up and touch and even *pick up* other peoples' babies without permission. I just...what? I wouldn't touch someone's baby if it fell out of the womb and rolled over to my feet.   Just another reason to not have kids. I don't like people bothering me in public to begin with, and if one of them tried to touch a child of mine, I'd be going to jail for breaking their fingers. Having a kid doesn't mean you don't like shopping in peace.     I'm a little ashamed to say animal abuse bothers me a lot more than anything that happens to people. It's not that violence against people doesn't bother me, it does, but I can't even stand to read about instances of animal abuse because I feel physically sick. Forget actual video of it. If I see a video of something happening to a person, I'm only bothered for a few minutes afterward. I saw a video of animals being skinned alive for fur coats, and I felt sick for literally a week.   	126
 I'm an introvert. People usually meet me in social settings so they think I'm a huge extravert. I can turn on my extraversion when need be, but I'm a huge introvert. I could stay by myself for hours.    Managing Emotions   Managing Emotions   If people ever had the chance to spend two hours wondering whether or not they can leave the house without setting it on fire, I guarantee they would never say things like this again.    Two of my really close friends are gay and I view them no differently. We talk about everything. Women, sex, man stuff, you name it. Sexual orientation is irrelevant to friendships.     I understand where you are coming from. Although my OCD does distract me at work, I have always been able to complete my work; therefore, I would not want OCD to be a reason for someone to fire me.    Is this a question or a general statement?   I was applying for a job recently. As I was filling out the application, I noticed a section where they asked if I had any disabilities. OCD was counted as a disability. Have you ever had to count OCD as a disability?     There will be pain that even those who love you most cannot rescue you from; you are all you have.    When you love someone, you don't treat them bad.   My long term ex girlfriend and I were young when we fell in love, however, our love was real. Eventually, she stopped treating me with respect. I was blind in love, therefore, I didn't see how bad things had become. She did, though. She broke up with me and told me this: "You try to see the best in everyone to the point where you can't recognize when something is bad for you or when someone is hurting you". Although it hurt at the time, she was right. When you love someone, you don't treat them bad; simple as that.    Yes and it's really annoying. I normally can wear slim fit pants except they are tight in the thigh   My best friend lived right across the street from me   I stayed because I started to defend her behavior. I would say things such as "she is just having a bad day", "she had a rough childhood", "yes, right now it sucks but I probably did something to make her mad", "I made her treat me this way". However, I realized that I would say things like those statements because she had been emotionally abusing me; she conditioned me into believing I was the problem.    I can definitely relate to this    When people talk in a whiny voice   Nike Elite socks are literally the best socks I have ever owned   Is your name Bruce Wayne?    I feel as if I'm the only person who I can trust at the end of the day    I tend to be attracted to women who are similar to my mother    I've met too many girls that play mind games and I'm tired of chasing after them.

Have your ever thought about going to see the university counselor?    Coldplay, Lana Del Rey, Paramore   One of my favorite artists    That's actually a really good song   Yes, Christianity    22   See You Soon is so so so good.    *Parachutes: Sparks.

I do this every time I find myself in this situation   The last time I cried was six years ago. The only times I remember bawling occured when I was a child but I was shamed out of those.    First of all, commend yourself for at least fighting to stay in college. I'm in grad school right now and I have OCD   Depression; therefore, I understand where you are coming from. Have you thought about seeing the university counselor?    It does take a lot of courage to talk to your therapist about them. You are not alone in that; i still struggle with talking to them because of embarrassment and shame.    Mine started when I was 17 and it was definitely out of thin air. I definitely had struggled with anxiety as a child, but one day my anxiety transformed into full blown OCD   I actually wrote my OCD story and it is focused on scrupulosity. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about it  [My OCD Story] (http://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/2leh5b/my_ocd_story_a_journey_into_scrupulosity/)    Head and Shoulders, I don't go through bottles that quickly though; however, I do take good care of my hair.    I know exactly how you feel man. It's a shame how people are ridiculed for being single. I can be an independent, heterosexual man and still be happily single   Baby powder does wonders   I'm sorry to hear that. What is your religion?    I think it depends on the denomination    What do you mean, a majority view?    I have seen plenty without them   I have these two and they are definitely some favorites   I was at a party during college. I was standing face to face with a friend holding a conversation and a girl who I did not know reaches down my pants and starts making her way down my underwear. I did not know the girl and I had a girlfriend at the time, therefore, the attention was unwanted. I definitely found it offensive. When I turned around, I gave her a confused look. She and the rest of her friends proceeded to kick me out of the party. I think people can forget that women can sexually harass men. If it had been the other way around, I could have gone to jail.    Out of 23 years, I have not. There have been plenty of situations when I have been close to fighting.    I'm truly sorry    When I'm having a bad OCD day, my obsessions take over my thoughts; therefore, I can hardly pay attention to anything else. I know the feeling and it's rough    My life in a text post.    Why did you have to clean a public bathroom as a child?   Yikes   happens to me all of the time   Best friends hold each other's poops    so what do you do if you will be out for awhile, hold it all day?   	54
 Adventure time :)   I would go back but it's so expensive. It's almost a day's wages for an hour session of just taking to someone who doesn't talk back to me.    I bought a drawing software for my tablet recently and I've been kinda...doodling haha.  	2
 The best thing to do is foster in them some love for a subject. If they love it, they'll pursue it. You can help by making that love stronger as they grow up. I would suggest introducing them to science and technology, by introducing them to fun science videos on Youtube (ASAPscience, It's Okay To Be Smart, VSauce, etc.) - my 9 year old nephew is hooked on them. Send them lego model sets of spacecrafts, tell their parents to take them to science museums, tell them on the phone about cool things that are happening in science in layman's terms... they really get a kid interested.   I wouldn't. I'd kill myself. A world war with the technology we have will most likely annihilate the human race - international biological warfare and nuclear warfare is enough to quickly weaken and destroy entire nations. During the war, all the knowledge we've come to know will be lost, and all scientific discovery will be geared towards the war effort. I don't see the point in living through it. Then again, some people might just survive in the aftermath - but it will take centuries to recover to present day conditions once more.  	2
 im assuming Triss-k-eye-deck-ah-phobia      [Welp](http://i.imgur.com/OtYFegV.jpg)   (Disclaimer: I'm black.)  My Alien Pet :: Name :: Jerome (pronounced Jay-Roh-May)  My pet is the Realest nigga alive, and non-humans ain't even considered niggas, but that's what makes Jerome unique. You see in 1993, Jerome landed on a planet called Kintekai, it was the land of Fried Chicken! Jerome lived there for 21 years. On November 4th 2014, Jerome appeared in my room, he was tall, muscular, looked like a human, and had real nigga traits, he had a high top fade, 8 pack natural abs, and he would sweat grape drink, not grape juice, grape drink. Anyways, Jerome didn't introduce himself to me like a normal alien (e.g. "I come in peace."), instead he(at least I'm assuming it a he, due to his name and appearance), introduced himself like this: "Yo Dawg, is you Timothy?" To which I responded..."Yes, but my parents are asleep please keep it down", he then proceeded to say: "Nah, nigga, don't worry b, only you can hear me, infact, you can respond to me, using your thots, I mean thoughts, I was sent from the planet Kintekai, to be your pet, but I don't play dat homo sh** mayne, no offensive to gays, but by pet, I don't mean no intimate stuff, iight my nigga?"...I said "lol...alright"(yes I actually said 'LOL') then we played some 2k, and then I checked reddit and saw this...so yeah.   In elementary school (kindergarten to grade6) kids would sing [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVPzYbGFQw)         Oh alright, thanks.      Well maybe a SG/SF, that can play SF this year then move to SG when PG13 is back.         Lance was amazing, i do miss him, atleast he's the same old Lance we all love :D http://i.imgur.com/rQgd6wg.gif   9+10= ~~21~~ 19   what is this thing im seeing in some people's posts(on /r/FreeKarma) about reading capchas or however you spell it?   trade Scola for a decent SF maybe?   I love that we still cover news on Lance, He's a Pacer for Life!! #PacersNation hopefully he comes back after his contract is up.            I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle. As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson).  But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf. But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season.   I'm a Pacers fan, and I understand how you guys feel **completely** Just like how Paul George has MVP potential. I believe Julius Randle has the potential to not only be a perennial all star, but the face of the Lakers franchise down the road. Competitiveness aside, I wish you guys the best on your season. :)      isnt Hill, West, George, Mahinmi, Stuckey, and Watson injured and like Rudez cant shoot, and SoloHill isnt really scoring?  Hibbert's doing well, some games are weak on the boards, but he's looking good.   yea, Lance only hates Evan Turner.    George Hill Knee Contusion   I'd be satisfied if Hibbert just completely forgot about offense, and put up Ben Wallace numbers:  2005-06 B.Wallace: 7.3ppg 11.3rpg 2.2bpg (Roy might average more blocks though.)      i still say its worth it, im just pissed off with that fact that i cant use VC on MyCAREER cuz it doesnt connect to 2K Sports server, so idk if i can play crews or myplayer blacktop anymore.  it doesnt say i cant play it, it just says offline MyCAREER means using Skill points instead of VC..  i hope i can still play blacktop online or crews if i ever find people to make one   its okay, i mean, its worth it, if the server work for you.    update just lost 80-54 KD had 40 pts 18-18fg    (i own a ps3 copy of the game)  only graphic changes are Nick Young's hair, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler have mini afros, and Chandler Parsons looks real for once, they still haven't given Steve Nash the hair he's had for so long now, since he joined LA (2k13).  and the 2k sports servers are retarded. every time it autosaves its supposedly "retrieving your files from the 2k Sports Server" for like 50 seconds  and when i create a MyCAREER, it says im unable to connect to the 2k Sports Server so i either play offline MyCAREER or get sent back to the main screen with KD on it.   Then when i go to load the MyCAREER, instead of letting me go to edit my player/play game/look at my player, it sends me back to play the **Rookie Showcase**  When looking for a match online the game stays at  **HEAD-TO-HEAD** **Searching for matches...** until you cancel it.  2K Heroes mode also doesnt work because...you cant match up with anyone to play online.  MyTEAM is undergoing maintenance. Wait...hold on, im trying right now it'll be a while since its **RETRIEVING DATA OF WHATEVER FOR 3 HOURS**  *takes chill pill*  alright, im making a team, since i cant make a MyCAREER....actually maybe i'll check out MyCAREER and see if it works, now that MyTEAM works. i named myTEAM the Toronto Lynxes...cuz apparently the "Lynx" is native to toronto, or something like that.  My starting lineup is Canaan, Rivers, Joe Harris, Jeremy Evans, and Sims  OH look i can play someone .__. so whats wrong wi- **HOLY SILVER PLAYERS**, Kevin Durant. omg, k well, im about to lose cya :D   No, by "Final Chapter" i mean, the last few years, his last run at success in the NBA, and stuff like that.     	34
 To be fair, it is pretty subjective, depends on what kinds of games OP likes.  	1
 Thanks :)  4 hours and it will be three days late. Still no sign.  Tmi I know but I'm so constipated and my breast feel like they are going to burst with pain. At this point I just want to get my period so I can get on with it.    Thank you so much, just hearing that someone can see how much we care and you saying to try and not fight. I don't know why but it just kinda helps.   Fighting always seems so trivial and silly afterwards I never understand why we even argue in the first place :(   Thank you for your opinion. Which you're entitled too. I'll take it on board.    We are trying because we may not even have a chance, it was the cancer scare and being told we may not be able to ever have children that started all of these issues off.    Writing down my thoughts down does help sometimes because I can take my time.   Talking I get tongue tied and almost stutter now, and then I get angry at myself and start shouting and getting frustrated.   I'm very good at articulating myself, it's like I've everything in me and who I am over the last 2-4 months. I'm not sure when or how long ago it started    Well that's it, when I'm upset I can go to my friends and they listen and want to know why I'm feeling a certain way. They know how much I love him and so they just listen and are there for me. They don't push their opinions.   I'm not sure who he has to talk to, we both have his mum but he's so adamant nothing is wrong he just keeps saying 'I'm happy if you're happy'   He's also a gamer and he's started playing a lot more games, to escape I think? He's always gamed a lot but it's a LOT more recently.   I don't want him to be strong and silent and my hero, but if that's how he's not feeling really. I want to know if he's stressed or sad. Even if it's me that is causing it, how would I know if he doesn't tell me? He wants to fix everything for me, make me feel better, not give me any stress and not make me feel bad. Why would he think I don't want to do the same for him?    That isn't what I said or meant. He isn't venting or talking it through he's asking this person to make decisions for him and to answer for him.   He's trying to act like the strong silent hero and fix everything and make everything better. Any time I ask if he's struggling or needs help he says no   I have no idea what's going on. He's telling me nothing is wrong but I know something is wrong because I know him. Then he's going to this guy for advise or help.   A relationship is based on communication.   And yes, I am trying to get help. I can't take any medication because we are trying to conceive and I wouldn't take anything anyway.   I was put on a waiting for counselling which was a 3 month wait list, and my first session is in five days. I've also taken some time off work to try and relax and de-stress   It's not that he was talking to him, I understand that completely. If he can't talk to me then he NEEDS to talk to someone else. This friend however is going straight to 'it's all hassle, women are hassle just break up' which doesn't help the situation.   I have counselling in five days, and I'm hoping that starts to help.   I want him to talk to me about everything but he's trying to be the strong but silent type. Isn't telling me if he's having troubles in work etc because he doesn't want to worry me, but I know SOMETHING is up anyway so I worry and stress and make up all sorts letting my mind wonder with what is going on and what he isn't telling me    I've known my boyfriend since we were 11 we went to the same high school.   I moved and moved to a different high school, I left home young, as soon as I could when I was 16 to a much older, controlling man. Got married at 19 and had the courage to leave him when I was 21 with the help of who I thought was my best friend but turned out to be one of the worst people.   Whilst I was leaving my husband me and my current boyfriend got chatting, went for drinks. He told me he had always had a crush on me and always liked me. We ended up going home together.   I knew I didn't want a relationship but I REALLY liked him, he was the first person I had had ever, properly had a crush on and he didnt want one because he had just come out of one as well  Anyway, things went tits up and we fucked each other around for about a year. Sleeping with each other but fighting and bitching about each other when we weren't doing that  Four years pass and in that time I have a relationship with an abusive sociopath, I get the courage to leave him and  have no interest in relationship or men or anything.....until we start talking again   Things are AMAZING this time though, we fall in love and everything is perfect.   Then his housemate moves out, and mine moves to Australia....everyone wants to know why we aren't moving in with each other? He wants to know why we aren't. We have only been together four months though   But we do, we move into what we think is the perfect place. Then we have the landlord from hell, no heating for months in winter, broken cooker and shower on and off. Insane damp in the bedroom that covers everything in a small layer of water   I get a new CRAZY busy job with loads of pressure and my boyfriend starts having struggles at work   He have money problems   We go through a breast cancer scare with a biopsy and tests and scans (yay no cancer!)   We get told me might have trouble Conceiving so (and probably stupidly) we stop using protection. Except now I'm worrying about conceiving. Whilst all our friends get pregnant around us I'm worried about being broken. I would love a family with this man. I've never wanted one before but the thought of a family with him fills me with this pure feeling of just warmth and happiness. So why am I the not who's not conceiving?   Anyway, so much happened I just kind of snapped. I started having panic attacks, chest palpitations, scratching my face and pulling bits of hair out, I developed ibs, I cry several time a day, I get headaches every day.   I just kind of broke, and everything came out. How I'm struggling and suffering with anxiety and stress and depression.   We agreed that I needed more help around the house and sometimes to just be taken easy and fragile with everything   But the opposite has happened  Our relationship break down isn't a victim of circumstances like cheating, it's neglect.   I don't think he can handle everything either but he's trying to be the strong one, the man, the hero and no matter how much I tell him I don't want or need that I just need HIM he's still trying to be strong.    When I do try and talk I'm so anxious it all comes out in jumbles and shouts and then I get more anxious and start scratching my face and shaking and having panic attacks. We antagonise each other and it gets so out of hand. We usually only stop when I'm crippled with chest pain having a panic attack  It's like he's shut down, he's not the same him since I broke down, he's not here, he's different and distant.   So this morning when I got up early because I was ill, when I went online his Facebook was still open  And I just couldn't help myself. I looked, and he's been talking to a friend about everything, communicating with him, telling him how he feels and getting advise from him. Even copying messages from me and asking him to help reply   Why is he talking to someone else and not me?   What can I do?   I love him so much, he's my person and I don't ever want to live without him. Everything before him just seems rubbish and wrong  But I'm watching our relationship ruin day by day as we argue and shout and I'm finding it harder a harder to deal with everything.   I've even debated killing myself   I just don't know what to do anymore   I just want us to be okay again. I want us to be US because it's just me, missing him.      I wax my eyebrows, I just buy the large wax strips for legs and then cut them to size with scissors.   I tried microwaveable ones and eyebrow ones and all sorts and this just works best for me and works out a lot cheaper as well!    I would say maybe clean the tops up a bit and they would be great. You already have a fab shape and they really suit your face. Very jealous of your brows!    I got the naked2 for Christmas, I had been viewing blogs and YouTube videos for months and couldn't decide between 1   2   What made me want two more was the hard wearing tin case over the velvet one and the colours were more 'my' colour   If also put off buying t because t coat so much, but would happily spend 16 on a mac eyeshadow.   I'm glad I got it, now I want 1   3    I'm seeing her tomorrow, I've written everything down I want to ask her.   My spotting stopped Sunday but I feel like I'm going to get another period any second now.   I'm so scared something might be wrong :(   I'm hoping that seeing the female Doctor in two weeks, we'll get some more answers, or she will explain more to us, refer us. Anything to get anywhere other than we are  	14
 So in one second, you're telling me she freaked out because "she's seeing a Black guy for the first time", then in that same second, she s,miles because she realizes how silly it is to freak out because "she's seeing a Black guy for the first time", but you don't want to accept the fact she recognized this celebrity in one second.  Alright.   Also, stop being so stubborn. You 100% understand what I'm saying so I'm not going to repeat myself.    Who smiles while being staggered back in fear? By the way she is pulled away by the young man on her right.   Also, like I said in the previous comment, it takes seconds to recognize someone, even less time when this person has distinctive features. There are not many Blacks in Korea, and even fewer are celebrities.  Say a Yakuza was under that mask. It would not even take you a millisecond to recognize him because I'm pretty sure you don't know a thousands of them. Maybe not even one. If you see, say, a portion of their tattoo while they're removing the mask, your brain will automatically, without having *you* the conscious being think about it, list out everyone with that particular feature. Same with that lady. She sees Black skin, a certain height, a certain sense of style, maybe, a specific voice! How long does she need?    I have no social skills, obviously, and what I've learned from sociable people is that you must talk about something the other person can relate to. It never worked for me.   Here's a recent exemple. A physicist told me they saw a spacecraft lift off. I love astronomy! And so I responded by talking about space, and the person lost interest immediately.   Another one. Someone I know just had a baby and was talking about her new challenges as a mother. I love children! So I talked to her about some things I've learned about childcare, and the person lost interest immediately.  I learned I should never talk about myself too much (which is a problem), so in both cases, I never even used the pronoun "I". I would say things like, "Apparently, blablabla." instead of "I learned that blablabla." Still no conclusive results, and it happens all the time.  How do I improve this?  Thank you.      Please don't feel offended or anything of the sort, but how did you end up in a relationship? It's something I never understood with people who have little to no social skills. How do you do it? I'm struggling to have friends here!!   I don't think so. If you have very recognizable features, it would take less than a second to know you. There aren't thousands of Black celebrities in Korea. Also, if you look closely, she is smiling.   Lastly, Koreans don't live under rocks. They have seen black people before. I went to Korea thinking I would be getting a shitton of attention or I would have some elders feel uncomfortable but ... no. No one cared about my presence (except kids. Those outside the city centre were genuinely curious).    Yes and look at how much we know about North Korea. /s   I have social anxiety, so yes it happens to me all the time. Even though I don't care about 99% of people. In my life, I've wanted to be friends with two people, so I obviously went for the "I'm going to blow your mind and you're gonna want to be my friend by tomorrow" route. With the first person, it was at first successful because I was older, therefore automatically "cooler" (we were 12-13 when we started talking). The second person is very sociable so didn't mind talking to me at first. Obviously I messed up because I have no social skills, and therefore like you, conversations were forced and terrible.   Both people today completely ignore me, even when I try to talk to them.    Apparently this guy is really well known in Korea, so they were just shocked because of his popularity, and not because of his race. But then I read this somewhere. It was confirmed by someone actually living in Korea though.    I'm Black, originally from the West Indies. Parents don't have children because they want to, but because they see it as a life milestone. And once the child is born, said child's only "job" is to not piss off their parents (so good grades, no talking unless the parents feel like it, no bothering them unless you're in danger, basically stay in your lane at all times). I think it's common among Black people in general, though I don't really know how Africans deal with their youth.   One thing that surprised me when I immigrated to Canada was people having casual conversations with their toddlers, of all people. Toddlers like to repeat themselves, they're not clear, they talk a lot ... and "white" (I'd always compare myself to white people only) parents enjoyed that. In my country, people don't converse with their toddler unless they're extremely bored. It gets slightly better for kids after puberty.    Hey I'm from Canada too. Seriously if you sound angry and you tell them you're going to switch, they give you whatever you want just to either shut you up or keep you as a client. My mother has done it with Bell, Videotron, Koodo and Fido. We have unlimited internet for cheaper than it should be, her cellphone bill have been cancelled many times (mine once with Koodo), and back when we were with Bell, they offered us I think free internet. All this so my mother could shut up (when she's mad, she talks way too much).   I think there is a solid community here in Montreal. If you're familiar with the area, The West Island and CDN-NDG seems to have the most hispanic families. Most I met personally were Mexicans, but there are also many Peruvians, Venezuelans, and Colombians. I, like /u/jamaljabrone , was shocked to see a higher percentage in Manitoba but /u/hubertiolable explanation makes total sense.    I totally agree with you! I wouldn't just give gifts only on those days (I have dozens of crafts planned, but holiday themed ones always seemed more fun to me), I was just wondering if I could on those days at all. I guess I got used to North Americans' ways : )  I will be in Hannover.    Oh wow, I didn't know that. I know of a couple of Germans who completely HATE this holiday. I always thought it was because of the overflow of candy part. I din't know tricks were actually taken seriously in Germany. Maybe because it's relatively new? And people only know about it from TV (and in TV shows, there are tricks. Like in the Simpsons). I hope with time the tricks part will disappear. I understand how you might not like this day.   Oh wow, I didn't know that. I know of a couple of Germans who completely HATE this holiday. I always thought it was because of the overflow of candy part. I din't know tricks were actually taken seriously in Germany. Maybe because it's relatively new? And people only know about it from TV (and in TV shows, there are tricks. Like in the Simpsons). I hope with time the tricks part will disappear. I understand how you might not like this day.   No, they don't do anything nasty. Kids will brush it off and move on to the next house without even looking at you. This night is literally a hunt for candy. If you don't deliver, ok whatever. There are dozens of other houses.   The trick part doesn't really apply and it's been so long that no one knows why they say it. Even here in Canada, you'll hear people only say "Happy Halloween!" because trick or treat makes no sense, since there will be no tricks.    I totally agree, I just wanted themed crafts to do once in a while. I think culturally, Canadians (or North Americans) just "expect" something on certain holidays, but glad it's different in Germany. Thank you ! :)    I agree! I honestly don't know how it is in Germany, it's just that in Canada, people "expect" something from their children on special holidays. I guess it's different in Germany.  Thank you for the comment.    I will look into that. Thank you!    I'm not sure I'm understanding how trick or treating teaches extortion, but thanks for your input : )  * If you mean that "**trick** or treat" is the problem, it's really just words people say. In fact very few people know where it's from originally and what it meant. Kids here just see Halloween as an opportunity to get free candy. Nothing more.    Oh wow, that's good to know beforehand.   Thank you very much!    I will be a caregiver in Germany, and I want the child in question to do fun activities he would normally do in a nursery. However, I am from Canada. Any occasion or holiday is a good excuse to make a craft and give it to mom and dad. Since I'll start in early February, I was thinking about a Valentines' Day themed craft, but apparently that would be highly inappropriate since in Germany, it's considered an adult-only holiday (from what I read). Also Father's Day seems to be more of a "Men Day" there. Basically, I'm afraid of getting the child involved in holidays he should not celebrate, as it would be inappropriate.    So on which occasions do children gift crafts and things they made (at school/nursery) to their parents?   Thanks in advance : )   Thank you for your input!   I enjoy being alone, too (I'm over at my sister's house like I said, and I became a noctural creature; I sleep during the day and stay up all night. This way I'm almost always alone). However, don't you sometimes wish you had someone? Sometimes I do. I don't want it to be anyone. Like I wouldn't go on a meeting website and just be like "Impress me." In my existence so far, there have been only two people I truly wanted to be part of my life. All two walked away because of who I am.   I hope I never feel this need ever again.   I totally understand you. It's so difficult to live when not only do you not understand how you are, but others do not either. And it's YOUR responsibility to accommodate to them. As for friendships, are you out of college? People usually say it's easier to befriend people in college but it's not. It's easier to befriend people you see all the time in high school. I don't know how different it is/was for you, but my classes were the same people all year long, whatever the class. So it was easier to just have people get used to your odd behaviours, and the nicer ones will look past that. Maybe I was lucky because I was in an all-girl high school.   I am so sorry to hear about what you went through because of your asexuality, and also what your mother put you through. Is it possible for you to move away? I know it's super difficult to move out of your parents' house, but taking distance is so beneficial. Anything works: A study trip, finding a job, backpacking ... some very cheap alternatives are available too like becoming an English teacher overseas, or a nanny.   As for my culture, I am West Indian. Physical punishment is the only kind of parenting people know. I don't mean spanking. I mean full blown beatings with belts, wooden objects, shoes ... even the things you'd use to beat an animal like a horse, your parents can turn around and use it on you. When I immigrated to Canada at the age of 8, as soon as I learned that White people did not beat their kids (huge generalization, but at the age of 8 I was convinced only immigrants beat their kid), I was really looking forward to someone snitching on my mom so she could get punished. I didn't want her to go to prison, I just wanted her to change. Well, I was sooooo disappointed. People know that West Indians (among others) beat the crap out of their children, but they don't want to do anything about it because it's "culture". I was watching Dr Phil a year or so ago and there was this mother who admitted beating her child. She said it was culture, and Dr Phil said nothing about it. Months later, A woman says "My husband beats me with a wooden plank!" and she got two shows dedicated to her, everyone was crying for her, oh my god poor lady, yadiya. It's so upsetting, especially since our parents know they won't get punished. My mom always screamed, with zero ounce of fear in her eyes, to call the cops on her. She would take the phone, start dialling if she wanted to fuck me up, and just hand me the phone. It was my decision to actually call or not. I was so scared because I knew either way, I was going to be beaten up. It was a terrible thing. But hey, my mother has changed A LOT. She is not great objectively, but compared to who she was, she's Mother Theresa. I don't think she loves me. She's disappointed still, but she is civil enough to hide that hatred (though she doesn't do a good job at talking behind my back). I think what made her change was when she realized she had no control over me. It was done under extreme measures but she eventually got it.   Anyway sorry this was long.      I don't remember the exact word (since there is one), but basically it was intensive behavioural training. My last psychologist was a college therapist so everything took place in school. Started off mild. She would ask me to look people in the eye. I tried but I couldn't handle it. It took me 17 years to (barely) look my mother in the eyes so I don't know what she was expecting. Then she said, while walking, I needed to stop looking at my feet, rather look at people. I did this once, cried in panic, and never tried again. I do sometimes look up but I need to be outside with very few people around me, or lost. Then she tried teaching me about social clues and body language. I understood in theory but in practice I had no idea what was going on. I was convinced (still am) that people, or at least college kids, aren't as sociable as she made them seem. No, me looking up and smiling instead of playing on my phone will not encourage them to talk to me. Anyway why would I want them to talk to me?! Then she would invite me to events where I had no choice but to talk with people. Thank goodness all those events took place during one of my classes. In the end she just gave me this book written for autistic people on how "People don't understand you, therefore you must change your behaviour because it makes them feel so uncomfortable, they rather avoid you." or whatever the conclusion was. I was not convinced. I knew she was trying really hard but this wasn't going to work.   By the way, I'm from Canada so it's free, but my 3rd to last therapist was from private practice. Free therapists were too busy with a long waiting list (my parents wanted to "fix" me as soon as possible because they were preoccupied by my grades more than anything). And my high school nurse, like yours, didn't get it so I was not going to waste my time on her. I remember telling her I was sick of my mother beating me up and she was like "Well what do you want, it's culture!" Ugh. Never again.    That is interesting to know. I live in Canada and I could guarantee only non-white immigrants thought this way. My white friends always had cool parents who didn't expect much for their children but a lifetime of happiness, while all of us immigrants were publicly shamed whenever we didn't have good grades. And other immigrant parents would chime in and encourage that. "Oh, your kid had this grade? What is wrong with them?"   Then when it was time to go to college, I was one of maybe three immigrant kids from my senior class who did not choose science (be it health science, pure and applied science, whatever). My white friends are mostly doing things they enjoy like art.  As an immigrant kid, your parents literally raise you to feel guilty. They didn't cross the Atlantic on a boat for a mediocre child. They didn't walk cm away from a bomb on their way to the airport for Bs and Cs. They didn't forfeit their Masters and Doctorates for mediocre jobs for you to learn languages (quoting my parents, who have since then giving up on me – best feeling ever). In High School, we had a project where we needed to invent a monologue, and most immigrant kids were crying their eyes out because they decided to talk about school and how they must not have their parents feel like immigrating was a waste of time. Another friend of mine who's a 3rd generation immigrant also was given high standards, since literally every single member of her family on her mother's side are doctors, and she is expecting to be just that. Her grandpa didn't go through all of this to have poor descendants.   My biracial classmates and friends all had their white parent as the "chill one". The non-white parent always went ballistic on them for "not trying hard enough". I only know of one immigrant white kid (from France), and she is like all other white kids. I thought French people would be tougher but even my French teacher (immigrated from France less than two decades ago) was really chill with her child, despite being very strict with us.  So yeah. I always thought since we're not "in our country", we were given higher expectations. It never really goes away, until someone gets "white-washed". Apparently, I am white-washed, so if it means my kids will be happy and not forced to do things they do not enjoy, then heck yes, I am happy to be white-washed.    Hey thanks for mentioning Asperger's because it's yet another thing I have considered. Though my last therapist didn't try to give me a diagnosis, she did however talk about how similar I am to her autistic or Aspie patients. She even used the same technique she would use on someone who is autistic to "cure" my social anxiety and to get me out of my shell. My 3rd to last therapist was the one actually concluding that anxiety and depression are part of my personality and there is nothing that could be done, but back then I thought she was just being lazy after eating my money and staying silent through most sessions. Then my last therapist's failure to change anything in a year led her to believe nothing could be done (though she blamed it on herself and I hate myself to this day for making her feel this way. she was the nicest). It's comforting to find someone so similar.  Thank you for the reply!    Thank you for the comment!   It helps to know other people's opinion as well.    Thank you for the reply!   I understand a formal diagnosis is a billion times better than an informal one, but I must admit that formal ones have not always worked the best for me. It took me 3 years to get any type of diagnosis for depression and anxiety, simply because the psychiatrists I would see only had maybe 20 minutes to pose a diagnosis, and they did not see the symptoms they wanted. Only in informal situations I feel comfortable talking about problems I may have (like now). I got real diagnoses from psychologists I saw on a weekly basis only because they observed me. Not once have I enumerated my problems; they either saw it or understood it from whatever else I would say or do. Now, I unfortunately do not have the time to have someone following me since I will be moving out of my home country, and moving to a country with a language I do not speak well is not ideal for that type of diagnosis.  I think most importantly, I wanted a label. It validates my behaviour. I know I'm not ~~just~~ crazy or ridiculous. Maybe I will never meet someone in real life who will understand and accept my behaviour, but I know someone out there does, and it feels so good.    It was by an "off duty" doctor. He's my sister's husband, someone I don't know very well (sister and I have not lived together since 2002 and only saw each other three times since then) but still he's family, so I don't know how legitimate his diagnosis can be. I've been over at their house for three weeks now, and randomly today, he tells me that after that many days of observations, he knows what I am and what I like. He told me what I was (SPD) but not what I like .. which is odd.   Anyway. I do have almost all the symptoms people usually list. I'll use what is posted on the sidebar here: (skip if uninterested)   * Emotional coldness: Through High School I was known as the cold-hearted kid who did not care. But I think I do care sometimes. Maybe not as much as other people (For instance I want to convince myself that when I'm away from my dog, the one 'thing' I think I care a lot about, I miss him but I don't think I do).  * Limited capacity to express emotions: Yes. Related to the first one I guess.  * Consistent preference for solitary activities: Even when I'm around people, I would much rather do things on my own. It was a pain in high school and college because most P.E. courses were team sports.   * Very few close friends, and a lack of desire for such: I don't think I have friends. When asked, I always say my dog is my only friend as a joke. But I do mean it.   * Indifference to praise or criticism: Here's the one symptom I don't think I can agree with. I'm afraid of criticism, and praises make me uncomfortable. So I do care.   * Preoccupation with fantasy and introspection: All the way. I didn't know that could be a symptom of anything but ridiculousness, to be honest.   * Lack of desire for sexual experiences with another person: I consider myself asexual.   He also said what pushes him to think I have SPD is because I'm a loner. He's not the first doctor or "expert" to tell me that. And it's almost always the same phrase "No offense, but yeah you look like the biggest loner, it's why no one wants to approach you". I don't take offense in it to be honest.   However, I was also diagnosed with Depression and (Social) Anxiety in the past, and these two diagnoses made so much sense, I kind of lived my life under those labels. And now I may have a new one, and sister's husband is insisting on forgetting about the two previous ones.   Has anyone ever had a depression, social anxiety, and schizoid diagnosis?   Thank you.  To be honest I'm just happy to have found something that makes even more sense than just depression and social anxiety. The "lack of sexual desire" and "preoccupation with fantasy and introspection" are too accurate for me not to consider this personality disorder. It shouldn't be like this, but I love knowing I'm under a known label, and I'm not just that weird kid who seems to invent all of those unheard-of problems. It makes me feel less insane and more worthy.    I would but I really don't want to experience intense anxiety before going through what could be the most stressful moment in my life. Thanks for the suggestion though.   I have two weeks left in my country of residence before moving to Europe for at least 15 months. I want to ask my long-time crush out and just go for it. What's stopping me? Social anxiety. No matter the outcome, I would still go through a paralyzing panic attack that would last days, which would then lead me to regretting it.  So I guess I'm choosing big regrets over smaller regrets + a panic attack.   I hate myself.    No. They're not Muslim or not even in a Muslim country so they shouldn't have to obey to Muslim law. A Muslim can be offended though, the same way a Christian may be offended by the countless jokes about Jesus. But what happened in Paris is not, and never will be, justifiable.    I'm going to Germany and will be welcomed by a host family. I'm not the best at giving gifts, so I was wondering what is something I can give them that is inherently Canadian or Québécois? My go-to gift is usually maple syrup.   Any other suggestions? Thank you : )    She's even more grown up now. [This picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/travelingroths/15028192561/) is only 5 months old.   Same here. To this day, I do not know how rich or poor we really are. I could figure it out, but I don't want to know. I don't want to know if my mother was lying and we're way richer than she made it seem to the family, or if she was lying and we're way poorer than she made it seem to others (which would mean she's crippling under thousands of dollars worth of debt). She flaunts a richness we do not seem to have to her friends and strangers, yet tells the family sometimes she doesn't have money for groceries. Either way, I still feel like a burden, and since the age of 15, I started calculating all unnecessary cost she has spent on me, and my mind won't be at ease until this amount is fully reimbursed.    Well, looks like I'm going to start shaving or waxing all the time : ( I'm not one who thinks getting rid of hair certain places is necessary, but I really hate touching my chin and feeling the hair.  Thanks a lot for the comment! : )   Not yet. I'm thinking of going to see a doctor for that though. But like I said, I won't be able to see a doctor (for free) before April or May, so unfortunately it'll have to wait. But it's definitely on my list!    I read about it and I have all the symptoms! Well, I used to. What's odd is that after being hospitalized 10 or so months ago, my menstrual cycle became extremely regular, and the cramps were mostly gone. I don't know if it's random or if what I was given through IV caused it. Usually I'd have heavy bleeding and cramps for a week, now I get cramps for one or two days, and my bleeding goes from mild to moderate. But I have the other symptoms.   Whew, very strange. Getting an ultrasound isn't too much of a hassle. I'll get one if possible, and as soon as possible.   Thank you very much!    I think so too. I was just worried. I thought it was just in my genes since my grandmother has a couple of hair here and there ... and then mine started growing very quickly and started forming small patches. My grandmother hadn't shaved in years! I need to shave at least once a month (not confident enough to let it be). I kind of want to let it grow for three to six months and see if it keeps on growing longer and longer. If it does, I would go see a doctor then. But since it has a grow spurt around the time I'm about to have my period, I'm thinking it's definitely something like too much androgen. Which isn't that big of a deal?    It's not a full beard but I have two small patches of long (5cm) very dark hair. Plus the way it curls makes it visible from afar. I think it's very noticeable, especially since it's paired with acne. Like I told someone else, it grows really fast around the time I'm supposed to get my period (which is also when acne appears), it is why I bothered asking. I used to think it was normal but then that's not what Google and my relatives were saying haha    Thank you for your comment!  I actually started using an eyebrow shaver but I guess I'll try waxing instead.    I thought so too but the only person who has normalized it was a Sikh girl with a full-grown beard. But then everyone else is acting like it shouldn't happen, especially since I'm 18.    It's not a full grown beard, but it's definitely visible. It's pretty long and it grows very fast. I last "shaved" on December 18th (It was really long and I was going to visit people) and on December 1st, it started growing back. Now, it's life five or so centimetres long. I have two distinguishable patches.    I think it's related to my menstrual cycle. My chin is like massacred when I'm about to have my period. Acne + chin hair. It's annoying.    Thank you! Hopefully soon enough I will be able to get tested. I'm just wondering though, is it that bad? I never knew it was a serious problem. I thought it was like women with a little hair over their upper lip.    I am a girl. I thought it was more common than it seems to be to have chin hair (since many girls have a moustache). Looks like it's not.    So whenever I tell a family member I have hair growing on my chin, they scream "Already?!" I had no idea having them at my age was that big of a deal. And then I went on trusty google, and the results are dramatic, as always. Hyperthecosis (too much androgen) is the least dramatic of the bunch, so I think it must be that.  So I'm wondering, how many youngish people have chin hair, and should I be worried?   ** I will not be able to see a doctor for at least four months, unless obviously I go to an emergency room or I pay (and I'm not a big fan of paying for things I can get for free, unless there's an emergency).    Oh really? I was going to use it in hopes of acquiring hipster friends.    I'm sorry this is a bit off topic, but thank you for making me discover the word "quaint" as I've never seen or heard it before (English is not my first language). It looks like its definition (attractively unusual or old-fashioned).    One bathroom is fine, but stalls are already scary as they are for many reasons: hygiene (it's like people respect individual bathrooms more than stalls), fear of being heard,  fear of being seen, few of being violated in any way. Most of those fear are expressed by women. I went to an all girl secondary school which had a coed primary school (both schools were in the same building but we each had our own floors) and surprisingly, after puberty, I became self-conscious enough to flush while peeing, cough while unwrapping a pad or tampon, inspect the ceiling or the spacing between doors (if you see what I mean). That's with other women. With men, paranoia and anxiety would go through the roof!  I have no idea how or when girls are taught to behave this way in bathrooms, but it's sadly common.   Oh I see. Alright I'll go on walks and hope I have access to a piano! ^^   Unpopular opinion: I don't find this cringy. It's sad. She has either social anxiety, has been deceived many time before and just doesn't know how to respond to rejection, maybe a mix of both. Which suck. And then I'm reading the comments and looks like OP kept talking with her only because she was smoking hot ... It's pitiful.    I won't be in my own house so I don't think I'll be able to play games, but yes I'll walk around and be healthy and stuff. Maybe the person I'll be living with will have a piano, I can pick up a new hobby!   Hey may I ask you a random question? While learning German, my teacher (who has not lived in Germany in 30 years but does visit her small city from time to time) said that cafés in Germany are different from what we (North Americans) know. Here, a café is a place to drink coffee, but it's not its only purpose. You can go there with your laptop and use their wifi for as long as you wish, do homework, or just chill with people or alone. Is it the same in Germany/Hannover?  Thank you in advance! : )    Thank you. I was just very frustrated and meditation made it worse ("quieting" my mind just makes it louder). I was using Headspace. I'll try your website. Thanks again : )   How can you block off thoughts that your mind is creating? What stops the brain from thinking? Itself! But then if it does not want to cooperate, what do you do?   I don't understand how people have control over their brain so much, making it hard for me to believe it sometimes. Meditation is basically all about controlling your thoughts but then it's your brain who does that, and the brain only gives you the illusion of having control when in fact, it's the one creating you, and making you think those things ... Maybe most people are just lucky to have 'easy going' brains? Or does my brain have "too much control"?    I'm from Montreal and the only time we hear the national anthem is during a hockey game.    I am wondering the same thing! Actually, I'm curious to know what were the survival rate before we became "civilized". Because unfortunately, our species needs women to survive longer since we are born extremely premature (contrary to most animals being independent in a couple of hours or a couple of years, we're not ready before five, six or more years). Maybe the fact that we are very social animals has a lot to with it, and an abandoned child even then would most likely find another caregiver.   I'll look into that!    I hope this isn't too late, but I don't know about Au-pairing in the United States, as the other user stated, but I don't think you legally need to have experience when going to Europe, unless you're going through an agency. Obviously, a parent would never choose someone who never took care of children before, so babysitting is good. Also, try taking a CPR/First Aid class. It's always a plus.  Basically, it's up to you. It's for your own confort if you get as much experience as possible, and you'll get many more responses if you're experienced. Taking care of children is overwhelming, even when you know what you're doing. However when you have experience, you know how to go through it without completely losing it.   Good luck! : )   Good old tactic to get more clicks.    [Not really.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) Even in countries where the average women has more than two children, and even in very poor countries, life expectancy of a woman is higher than that of a man. [Here's why.](http://news.health.com/2014/10/13/why-do-women-live-longer-than-men/) (feel free to look for other sources) I'm pretty sure we evolved to have mothers who can survive pregnancy, childbirth and live long enough to take care of her progenitor until they're strong and independent enough. We would be a useless and long dead species if most women did not survive, since our babies are premature as fuck.    Do you attract much attention?    May I ask you what racial group is the most represented? I am also of a culture where people do not encourage their children to talk (they find it annoying) at all but I never saw a child getting help from it.    Hello!   I am from Montreal Canada, and I will be in Hannover for at least a year. Second time ever in Europe (first time was in Paris for a few days).   Usually people ask questions about pubs or the Hannover nightlife. As I am quite asocial, I was wondering, what are the best "Loner Places" or "Loner Activities" in Hannover? Anything goes, as long as you're not expected to talk to people.  Thank you!    Depression is not rare. Almost everyone will go through it at some point. Others go through it "all their life". We just don't hear about it enough because may non-depressed people ridicule it and blame the sufferers for not "trying hard enough" or whatever they say.    Nah I get you. I lack confidence and social skills. On the rare occasions I decided to go for it, I would sound like that. I think it's enough motivation to never try again.   Okay, let me put it this way.   70% of the population of *City A* is 5 and under. 65% of children 5 and under have *Deadly and Contagious Disease X*. Say you have a three-year-old daughter. It's no one's fault if 70% of the population is a toddler in *City A*, but *City A* is dangerous to your daughter's health, BECAUSE 70% of the population is a toddler. So say you live in *City A* because rent is cheaper or something, and you go online and say "Gosh, 60% of toddlers are sick. What an unsafe environment for my child." How are you acting like the number is higher than it should be? If most of the population is dangerous, and they just happen to be of a certain group, then you can affirm that said group is more dangerous than another. Like all statistics linking race and crime rate do (though it's actually linked to poverty, and we can link poverty to race). So comparatively, White people commit 'more' crimes than other races. - I am not confirming that fact since I did not research the statistics myself. I am just saying that thinking he's making it seem bigger than it is, is exaggerated.    The problem is that I don't see where or how he's acting like it's higher than it should be.    The excessive exclamations after using only two? Ok.   "Less crimes than expected" what is that supposed to mean. It's still more than half! Wether there are 3 people or 3 million, if 2/3 of them are criminals, it's still 2/3!    Yes I will. Thank you : )   Yes that is what I was planning on doing. I was just getting accustomed to the system beforehand. However I couldn't find the information myself.   I'll be spending 12-14 months in Germany.   If you cancel with them, they charge you, sometimes more than the actual price of the ticket (from what I read on websites like Yelp). I was worried for my credit card too but one positive thing people said was that before charging you, they send you an email beforehand (and they do send at least one email a day so that would not surprise me). I will however check my bill to make sure I am not being scammed.   Thank you though : )   Nope. I am leaving from Montreal, going to Germany (layer in London). I have an American passport though, but I did not disclaim that information, so I don't think that's it.   Definitely learned my lesson. I won't cancel though since they will charge me. But so far it's just confusing, not terribly exasperating. Yet.  Glad to see a few people who have nothing negative to say about it. The reviews are so discouraging.    I am not from Europe.    With the sketchy-looking website and the terrible reviews, I honestly didn't feel comfortable sharing any information with them.  Thank you very much!   I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for formatting.   I bought one-way tickets to Germany through Kayak, but they redirected me to a website called airfare. I have never heard of them, but quite frankly it's only my second time booking a flight on my own (I'm 18) and the first time, it went well (it was not with airfare, still through Kayak).  Anyway so I booked my ticket, got a confirmation email the next day saying it's all processed and I'm basically ready to go, but here we are, two days later, and I receive this:  " Dear Traveler,  Government authorities around the world have tightened security considerably at Airports so that you can travel safely to your destination.  With that in mind, we are required to collect 'Advance Passenger Information' from all passengers before travel, on behalf of government authorities.  You must provide this information to us to complete the ticketing process.  It is important that the information provided is accurate.  Advance Passenger Information refers to specific Passport details and we need the below information in order to process your Airline ticket(s).  • Passport number  • Country which issued your passport  • Passport expiry date   Thank you for making your booking withAirfare.com"  Should I do as I am told?   Thanks in advance.   Great! Ustra's "Fares" page isn't working for some reason and I couldn't find anything else.   Thank you very much! : )   I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit, but /r/hannover has been inactive for a full month.   So as the title says, are there monthly passes in Hannover if I want to take the bus/s-bahn? I can only find informations about day passes (online), but I'm having a hard time believing that's all there is ...  Thank you in advance.    Yep, he is no exception. Like I said, prestigious schools send their students overseas, and prestigious school only board kids of important people, including the Kim family.    I think "any second" is inaccurate. In Astronomy, the "near" future is at least tens of thousands of years. Also, it would not affect us the way you're describing it. It will affect whatever is chilling outside out atmosphere, including humans, but thank goodness Earth has a trusty atmosphere that's doing pretty good despite the shit we're making it go through. However the upper part of it would be damaged, including our ozone layer, which is where the problem would start. But no, it's not immediate doom, and it's not going to happen "any second" from now.    I know the words, I understand the words, but I always want to fully understand by imagining it ... then I realize nothing else is infinite, and nothing else is "expending into itself". Frustration.    In all seriousness, the odds of that happening are so slim. Look at what's happening on Earth. We're the most intelligent species, with language and an advanced understanding of our existence (according to us .. haha), yet our DNA are 50% similar to that of a Banana, 90% similar to a cat's ... Small variations in the DNA results in huge differences. The odds of having living beings similar to us on another part of the Universe is unimaginable because of that (not impossible though I mean. Who knows). Plus we probably wouldn't have the same 'definition' of alive or intelligent. They could be right before our eyes and we wouldn't know ...  It's very sad to be honest.    You are lucky I think. Most people do not have relatives as understanding as yours seem to be. And I  truly think, like OP said, though  your  situation might  stay the same (or feel like it), relatives and friends will likely forget about you. Grieve and move on. So ultimately, you staying isn't making them that big of a favour.   My opinion anyway.    It was definitely irrational, but after ending up in  the hospital after my first  attempt, my family saw it as a victory. "Ha. You can't escape us." type of thing. They talked psychiatrists out of taking care of me, got me out the  mental hospital, high fived (figuratively) and moved on. Prior to that, my sadness were also victories, my tears their trophy. But whenever I would take a decision, make myself suffer in x or y manner, they'd feel insulted. So to me, suicide was my last fuck you to them.  But later I realized my suicidal thoughts and actions were definitely not only caused by them since I'm still having them and my parents affect me less.   Exaclty. People who think their dogs are ruthless sex addicts like they are and they "deserve to know that feeling of freedom" are idiots.   The whole point of existence is selfishness. Survival class is basically How to Be Selfish 101 because you must make sure you're out of danger before helping someone else. Our ancestors were selfish so they wouldn't have to share their food too much and die. So many other examples of how selfishness is what has made us survive as a species. Therefore it's a good kind of selfishness.  Now. About suicide, it is still the good kind of selfishness. You're not living for others, especially if said others are your parents, friends, etc.. The only people who need you would be your children, but that's on a moral standpoint. No where does it say you owe them your life (though I truly believe that is a true statement. You owe your kids everything). Family and friends will be in grief, but if you're in a deep depression and you choose to stick around to please them, you're in for one hell of a ride since life is the single thing you cannot handle anymore. It is selfish of any relatives to say "Think about us!" because they are not telling you to live for yourself, they're telling you  to stick around so they don't have to go through pain, while you can continue suffering. Isn't that  selfish?   Ok now think of someone with a terminal illness who  is suffering. Wouldn't it be only fair if they asked for a no-resuscitation bracelet? Even if the family does not want them to die? Because it's their suffering, not the family's.   Its no rocket science. Your life = you live for you. I am not promoting suicide, but there is nothing I can think of that would ever make me relevant in whatever situation the person is going through. I am battling depression and ironically, thinking about my family was the best motivation to my suicidal attempts. Because my life  wasn't theirs and I couldn't wait to tell them that without any fear.   How is that not selfish. "Live! Think about us before thinking about yourself!"   ITT : People who know very little about hacking and/or North Korea.   Many North Koreans know how the West is or how they view North Korea. Prestigious schools send their kids overseas all the time. Yet after their trip, for some  reason they become more supportive of their country's regime. Probably out of fear to speak up. So no. That would not change  anything.   Really now? Giving up on the only worthy piece of greenery we have?   Why are you so upset? Damn ...   If you fail to understand the meaning of "sexualize" in this entire debate, don't even bother chiming in. It's like you did not read the entire thing, but you're commenting along.    This, I agree with. It's just my opinion, and no, I can't find actual facts proven by scientists! I can only rely on feelings and personal knowledge (mixed with culture maybe). But yeah. I also suck at expressing myself, especially in English.    [Yes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2363193/No-time-family-You-Parents-children-spend-hour-day-modern-demands.html) and no. There are articles out there, but my personal opinion comes from personal experience with my family of childcare providers, teachers, therapists, etc.  The problem is our modern day (that is, from 1945) tendencies: mothers must work now, everyone has longer hours, and everyone is tired. My mother works in a daycare and there are kids who arrive at the same time or before her (7 AM), and some leave way after her, as late as 7 PM. Sometimes, she has to bring a kid home because the parents never come! And what's funny is that many of those parents are extremely rich people who do not work (my city has many Italian millionaires and many send their kids to my mother's daycare), yet they are the ones with many nannies, filling up daycares to make it impossible for others to place their children, and seldom knowing their children's personalities.   I also read an article about psychology. It was French and from a book, so I can't send you a link. It doesn't say "Parents spend less time with their children", but it does say that parents often rely on others when it comes to parenting their children. In North America anyway. It is why like 50% of kids have ADHD because there is no one to take care of their individual needs, even though they have parents and that's kind of their purpose and job ... A relative's friend is sending her four-year-old to therapy to get potty trained! How crazy! Anyway. That's another debate. But yes, the increase of mental health diagnoses is related to our inability (or lack of motivation?) to treat individual children, so we rather group 30 kids in one room, hope they act the same, and the one requiring more individual attention will have a diagnosis of any kind and be sent to professionals.   It's often not the parents' fault, but it's not impossible to spend time with your child and devote your time off to them. Even with a full time job! It just demands a lots of energy and giving up on your "alone time".   Do you have a view that is based on evidence or reason? Do we have CGI depicting child porn?    I'm telling you that we do not agree on one and only thing: how we view sex. That is all.   Alright. This is going nowhere. I know my English is not the best but it's like you're purposely dodging what I'm saying at this point. I'm just repeating myself.   I give up.    So you're telling me earlier it's okay to have opinions, now you're all on my throat because I'm not giving you scientific results of extensive researches. It's an opinion. Mostly based on feelings and morals.   The problem is that you do not see it as wrong (which is a feeling, so opinion). Some things are just wrong because the majority thinks so. Rape is wrong because we think so, but some cultures still does not see the difference between rape and sex. Now this idea of sexualizing things as wrong is new, so it'll take time before it catches up but I sure as hell hope it does.   No, I am not being inconsistent. In your head as in no one knows about it =/= in your head as in mental difference/difficulty.   All I'm saying is this. I have an opinion. I obviously like my opinion. Yours is the opposite, and I find it sickening. Which is bad because it's your opinion. Opinion, by the way, meaning based on feelings, experiences, among other things. We're trying to convince each other, because you want freedom of doing whatever, I want people to stop sexualizing everything there is because my opinion is that it's harmful. It just is. Based on nothing. Like most opinions.    Ok first of all, sexualizing someone does not mean you find them attractive. Sexualizing them means to make them sexual. Plain and simple. A banana for a horny woman is not attractive, but it becomes a sexualized object. If you fail to distinct sexual and physical (and emotional, let me throw this one in) attraction, I'm very sorry for what you are missing.  Second, now that we understand what sexualizing means, it is wrong to sexualize something that was not meant to be sexualized, especially if you expect whoever is/has those thing to respond positively to your sexual impulses. That is something people can't understand yet it's so simple ... I could be walking butt naked outside, don't expect me to be okay with you voicing your sexual interests, or acting upon them.  Now whatever happens in your head is no one's business if it stays in your head. I bet many people have fantasized about violent sexual relationships, even if it's abusive. But that's cool I mean it's your issues. Now if you expect others to think it's okay when they don't, or you're using the fact that whoever is in question can't have an opinion on it, then you're in the wrong. It is why the law protects 16 year olds and younger when it comes to sex. Technically, they're mature enough for it physically, have taken the decision themselves, but they are not mature enough to understand the repercussions that may actually comes with it.    I can follow it ... or else why would I want someone to follow it? And obviously your example is wrong and exaggerated, and you sound like a smart person so I think you understand exactly what I meant.    I think the problem is that you do not see what is wrong with sexualizing things against their will. If said thing has no will, why sexualize it? Unless it's an object, then .. well it's an object.   Yes, you sexualizing a person who didn't allow you to is wrong, but that's too new of an idea for people to understand it. I can't wait for humanity to change and see what is wrong with this tendency.    Not really, since he's dead. But it does affect children because they're sexualized! It's so simple! What else can I say? Anyway.    Some things are just morally wrong, and that's one of them. Morally wrong things (like murdering a homeless man) affects no one really. But they still wrong.   Anyway. See, we just have different opinions, and you seem to not understand why my understand is what it is, just like I don't understand why yours is what it is.    So? So if you don't know what's happening, it can't affect you? And sexualizing children is not just wrong without any need of justification? This is where I will never understand you and people sharing your opinion. But oh well. Whatever.    I think it affects children negatively, by sexualizing them. I'm repeating myself but that's the whole problem for me. If it's not for you, okay. But it is a huge problem for me, needing no further explanation.   	106
