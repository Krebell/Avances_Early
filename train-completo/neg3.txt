 Daaaaaaaang!!! With those fangs your sexiness level is over 9000!!!! The tattoos are awesome as well   Yea, Serj's music is hard to classify into a specific genre   This was amazing! I recently started enjoying cabaret style music, and this is one of my favorites so far. Any way I can get a hold of their music? I tried torrent but nothing showed up. I wouldn't mind purchasing the album at all from them either.   My first thought when I read the title, "what!? No way!? I gotta try that!". I know what I'm doing today!  I think it has to do with the being naked and how we're so used to being clothed. No restraints I guess   I currently work there and I think out store wins for the most sugar. We use a 4lb bag of sugar and it makes a little under 2gallons. We then add enough ice to make it to the 2gallon mark. I also had a manager there who would make his special diabetes tea......the secret was an extra 4lb bag for the same 2gallons. Customers never complained some even said it was good. Just a 16oz cup of that would make my stomach hurt all night but give me energy to work   I can't sleep until I devour you.   I was appalled and disgusted but, I couldn't look away......good post   	7
  /r/19kidsandmounting, more like.     Just trying to view it from all the angles.  So did Josh.   Hopefully he was able to actually learn something from it.  Freelance gynecology?    Maybe they thought they could pray the play away.   It's a tragedy how Christian Fundamentalist extremists have managed to sully the phrase "Christian" in barely more than a generation.  "Christian" used to be a noble and honorable appellation, and in its traditional definition remains so.  However, given all of the scandals, scams, hucksterism, fraud, and extremist right-wing political activism we've seen among Evangelical Protestants in the last 30 or so years, "Christian" has picked up very negative connotations such as to imply ignorance, smug self-delusion, and false righteousness.  It should never have been this way, but there was too much money and power to be had.       The most foolish and self-destructive move the American Catholic Church ever made was to ally with frothing Fundamentalist Evangelicals on "Culture War" issues.  It's cost the Church so much in the credibility department (especially among Catholics) that I wonder if the damage can ever be undone.    Doctors are not really allowed to unionize  What's the AMA, then?     Why not go for a swim in it, petro-apologist?   How can anyone take the Paul family seriously? They've been canoodling with far right-wing extremists for decades.   MONEYBOMB!   Another Hero Patriot from "the Party of Personal Responsibility!"    Another fine representative of "the Party of Personal Responsibility!"      Dinesh D'Souza and various other right-wing cranks.   Worked himself into a froth.   That means it's working.   Could it be . . . LIBERTY!^TM ???   "right-to-rise society"  I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a new Republican catch phrase. I see Rove's hand here.  Remember how Rove sold GWB as a "reformer with results" and a "compassionate conservative"?  "Right-to-rise" is both alliterative and has a slight tinge of dog-whistle.   Hopefully this will hasten the decline of social conservatism.    I was interested in Rand, but my inbox got filled with requests for money.  Ever notice how Ron and Rand Paul ***constantly beg*** for that "worthless fiat currency" they so deride?      I'm more of a Democrat than anything  Yep. Because Democrats always run around snarking about "SJWs" and whining about "feminists."  Everyone believes you.     The LIBERTY!^TM Brigades are here!   If you want a similar deal, I'm sure Ron would still be willing to take your "worthless fiat currency" in exchange for it, just like he's done for all his true believers for decades.  You act in your own "informed, rational self-interest," right? Give Paul a call! I'm sure he'll be willing to work with you. He might even throw in a racist newsletter for your troubles!         Ron Paul has been "consistent" in courting, then scamming money from White Nationalists and Neo-Confederates for decades (if that's what you mean by "consistent.")

Those Iraqis died for FREEDOM!^TM  We liberated their souls right the fuck out of their bodies.   Don't forget the Carlyle Group!   The GOP doesn't have a way of shutting that whole thing down.      Jeb and GWB: two more Republican Chickenhawks.

Decide for yourself if their characterization is accurate: the users of /r/politics aren't able to.  Here's the full text of the article:  In a 2010 radio interview, Frazier Glenn Miller, the man suspected of killing three people Sunday at a Jewish community center and a Jewish retirement center in Kansas, said he was interested in the tea party, voiced support for then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and spoke approvingly of Ron Paul, the Texas Republican congressman and presidential candidate. In late April 2010, Miller, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, was a guest on The David Pakman Show, a nationally syndicated left-of-center radio and television program. At the time, Miller was running for US Senate as an independent in his home state of Missouri with the slogan "It's the Jews, Stupid," and Pakman pressed Miller on his extreme views.  During the interview, Miller was unabashed about his anti-Semitic positions. When asked whether he thought the United States would be better off if Hitler had succeeded, Miller responded, "Absolutely, the whole world wouldHitler would have created a paradise on Earth, particularly for white people. But he would have been fair to other people as well." He added, "Germans are blamed collectively because of the alleged so-called Holocaust."  Not surprisingly, Miller denigrated most American politicians, but cited one positively: "If I had my way [all US senators] would be in jail right now for treason, if not hung from a sturdy oak treeRon Paul is the only independent politician, representative in Washington." He also spoke highly of another conservative: "Patrick Buchanan, he's a great man, he's a great historian, he's one of the very few journalists who has the courage to speak out against Jewish domination in the country." Miller called Howard Stern "a Jew liar." When asked whether he supported the tea party, Miller replied, "The school's still out on them. They're a new movement. I'm watching them closely. I suspect, however, they'll be infiltrated by the Jews and therefore led into defeat."  During the interview, Pakman asked Miller whom he would "elect, deport, and waterboard"given the choices of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Fed chair Alan Greenspan. Miller answered, "I like Obama more than the other two, by far." He chose to elect Obama, deport Greenspan, and waterboard Biden. Miller said, "I have a great deal of admiration [for] Louis Farrakhan," and he called Ahmadinejad "a great man" because he "has guts and he tells the truth about the Jews."  "I'm a convicted felon and I'm proud of it," Miller boasted, noting that he "was convicted of declaring war on the federal government and possession of illegal weapons." He added that Jews "were responsible for my conviction that prompted me to go underground and declare warMorris Dees mainly, he's a Jew that runs the Southern Poverty Law Center." (The SPLC monitors hate groups.)  In November 2013, Pakman had an exchange of emails with Miller in which Miller noted that he was "close friends" with Craig Cobb, a white supremacist who had attempted to form an all-white town in Leith, North Dakota. According to Miller, the two had worked together "on several White Nationalist projects, including the Aryan Alternative newspaper." Referring to the recent news that a DNA test indicated that Cobb had African ancestry, Miller told Pakman, "I can't believe a man as intelligent as you, actually believes Craig Cobb is an octoroon. Surely, you know it's just another jewsmedia fraud."

Did the Admins have to have a little talk with that petulant crew of self-appointed authoritarian censors over at r/politics?  What say you, our dear Censorship Mods? Did those "Community Outreach" purges of yours finally catch up with you?   This comment was deleted on at least one other subreddit. Hopefully this redacted version will pass muster. Please give it you consideration, and add your thoughts in the comments. ______________________   In response to another redditor's query: **"What are some trends on reddit that should die?"**  Censorship.  In some reedits, censorship of legitimate news sources, users, and user comments based on the whim of rogue, self-appointed Moderators is now the norm, not the rare exception.  Yes, /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED]r , /u/[REDACTED] , and /u/[REDACTED](among others,) you Censorship Mods over at /r/[REDACTED] ban users and sources at individual whim. This has been well documented and will only become a larger issue until the Admins of reddit deal with the censorship dictates you Neo-Mods have forced upon the largest political message board on the Internet.  You deem sources "unacceptable" and they are pulled before they even hit the /r/[REDACTED]/new newsfeed.  As a redditor, I don't need some vigilante Mods deciding what is and what is not acceptable to their whim and censoring content "for our own Good." There are tens of millions of redditors, and we don't need authoritarian control over the means of our communication. We can decide for ourselves, thank you very much.  Salon is banned on /r/[REDACTED]. Wonkette is also banned. For a brief time, until reddit outrage grew too large to ignore and the Censorship Mods were forced to backtrack, Mother Jones was banned. (Mother Jones is the media outfit that broke the "Mitt Romney 47%" story, the biggest political story of 2012.) But the Censorship Mods were forced to back down when it blew up in their faces; they were made to undo their unjustified and partisan ban of Mother Jones. Other of their arbitrary bans remain in place to this day.  What sources are you not able to see, fellow reddit users, because the /r/[REDACTED] Neo-Mods have decided that they know better than you do what is and what is not news and/or politics? (Hint: more than you think.)  Reddit exists because of the free flow of information. When self-appointed guardians of what is valid and what is not seize control to impose their spiteful will by force upon an unwilling community, they are violating the very premise of reddit. This is why Admin intervention is needed: this Censorship train needs to be stopped in its tracks before it becomes a trend among other would-be authoritarian Mods.  The "Digg Patriots" destroyed digg; we cannot stand by as "Reddit Patriots" force the same fate on Reddit.  Don't let the Censorship Mods win.                                                                                          He said something about "primate nocturnal" or something and declared it was his natural right to devirginize my new wife.  I know he's right, because he is richer and better and smarter than me. But does anyone know what he's talking about?  This is a disappointing start to our marriage. I can't make ice in the Liberty trailer, so the Liberty champagne I had specially chilled for our honeymoon night went warm while we used the ice to keep her swelling and bruising down.  She just arrived here from abroad last week. I hope this incident doesn't skew her perspective on LibertyWorld, where the natural rights of Propertarians reign supreme, and they harvest our Flowers of Freedom at will.      Please share your stories.            And why do they seem so happy to do so, even as they continue to lose ground every year? Is the American Right's "flag-and-eagle-porn" really that effective?  Any ideas?            When did you first realize that Ron Paul was not in fact "a Champion of the Constitution" but nothing more than a Neo-Confederate grifter who exploits the paranoid fears of White Supremacists?  Did you fall for the "Hey, he's 'Grandpa Peace 'n Pot!'" rebranding that started online in the mid-2000s to cover up Ron Paul's past and his decades-long associations with the *Turner Diaries* crowd?  How long did it take you to get out of the Cult of Paul? Are people you know still in?  Please share your personal stories.             That's right  it's [Ron Paul!](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6560359999_b98a55fc71.jpg)  (The "official World War II U.S. Army Ammo-Holder" containing the coins is free with purchase, lest anyone accuse Ron Paul of trying to rip them off.)                                                                     Why or why not?                                 I dont know what the future holds for the Republican Party.  The Republicans, desperate to win at all costs, deliberately targeted both the malignantly ignorant, the dangerously paranoid, and all combinations thereof. This segment remains prized for both their malleability and their susceptibility to flag-and-eagle porn. Single issue voters, who will often vote in direct opposition to their own interests for the sake of litmus test issues, are really all the Republicans have left.  Beginning with President Nixon continuing right up until today, the Republican apparatus has catered ever more to these loons to secure victory. As a result, the paranoid and proudly ignorant now make up the largest segment of the Republican coalition, and traditional Eisenhower/Rockefeller Republicans are not only excoriated as "RINOs," they're viewed as prize game.  The Party now finds itself in trouble: it can no longer win national elections due to this self-cultivated demographic albatross, yet they now have no chance of winning without those voters. It's not merely a matter of their individual votes: these are the activists who man Republican phone banks, donate money, walk the precincts, and hand out lawn signs.  There really is no place for a sensible American conservative to seek shelter these days. The Libertarians are even more tied to the extremist American Right and its bizarre "black helicopter" conspiracy fantasies than the Republicans are, so there is really no refuge for a sane Republican moderate.                                       	143

The agency can take the penalty out of a filers refund, but beyond that, its ability to recoup those dollars is extremely limited. The IRS cannot, for example, send agents to peoples homes or put liens on their houses. In the health-care law, Congress specifically curtailed the ability to enforce this penalty, giving the IRS fewer ways to collect it than there are for other tax fines.   Thank you, canteloupy. That is quite appalling. I find it very demeaning to women living under such conditions.

It's nearly impossible today to build a piece of software that doesn't at least violate a handful of software patents, if not more. For the sake of innovation this dysfunctional patent system needs to be abolished.   I hope Hollande listens to the French public. He should recall his country's previous experience in relation to France's involvement in Syria post WWII.

It is a victory for the British public and a lesson for other nations to learn from.   I think many of us in the west have had enough of getting involved in other nations civil wars without a real clear idea of what we're getting our soldiers into. Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya are all witness to this.

Even though his position is to go to war, I praise Mr. Cameron for bringing this to a vote. And to the UK members of parliament who listened to the view of their people. It's terrible what is happening in Syria but history has proven that dropping more bombs won't bring a war to an end, it might just do the opposite by inflaming the whole of the Middle East.  	199
 Horror,adventure,crime.   Well,i decided to join a team as a writer.Thank you for your comments.  	2
 Nope. It's not an action movie.   1. - 2. True Romance 3. The Raid 2   V for Vendetta and The Dark Knight Returns. I'd just love to see a really liberal Alan Moore character clash with Frank Miller's fascist Batman.   You're a mutie, Harry.   I felt just a lovely Spielbergian vibe that I dug so much. I really think it's one of the stronger movies.   And its sequel.   What's that in?   Firstly, Age of Ultron had nothing to do with the comic and the other three aren't even out yet. Secondly, I said credited, not named after. As in the actual credits say "Based on Iron Man: Extremis" or something.   No, in the credits for both Days of Future Past and The Wolverine, they say "Based on Days of Future Past by Chris Claremont and John Byrne" and "Based on Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller". They'll likely do this again for Apocalypse and Fantastic Four.   I hope most sequels are team up movies. Wouldn't it be great to see Doctor Strange have a small role in Spider-Man 2?   I dislike most of the final battles in the movies. I feel **most** of them don't hold much emotional weight.  Exceptions are probably Age of Ultron, The Winter Soldier and (maybe) Guardians of the Galaxy. Iron Man is the worst, Stane turns from someone truly menacing to a cartoon villain.   I know the franchise is predominantly for children, but the current IDW Transformers comics are the shit.   Nah. He likes Luke Cage, Spider-Woman and Daredevil. Probably because they overlap with other genres better.    Tim Sale and Alex Maleev both have drawb a great Daredevil   Didn't she fail to keep that up?   The Fast and the Fury Road would be pretty badass.    I said I didn't like one aspect of Guardians of the Galaxy, a day later I was on -30 and got alerts asking whether or not I had a healthy relationship with my mother. I don't think that's acceptable.   I don't know how common this is, but I used to think Carlito's Way was directed by Scorsese.    I would like to see you the proposed book club idea come to fruition.   Not dark, but Interstellar involves time warping and is quite serious.    Not the best writing, but Natalie Portman in the Thor films. She just looks like she doesn't care.   At least TV is getting some variety. This Autumn we'll have Preacher, two Walking Dead shows, iZombie, Constaintine, Sex Criminals and a few more shows are coming down the line by Matt Fraction and Kelly Sue DeComick. This is probably a better place for comic adaptations due to their serialised nature.  Films for We3, Y: The Last Man and Wytches have been announced, but I doubt much will happen with them. :(   Beyond what?   I think you mean Superhero fatigue. People don't get "book fatigued". Would you really object if every comic book movie is A History of Violence or V For Vendetta tier and came out every three-four months?   This becomes so clear on the rewatch of Season 4 in particular.    I've got to remember that one.   The many studied at the school of Grant Morrison and came out with all the wrong lessons. It's like he heard what Morrison had to say and ventured in the opposite direction. M   Bendis is at his best when he's given complete freedom. No consequences and very little continuity let his dialogue and plotting shine. When he's leading events or restricted by what has been happening in other books over the years, his writing is less interesting.  Millar on the other hand needs restrictions. Give him structure and focus and he can come up with a masterpiece such as Superman: Red Son, but sometimes he gets wrapped up in ultraviolence and rape when it feels like toning it down would really help the story. I feel that's what they're doing with his film adaptations - they filter out a lot of his crap, but that's really what his editors should be doing.   Lots of Mark Millar and Bendis there I must note. TBH, those big battles tend to take away from the personality and meaning from the comic. Look at House of M, which is a surprisingly poignant and touching event, but it just descends into a series of splash pages towards the end.   Thrills.   Mind if I use this?   Starlin bringing his grandiose style to the big screen would be great. IMO he also writes the definitive Batman.   No-one better than Vaughan' for a Runaways movie. He created and perfected the characters.  Which other comic writers are experienced with TV and Film? i can think of Bendis, JMS and (maybe) Gaiman.   How is Fight Club 2? I was gonna pick it up in trade.    For me, it'd be Jason Aaron on Black Panther or Bendis on Spider-Man.  Aaron is used to writing tough badasses and his brief run on the Black Panther comics proved that. In three issues, he gave an in-depth understanding of both Wakandan and Skrull cultures and some truly epic battles. I'm sure he'd be able to replicate that for the big screen.  As for Bendis on Spider-Man, has any writer had such a definitive run on a character that they didn't create? (Maybe Frank Miller) He added so much to the mythos in his retelling and his stylised dialogue is perfect for film. With his inclusion in the film, he could bring along his cast of characters from Ultimate Spider-Man - who doesn't want to see a live-action Kong or Ganke (can you do Ganke without Miles?).      I love Truth: Red, White and Black. A really great read. If were introducing Bradley, it means that we're not too far away from Patriot and the Young Avengers.    You seem to be misunderstanding Rotten Tomatoes - it is only a gage of what percentage of critics liked it, not how good it is. That would be for a site like Metacritic (where it sits at a very healthy 66%). Most critics who liked it gave it a very positive review, but some struggled to overlook the flaws. Take a movie like Star Trek (2009) - it's a very enjoyable movie that most people liked (hence the 92%), but nobody who liked both it and The Wolf of Wall Street (77%) would argue it's a better movie. It's really just a way of figuring out the odds of you liking a movie and collecting the scores in one place and don't forget that 74% is still a very good score. I think, if you're looking for a place to gage how good a movie is, look towards IMDb. Although it is skewed towards films enjoyed by a teenaged and early twenties demographic, it is a better measure of how good a movie is overall as that's what it is trying to achieve, unlike Rotten Tomatoes. On IMDb, Age of Ultron has an 8.1, putting it in the top 400 movies.  **TL;DR** RT isn't for measuring how good a movie is and most critics liked it - a lot.    Is Groot still an alien monarch in the films?   This just doesn't make sense to me. I've been wanting to read Punisher MAX for ages, but the TPBs are so expensive.    This just doesn't make sense to me. I've been wanting to read Punisher MAX for ages, but the TPBs are so expensive.    What about his Ultimates?   Is any of the stuff before worth reading at all?   Sometimes, I just can't believe Reddit.   Do you want to know why i don't like LotR?  * The characters are uninteresting and dull (with the exception of Boromir). * There's way too many characters. It wasn't hard to follow, I just didn't want to. * (Only really a problem with the Fellowship) The first one seemed to be aimed at young children with lots of childish jokes and dumb slapstick and dialogue - which then seemed really odd because of some of the darker things in that movie. * The action is really boring. I spent so much time waiting for something interesting, but it never came. * It's so slow and so long. There's just so much that doesn't need to be there (like the last 40 minutes of RotK). You could say these moments enhance the world, but it already is so rich and vast those moments just drag. * The lack of an interesting villain. I don't even know why I should care at times. * The plot revolves around a MacGuffin and is full of Deus ex Machinas (an army of ghosts? WTF?). * Too much exposition.  * Too many subplots that just don't matter to me. Why should I care if Aragon found love or didn't or whatever? I don't care about Aragon. * There isn't actually that much plot there. Just look at how little Sam and Frodo's story progresses from the end of the Fellowship to their encounter with Gollem in RotK. If you cut out all of their story up to that point, you could still follow along just fine.  Things I did like:  * I respect how well made it is.  * Good acting.  * The landscape and environment is just beautiful.  * Middle-Earth was a pretty rich world by the end of it.   Is it reading all of the stuff that came before? i'm very interested in delving into this universe and I don't know whether it'd be worth reading all of it, or just a few.   Disappointed to see LotR scoring so I highly. I know it's a controversial opinion on /r/Movies but I really don't LotR.   Adam Warlock. I can see him as a wise and powerful guy.   Saga, Sex Criminals, Sandman, Wytches, Southern Bastards, Y: The Last Man, Afterlife with Archie and We3 quickly come to mind.   So like Vertigo or Image or what-have-you.    Or eat.   Tony was an interesting new status quo, shame it didn't last long.   Excellent, isn't it? IMO, E for Extinction stands as both a great X-Men story and a great Grant Morrison story.   Do Tarantino movies count? If so, the Candyland sequence in Django Unchained is jaw dropping.   So, the majority of my problems with Nolan movies are Jonathan's fault?   I love how this is one of the most iconic pages from the event, yet it wasn't even in the main series.   My bad. I actually noticed that on my shelf after writing it. I guess his art isn't great (unless he did the Thanos Quest?).   Not really a fan of Theron, but I love the idea of an older woman in the role. There aren't very many good action roles for women over 40 (which Chalize will be when Captain Marvel comes put), so I think it would be great if Marvel decided to help diversify on another level. Fighting sexism and ageism in the industry is a commendable cause, why not got for the trifecta and hire Pam Grier?  Damn, I'd love to see Pam Grier in a Marvel movie.    Ultimate Ben is in love with her.   His brief run on Thanos (2003) was also excellent, shame it's kind of gone downhill since then. His art can be great though, look at his work on Batman: The Cult.   Thanos (2003). It leads into Annihilation if you like it.    Are you sure it's not Laurence Fishburne?   Shall we expect news on that soon?   What's happened to the Titans show?   It's not even accurate. This is the second sequel.   Also: where's Pepper? Is she completely gone from this franchise now?   I'm loving the cynical choice of giving RDJ the first credit.   True Detective style time jumps would be awesome.    I hope we see more of the 2003 New Mutants than the 80s team. I want to see Prodigy on the big screen.    Gotta read his Batman or Marvel Colours work. All of that is absolutely beautiful and can easily reduce one to tears.   Hundreds of variants, millions of copies sold, antihero leads and constant rereleases. Anyone else getting dj vu?   Don't be a hero? Don't be a fool with your life?   Replace Mr Fantastic with the Maker.   Beak is my favourite - you just can't help but feel sorry for him.    If they do Iron Lad, it better be a time-travelling Kang the Conqueror like in the comics.   Bodes well for Civil War and Infinity War.   I always sa that as the characters not the movie. I'd struggle to believe that the man who made Jackie Brown could make a racist movie.   She was a villain though, then Charlie Day proceeds to try and kill her.    That would be a plus of a hard reboot (which I am totally in favour of).   Yes. Why?   I know, but it is hard to accept any point about racism made by John Wayne and no one in that movie makes a point disagreeing with him.   Sexist is the wrong word, but woman are almost always put in the background in action movies. They're typically motivation for men, love interests or there is one woman who kicks ass and no others. They typically are never afforded complex characters as men are.    I read that in Luke Cage's voice.   I have a similar feeling about racism in The Searchers. Knowing that the Duke was actually a racist, makes it hard to believe that it was just his character talking in that movie.   Most modern action movies are inherently sexist. The only ones that I can think of that aren't are the Fast   Furious films.   I wish I had a daughter to share Korra and Leslie Knope with. Such great characters.   * Seven Samurai * The Magnificent Seven * A Bug's Life * 13 Assassins   Stop downvoting this guy. I think he's refer to the 1940s serial.   I forgot about Wolverine. It is actually really good. The art - whilst kind of cartoonish - is pretty awesome. Logan looks how I imagine he normally should - rough and tough, rather than the short Superman-esque build I found him looking like in the Avengers books of that era.      Front Line, New Avengers, The Confession, Young Avengers/Runaways, The Amazing Spider-Man, Captian America, Winter Soldier - Winter Kills and maybe Iron Man.   Frankly, apart from Front Line and New Avengers, the others only really are good if you've been reading the character's own series.      I must ask if they're doing a hard reboot or a soft reboot.   Toy Story 3   I can't wait. Any series leading into the new ones or is it a complete reboot?   Dick was a better father.   I really can't recommend this. Setting aside my feelings for the event - I abhor the main series, but there are some great tie-ins - it's far too expensive to consider getting anything beyond the main series. It'll cost $7 to just get the main series and $112 for the whole event, whereas a Marvel Unlimited subscription is $10/month for all the comics in the event and 13K more.  It just makes more sense, despite the few bonuses that come with Comixology (better smart panels for example).   Marvel and DCs current offerings are much more readable, so I'm more lax about that.    For me it was Andy giving away his toys and moving on. It was like saying goodbye.   Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street and either The Departed or Taxi Driver.   Better than She's the Man.   I really like this order, but it's missing a lot of key series. NYX, New X-Men/Mutants, Mike Carey's X-Men, the Vulcan Saga, Origin II, Logan and chunks of Aaron's Wolverine and it is filled with a lot of mediocre books.   No pictures of Tatum? I can't wait to see what he looks like playing a character that's quite unconventional for him.   No one has mentioned Scarface?   I know that movie sucked and he's more of a DC guy, but I'm certainly not adverse to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.    I love the new team, as a black guy, I love seeing the Falcon and War Machine on the team (even better given the fact they're played by Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle). That, along with the fact there are twice the number of female team members, really means they've created a much more diverse team so I instantly approve.  Here's hoping Falcon takes other Hawkguy's role as the clown. I think Mackie is perfect for it.   I hope it's Doc Strange. I love their relationship, especially when Bendis writes them.    3.8...   An Incredible Heracles TV series would be awesome. Heracules the Mighty accompanied by Amadeus Cho (with Pup in tow). The theme song writes itself.   The main series and Silver Surfer mini were pretty pretty.   What do you mean? Immensely popular, but have strong critics?   I agree with you. I was actually expanding on your point. Lol  Digge's is so disappoining, starting with the famous death is Guardian Devil, DD was having a massive breakdown that Bendis, Mack and Brubaker handled fantastically handled and Digge just ruined.   Worse than everyone who came before Miller? Worse than everyone who came between Nocenti and Smith?   I felt it was just randomly thrown into an action sequence. I feel it would have been better in the montage after he escapes the miners or just a sequence of him riding.   The dialogue. There's no subtext whatsoever and the characters often just state their emotions. Also, it's a Sci-Fi movie with no David Bowie and that's a sin. L   I love this movie so much, so it pains me to say it's too long.   Whiplash  	116
 Hey fuck you, buddy. Who died and made you Conductor of Assumption Junction, eh? Society dictates what's "normal" or not. I mean, sure, there's the whole thing about normality being established by statistical representation of sex and gender identity, but the implication is you're calling non cis NOT normal, and that's mean. Also accurate. BUT MEAN.   I really wish there was a large group of black people watching this go down. I'd pay handsomely for that commentary.   So... WERE YOU THERE FOR HER?   Was waiting to read this. Former court reporter here. Cameras are shown to have a significant impact on the judge's sentencing. Doubly so considering judges are elected in America, leaving them prone to handing down harsher sentences to please the public.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_bounce   A school is using perfectly legal means to reduce interest payments! Burn it!   Am I the only one that would like to see confirmation that this is OP's mom?   FUCK. THAT. NOISE.   My balls just retreated quicker than an arctic glacier on rollerskates.   I'd have to be certain I had something worth saying. Otherwise you're just asking to be haunted by the disapproving gaze of the president of the united states the rest of your life. "Yeah, I met the President," you'll tell your grandkids, trying your best to forget the way his eyes belied precisely how disappointed he was that you were even in the room.   The fuck is everyone angry at then?    Yeah. Only a fucking moron or a genius would speak up during something like that. I'm the loudest cunt in the room 90% of the time but you couldn't get me to give my thoughts in a situation like that in a million years.  EDIT:[ Thank you.](http://i.imgur.com/86etTSn.gif)   Wait. Really? Did a gay couple ask them to cater, or did they just say they wouldn't cater gay weddings? Maybe I run with a different crowd, but a pizza place announcing they're not going to cater a gay wedding is a bit like me announcing I'd rather not make out with the hottest girl in school.   That's precisely what I meant by "solution". Apologies that it came off differently, I agree 100%. My point was that the public doesn't understand that the "solution" to addiction is in mitigation, not eradication, and that our current way of dealing with the problem only ends up costing everyone more money and ruining more lives.    Very much so. The most interesting aspect of drug treatment court for me was that it's more like a therapy session. I'm of the opinion that if you enjoy using drugs, you should be free to do so until your drug use infringes on the rights of others. That's when your addiction becomes a problem for the state and community to address (although that's not to say it shouldn't be addressed sooner). I'm a big advocate for the "it takes a village" approach.   Cassie????   I appreciate it, but I'm only a conduit doing its job. Covering such stories is to my benefit. It just so happens that what benefits me also benefits the public. It's impassioned people such as yourself that really need to be thanked. Without people like you I wouldn't have a story to write.   Funny you mention it. I'm looking at Ross Perot's cigarette boat "Blue Thunder" as I write this.   It's actually astounding how much push back there is to the idea that sticking a badger in a cage is the best way to make it nice. Alongside the public perception of addiction, I think Americas biggest difficulty will be taking capitalism out of the prison system without plangent screams of "socialism" from the right. We've already seen how hard it is to take capitalism out of health care.  EDIT: clarity   Weird. The religious people I know are some of the most positive, genuine, and selfless people I know. I'm as athiest as they come, but still...   I've reported on the rehabilitation of non-violent drug offenders for a while now. Was given unprecedented access into a drug treatment court, which is not open to the public or press. Wrote a solid 15+ articles on the subject for my country's national daily paper. Was interviewed by a PhD student studying the same thing for their dissertation. Was thanked profusely by the lawyers involved in the process (who are some of the most genuine lawyers I've ever met). Basically, everyone who knew anything about the subject was super stoked that it was getting coverage, and a lot of it.  Every article I wrote received little to no attention. The comments came in on the web version were derisory, often along the lines of: "Yeah, I'd fake being 'rehabilitated' as well if it meant getting out of jail."  I can't speak for other nations, but to me the problem is clearly with the public's perception of drug addiction. There is still the prevailing mentality that people do this to themselves, and they get what they deserve. Up until those articles I was as gung-ho about drug reform as you could get. After seeing how much the public actually cares, I've lost every last bit of optimism. My only hope is that enough countries begin taking such approaches, so countries like mine can see just how powerful this kind of rehabilitation can be.  EDIT: THANK YOU FOR THE [GOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD](http://i.imgur.com/86etTSn.gif)   Betty probably said the same thing about her dog.   I've seen it matter firsthand working in a single industry for more than 10 years. You're not even out of high school.  There are times when diversity can be of value, and times where it's not needed. Saying point blank it doesn't matter just shows a total lack of understanding when it comes to workplace dynamics.    ...placing diversity over skill is clearly counter-productive to the bottom line.  How you managed to interpret the exact opposite of what I said is a miracle.  My point was only that diversity can be a positive thing when it's not prioritized above skill.   Why not? Having a gender diverse workplace is shown to have a number of advantages. If you have two equally skilled male and female candidates in a workplace that is largely comprised of men, there are plenty of reasons for why the female candidate would be a better option.    Not to be contrarian, but [workplace diversity does have its advantages.](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/workplace-diversity-can-help-bottom-line-1007)  Obviously, placing diversity over skill is clearly counter-productive to the bottom line.   Probably risks having the whole cave collapse...   "Skeets Miller" is possibly the best journalist name ever.   Glad to see this sub going back to its roots. That "bathrooms should be pull to enter, push to exit" nonsense rustled my jimmies a bit too much.   I guess people don't care when it's TIME magazine. Unabomber, Gaddafi, Bin Laden....   Rolling Stone is hardly the first magazine to put a terrorist on the cover.   A total pisshead is who.    Solid plan. Let's run with it.   I didn't realize /r/showerthoughts had become /r/commonsense    Spot on. No idea why I keep clicking on the comments section. This is the ONLY time it's ever paid off.   We need more women like you commenting in this sub. Dear lord that would be so refreshing. Like a paper daisy on a cum-stained corkboard.   One of the few times I'm glad I got the titties   It was piss my pants or dash for the bathroom. I chose wrong. And yeah, they sell beer inside the stadium but you cant bring it with you to your seat. Hence the chugging.   Nah, Essien's famous screamer against Arsenal in 07/08.    He was far and away my favourite player, which made it all that much worse. But yeah, he was crucial for us for so many years. Won't ever forget the Ess Express and his love for naps.   I know. It'd be like having an Army badge as well as a Green Beret badge.    Whenever I watch a game with the English side of my family and we go down a goal, they all tell me to go take a piss so we can score. Its worked a solid number of times actually.    SO fetch   I'm just being pedantic and I love WWII history. The creator clearly just threw on as many Nazi logos as possible.

It takes one hell of a falsely inflated ego to flip out over something like this. Even if you WERE lying, I've had plenty of dates "reschedule" on me then never follow back up. I'd rather sit at home a watch a movie than go on an awkward date where one of you doesn't want to be there.   $10 says "Easter dinner" comes in scare quotes   Not a hope in hell that is Courtois' fault. Jog on.   LOL a bedpan? With that kind of money I could just pay someone to piss in their mouth.   You try holding it in after chugging as many beers as possible before the whistle.    What kind of ham did you use? And it better have been whole wheat bread. Hovis, preferably.    You know nothing.   My first Chelsea game I went to take a piss. Walked up the stairs back to my seat and the crowd goes nuts.  [This was the goal I missed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl1L67rzuEk)   Called the whole family into the TV room for this one. Jesus Fuck.    I didn't know "heads up" was shitting on someone   Ugh. Yeah, that's the ticket.   Oh man. I saw these chicks in London and this song had me DYING. I want to marry them both. So glad they're making it big time. Only person to make me laugh that hard at a show was John Stuart doing stand up.

Just a heads up.   I think it's pretty fucking stupid that Jesus needed to roll a giant rock out of the way to escape the tomb when he has teleportation powers, but you bet your ass I'll be chompin down on some candy bunnies this weekend.    HA! Thanks for pointing that out.   I posted this same TIL to Archer a while back. Most people on the thread pointed out Hiroo probably wasn't the guy as there were lots of "hold outs."   Not really, no. So just putting it out there. Bring me a puppy, you've got yourself a free stay at Chateau du Weiner!    I mean... it doesn't HAVE to be an aussie.

Thanks.   wasn't just for you. I've had a few messages and there are other similarly themed comments to yours   Yeah... I get that my comment came across that way. But there are a lot of circumstances to my personal relationship and how it ended that has resulted in me being a lot more judicious with who invest myself emotionally in. No sense going into them, this isn't /r/relationships, but for clarity's sake it's not my trust in women that has gone specifically, it's the realization that the person I choose to give myself to wholeheartedly can at any given moment turn around and leave me with my dick in the wind. I doubt that person would ever be a man, so it's not a leap to say that relationship has left me wary of any woman I should want to spend my life with.   Mixed, but close enough.   Go ahead and check my post history. I'm all for remaining with England because of the advantages it offers us. Carry on.   Spoken like a true member of the Empire.  Since you clearly can't pick up on colloquialisms like "readins", I guess I have to explain.  Bermuda was settled by people on their way to settle in America. Therefor anti-British sentiment was strong circa 1775, since many of the people fighting in the Revolutionary War (sorry, "The War Of Independence" in your parlance) had close ties to Bermuda. Famous figures like John Rolfe, for example, had been wrecked in Bermuda (he even named his child with Pocahontas "Bermuda Rolfe.")  Seeing as those who settled in Bermuda did so for the same reasons the colonists settled in Virginia, it's only natural that they would side with their American brothers and sisters in their fight to gain independence.  Subsequently, we have attached our own dollar to the American dollar, become the darling of your biggest corporations, and underwritten the majority of your insurance. We are the oldest self governing colony in the British Empire, and have made shaky steps towards independence on a number of occasions, each push ultimately failing because no longer being a part of Britain would deprive us of valuable education and work opportunities both in the UK and the wider EU.  But what do I know, I'm just a Bermudian journalist with more than a decade worth of experience and research into Bermudian history to draw from.    It was more savage than that.

You've only made me feel sorry that Justin Beiber has to live his life under such scrutiny that regular teenage hoodrat shit qualifies him for being vehemently hated.

When it comes to helping Murica fight off red-coat scum, let alone the wand waving kind, we've [got your back.](http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/the-bermuda-gunpowder-plot.html)   I agree, although I found her more annoyingly stubborn and pompous. The way she walked over the house elves really irked me.    What makes you think Hermione would want a domestic life?    I feel compelled to say sir, yes sir right now.   Actually, my last name is double barrelled. "Spicy-Weiner" just sounds too weird.   Ah. TIL. Good for them. Must've been fun. We in Bermuda had a Cat 4 hit us dead on last summer. One of the coolest things to experience, so long as nobody gets hurt.   IIRC that picture was photoshopped or taken at a totally different time to the hurricane. Did they actually, or was that just more Facebook bullshit?   Well Muslims born and raised in the west usually ARE like every other muslim. Regular people.  The media is responsible for a lot of things, not least of which is the total confusion over what is going on within Islam right now. You're right in that it's helped spread xenophobia and racism and prejudice. I totally agree. You're right in that plenty of other religious groups have practiced the exact same things from time immemorial.  But Islam is in the middle of a massive ideological battle right now that is spilling over, costing hundreds of thousands of lives. Should talking heads be wondering on national television if the guy was a muslim? Of course not, if there's nothing to suggest that. Of COURSE that is wrong.  Is it prejudiced to wonder if a muslim who has carried out a violent attack was doing so in the name of Islam? No, because prejudice is by definition a pre-conceived notion not based on actual experience. If 20 people have been bitten by sharks off of one beach all summer, and a body washes up with chunks taken out of it, you're going to assume a shark did it.  EDIT: #notallsharks   1 + X = 2. Assuming X = 1 is not exactly rash.  It's not prejudicial to assume that if a Muslim commits an act of mass murder, especially in the West, it's usually in the name of ideology. And when it comes to killing people with planes, it's not like there isn't a history. It's irresponsible to use a label such as terrorist without knowing the motive, absolutely, but questioning whether an act of violence was ideologically motivated these days is only natural.   Just to be clear, I lived for three years with kids from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Some of the best friends I ever had. I'm not trying to shit on Muslims. Hell, the most devout Muslims I met were the most morally upstanding people I have ever come across.    I'm one of those people. Worked in journalism from 16 onwards. Went to college. Realized in my first month that it would be way more beneficial to stay in the industry for three years instead of spending money on getting a 3-yr degree.

Please join us at the forum and delve deeper:  https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php      Probably true. One must be pretty extreme to win GOP primaries. It's also become a regional party for the most part; those NE Republicans are considered too liberal.   He needs Jeb, Mitt, or Christie not to run. Then another to have a misstep or somehow they cancel each other out. At that point, people would take a serious look at a Walker candidacy. Or he could be a VP.   I wish he'd retire to Waukesha or wherever he's from.       When I wake up in the morning, I definitely see the world differently than Scott Walker does.    I said that to give him the benefit of the doubt. Some people don't like talking publicly and that's fine. As for the rest of it, he's the only one to blame for making an issue of this.       Truly beautiful. I love the granite boulders.    No kidding. I'd do the southern leg first and get that out of the way before it really starts to roast.    In that case, the appreciation aspect is pretty much a coin toss. I'd look for coins that have strong communities, since in the end, that's the best route to adoption.    You probably should look into the 2.0's then. I try not to be a BitShares shill, but if appreciation and potential are what you want, then a simple coin is nothing compared with putting businesses   banking on the blockchain. Look into NXT and Ethereum also.    Unfortunate. But I can't help wondering why some geniuses voluntarily remove their DNA from the human genetic pool.    Such a wonderful, articulate role model for our nation's youth. I understand the part about being an introvert, and he shouldn't really have to do these press conferences all the time, but...his business is entertainment and this is his brand. Rather than proving that he's an ass who cares mostly about himself, he could have used all that fine money for charity or something.    Most of them are money losers, but it is fun for awhile. I finally had enough of it and moved everything into one, but as long as you don't mind losing a few bucks here and there, then you might also get fortunate and ride the occasional lucky bounce.    You could do it for gift cards or something, but if this was for the currency in general, I don't think it would catch on. Savers are a big segment of any market and that fact provides a great deal of the currency's value.    Presidents often take credit for the portions of an economic cycle they bite off with their terms of office. But Obama has done many things to improve the economy; I'll grant you that.   Wait, I thought Republicans control the CBO now.   Didn't last long, did it?    Fine, but it's his own PR service for press releases; don't call it news.   "Major announcement". He's coming out?  Just kidding.   Naw, just a bit underwhelmed.    "We literally hate you".  http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Punk-band-tells-Gov-Walker-We-literally-hate-6040575.php    The whole Western United States was 'fucking enormous' once also. There were an unlimited number of trees. Just like now, when we pollute the ocean, there's an unlimited amount of water to soak it all up.   I understand where you're coming from. The Alaskan viewpoint is important. But it's a very finite ecosystem and it can be wrecked just as easily as others have been wrecked. We don't need to preserve it all, but we need to be very careful to leave as much as possible unspoiled.    It's a great addition, but...to the moon? On this news? I think that was oversold in the promo.    If hitters in the minors really spent time learning to bunt, it would change the game. Not easy with today's pitching, but also with today's pitching, an extra hit or two can have a real impact on games   batting averages.      Theoretically, couldn't he designate the entire thing a National Monument using his executive authority, bypassing Congress completely? Not sure, but I think that would create a stronger protection than what ANWR has now.       Where's Johnny Appleseed when we need him?   If the dude can still hit, I predict they'll mend fences in a hurry and he'll have every opportunity to crack the starting lineup. Probably a DH at this point, though.    He looks different.   Underwhelming.   Didn't anyone bring this up in her Senate campaign? We're stuck with her for six years.  	42
 I am sorry, but bird is not worth a US Senate Seat or devoting that much land to it.   You are cute! Don't let people ruin your self-esteem like that.   I watch the entire story on the local TV news and the guy who filmed the beating stated that cop clearly used excessive force.   I think the local DA needs to charge the guy with Assault with Deadly Weapon (his hands) just to show to Cops that they cannot use excessive force.    Are they trying to set up a defense for "Not Guilty Due to Insanity" or trying to getting a mitigating circumstance to prevent the prosecutors from using the death penalty  Or is this case to charge her with involuntary manslaugher and get a twelve year jail term instead of life without parole.  Even if they reduced to second degree murder, she would still have to do 45 to life on the term.   I wonder if that person helped the NSA with some its nefarious activities.   I just find that sentenced to be a little stiff for my tastes.  He would have to produce a lot of images like (400-1000) to get that many years.  He should have gone 25 years instead which is still a stiff sentence but more in align with the crime.   It is their problem. Our social welfare system cannot handle them.   Why would we ever want to vote on that dreaded bill again.   The only way that I state "Yes" to this is that Fox News misinforms a large percentage of people on bad policy when it comes to environmental policy.  Since a large percentage of the Fox News viewer is misinformed on environmental policy, Republican politicians do not get significant pressure from their constituency to change environmental policy   What were the results?   Personally, I do not see it as offensive.  Only when the "God" means the God of fundamentalists do I cringe.   She is just like any othe ex-politico making money.  There is a huge market because everybody wants to know her opinion and analysis on things and therefore, she can command that type of dollars. Look at Clinton, Newt, Condi, or even the sociopath Cheney and they get big bucks for making speeches.  And Obama? He will get ton of money when he leaves office.   So is the GOP going to use this a fodder for blaming the Obama administration for making thee economy worse than it actually is   The real question is that removing money is going to desired effects that liberals want which is a more progressive government. Or is it really going not to have any effect because the wealthy and powerful will find other ways to influence government without using direct campaign donations.   Totally agreed, this is a travesty of justice especially knowing that she was a raised a Christian.     What BS is that?   True Libertarians are Ron Paul or Gary Johnson.  Note: They do not believe that LGBT people should be stoned.   Wing nuts at their best!   ISIS is going to turn Iraq into a Islamic theocracy. There is nothing that the US could do or should do except stay out of the conflict.   Spend time tripping on the net.   Well, that has been on a lot of National Enqurier posts.   Don't these people remember  the Status of Force Agreements.    This stuff makes me gnash with me because it could be me.  Drinking and driving is the one of the reasons why I have to practice my recovery program harder or else I will be that driver.   I have not believed a single word of the IRS scandal.  However, this makes me suspicious.  Documents just do not "missing" unless there is something to hid.  The Obama administration should provide these documents so they shut up the GOP.  However, it seems the opposite thing is happening and so maybe there is more than meet the eye on this issue.   There is a really good place off Harbor and Banner that offers $7 hair cuts that are real good and cheap.   It was good to meet your group. Perhaps, I will stop by the next time to play some bocce today.   Is that a little bit of a cheap shot?   She is full of the bling, bling.   Now, the real question is how much that 12 cent hamburger is worth today.  In today's dollars, would be worth $1.72 or $6.00.   This sounds giving out a free lunch.    Good video.   That is Japan is much more densely populated than the US. Yes, California has areas that extremely high density but there is huge distances of very sporadicaly populated where building a train would be inefficient.   Just end halt the railroad.  It is money pit headed towards nowhere. High speed rail works far better on the east coast.   Mile Square Park would have better location for those people who live in Central OC/North OC. (The 37, 35, 72, 66, and 70 run more frequently than the 87 and 90 does).   That area has terrible bus service.  The bus does run there but it only runs like every 80 minutes for both the 87 and 90.   Great, just what we need another military ramp up.   It is okay, but not really epic. I do not understand why his videos get a billion hits.   Your tits are rock hard! We love them!   Turn to my programs of recovery to deal with the pain of hitting rock bottom.  I also had my friends help me through the pain of hitting of rock bottom.     No pants rules!   It is conservative website.  What do you expect?   Yes, it happened yesterday.  It sucked.   Boko Haram is just pure evil.  They are even worse than Al-Queda.  Even Al-Quaeda does not do stuff like this.   Where is the gallow when you need it?  This guy is a poster boy for capital punishment.   Have autism and just not interested.    Blame Citizens United for this one    Do people actually believe this stuff?   There needs to be a serious rewrite of rules regarding the application of use of force by police officers.  Any unauthorized use of force beyond that the proper rules of engagement can result in felony prosecution.  Once you get start jailing cops on mass for excessive force, than you will see these type of incidents.  If I were a prosecutor, I would have zero tolerance for this behavior especially if there is no real or perceived threat engaged by the officer.  The officer should be charged with misdemeanor assault.  He should not lose his job, but he will have a misdemeanor on his record for assault.   What about the concept of separation of Church and State.   beauty.   There is no such connection.  The guy is not even Christian at all.  There is a lot of patriarchal religions other than Christianity where the male is supposed to be the dominant head of the family.  This exists in almost of all traditional society where gender equality has started to be occur in the recent eras.     Maybe we should learn not to trust Iran ever, but to exercise extreme professional skepticism about Iran.  War is not option, but skilled, skeptical diplomacy is the key.   Why would people want that creep to represent them? Or maybe, he is a such creep that he makes $$$ on bad lawsuits.     You never really predict or you can prevent these events.  These are people are pure psychopaths and evil and this stuff cannot happen.  The only thing that you can really do is ban all firearms, but how much with this actually prevent these massive casualties.    The US fails to calculate the human cost of its military inventions and other indirect intervention.  If an external cost was placed on the cost estimate for each foreign incursion, the US would find out that its budgets are too high and would scale back on foreign intervention.    It will be impossible to get to 350 PPM at the current state of politics.  With the EU going to the far right and the US trapped with a far right House of Representatives, there is a little hope of ever getting to 350 PPM.   It should be should job of muckracking reporters like Glen Greenwald to tell the truth  There is too much institutional paranoia and turf-fighting that prevents more open disclosure of state secrets that no longer should be state secrets.   Abbott=Dumb.   The British NHS and the VA model is not the way to go.   Neat   The real solution is provide better individual training to job counselors,    In my job market, I am beginning to partially "give up" my job search.  There is enough work at my local Labor Ready to get at least 32-40 hours a work.  Yes, it is grunt work, but at least there is work.  Most of the problem with people "giving up" exist in small labor markets with limited job opportunities in very limited jobs.  There is only so many grunt jobs/minimum wage jobs to go around.  The flaw in the Republican thinking about not extending benefits is to understand the job markets where there is abundance of low-wage jobs that are easy to get and job markets where there is limited low-wage jobs and there is huge competition for those jobs.  The other issue is that most one-stops center job counselors lack the proper training to teach job-searchers proper job search strategy.  Most of people need to taught how to network outside their comfort zone and how to develop large contacts of people.  The one-stop center really lack the in-depth training to use these resources.   Great freestyling there!   It was too high. It should be about $12.00 an hour which is much more reasonable minimum wage given the country's cost of living.   Awesome!   Beautiful!   Dumb, but kinda funny. I have seen a lot worse than this    Be on Reddit of course   How about cutting some dollars from the prison budget and bring parole to all offenders unless they commit a serious sexual offense or first degree murder.     Tax credits are big wasted of money is a lot of circumstances.   Right-Wing Bigots.   Rich assholes.   Seems like fodder for the NDP in upcoming elections.  Maybe Steven Harper's policies are actually showing signs of faltering.   I wonder what this guy is going to do to his prison cellie if he talks too much.     I better this a lot of people who are going to miss get high with that amount of dope.   There is incredibly stupid idea in California because people drive ridiculous commutes just to work for a job.  Not everybody has the ability to pick up where they live and relocate within five miles of their job.  I can do that especially in an area of abundance of recovery homes until I find a room to rent.  Not everybody can relocate very quickly and very fast.  And a lot of people do not want to move away from their families and friends just to live near where they work just to avoid to paying a tax.   Like deregulation and lowering tax rates is going to improving things.  That might increase corporate funds, but it will funnel either back to repurchasing stock or issuing more dividends to stockholders.   The real issues are not Benghazi, the IRS, or the Fast and the Furious. It is really the drone issue which is the real travesty of justice committed by the Obama administration.   People that habitual drunk driving laws should be subject to felony convictions if they commit at least four drunk driving charges in ten years.  Once they get more than four DUIs in ten year, each subsequent DUI is a felony.  Eventually, the subject offenders will get nailed by the habitual offender laws in their states and will face stiff jail time (like 15+ years in jail for DUI).  If a person commits habitual DUIs over a long period of time, but does not commit four in a ten year window, should not subject to be a felony law.   Like 1991?   Please tell me that we need more patriarchy in this country.  That is all what these "prayer rallies" are all about.    This is way too long to plot to kill somebody. Doing that is just way to throw your life in a heartbeat.   Everytime that I have to read one of these stories is less one reason for to drink again.  Just reading these stories is enough for me not to drink again.   Why this guy only doing 12 years on a murder charge. The guy should eventually get out, but not until doing at least 25-35 years in jail.   Maybe, it is time to quit.   Maybe, we should actually investigate as preventive issue. I think the Republicans should stop looking at the past so much and focus on more what can be done to improve border security.  The blame game with Benghazi should be over by now because the scandal is two years old and any future effort should be focus on improving diplomatic security in the future and any further investigation into Benghazi should be going forwrd.   This is absolutely horrible. I would give the guy 22 years for this.   They are moving to be closer to their manufacturing facilities in the South .  This is very similar when Boeing moved to Chicago to be closer to the defense manufacturing facilities in St. Louis and also be closer to DC for lobbying purposes. Northrop Grumman did the same thing in Southern California.   Taxes are a secondary reason for the move.  It is a just a secondary benefit to the problem.   The problem is that places like Texas encourage America to have a run for the bottom.  People like Rick Perry do not even realize that they are allowing the corporate vampires to create a race to the bottom by making all of these business go to places where they score cheaper labor and bad regulations instead of making their regulations similar to California. However, they are so dumb and beholden to the dollar, that they do not realize that they are not helping the their own citizens.   How is Robocop is going to more efficient at catching the bad guys than humans are?   Has anybody look at the old tests that they give eighth grades back in 1912? I bet your average twelfth graders could not even pass that.   The stupid library and the Anaheim Work Center all use Internet Explorer. It is the government that likes to use Internet Explorer.   A easy Hilary Clinton blowout for sure.    That is so sad, but some people just lack the coping skills to handle surprise rejection.   Maybe Christie is finally going to jail.   I went to treatment and built a strong support network. I also moved to a sober living. My story is a little bit complicated because of several major relapses and two duis. But I finally got year clean. Also, do not hang out friends who chronically smoke weed and stay way from friends who recreationally smoke until you got one year clean and are not triggered in any form by people who smoke on front of you.    Or better yet, pass out on the floor.   Throw up.   Since I am in recovery, I can relocated very easily and very quickly.   The cost of living is very high in LA and it has hard to find a place to live quickly unless you are in recovery.  The best way is to fake that you are in recovery and you will find it a lot faster to find housing cheaply. When you are in recovery, it is very easy to find cheap places to live that offer weekly rentals compared to living in a hotel that will be very expensive and unaffordable at that wage.   Unless the job is a job that is going to give a foothold into a industry (such as entertainment) that is around in Southern California or the employer will have a lot of contacts for future employment in that industry, I would say no.   Jail them for life without parole.  They are bunch of real creeps that need locked in the SHU and left to rot there for the rest of their life.   Please? Do not come here.  You are not welcomed.   American States Utitilies is a company to look at.   I think it is overgeneralization. However, some of those guys are linked to fringe right-wing sights, not your are typical wise-use supporters like Bundy is.  They are not terrorists, but rather people that are sketchy and unbalanced.  The other people just believe in the rights of landowners over the rights of the federal government.  In reality, this is over very different interpretations of the constitution and not people who are considered to be domestic terrorists.    In some places, it might. It might also inspire some gun nuts to accidentely kill somebody.  Concealed-carry laws should require strict background checks and risk assessments for the reason for having them.  There is needs to be a good, justifiable reason why you should the right to carry loaded gun in public concealed.   So the local news is going to replace the paper.  Who is going to report on the local news once the OC Register.  There is no local cable news network that dedicates itself to local coverage.     Why would anybody vote that bill?   The answer to that question is "No" although I prefer him to Chris Christie or Ted Cruz. Rand Paul is better candidate than Ted Cruz/Chris Christie, but I think that he would dismantle too many government programs.   Try to post the link to City-Data which is another forum that deals area-specific issues.  Topix is another but that site is loaded with right-wing nutjobs .   Yes, that sounds pretty fishy to me.  Have you checked a premium support calculator yet?   So is going to work at place like Labor Ready a good idea for the long-term unemployed at this point even though they are very highly-skilled labor?   There is always LaborReady. Yes, I might do that (not because I running out of money), but I have to start working soon (at any job).   Orange County is doing very well economically.  Just remember to live in North OC to avoid high rent costs.  The best area is the border between Garden Grove/Westminster to avoid getting nailed on high rent costs.   Usually two interviews for all of the jobs that I have gotten.   I have never had Craigslist lied about salary, but for accounting and finance openings on Craigslist, companies are usually for real and not shady.   He will got some serious prison time for this.  He will least at get five years for this crime as stated in Georiga Code Section No. 16-5-70 (http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-5/article-5/16-5-70/)   The GOP is going to have a field day with these scandals.   It is all of those federal dollar is why prisoners are overclogged.  If the states did not receive all of the dollars in the 1990s, the states would have not adopted such draconian truth-in-sentencing laws.    I would to work in the FBI and go after corporate crooks at Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JP Morgan.  That would be sole mission if I was in charge of FBI instead of chasing nonexistent terror threats.   Flipping over in my car on second DUI. Could have killed somebody and gotten 15 years to life.  That was scary.   Get drunk at work and drive home.  Got second DUI in three months and never drove since.   Nope because it based on chemicals that weave thoughts based on prior memories and things from senses.   The devil.   Why should let some foreign power control the Internet? Do really want the EU to control it?   Yeah, Single Payer will not happen any time soon because the GOP is going to get the Senate back in 2014.    I hope they do not schedule it during rush hour.  That would be insane knowing how bad the I-405 south gets.    Is this is a prelude to war?   I doubt that there is anything that the US can do.   Call my friend's business called Traffic Tax Services at (714) 603-2343.  For more details, please go to (http://www.trafficticketfixers.com/).  He advertises a 90% success rate, but I am not sure that if it accurate. Still, the method that he uses will significantly reduce the chance of getting conviction.. (Note: This business is legit).   Cashiers.   What an ass.   Great! This sounds like a flop.   Bitcoins are no good.   Another dumb move by the GOP.   This is where they could nail bush "2340A. Torture  (a) Offense.Whoever outside the United States commits or attempts to commit torture shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both, and if death results to any person from conduct prohibited by this subsection, shall be punished by death or imprisoned for any term of years or for life.  (b) Jurisdiction.There is jurisdiction over the activity prohibited in subsection (a) if  (1) the alleged offender is a national of the United States; or  (2) the alleged offender is present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or alleged offender.  (c) Conspiracy.A person who conspires to commit an offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy."    2 DUIs in a year.  Top that.   My mom.   Yeah, but the Supreme Court would block such lawsuits.   Hmm. I had little issue with Kaiser plans at all.   Getting my second DUI.   This shows how weak the DUI laws are in that state.  She should get at least five years in prison.   Maybe, they regrwted that they did vote for Hilliary in the 2008 primaries.   The Harbor bus on the weekends can be bad. I remember going to Target one day and there was no bus for 40 minutes on the Northbound route. So I eventually took the Southbound route to the Walmart  The 56 was nailed me a couple of times but mainly due to construction delays that has nailed me with two job interviews.   He is an idiot.  Complete bungler.   US progressives need to understand the limits of what state intervention in the economy is.  Currently, there is too little regulation and state intervention in the US, but this country shows what too much overreach does.   This is just like Sochi. It is massive waste of public finances on facility that will have little long-term return on capital.   As much that I despied Morsei regime, this is totally bad tactics by the Egyptian government.  A better alternative by the military-backed government was to let Morsi go into exile into another country (aka: UAE or Saudi Arabia)   Cooper Fellowship has some rooms, but you need to be in  recovery and they have mandatory meeting requirements.  In addition, you have to share a room with somebody else.   He never get the death penalty. California is going to real hard time to getting a death penalty procedure past the Ninth Circuit and with the drug shortage, it will be even harder to get the proper drugs even if they did all of the death penalty procedures correctly.   This shows the effect of the insanity of being drunk.   dumbass.   Why do we want to have guns on post office ground, but refuse to extend unemployment insurance? What gives you right to bring a stupid gun into a post office? You are not hunting anything or you are not imminent danger of getting shto.   Yeah, I had a similar story. I lost my glasses in my own room. Could not find them.  Roommate finds the room in an area that I would not even consider looking for in my bedroom.   Maybe, the economy actually headed towards another downturn.   Those guy are psycho! Whole life term for those fools.   It seems that austerity never leads to any solution.   Hike gasoline to $8.00 a gallon in the US and you start to see some major changes.  The only to cut emission to stick it to people in their pocketbooks.   I lost several accounting jobs because I have had a serious case of ADHD. I just beginning to realize that my main problem is not ADHD, but the selection of music that I listen to.  I have to listen minimal or ambient music to have insane concentration.  I have the correct medication regiment, but I cannot function in perfectly silent background.  I guess ambient music has the correct connection to my brain.    I totally agree.   Is that a first world problem?   Why should they waste time with that?   What about in California?   Damn Brits!   Move it to a Schedule II drug.   He has the same approval ratings of Congress.   When will the India do something culture of male aggressiveness that promote thus behavior in the first place.   Consequences of a tax code gone insane.   It is because she was hot mama that it cost so much money If it was a dude, he would be a death row in a heart beat.   Why would I?  With the GOP, nothing is going get done. Obama is done and finished now.   Beautiful shot.   Where did you get that piece of proganda? The American Family Association or The Family Research Council.   He is a crook.   What a bunch of savages! They should be locked for a term not exceeding 50 years.   When I was 12.   Taking my pills.   bored at home.   This guy is a nut.   Well, that is the cost when you get duped by Goldman Sachs and you cannot collect your taxes properly.   Maybe they need join the fellowship Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob.   What is their fear?     This guy needs to wait ten years without commit another sex offense or felony (except for minor drug possession and pass a psychological evaluation before he can clear to practice the bar.   Having two DUIs.   They should have kept the major routes in central and North OC running until 2:30 AM such as the 53, 60, 43, 57, 50, 42, 29, 91, 1, 89, 47, 64, 54.   Yeah, that is why I did not go to my friends party last night.   The only way to end the problem is the enacting the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and tax, tax, and more tax until the corporate are banks are broken into dozens and dozens of regional and local banks that invest directly into the local and regional economies.  Our regulators are afraid of enacting a massive Sherman Anti-Trust act against the banks to break them up into dozens and dozens of large regional and local banks that are force to compete against each other instead of engaging in massive collusion.  This is the real free-market capitalism and not crony monopoly capitalism.   A UFO?   Because it upsets the balance sheets of his crony capitalist supporters.  Climate change is real and the right denies like a drug addiction because it undermines their entire political philosophy.   He never made reached his "potential" on the Lakers. How is another teaming going to use this guys abilities.   He is a punk.   Construction jobs.   I have been to Burning Man five times.   At my college.  	194

 For $80k you might as well get a Tesla instead for a few bucks more. But maybe that's what he's getting at with letting this generation of ELR retire so they can have something better to go after Tesla with in the future. He's been involved with that E-tron R8 at Audi. I'm all for something like that.      Your copy paste cop defense argument is weak. This was a murder. And he lied in the police report to CYA.   Next outrage: Cop shoots a 12 year old kid in the back. Why is it always shoot to kill? Why is running or holding a gun or resisting arrest now an instant death sentence? Even Rodney King wouldn't have a chance these days.   Rutledge Wood is just great. So are Freiburger   Finnegan. Hey Derek.   Yeah I'm okay with Top Gear USA. It's not gonna be the same so I'm glad they abandoned the British format after S1. Who needs 10 minutes every episode with some asshole celebrity driving a cheap car around the same track? Rutledge Wood is the breakout star of TGA. Tanner can really drive. Adam I'm still not sold on. Adam Carolla might be good in that spot but you'll eventually have to fire him for being a dick like Clarkson.  But TGA is better than no Top Gear or all these dumb shows about flipping cars for cash, screwing people over and being a douchebag. We have our quota there. Also TGA doesn't shit all over American cars at every turn. Roadkill is fun but most of those cars are complete garbage not worth putting a dime into. I guess that's part of its charm though.      However I'm pretty sure Top Gear will carry on...after all, how many different Dr. Who's has the BBC put on the air?   Exactly. Sure he's funny and makes good television but he's a big ugly bigoted asshole baby. You can't drop the N word on camera, incite a near riot in a foreign country, and beat up your producer in the span of a few months and expect to remain employed by a state run television network.     	10
 That toy really tied the room together, dude   I am sure someone can give you a better answer but anecdotally - you adjust. It felt very weird when I went from using the spare dojo iatio to my own. Everything felt very odd but I quickly adjusted. I would look at sizing charts and, as you said, const your sensei.  Welcome to the sport!

Some what tangential but I was at an animal behavior seminar (I work for a veterinary diagnostics biotech company) and one of the presenters who studies wild dogs and wolves indicated that muzzle and face 'biting' among dogs is a symbol of affection. Pretty cool stuff to see especially during play.   No problem! It's a lot of fun and there are always things going on with the program as far as activities and events. Here is the site: http://blogs.portlandschools.org/phspma/    Portland mentoring alliance through portland high school. You are matched with a student with whom you have similar interests and you spend time each week doing something you both enjoy. It can be hugely important to some of the kids and is a pretty fun program. Its a great way to help at risk kids keep out of trouble and to help other kids learn more about the world and get them through that awkward process of becoming an adult. They always need mentors, especially male mentors.   This. My SO and I play a game we call 'Left, Right, Straight' in which we drive/walk around town and pick random turns at each intersection. We've discovered a lot of awesome stuff about our city doing this. If you have GPS on your phone you've got nothing to worry about; just have fun.   Thanks! The leave it command sounds like it might be a huge help in this; I hadn't even thought about it for squirrels!   Thanks for all of the info! She certainly has a big personality. She does have the husky independence but that is overlayed by the  Basenjii stubbornness. There are days where she listens great and others where the only reason I know she hasn't gone deaf is her running to the sound of me making a peanut butter sandwich. If she doesn't want to do something she will protest the whole way.  I'm going to work on trying some of her commands in different environments, that's a pretty solid bit of insight! We do short leash her when we walk past a few certain houses and cherry trees but I want to try to break her from the habit of eating everything. I'm afraid she's going to swallow something dangerous that we might not have been able to spot in the grass some day.   Thanks again!   She's got a pretty good drop it but she keeps going if it's something she can eat. I'll check out the links to see if there is a better way to deploy it than we currently are. Thanks!  As for the interactive toy - We tried that one. She likes to take things apart if it's possible. She burns through the 'indestructible' toys in no time. Any feeder toys that are as rugged as the 'black Kong' that you'd recommend?   Just discovered this sub. So far there is a lot of good information but so far I've yet to stumble across a thread with the answers I'm hoping to find.   We adopted a 2yo Husky/Basenji/Border Collie mix this past March and she walks very well on a leash over all, but, often times she can be pretty difficult. She tries to eat everything on the ground; berries, trash, bugs, etc. We feed her a stable diet that our vet approves of (activity level and weight appropriate 2x a day at regular times) but it makes no difference. We've tried walking using small treats and redirection but that still didn't help. She does eat incredible quickly at breakfast and dinner and when we are putting food in her dish will do every trick she knows at once (It actually is as funny and endearing as it sounds). She loves to eat but we keep her at the target weight assigned by our vet.  Eventually we'd like to train her off leash but it's seeming that between her prey drive (She locks on to any squirrel or bird) and her focus on what might be edible on the ground suggest that it might not be a possibility in the near future.   Any tips on how to get her to stop trying to eat the neighborhood trash? Bonus tips for working on prey drive (We currently make her sit, redirect her attention to us, and wait for her calm down when she locks on to a squirrel.)?  Thanks!    * Fort Williams and the Portland headlight in Cape Elizabeth are pretty excellent if you like the cliff over the ocean feel. * take a ferry from Commercial st to any of the islands or just ride one around the loop to see the coast and skyline * Check out the cemetery on Stevens ave. I know it sounds a bit macabre but it truly is scenic and beautiful. All of the statues and monuments make it feel like walking through a museum and there is a small duck pond in the back.  * Deering Oaks park has some nice scenery and usually some cool stuff going on. Bintliffs Cafe right off the park has the best brunch in the city IMO. There is also The Holy Donut right there which makes some of the best you'll ever have. *   Riverton trolley park has trails through the woods that are literally impossible to get lost on and have cool stuff to look at like a river and a 'castle' wall. The Alligash Brewery is right across the street and will serve you with a free flight of their beers upon walking in. * The back bay has a 3 mile trail loop as well as some benches and cool views of the city skyline. Not too far down the street is my favorite sandwich shop called The Local Press (woodford st) which is a must try.  * if you're looking to get out of the cold and grab a drink or food check out Novare Res for over 500 beers and small but pretty impressive food plates (Crab Rangoon grilled cheese sandwiches are killer) or Sillys for a pretty cool menus and stellar shakes.  E - spelling    What do you think you're doing? Only Garth and I get to talk to the camera   I've recently started learning Toyama ryu (I practice MSR) to 'save my knees/legs' from over training. Toyama is a requirement for nidan testing in my organization so it is something I will need to learn anyway. My question is this - in the fourth form, Ushiro, there is a moment where both arms open and the chest is completely exposed. What is the purpose of this? My instructor believes it is to generate power or that it may possibly be to 'move bystanders' out of the way. Any insight?   One major contributing factor is what is called your chronotype. Tons of functions in our bodies are governed by cirvadian rythems which are ~24 hour cycles that influence the way many functions in your body work. An example of this is how you always seem to get hungry around the same time each day, or better for this thread, how you get jet lagged when you fly a few timezones away. You have a set of very specific proteins that, through a relay of 'signals' in your brain, adjust to light/dark cycles. These proteins interact to make a 'clock'. This clock has an output which could be anything from releasing certain hormones to make you sleepy to raising or lowering your body temperature. Now here is where chronotype comes in. Each "healthy" persons brain chemistry functions largely the same but with some differences - timing of protein and gene interactions are among them. Some people, no matter how regular and consistent their schedule or routine will always function better when they wake up late. Some earlier. It comes down to environment, life style, and genetics.

 The main cause for America's transition from isolationism is contained in NSC-68, a National Security Council document written for Truman that described the global threats facing the US. Released on April 7, 1950, its primary authors, Paul Nitze, Dean Acheson, and Chip Bohlen declared that to protect the free world from communist aggression, the US must abandon any plans for slipping back into isolationism. It recommended a substantial increase in defense spending that included growing the military's strength and investments in missile delivery systems for nuclear weapons. Two months after the document's release the Korean War broke out, lending credence to the writers' predictions about communism.   These are the politicians who expect the average American to live on a minimum wage and still pay rent, and if the person complained, politicians would advise them to find a better job. The pay for the average American has remained stagnant since 1972, so I have little pity for the politico's not receiving a cost of living adjustment.   Feel free to ask for assistance, but I need more information on the specifics of your class. I would also suggest posting your question to r/askhistorians for more input.   As an American historian who knows 1950's films intimately, I would suggest you research about the change in the movie industry during this period from a vertically integrated studio model to the now familiar producer/director model. The federal government deemed the old studio model as too monopolistic because studios owned the film process from the creation of a film to its final viewing in the theater. If the city you live in has a Paramount theater, it's because the studio once owned that theater.      You can see the change in film during the 1950s because directors suddenly had more influence in their work. A good example is *Shane*, directed by George Stevens, in which the gun is no longer considered in heroic terms, instead becoming the last line of defense for a good man.      Films addressing Cold War fears began appearing around this time, and Sam Fuller's *Pick Up on South Street* documents this superbly using characters such as a pickpocket and a prostitute to thwart a communist plan to steal atomic secrets.      Science-fiction movies also appeared regularly during the period with the original *War of the Worlds* directed by Byron Haskins. The special effects work he pioneered on this film helped set the stage for Star Trek.  All three films debuted just weeks apart during 1953, but each owed its production to the shift from a studio system to the director/producer model.    I wonder if any of the homeless people living in the Washington, D.C. area would complain about sleeping in a warm, safe congressional office.   We came up to LA from San Diego, and everyone had a great time. We caravaned in about 5 cars, and gathered together after the tour in a park by a golf course to have beers and grill. I always carried my golf clubs in the trunk of my car in those days, so I pulled them out and played the par 3 hole next to our spot repeatedly between the groups playing it. It's what I loved about the small history graduate program at SDSU; our profs often became very good friends.   The profs name is Sarah Elkind, and the reason we concentrated on the port and railways is because her PH.d. from Michigan focused on environmental and urban history. It was a great class that sometimes met outside the campus, as when the class took a walking tour of the L.A. river that highlighted its importance for the city.   I took a seminar on the history of Los Angeles that included an examination of its success relative to San Diego and San Francisco. L.A.'s overshadowing of San Diego rests on a number of factors. First, the fight over the terminus of the intercontinental railroad, and which towns in California received regular service; L.A. won this battle. Next, the two cities battled over becoming the port destination for import and export; L.A. won this battle, as well. Finally, when William Mulholland stole the water rights from Owen Valley and diverted it to L.A., the lushness it brought to the nearby California valleys made the city more attractive than arid San Diego.

Since the *Fog of War* is mentioned, McNamara stated in the documentary that if the U.S. had lost WWII, he and other planners would probably have been charged with war crimes. I remember this admission because of the shock I felt at hearing it, and the understanding that in any war, the winners decide the rules.   I understand the ideology of providing monies to a country during wartime conflicts, but the Lend-Lease deal with Britain and Russia were extremely controversial during the run-up to WWII, according to Eric Goldman in *The Crucial Decade: 1945-1955*. The first time I've encountered explicit mention of the U.S. providing aid is during the Marshall Plan, and it was seen as a way of influencing the political outcomes in Greece and Italy. We now provide financial aid to a large number of countries, and threaten to withhold funds when countries behave badly, but I'm trying to discover when this strategy became a policy for the government. Thank you for the reply.   Thank you for this answer; it will point me in the correct direction.   The Worldnews' mods are showing a level of intolerance by labeling this story "Not Major World News".    Why is original commentary and analysis on Salon being labeled "rehosted content" when it clearly is not?   There is a wonderful, short book by the black historian Henry Gates titled Colored People: A Memoir (New York: Vintage Books, 1995), that speaks to the changing attitudes of African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. Gates spent his childhood in North Carolina, coming of age during the lunch counter sit-ins taking place in his local city. He clearly documents the attitudes of black Americans as violence erupted across the country during the various civil rights demonstrations.    Sure, a person could move to California, but that was a very long, hazardous trek because the railroads hadn't expanded to the west coast, and the travel was by foot, wagon, or ship. Since the Panama Canal wasn't open, ships had to travel around the coast of Argentina and skirt Mexico before arriving in California. The trip was probably as hazardous as fighting in the war.   These areas were, indeed, fertile for thousands of years before human writing existed. The encroachment of the desert over the centuries has covered much of the area, and it's expected to continue expanding south into Africa.   Most of the posted comments provide good information, but I'd suggest narrowing your subject matter to specific areas. Instead of writing a historiography of WWII, examine writings about the Battle of the Bulge; instead of the Cold War, write about the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Berlin Air Resupply missions. The tighter your paper's focus, the better it'll appear to a reader. Finally, always approach your readings by focusing on the differences between authors' approaches or methods. In many ways you're writing a series of book reviews on a single historical event. If you need help choosing the books to include in your historiography, begin with the most contemporary historian's writing on the subject and use his/her bibliography to identify the historical works they relied upon.   I don't know if Soviet spying on the Manhattan Project counts as a conspiracy, but Stalin knew about the bomb well before its use or the public's discovery. There are also theories about the decision to use the bomb, that some might find conspiracy related.   One of the best sources to answer this question comes from Lisle Rose. He described early public reaction to nuclear testing as popular, and that people flocked to the desert to watch tests. As for the health ramifications caused by radiation, the U.S. government was well aware of its dangers, even to the extent that it barred newspaper reporters and photographers not approved by the government from visiting Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The public didn't really become aware of the danger from radiation until after Japanese fishermen working in the area of the Bikini Atoll tests became sick and the news went public.      Source:   1.

There are also many books written on the subject, but most are found in university libraries as opposed to local county or city libraries.   The term "shell shock" refers to a condition that VA mental health professionals now call PTSD. The term first came about during WWI and its aftermath when soldiers exhibited symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking, fugues, and panic induced by loud noises. After intense periods of enemy shelling, a spike rose in soldiers reporting these symptoms leading health officials to use the term "shell shock." Doctors blamed the concussive blasts from the shelling for the symptoms and believed it was a physical problem, overcome by simply resting.      As the science of mental health improved over the century, doctors recognized the symptoms as a mental disorder that could be controlled with proper care.      Sources:      1.

What is editorialized about this lede. I copied and pasted it straight from the article.   The author ignored the role Mormonism played in Romney's life. The mormons are rabidly anti-gay, as demonstrated by its role in defeating Proposition 8 in California.    I cannot address Taft's role in trust busting, however, Theodore Roosevelt's reasons for going after these entities were based on his close relationship with both the environment and the American people. As a child, Roosevelt collected animal, insect, and plant specimens for classification in his many journals and diaries. During his college years, he left school to mourn the death of his first wife, moving out west to start a cattle ranch. He formed close relationships with migrants who settled on undeveloped land, and understood the daily struggle these people faced. The most pernicious obstacle for these settlers was the large corporations and railroads that simply took resources from the settlers' lands without compensation. When Roosevelt became an "accidental president" after the assassination of McKinley, he seized the opportunity to protect the environment and American citizens from unfair trust practices by setting aside huge swaths of land as national parks for future generations. Once called a "traitor to his class" by the wealthy trust owners, Roosevelt was considered a hero by his fellow citizens.      Sources:   Brands, H. W.

I once worked for the College Board as a phone pollster and my first question is: where did the pollsters obtain its phone list of possible interviewees? Individuals who end up on these lists have usually shown a willingness to answer polls in the past. These people are usually better educated, and in a comfortable living situation. A proper polling population should cross social and economic boundaries, thereby providing more diverse answers that reflect contemporary socioeconomic realities.   Weiner, Tim *Enemies: a history of the FBI* pages 258-259 detail the bugging of MLK, and page 273 discusses the FBI efforts to force MLK's suicide.   Apparently you cited Wiener without reading his book, but there's a section at the book's end that provides the evidence of the numerous black-bag operations that targeted MLK.   Untrue...Weiner documents attempts by the FBI to convince MLK to commit suicide through the release of documents and a letter writing campaign by FBI agents to the civil right's leader. The FBI also participated in "black-bag operations" without warrants that were essentially breaking-and-entering crimes, and frequently targeted MLK. edit: The true extent of the spying on Vietnam war protestors and civil rights advocates will never be known because a huge collection of J.E. Hoover's secret documents were burned after his death.   You are very welcome.   Americans attributed the loss of China to the Truman administration and its backlash swept Eisenhower and the Republicans back into power after almost 2 decades of Democratic party rule. Communism was tightly wound together with the U.S. social and labor movements of the early 20th century, and it was greatly feared because of its challenge to democracy and capitalism. This is a recurring theme in John Gaddis' *The Cold War a new history* and *We now know: rethinking Cold War history*, in which Mao first reached out to the U.S. for help before being rebuffed, causing the Chinese turn to Russia. Lisle Rose describes the political climate of the 1950s in *The Cold War comes to Main Street : America in 1950.* Stalin's efforts to consolidate Russia's satellite nations were brutal, and this played on Americans' fears of an outbreak of war that included nuclear warfare. Eisenhower's reputation as a military leader, and the Republican Party's sable-rattling, signaled confidence to a frightened country that it believed Democrat's lacked.   According to Bruce Schulman's *Lyndon B. Johnson and American liberalism : a brief biography with documents*, both LBJ and Kennedy viewed the loss of Vietnam as both a victory for communism, and a political grenade for the Democratic Party. The Dems blamed the loss of China to communism for the party's election losses to Republican Party during the Eisenhower years. Dems feared that if the U.S. lost Vietnam, Republicans would recapture majorities in both houses and the presidency. Eric Goldman's *The crucial decade : America, 1945-1955* was written in the 1960s, but it also makes mention of the political repercussions facing the Democratic Party if it lost Vietnam.   My answer isn't as a historian, but it comes from lived experience. About twenty-five years ago I worked for military intelligence as an ELINT analyst. One of the sites I operated from was run by the NSA, and located in an allied country where we collected and analyzed satellite and missile telemetry from hostile nations. At this site, the analysts were guarded by armed MPs, and the equipment was rigged with self-destruct explosives in the event of a foreign military attack. To complete the destruction, two f16s from a nearby airbase remained on daily alert to bomb the site so that nothing remained for the enemy to use.   According to Eric Arnesen in *The Black Worker: Race, Labor, and Civil Rights since Emancipation* and Richard Valelly in *The Two Reconstructions: the Struggle for Black Enfranchisement*, slaves so despised their masters that one of the first things they did as freemen was change given names. Instead, they adopted names taken from places, trades, and even African relatives. Keeping the master's name was considered a last resort as a means to escape the rampant violence visited on newly freed blacks.   The Roediger book deals explicitly with Eastern European immigrants.   Two wrongs don't make a right, but isn't the gang rape of women in India a common occurrence?   There are many authors who discuss race and the immigrant's path to acceptance as a member of the "white race", but David Roediger's *Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White* is probably the most concise. As one commenter mentioned without going into detail, the process was related to economic and political power. An individual gained access through attaining a steady, well-paying job, but the best means was by purchasing land and building a house, or buying a preexisting house. According to Roediger, these two conditions signaled to the community at large that the individual held a stake in the nation's continuing success. The most problematic "whites" were the Jews because of the rampant antisemitism both in the U.S. and abroad, but even they could be accepted if they satisfied the job and house provision. Asians and blacks were excluded from this process by the National Association of Realtors which instituted a system of "red lining". The institution used signed covenants to restrict homeowners within a community from selling their homes to African-Americans or any other minority the community deemed unwelcome. On Realtor maps these areas were outlined using red, thus the term "red lining."  For more information here is a list of books: * Fenians, Freedmen, and Southern Whites by Mitchell Snay * Inventing the "American Way" by Wendy Wall * My Blue Heaven: life and politics in working-class suburbs of Los Angeles by Becky Nicolaides * Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight by Eric Avila * Urban Revolt: ethnic politics in the nineteenth-century Chicago labor movement by Eric Hirsch * White Flight: Atlanta and the making of modern conservatism by Kevin Kruse   According to Zubok's *Inside the Kremlin's Cold War,"* and *Gulag: a history* by Anne Applebaum, not only did soldiers have to share a rifle, many were forced to collect their weapons and ammunition off of dead Soviet and German soldiers. Both authors report soldiers going into battle with sharpened pitchforks and scythes for weapons.   If you want a concise history through timelines I suggest reading *Map of Time: an Introduction to Big History* by David Christian. He also does a beautiful TedTalk on the book.   we can assume he didn't pay for grades, but if he did, he got cheated.   I've studied T. Roosevelt's life pretty extensively, and he was a contemporary of John Muir. Roosevelt's intention for setting aside so much federal land was so the American public could enjoy camping in the wild.    JFK's grades were horrible; he barely maintained a passing grade point average.   I refuse to tell the reader what to think about an article.

I would ask: "If your party is completely against raising taxes, why did you vote to raise the payroll tax, which impacts the majority of hourly workers, but voted not to raise taxes on those making more than 200k?"   Boeing is currently threatening to move out of the Seattle area because of labor issues, and it is pressing the city and state for more incentives to remain in the area. It's silly to give such perks to an obviously declining company.   I've read a number of historians (Foner, Ward, Kennedy, Norton) who've stated that the recession began in the early 1920s, and the Stock Market crash of 1929 was just a part of a longer economic downturn.   I was a TA for Eve Kornfeld, a prominent historian a pre-colonial and colonial American, and she explained the gendered immigration patterns of early settlers as a result of economic interests. She said the Virginia area became a focus of interest for British companies that were searching for new sources of raw materials. These companies would advertise for men by espousing the New World as a means of new opportunities and wealth. They offered to pay the individuals way via ship and provide them with food, and in return the individual would labor honestly and without trouble for six years. When the six years passed, the individual was given a plot of land and the means necessary to make it prosper. When the individual arrived in Virginia, a local would buy his contract from the British company, and the man would now work for a new employer for the six years. If his new employer accused him of being difficult, he could add more time to the contract. New immigrants to the Northern U.S. were mostly families because they were moving to escape religious persecution. They came to the new world as a family unit, and encouraged settlement as a family unit. The individual's life expectancy was also very short during this period and the new world's appetite for new immigrants remained constant. I hope this explanation helps.   i know, but that acronym just seems so unexpectedly appropriate for the NSA; either they didn't write the acronym down or didn't care what the public might read into it.   who out there didn't read that acronym as i con the record? it's truth in advertising.   There is a wonderful book by Timothy Egan called *The Big Burn* that talks about the birth of the U.S. Forestry Service and T. Roosevelt's role in setting aside land for the national forest. It details the huge forest fire of 1910 that spread across Washington, Idaho, and Michigan, and how the newly appointed forest rangers and volunteers battled to fight the fire. One of the tidbits I found interesting was that Ed Polaski, a forest ranger, invented the axe that all modern firefighters now carry but never received any financial gain because he didn't patent the design. As a result of the 1910 fire, Polaski lost all the sight in one eye, and damage to the other eye left his vision blurry. The saddest portion of the book details the lack of social and medical support the rangers received after risking their lives. The men were forced to pay their own medical bills and none of them received pensions or disability payments. Because of their injuries, many suffered financial ruin and died poor.   in virtually every book i've read on this subject, stalin's need for an american invasion of france was to force germany to shift resources away from the russian front, and relieve pressure on the russian military. as the winter took its toll on germany the need became less pressing, but stalin still continued to insist on the invasion. another rarely mentioned fact is that the japanese 5th army was amassed on the chinese/soviet border. because japan and russia were members of a non-aggression pact signed in 1905 (T. Roosevelt won a nobel prize for mediating this), stalin knew this border was safe. the japanese were terrified the russians would enter the war against them, and would probably have surrendered before the bomb drop on hiroshima (stated by: arnold, leahy, macarthur, eisenhower). i've always asked myself why truman didn't drop the bomb as a demonstration on the japanese army amassed across the border from russia? it was a military target and the demonstration would reveal to both russia and japan the bomb's power. the arms race would probably have still occurred, but there might have been less animosity between the russia and the u.s.   I once took a seminar on the history of modern germany - bismark to adenauer In regards to hitler, my prof. offered two factors he felt were decisive for the nazis to gain power. first, the radio was employed to disseminate a constant stream of pro-nazi propaganda. he said that every home in germany was required to have a radio, and if it wasn't on, the homeowners were regarded with suspicion and reported to the authorities. second, the concentration camps began as a political tool used to scare local social-democrats and communists within the population. this soon expanded to include religious leaders and newspaper writers/editors/owners. many of the individuals swallowed up in the camps were later released and the stories they told about the camps were positive.  at the time, many of the camps were located in secluded, forested areas where the local populations rarely encountered it. most germans, he stated, were simply happy they weren't imprisoned in one. as the camps evolved and became more closely associated with jewish imprisonment, they were ignored by the population. in the nazi party's early days, these camps were full of political prisoners, and the mere thought of ending up in one kept the population from supporting the party's opponents.   I had friends that TAed for him, and I've read his *Maps of Time: an Introduction to Big History* twice. I took a seminar on historical methodology, which is when I read his book for the first time. We got to meet him and ask questions the week our group covered the big history topic. I enjoy his writing and highly recommend the book. Dr. Christian moved back to Australia, but I'm not sure where he's teaching.    It was at SDSU and so long ago I can't remember the profs. name.   This seminar did include Nicholaides, McGirr, and Davis (not his ecology of fear), and these three are known as part of a California history clique.   I can only speak to the seminars that I've been directly involved in, and it may vary from institution to institution. A history seminar will delve deeply into the history of a subject, location, or even ideology, among many other things. For example, a seminar on the history of Los Angeles would require a number of core books about the city's social, economic, political, and physical history for the student to read weekly/biweekly. Additionally, the student is assigned a book from the list to review. Book reviews are generally 6-10 pages and focus on where the book fits within 1) its historiography, 2) the author's citations and historical methodology, 3) the argument's strengths and weaknesses, 4) and what the author's argument adds to the historiography. The instructor will also offer subjects for deeper historical inspection that relate to the course, and the student is assigned a 20-30 page paper to respond. The seminar generally meets weekly to discuss assignments and the readings, and I always found it the most interesting portion because my fellow students often noticed things that I did not, thus expanding my knowledge. Anyway, the gist of it is there's a lot of reading and writing involved, but if you love history, a seminar's the best thing since sliced bread.   Let's go ahead and blame Manning's release of documents for helping radicals recruit new members; let's forget that the incidents documented in the leaks really happened and could be seen as a recruiting tool.   There were multiple contemporaneous military studies completed at the end of the war that stated Japan was close to surrender, and the bombs were completely unnecessary. Hap Arnold reported that the Japanese had "lost the skies" and the Army Air Force was running out of targets in Japan. Leahy reported that the Navy blockade of Japan ensured no further war production could take place. All of the military command with actual knowledge of the South Pacific War stated they believed the war couldn't have lasted past November of 1945.    I understand and appreciate your input on this; I also want to say your earlier mention of the Alperovitz thesis piqued my interest so I read the book. I've encountered much of the information Alperovitz documents but it came from secondary resources that had written about the bombings. His research appears sound, the citations are many and speak to the incident at hand, but he also identifies areas where the information has changed or was incomplete. You argued in another thread that his thesis was popular in the 1990s, but that was no longer the case. What do you believe is incorrect about his work, and the thesis that the bomb, while dropped on Japan, was meant as a political tool for use against Russia?   Thank you for the information; it answered my question completely.   Boeing - not only can we not develop and deliver a plane on time, we will also sue you for failing. Plus - like at Walmart - you only get an in-store credit.   Firebombing a city entailed massive numbers of planes and bombs, and took a number of hours to effect what the military would call a success. The A-bomb required one plane and one bomb that acted with immediate destruction rendering the possibility of survival virtually nonexistent. Everyone understood the destructive potential of this weapon and its political implication for future generations. If you can gain access to Time's and Harper's archives, the contemporary articles clearly articulate the pulse of the world after the bomb's drop.   I appreciate your input, but I caution you against "taking yourself" back in time as you study the bomb's history, and by that I mean believing our contemporary attitudes were shared by those living in 1945. We have lived with the knowledge of nuclear weapons for over 65 years, and its depictions in numerous films, television shows, documentaries, and video games lead to a disconnect with its actual danger, but in 1945, a force as powerful as these two weapons simply didn't exist. For nations at war, the understanding that one bomb could wipe out entire armies, was both awe inspiring and frightening. Articles in Time, Harpers, The New York Times, and other news sources in the U.S. and overseas immediately address this weapon's implications on war and politics, and the paradigm shift this meant for the world at large. As for who wouldn't want to see the bomb drop? Just about the entire military and scientific community who had witnessed the test drop or were briefed on its results. Within the naval command, Leahy and MacArthur both stated there unhappiness over the bombs and targets because they considered it an almost cowardly act against a civilian population. And while the destruction of cities was commonplace during this period, the ability to do it with one bomb was not imagined.   There are mounds of declassified documents, but there's a reason they're classified as such. And, while some documents released earlier to researchers still had large portions redacted, more complete versions have been released which call into question the accepted understanding of the roles and attitudes of those involved in the decision. The military command's involvement in the decision was based on the intelligence at hand and what they were seeing on the ground. The navy commanders in charge of the blockade of Japan reported that the enemy was completely unable to resupply and predicted it would sue for peace by December, 1945. Hap Arnold stated in Time magazine a mere 11 days after the event that the Japanese were already beaten and dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary. I do, however, appreciate your input and the listing of another book that I can pour through.   The government still has a massive amount of classified information from WWII, and the difficulty for a researcher is to know exactly what document to request in a FOIA, otherwise it's like throwing spitballs at the wall and waiting for the right one to stick. Regarding my flare, I do study the development of cities, their social and political histories, and yes, race plays an important role. As for the media, I have a deep understanding of film's influence on society in driving a popular narrative or style, or taking the historical pulse of the nation in any given year.   I didn't know there was an Alperovitz thesis. My knowledge comes from reading Gaddis, Lytle, Zubok and Pleshakov, and other cold war historians whose stances have shifted on the bomb decision issue over the years. Probably the most damning material for what Truman knew about Japan's attempts at peace overtures comes from the declassified MAGIC intercepts. This information, combined with newly released classified documents paints a very different picture of the decision. Another point that has become clear over time is that Stimson was far removed from the decision making process at both Potsdam and for the bomb. This is verified repeatedly by his own diary and from the personal papers of those involved.   The problem with the narrative of a "perfect storm of justifications" is that it doesn't fit with the historical record of the event that continues to contemporaneously evolve as more formerly classified material is released, along with the diaries of primary participants that were withheld from publication by request (25-50 yrs.). The information Truman had from his military was that Japan was on its last legs because of the blockade. The U.S. controlled the skies above Japan because the country was out of fuel, and the pilots were rapidly running out of targets on the mainland to bomb. They urged a clarification of the "unconditional surrender" term that assured the Japanese people that their Emperor wouldn't be harmed. They also believed an invasion of Japan wasn't necessary because Allied bombing had completely destroyed the country's ability to manufacture munitions, and the blockade denied it the raw materials for production. Eisenhower was particularly vocal, especially after encountering the Red Army in Europe, and witnessing its decrepitude, that U.S. forces could operate without a declaration of war from Russia. The number of high-ranking military officials who supported a demonstration of the weapon prior to its use is overwhelming. A number of these same officials later said that more American lives could've been saved, and the war shortened, if Truman had simply clarified "unconditional surrender", which was the only sticking point to Japan's surrender. The idea that Japan refused to surrender is a fallacy, and the record is filled with these attempts. The Emperor became personally involved in these attempts during June, 1945, and a MAGIC intercept details his attempt to meet with the King of Sweden, who as an royal personage could broker the terms of surrender with the U.S. The OSS chief in Sweden, William "Wild Bill" Donovan, confirmed the effort but Truman told him not to pursue it. That's why the decision to drop the bomb makes such a compelling mystery.   The conspiracy isn't about building the bomb, it's about Truman's decision to use the bomb. His decision to drop the A-bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki fits all the parameters of a conspiracy. Did he authorize the drop because it would end the war quickly and save American soldiers' lives, or was it because the entire Red Army was amassed across Eastern Europe and Germany's defeat freed up soldiers to shift to the Asian sphere of battle, leaving western Europe defenseless? Regarding the latter question, a demonstration of the A-bomb sent a clear message to Stalin that the U.S. now had the capability to offset a large land army with superior technology. However, this is only one area of inquiry. Who influenced Truman's decision-making process? Why were Japanese peace overtures ignored? Why was a Russian declaration of war against Japan pursued so vigorously at the onset of May-July, 1945, and then abandoned after the Potsdam Conference? It was generally believed by all parties involved that a declaration of war by Russia would force the capitulation of Japan without the necessity of a U.S. invasion. Why did Truman refuse to define the term "unconditional surrender" so that the Japanese people understood it didn't mean the death of their Emperor? Despite calls from the American media, Churchill, the U.S. legislature, and all his military commanders to clearly outline for the Japanese people what surrender would entail, Truman remained evasive on the issue. If a historian wants a really good conspiracy, it's the decision to use the bomb.    This is also a theory I'm familiar with, and one that stands up to scholarly inquiry.   You believe the bomb was used to save American soldiers from having to invade Japan.   You believe the bomb was used to save American soldiers from having to invade Japan.   These figures don't hold up under historical scrutiny. Primary documents from the historical actors (Truman, Eisenhower, Marshall etc.), and from declassified material, paint a very different picture of the reasoning behind Truman's decision to drop the bomb.   This is also one of the narrative's that I'm aware of, but is it correct?   All of these arguments assume that dropping the bombs on populated areas was necessary, but why not demonstrate the bomb's power before a Japanese delegation, and then actually use the bomb if the nation remains unmoved? Based on the accounts of scientists who viewed the first atomic explosion, the overall emotion felts among them was awe at its power. Japan's government had already sent out diplomatic feelers among the Russians to broker a peace deal with the Americans. MAGIC intercepts of Japanese communication also provided U.S. military leaders with the knowledge that Japan's military was on the verge of collapse. So, why drop the bomb without offering first a demonstration?   I believe that the legalities of the bomb played a small role in Truman's decision-making process, but do you really believe it was his main impetus for dropping the bomb?   The legalities of whether to drop the bomb was not an answer that I expected, and it is appreciated. A number of historians mention the comparison between the bomb's effects and fire bombing civilian cities in Europe and Japan. McNamara admitted publicly that if the U.S. hadn't won the war, the leadership, himself included, would have faced charges for crimes against humanity because of the firebombing of Dresden and Tokyo. Am I correct, then, in summing up this line of argument as "it was okay by the rules of the Hague Convention?"   I'm an American historian, but of the two people who immediately come to mind, one is british - Winston Churchill. Immediately after his speech "we will fight in the...", American public opinion reversed course from isolationist to intervention and allowed congress to pass the lend/lease bill. Benjamin Franklin is another individual whose scientific stature bestowed on him a fame that he capitalized on by convincing France to aid the American Rebels. It was his invention of the lightning rod that brought him the most fame overseas. Most cities were constructed of wood, so lightning strikes were a constant threat. With the advent of Franklin's lightning rod, cities suddenly became much safer places to live, something that the French truly appreciated.    While reading Wade Davis's *Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest*, there is an account of two climbers from Mallory's 2nd expedition in 1922 who used experimental oxygen. They both climbed higher than Mallory and remained overnight. To celebrate their oxygen equipment's success, they shared a cigarette. I was surprised that fit climbers such as Mallory, and his fellow climbers, weren't leery about the effects of smoking, but their accounts talk about sharing cigarettes in an almost ritual-like way.   If you truly want to understand why Detroit collapsed, read Thomas Sugrue's *The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Post-war Detroit*. Another good read is Kevin Boyle's *Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age*. Both offer pain-staking details to the decline of Detroit, but the main gist is that the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors made their money off the city's constituents, and then abandoned it along with the manufacturing sector.   Hubris.   The ideology of anarchy demands that members deny the authority of anyone other than ones self.   The resulting arms race also cost Americans far more than they could have imagined. Instead of investing in education and building a more robust working class, the capital was spent on building, maintaining, and improving nuclear bombs; it's an investment in a weapon that no one ever plans to use, because the response would overwhelm the world. During the arms race one group did prosper - the military-industrial complex. Alec Roland called weapons the "capitalists dream" because they created their own market, required constant upkeep, and always needed upgrades.   Before 1945, only individuals with the 'need to know' were aware of the atomic bomb. Physicists not involved in the project probably understood the theoretical power of nuclear fission, but didn't know about the real deal. I once did a search on lexis nexis for the two words "atomic bomb", and the only hit returned was from a 1920s era newspaper story that predicted what the future would be like. The author posited that cars in the future would fly using energy from small atomic blasts.   I mentioned Lev and the directors' autobiographies because they were the quickest sources that I could recall, but I did a deep study on the film industry's development and very little was mentioned about Edison's patents. In its early days, Hollywood was very much a wild west atmosphere with new innovations occurring annually. However, every telling of the story about Hollywood's birth shares the same commonality, weather.   If this occurred, then the individual didn't successfully fake their death.   Peter Lev wrote an entire series on the history of film that is broken down into decades (ie. 1900-1910, 1920-1930). He posited that California became the studios' choice because of the weather. George Stevens and Byron Haskin both began their careers as camera operators around 1910, before becoming directors; in their biographies, both men discuss at length about the extended shooting schedules that California offered, as well as the variety of landscape. Montana was considered as a suitable replacement for California, but its weather and short summer left the state at a disadvantage. I cannot comment on the reason for New York's success in American theater.   If they successfully faked their death, doesn't that mean no one would know?   I don't know of A. Beevor's claim, but I have read translations of primary documents that described strategies used by German women to avoid rape as the Red Army rolled through their territory. This included making themselves appear as men (cutting hair, more clothes for bulk) or just completely undesirable (blackening face with soot and mud), but the main strategy was to flee toward the approaching Allied armies.   Physically, Stalin was a very short man (5'4 I think) with a club foot and a deformed arm. In no way was he physically imposing, thus the moniker "steel" to make up for his features.   There is a good reason for Churchill's quote about the Britain being able to survive. Lynne Olson's book *Those Angry Days* describes the fight between isolationists and interventionists before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. We like to see the Lend Lease program as a crutch for Britain, but in actuality it didn't provide much support for the British because American military leaders were unwilling to release equipment they believed would be necessary for U.S. defense in the immediate future. Roosevelt was hesitant to go against public opinion, and the isolationists were extremely vocal and led by a number of groups, the most influential being America First, which touted Lindbergh as a member. Olson describes Britain as being on the edge of collapse and encircled by the Germans. Hitler, meanwhile, has given orders to his navy not to menace any U.S. ships. He avoided at all costs bringing the U.S. into the war, but after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, he waited a period longer before declaring war on the U.S. Olson also claimed Roosevelt wanted a declaration of war from Germany to strengthen his own political position in asking congress for a declaration of war. Churchill and his interventionist guests, which he described as fairly dancing, were so very happy because they knew America's business interests would now support war, and the trickle of war materials would now become a flood.   I cannot comment on the first era (1920), but Stalin's reaction to the German invasion and Winter War is documented by his daughter, who said he sequestered himself in isolation and wept out of fear. She described him as being unsure of his leadership skills, and that he felt vulnerable to his many political enemies. All of this is documented in Zubok and Pleshakov's book *Inside the Kremlin's Cold War*. Applebaum writes of Stalin's deep distrust of the Polish military and underground and his vicious purges after gaining control of the country in her writings about the Gulag.   I've already seen that Sinclair and others were mentioned, however, Jacob Riis was one of the earliest investigative reporters that combined photography. He wrote *How the other half lives* but prior to this book, he wrote in-depth articles on everything from sanitation to alcohol reform. He is mentioned by historians as one of T. Roosevelt's companions on his jaunts through 1890s New York City.   We spent a week on studying and understanding the different historical methodologies during one of my early history seminars, and post-modernism was by far the most complicated. One of the books we read was Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*, but I deal mainly with film historians who specialize in post-modern methodology. My greatest complaint is that the pm methodology create these very long, sometimes confusing argument, and then give it a shorter label, before using it again to support another argument. In short, it appeared to be a form of verbal gymnastics employed to prop up an argument when proof wasn't readily available.   Somehow, North Carolina's branding as Dennys is aptly appropriate.   That answer was given in earnest, and has a basis in ancient histories and drawings. The human breast's ability to squirt milk led children to use the same technique on goats, cows, llamas, or any other animal that produces milk for human consumption. The only thing wrong with my answer was its need for more context.   It began when male children learned their mothers' teats squirted milk when pressed just so. It then moved to the bladder of animals. Of course, the concept of a squirting gun only came about with the commercialization of toys.   Hints of war over declining natural resources.   I'm assuming the government's at fault here because it has a long track-record of doing really bad things: vietnam, watergate, grenada, shah of iran, nicaragua, iraq, ............   However, these are the same ratings agencies that gave AAA ratings to junk bonds during the financial meltdown. Regard their ratings as suspect.   The author only mentioned [freedom of contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_contract) once, but it was the precursor to "right to work" and was just as heinous.    No...someone in her position could send a proxy, as is so prevalent in our society, but she chose to attend and present her viewpoint. If the opportunity ever presents itself for you to heckle the president, let me know if you had the courage to do it.   You have to admire someone with the courage to express their beliefs.   The Republicans seem perfectly content to screw over those of us students with loans; it's not considered a tax so it can't be held against them.   i cannot agree with you because i believe t. roosevelt was a far superior president than either of the poor examples you mentioned.   I humbly withdraw my selection.   Herbert Hoover - the presidency was his first elected office.   Ditto...damn it.   The anti-registration contingent argues about this fear of having their guns taken because they'll be left without protection. The government doesn't want peoples' guns because they have so many better toys with which to reap destruction; and if they wanted your gun, they could take it, along with the owner. Protesting the drone strikes that killed an U.S. citizen, the closing of Guantanamo, the use of torture, or the warrant-less wiretaps are all equally important, but gun advocates only want to protect the 2nd amendment and toss the rest out. Asking gun owners to register their weapons and instituting improved background checks is not unreasonable, and anyone paranoid about the government taking their gun is probably not that stable in the first place. If an individual is obeying the law, and living within it, they have nothing to fear. You may have the final word because I'm finished with arguing about "what might happen" in some paranoid's world.   If it comes down to making your life a little harder in order to save lives, that's simply a no-brainer. Asking people to register and pass a background check before purchasing a weapon in no way inhibits an individual from owning a gun. If that person passes the background check, no problem, they get the gun; but, if that person fails the check, it may stop a mass shooting. The straw-man in the argument for 2nd amendment enthusiasts is that registering puts them on some kind of list. This kind of fortunetelling leads to conspiracy theories and worries that the government will take away guns. As for being on a list, the number of things that necessitate registration are almost too numerous to count: boating, hunting, school, children, vehicle, home, pet, rv, motorcycle, political party, etc..  The government knows enough about its population without having to worry about whether you have a weapon. In fact, the information government has on the population probably includes whether or not the individuals is willing to use said gun. Again, registering a weapon and passing background checks in no way infringes on the right to purchase or own a gun.   I am former military; we went to the gun range an average of five times a month. If you asked the soldiers managing the gun range, the most dangerous individual is the untrained shooter. New shooters will point weapons at people, cars, and animals because the weapon is a new "toy." Our nation doesn't allow people to drive a car w/o a license and it should be the same for gun ownership. Our nation's founders didn't require this because children were taught about weapons during this period; it was a tool used for survival. We no longer use weapons this way, but expect people to understand them.   I should have clarified which rights I don't believe are being stepped on - gun rights. Weapons should be registered and training to use them should be mandatory. But the government's asking gun owners to register their weapons shouldn't be a big deal.   The stated reason for the protest is to protest an encroaching government and the event organizers stressed that it would remain peaceful if the authorities remained respectful of the protestors' rights. The "if" in that statement bothers me because it implies a threat of retaliation, and is almost provocative in nature. It almost appears as if they're spoiling for a fight over rights that I don't believe are being trampled on.   Remember when a group from the black panthers showed up with guns in a public forum and the government went ballistic?   I only have myself to blame for the lack of regulatory oversight that is slowly killing the united states, because i voted in every election that allowed my representative to act like a shitbird and vote for corporate self-regulation. i know that the ron paul types and republicans scream for smaller government and less regulation because it's anti-business. i'm ashamed that i once voted for ronald reagan, and the sr. bush fooled me once, but age and education have shown me the error of my ways. the gutting of *our* resources, not corporations resources, but the *nation's* resources, comes at the cost of smaller government. i take responsibility for the debacle that is our congress, and let me go ahead and apologize in advance for the future *insert catastrophe here* by the *insert corporate entity here* causing the needless deaths of *insert number dead here*. boy, do i feel better about small government.    Now the 1 percent is outsourcing our scholarship programs.   I'm currently watching Jon Stewart on the Daily Show. He agrees that you're an idiot.   I acknowledged the fact that my idea is repulsive, but so is an ideology that fights for the rights of a deranged portion of the population to have the arms necessary to decimate twenty children.   I'll defend your right to be wrong, and to express your opinion using an ad hominem argument, but I won't agree with you because then we'd both be wrong.   This is in no way an argument based on raw emotion. The will of the people has been usurped by a powerful gun lobby, and that runs completely against the constitutional laws of the United States. As for my argument about the crime scene photos, that, too, is on solid ground with a plethora of sources, but I'll include one [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/6152050/Ten-photographs-that-changed-the-world.html).    This is completely unacceptable behavior on the part of our legislative branch, and those that are responsible for the bill's defeat should be politically punished. Citizens are forced to register their cars, animals, and homes, so why should guns be treated any differently? There was, and still remains, one sure-fire way to get gun legislation passed - release the crime scene photos of the Newtown shooting victims. I know this suggestion is thoroughly repulsive, but as a photojournalist, I understand the visceral reaction to a photo, and the power contained within. The public's reaction to those photos would be a firestorm that even the most jaded of politicians could not ignore, nor could the NRA dodge the reality that occurred when a lone gunman stole the lives of 26 helpless and innocent individuals.   I can offer you a good book source that answers just this question: David Roediger, "Working toward whiteness: how America's immigrants became white". Roediger attributed the path to "whiteness" as earned by owning a home, which of course meant you had a good job.   Siemens has been mentioned, but it deserves another mention for the funding of the Nazi party. It also used slave labor from the jewish prison camps, often working the prisoners to death. there are oral accounts of jewish prisoners working on siemens' assembly line and simply falling over dead from hunger and disease.   Fear is the engine driving your question, and obviously the U.S. government is not worried about NK. Conducting the test would be tantamount to "chest thumping," and do we really need to do that these days?   Thank you, Jon Stewart.   Another example of "Fast and Furious" at the local level.   The wealthy and the corporations they own consume a far greater ratio of national resources than the average American. The reason this goes unnoticed today is because in the last 100 years the wealthy have learned to play down or hide their wealth. The communities they live in are gated and exclusive, hidden from site. This wasn't true a decade earlier because limitations on transportation meant the wealthy had to mingle with the poor. As a result, Americans witnessed up close the drain on themselves and the nation's resources, which is why taxes on the nation's wealthiest once stood at close to 90%.   You'll have to explain the whole process of "wealth redistribution through taxes" before I can understand your argument.   Leave social security out because that is taken out of every worker's check, and Medicare is for the poor. National Defense is shared by all, but let's take it as an example. As a taxpayer, I'm paying for the development of the F35 by Lockheed; as an aircraft, it's the equivalent of a money pit - taking in vast amounts of taxpayer funds for over 9 years, but it remains in development. However, Lockheed's board of directors and ceo take home outstanding paychecks. They live in gated communities, fly from place to place, and often park their funds in accounts that are beyond the government's purview. Meanwhile, the industry that they control uses national resources that they pay for at a reduced rate, while simultaneously receiving subsidies. In addition, they employ armies of accountants to insure they receive every tax-break available. Every time I see masses of semi-trucks barreling down the road, or delivery vehicles (UPS, etc.) on the street, I know they're wearing on the roadway more than my car. Shouldn't their taxes be tied to the amount of national resources for which they demand?   Untrue...the best example of this is Mitt Romney, and he doesn't represent an anomaly among the wealthy, but rather the norm.   What I mean is that the wealthy own the means of production in this country, and that their industries absorb a large portion of national resources. In relation to the average individual, the wealthy are consuming vastly more government services than for which they are paying.   Ahh, Adelitas. If you can't find the woman of your dreams there, she doesn't exist.   My sentiments, exactly. Harper's is a great primary source if you want to take the pulse of the nation during a particular period after 1857. Harpers is still around today and its archives are available online to subscribers.   According to the posse comitatus act of 1878, the use of federal troops to enforce state laws is in direct violation of the constitution. An act of congress, however, can supersede the act if the government believes it necessary to maintain law and order.   Good call...this was the first time Douglas MacArthur made it onto the national stage.   When I lived in San Diego, I was robbed twice by police while visiting Tijuana. I still love the city, though. There's something about lawlessness so brazenly on display by police and locals that really makes you feel alive.   Because the majority of America's soldiers come from the working class, a social class vastly under-represented by the mainstream media. It's only when the suicides come in bunches, or from a particular post, that the media shows any interest.   Now let's send some of the bastards to jail.   That's just my point, you don't possess the necessary knowledge without my explaining it to you. I can tell you that two centuries earlier, the idea of working for a wage was ludicrous because the world - Britain excepted - still operated on a market economy. Barter remained common for all goods and services. A worker either apprenticed themselves to learn a trade, or they labored in agriculture for a sustenance living.  One century earlier, the average laborer worked 12-14 hour days, six days a week, in incredibly dirty dangerous conditions. If he/she worked in a factory, there were no safety precautions taken and if the worker threatened to strike, he/she was replaced by a more willing worker, or a black laborer. By black laborer, I'm including Sicilians, Greeks, East Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and Mexicans, because each race was considered "black" on some level. The laws covering this labor fell under the "freedom of contract" clause, meaning if you agreed to work for a wage, you did whatever the boss demanded regardless of danger or long hours.  The reason our food server was able to draw attention to this incident is because of the advances in work conditions made possible by labor unions. We now have 8 hour work days and laws requiring overtime pay; we work five day weeks; if an employer is at fault for bodily injury, they now have to pay; child labor is no longer acceptable in the US; employers are required to give breaks. The list goes on-and-on, but it offers the historical precedence that allowed this food server to speak up and actually be heard. It is also a system that employers hate because it restricts them from taking more-for-less from the employee. Republicans would love to rollback the advances made in labor as we've witnessed in numerous political battles across the nation (Wisconsin, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee).  I've given you ideas that any American historian immediately recognizes, but you don't want a list of "unqualified sources." Perhaps you don't like reading, but the list of sources I offer are peer reviewed university press books published by Harvard, Cambridge, Princeton, Duke, and again the list goes on. Let me finish by saying that *ideas* are wonderful things, but unless supported by real research and testing, they remain ideas until proven, or they slip into the realm of fantasy. If you still want the historiography, I'm happy to send it, but now I'm at the point of wasting my time. If you want to know more, attend one of my lectures, or perhaps at a class closer to where you live.   You are correct about the "decade" reference, it should've been centuries. As for the rest of the argument, you win by default; you lack the necessary knowledge of US history to intelligently continue this conversation, and I lack the patience or energy to explain it to you. The only way I will respond is if you'd like a reading list for a historiography on the US economy. If you're interested, let me know and I'll send the list, and then we can have an intelligent conversation.   How a person behaves is absolutely dependent on historic precedence. The very fact that we're having a spirited argument on the relevancy of an individual's work behavior is proof positive of historical precedence. Were we to be having this discussion even a century earlier, it would be about the benefits of socialism. Go back even two decades, and the very idea of working for a wage in America would be greeted with disdain. Understanding the social, political, and economic history of the United States is absolutely necessary for me to know where I fit in this society's complicated structure, and for that historical precedence is absolutely necessary.   As an American historian, the very idea of finding the two words "professional integrity" side-by-side to support the US business system makes me chuckle, but the "breach of trust" concept brought a big laugh. In today's business environment, these terms only extend as far as the bottom line, and are mere lip-service in the left in the wake of profit. Our history is littered with examples of small and large businesses behaving badly, such as big tobacco and its "breach of trust" by a lowlife with no "professional integrity" that offered proof that "potentially harmed his employer," but ultimately broke the industries stranglehold on the country's cigarette use. The small business employer is no less culpable in displaying that "professional integrity" when placing the public or its employees at risk. My argument is that we need to worry less about "professional integrity" and demonstrate more personal integrity, which I believe the food server displayed in this case.   Sadly, you won't be the only misguided individual to agree with corporate America. However, when an individual claims a special relationship with the world at large - in this case a pastor - and they betray that trust by behaving badly or abusing that special relationship ("I give 10% to god" bullshit), then they also deserve every instance of disdain being heaped upon them. It took personal courage for this food server to defend a wronged fellow server, and it cost her the job. Does the average American worker possess this level of courage? IMHO the answer is no. The average US citizen has noted the treatment of whistle-blowers in society (wikileaks, enhanced interrogation) and decided to sit out any future fights, so when someone with the courage to step up appears, I'm firmly behind them. If your ultimate argument is that the food server broke the rules, and deserved the consequences, I'm arguing that the rules are there so that the average person doesn't have to think. If, as a person, I'm happy to have someone else do the thinking for me, then I've earned the society I live within. The food server picked her battle, but who really lost? I guarantee that the fallout among the restaurant's corporate leaders and the pastor's followers far exceeds losing a crappy food server job.   I've spent a good majority of my life waiting tables while earning two undergrads and a graduate degree, but never worked for Applebees. In fact, that crappy restaurant chain is the walmart of the restaurant world, and only a small step up from Denny's. Stories abound in the server's universe about the reputation of a restaurant chain. Olive Garden is a chain whose food is so inferior that servers warn other servers not to eat there. There are restaurants with reputations for not hiring minorities. I worked as a server/bartender at a M S seafood restaurant for almost seven years; during that period, the restaurant only employed one black server, and then only for less than a month. In the kitchen, we had a single black cook who lasted for less than a year. Perhaps our M S location was the extreme and not the standard, but it followed closely with the restaurant's corporate reputation for not hiring minorities. Within the "waiting world," the religious fucks were always the hardest to serve because they generally demanded more perfection and were the least forgiving. Any food server dreads working on a Sunday, because the 'GOD SQUAD' or 'JESUS FREAKS' invade restaurants at the same hours. The average server leaves a sunday shift exhausted, frustrated, angry, and underpaid. The religious nuts are only one small portion of the dining population that demanded more for less. The infrequent diner is another of these creatures who appear on Christmas or Thanksgiving days. These diners believe every aspect of the meal should be mistake free, and servers heartily agree that the meal should arrive on time and and in perfect condition, but we live in a world where mistakes occur, particularly when more than one individual is involved in the process. The frequent diner understands this aspect of the restaurant experience, but the infrequent diner often expects perfection or the meal is free. There are other diners, the real scumbags, who use complaints as a means for the free meal, but in the end the server is just the middleman left to apologize for the kitchen, bar, and hostess staff who see the customer for only brief moments. If your defense of the customer is "they're always right," let me be the first to say "fuck you," and downvote away. The customer is correct less than half the time, but even if they are correct, it doesn't give them the right to attack the server's dignity. One of the reasons eating out on a date remains popular is because the experience offers a couple the opportunity to observe how a potential mate treats someone else. It's like the bumper sticker, you learn right away what a person thinks about society at large. If you're a dick to a food server while part of a group, you can bet the other people you're dining with take note. In this case, a fellow food server drew a line in the sand, and lost her job, but she left Applebees with her dignity intact, and having learned a lesson that's commonly known in the industry - some restaurants only want smiling robots that are willing to endure a tongue lashing and nasty notes.  By the way, if this short note offended you, then good; you were my target audience.   When leading Wall Street executives line up to praise their regulator, be afraid, be very afraid.   Welcome back to the arena of irrelevance, Sarah. You will be missed by comedians everywhere.   Because ruining the finances of the little person wasn't enough, GS has decided to wreck the small businesses of the US.   What's wrong with you, Florida? You're getting out-crazied by Virginia.   I realized White was the wrong official for the position when Wall Street insiders praised her appointment.   The reason my dad could raise seven kids was because he worked two jobs, however, one of those jobs was in the steel industry and it paid a living wage for a family of three. The second job was at night with Kmart and paid minimum wage. Our family remained poor, and qualified for government food assistance, but dad just wouldn't accept it. He also refused to allow any of us kids to sign up for school lunches. Today, it's impossible to raise a family on minimum wage, and the jobs available don't pay nearly enough to cover a family's cost of living. As a result, more families are turning to credit cards to supplement the paycheck. Even with both spouses working, the contemporary American family can't keep up with the month-to-month bills, and the constant debt and long work hours, coupled with an uncertain job market, have suppressed the will to protest against unfair wages. With the average worker's wage in stagnation, and the manufacturers' war against labor unions, employers are rolling back many of the advances made by labor during the 20th century. The average working-class employee is now a wage slave who is so deeply in credit card and school loan debt that the very idea of owning a home and having children remains too far in the distant future to warrant making plans. While wages in the financial and political sectors continue to adjust with the cost of living, the salaries in retail and the service industry have remained stagnant since 1972. In short, stagnate wages are the reason for the decline in the middle class and the chasm between the rich and poor in America.   It's all part of dog's plan.   This story provides another example of why religion is such an odious influence on people that seeks to divide and denigrate the "other."   the bible   Why are "cost of living" wage increases allowed for federal employees yet denied to the average laborer?   If the Bush staff figured out a way to make torture acceptable, Obama's staff can figure out a way around the debt ceiling.   They were completely different entities and I'll offer you a number of books that backup my argument:  1. *Naming names* - Victor Navasky 2. *Cinema and History* - Marc Ferro 3. *Hollywood and History* - Robert Burgoyne 4. *Writing History in Film* - William Guynn 5. *The Persistence of History* - Vivian Sobchack  When you finish these books, come talk with me and we'll re-evaluate your understanding of this subject.   You are confusing the Hollywood investigation into communism with the McCarthy red scare; these are two separate events and the listed links are from the hollywood blacklist.   Boeing is going into damage control mode. Personally, I'd be terrified to fly on one of these planes.   See...you do get it. Decide when, where, and how to participate in the system of production. I'm telling people to participate in the system on their own terms, and to determine what really matters to them in life. Are they more interested in being the richest person in the cemetery? Fine, but I'm not sacrificing my time spent with family and friends, or expanding my horizons on the system unless it's on my terms. I don't want to look back at the end of my life, and see it wasted on filling a slot in the machine of industry. I want to remember the lazy walks through dense forests populated with hollows, as my dog pants alongside me, eager to chase the next squirrel.   Stop being wage slaves; make industry pay a wage that you believe you're worth, and don't work for less. If industry refuses, don't work. Learn the difference between "needs" and "wants", and live accordingly. Simplify or suffer.   We're just talking past each other, which I find is counter productive. We each have competing beliefs, but if I agreed with you, I would be wrong.   So is Saudi Arabia and you don't hear them making waves in the U.S. to further their regional agenda.   When did Israel begin dictating foreign policy in the U.S.? Why is this acceptable?   007 or Bourne?   I wonder if they'll put the patriot missiles in the same place as the old jupiter missiles.   The book, *Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalions 101*, gives a firsthand account of the moral questioning the ordinary german faced when participating in the final solution of hitler's plan. Many of the men used alcohol during the process to dampen their memories, and peer pressure among them also played an important role. The book offers accounts of soldiers refusing to participate, which is more along the lines of what you seek. It's also an incredibly depressing read, that gave me headaches from reading the accounts.   Payroll taxes went up 2%, and will hit the working class hardest, but the Republicans never let out a whisper about it. Meanwhile, they continue to protect the wealthiest upper classes. In a sense, it's a petty way of economically punishing the largest portion of Obama's supporters. Sadder still, the Democrats agreed to throw the working class under the bus.   Great selection, as the film M is credited with beginning the Film Noir hollywood movement.   Run, Lola, Run   Lately, stories about veterans committing suicide filter into reddit. I wonder if this article about the VA's approach to treating wounded veterans is really an attempt at damage control?   My photojournalism professor, Ken Bisio, did a photo essay for Time on Russia's orphanages. State run orphanages didn't have names, and only given a number, instead. Many of the children were used for labor by local factories, and many were adopted by organized crime. These were Soviet-era conditions, and my hope is that contemporary conditions have improved.   I'm going to approach my answer from a media historian's viewpoint that you may find unpopular, but the reason the violence in that film appears so tame is that as a society, we've become more accustomed to scenes of brutal violence. Contemporary film censors allow a vast amount of violence into film in relation to that of the 1970s. A film with only a moderate amount of violence, say a LOTR film, would have received an X rating for violence from a 1970s-era censor, who would consider the battle scenes as too graphic.   I knew he would confess when asked his "opinion" on whether the dead stewardess drank to excess, or left behind the two empty vodka bottles. He truly cared about her, and wasn't willing to accept that level of shame placed on her memory. The scene showing Denzel's last vision of the stewardess is shot from the first-person point-of-view, so the audience follows along, peering between his shoes. As he is dragged from the plane, his lover's body is splayed, with her head crushed under some bit of plane debris. During Denzel's initial official interview, he admitted to only remembering events up to the crash, so only his subconscious, and the audience, remembered being dragged from the crash.   That family rendered their shelter useless because now everyone knows where it is located. It's the first place outsiders will look for during a disaster.   T. Roosevelt viewed institutions that were too big to fail as *trusts*, and as such, he considered them threats to national security. In the early 20th century, if a trust failed, it received little to no assistance from the government. To limit the damage to government and unemployment, trusts were broken up. The same applies today; a too big to fail financial institution is a threat to national security. The US government may not have the clout to break up an institution such as HSBC, but it can place limits on the amount of business it does with the corporation. If a company is broken up, the assets remain the same, and there could be job loss, but there could also be less corruption if corporations were made to understand that it would face harsh punishment.   Not doing anything will also cause a lot of common folk to lose a lot of money, and give the impression that these actions are acceptable to the government.   Break these banks up as a form of punishment; make them give up assets as a monetary penalty.   Break it up as a consequence of malfeasance; make it a condition the big banks will face if they're corrupt. Believe me, there are plenty of players in the financial industry who would salivate at the idea of owning HSBC assets.   tucker and dale, hands down, is my pick. It's hard to make real horror a laughing matter, but this movie does it and still brings the gore.   as a history graduate student, i worked as a ta for two different history professors. the first prof. received her undergrad at harvard and her grad at yale. i learned from her to always attend a meeting with an agenda, even if it isn't a meeting you called. she said this would allow you to direct the meeting. the second prof. received his undergrad/grad degrees at columbia. he taught me to be a more skillful writer, and how to become an accomplished researcher. he taught me to honestly confront my argument's weaknesses, and discuss them before someone else does it for me.   It's been at least 10+ years since I've taken any roman history courses, but I believe the maccabees were involved in the jewish rebellion against rome.   And I'd be willing to bet that historic reference is masada, when jews kept roman armies at bay, until a ramp was built and herod's mountain fortress was retaken.   Says the man name "maccabe".   Ah, the old fallback, "antisemitism," to explain away something that is obvious to the world at large. I mentioned abraham because he's the linchpin that connects three of the most heinous religions. I'm saying that Israel's entire argument for existence rests on religion. If it weren't a religious matter, the other middle-eastern countries would not care what happened to Palestine, and consider it just another vanquished country, much as happened when rome wiped israel off the map in 70? ad. There was no islam to celebrate the event, but the christians were probably there to cheer it on. islam doesn't make its grand appearance until the 500s ad, and by then israel was just another failed nation state under the romans.     Remove the religious aspect from the formula and it all falls to pieces. Imagine not having the ideologies of islam, judaism, and christianity to use as a framework for admission to the region. Without religion there is no israel or judea, king david or solomon, no philistines or sadducees, clean or unclean, favored people and the rest of us. In fact, eliminate abraham and world development would have progressed at an accelerated pace. Instead, we're left with an endless supply of really bad "a priest, a rabbi, and an imam walk into a bar" jokes. If you still think I'm not pointing a finger at all the religions, well, you haven't been paying attention.   A mere drop in the bucket for HSBC. If you really want to cleanup wall street, dissolve or sell off offending companies. The feds should use the same mentality as a federal judge sentencing a crack addict, and cripple them for life.   As someone who doesn't believe in the whole god thing, all of the indoctrinated scare me because they can hang all the killing on the "will of the almighty," and justify their existence because they're mentioned in a book. Honestly, one day Israel's use to the US will go to the wayside, and it will join the ranks of the Philippines, Georgia, Honduras, Cuba, Hungary, and a bevy of others, on the sideline and ignored. I honestly hope that when that time arrives, Israel has learned to live peacefully with its neighboring countries. If not, it can always fall back on "his will be done."   The Israeli government treats Palestinian people as non-entities, with the hope that they will eventually "self-deport" to another area of the world. It is a condition with which Jews are well acclimated, the diaspora being just one example. But my support for the Palestinian people should not in any way be considered agreement with either country's use of violence. I recognize the actions of a bully when I see it, the constant overreaction to slights that escalates to violence. I also empathize with a people who were pushed aside, to make room for a nation that had not existed for close to 2000 years. It's as if a bunch of people calling themselves Roman decided today that all the people in Italy that didn't identify with being Roman were no longer recognized, and the country was defunct. But human beings believe we can lay claim to a place, when the reality is that when the earth's been injured enough by humanity, it will respond by eliminating the irritant. They believe there is some entity named yaweh, god, allah, buddah...waiting to accept them into a paradise, and will destroy anyone who doesn't believe as they do. If ever there were a one-word definition of mass murder it would be "religion." If humans stopped masking their pain by turning to religion, and instead placed ideology aside and asked how they could help one another, we would still fight but it would be with more honesty. Instead of standing beside Israel because "it's the only democracy in the middle east," the US could simply admit that the country's only use was as a conduit into a much-needed energy supply. By the way, name calling is the last bastion of a weak argument.   Why should the US place its soldiers and people on the line for a country that is so militaristic? Israel's handling of the Palestinian people is much the same as the US's handling of African Americans.   You're right...the hollywood insiders recognize b.s. when it sees it.   Explain to me your rational for removing this comment.   Changing climate conditions have led to droughts and a rise in food prices. The economic conditions have exasperated the decline, leading individuals to question leadership and the economic models that favor the elite. This is particularly true across the middle east where graft is an accepted practice in business. As U.S. power continues its decline both overseas and at home, the amount of aid to countries will substantially decrease, except to those countries that hold resources the federal government considers vital to national security. In the U.S., the economic downturn has halted and reversed any momentum to grow the middle class. Most Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck, working longer hours, and mired in school-loan debt. The new jobs being added to the economy are in the low-paying service industry. The discontent over wall street will continue to grow as more americans feel the tightening grip of the declining economy. Increasing violence, I believe, is just around the corner in the u.s.   I believe you have a valid argument, and if you need some ideas for primary sources, here are a few:  Time magazine archives - articles will give context to the political and social contemporary climate. Harpers magazine - it also has extensive archives - see above The Fog of War - documentary about McNamara and the war's operation NSC-62 - the plan for implementing containment as advised by George Kennan's "Long Telegram" JSTOR - If you're in college, the library provides access to this site, which is a huge repository for secondary and primary sources.   Property records are generally found at the county seat level. The records should contain the name of the contractor, and in many cases, the actual blue-prints.   Eric Foner discussed the viability of these interviews, and cautioned that the veracity of the interview depended on the individual doing the interviewing. If the FWP interviewer was black, the participant was more apt to be honest. If the interviewer was white, the information skewed to conform with the interviewer's beliefs of slave culture.   Good answer - I liked Christian's *Maps of Time* because it revealed patterns of human behavior that the micro-history approach simply missed. He also draws from science writing to place human history in context.   I took an undergraduate native american history class from Prof. James Drake, and he discussed the inherent racism still practiced in the united states against indigenous americans, particularly by sports teams. Atlanta Braves, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, Florida State Seminoles, and a plethora of other teams abuse the indigenous american culture, while ignoring the pleas to correct their abuses. One washington d.c. newspaper decided to stop using the home team's name because of its unfair racial implications.  	199

I cant stand vegans (at least when they talk about being vegan) but there are some great vegan recipes out there that can easily be altered to be real people food.     Ingredients  can of chickpeas/garbanzo beans  1/4 cup sunflower seeds  1/4 cup flax seeds  1/4 sesame seeds  2 eggs  2 cloves of garlic  1 red pepper  1/2 red onion  1 carrot (or about 12 baby carrots)  1 cup of BBQ sauce  1-1.5 cups of Panko     Step 1: Finely chop the garlic, pepper, onion, carrot, and chickpeas. I used a small food processor. You want it to look kinda goopy and it will be wet. I did the veg first, put it into a large bowl, and then did the chickpeas second mixing the two together in the bowl.  Step 2: Once the veg and chickpeas are well mixed, throw in the BBQ sauce, Panko, eggs, and seeds. Mix these all together. Add more Panko (or breadcrumbs) if you feel you need to thicken it.  Step 3: I have an old George Foreman grill that I use for burgers because I dont have an outdoor grill and I despise pan frying. Roll up the mixture into balls only slightly larger than a golf ball. Plop them down on the grill and let them flatten and cook. Maybe 3-5 minutes for each group or until theyre nice and brown on the outside.  You could probably bake these in an oven as well. Guess would be 350 degrees on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil for 15-25 minutes flipping them at least once so theyre brown on both sides.   This should make between 10-15 patties. I would estimate the prep time at around 15 minutes   the cook time at between 20-25.

It'd be nice to get a local tune in the chant rotation--something Replacements maybe, Doomtree                                                watching it over again, most of the ball is over the line as it rolls along but it never completely goes over. I think it was the right call but Eddies are completely justified in being miffed, that goal would've changed the game entirely      Pasher looked to be more of a leftwinger/forward in those highlights, which was mostly of his time in Finland's 3rd tier. I think he played for Lansing United this year in the NPSL. Great video finds               well, I play chess rather poorly   love beer (Untappd: danielcasey). I'd be up for it      where were you thinking of doing this?   love this crest, the dry-fit shirts are screaming to be rec league jerseys     	137
 One day man. One day...      Did you get the owners permission?   May I ask how you went about getting the location?    The Waitress!!!   Would you mind explaining how the dog fight went above other comedies. I feel like I've seen that exact same scene before.   Yes! That was terrific too. I think the main reason there has been very little Rizzo is that the puppeteer for him now does Kermit and other Jim Henson characters.   I remember that! I got through the first minute of his "web series"   Hey Moone Boy is about as Irish as Game Of Thrones in that it films here. You can put Father Ted in that same category except I don't think that was filmed here at all.   They're cool, but in regards to your kickstarted maybe you should look into a Patreon. I wouldn't be able to pay either way but that seems more appropriate for you.   And Rizzo! Rizzo has only had one line in the past 10 years!   The muppets did that before Abed! But I'd say it was just a one off joke in this.   There was a pigs in space movie?   Some multicams cost more purely because they're often more popular and so the cast get paid much more.   What was it?   I'm not too sure. It must have been after he stopped doing the "thanks for playing the theme song reggie" since that's how he used to start the show.      That's what people said when Scott retired "What's Up Hot Dog."    It's been a big staple of the show for a few years now and he finally chose one. It's a pretty big step in terms of canon of the show.   Is it uploaded anywhere?   [There are also these two without a match.](http://imgur.com/TL8Pfa9) I normally just randomly choose two out of these five and hope no one sees me with my feet close together.      The main difference seems to be that this one keeps forcing the message after the sex starts.   Nah Candance has anyone but she never catches Phineas And Ferb.      It's lower than the picture on the website?   Well Grown Ups 2 isn't even close. That fight scene at the end drags on for quite a while.   What's the deal with carnivores?   Dan plays Minecraft a lot.   Thanks, man.    I didn't know Jon was on so many MTV2 shows. Are they any good? I assume not from the way he used to plug them on Improv4Humans.   Does anyone want to make a list of everyone's catchphrases?   So I was inspired by your comment to finally press the button and get my favourite number 27.   Oooh people from "No You Shut Up!." I want more puppeteers at earwolf so eventually we'll get a puppet episode of CBBTV.   I believe I started regularly listening around the 3rd anniversary so this means from now on I have officially regularly listened for more than half of the show.      Bane? I may be filming a video where I do famous movie impressions for the year anniversary of this one.   Eh..thanks. It does drag on way too long.    I am not like that at all. I regularly doodle on books that I'm in the middle of reading. I think the fact I do that is the same reason the line going down in the middle of the triangle being lobsided doesn't bother me.    Eh..Avengers Spoilers bro.      This is a much better version of a [video](http://youtu.be/wJr0u7GaDRw)  I did a while ago.    I.T Crowd is not a cult show. It's very popular here.   Could you give rundown on what was and wasn't filmed live right in front of the audience in that episode. As far as I remember everything looked like a proper set except for the basement scenes.   Pretty sure that's at the start of the prisoner-monitor episode.   It looks like we need Superman IV The Quest For Peace.   India, I guess, still do 4:3.  	47
       The wildlife can be imported directly from Australia.         The survivors can design the memorial.   We all know the cinematic tropes in cinema for the various accents of the world as expressed by Hollywood films. However, as somebody who hasn't experienced as much foreign cinema as he'd like, I'd love to pose a question to you, non-Americans of Reddit. How are the various accents of the United States (Southeastern, Boston, Californian, et al) portrayed in the culture of your country?       Also, ants can carry them off in the night.                  I've long been of the belief that cat declawing is an awful thing to do to the animals. The bulk of evidence I've seen seems to agree with this point of view, and it's been gaining a lot of supporters as of late.  HOWEVER: it would seem as though the American Veterinary Medical Association and several other reputable veterinary groups disagree with this assertion. While I tend to agree with scientific and medical establishments, there's no doubt that there's money to be made on declawing, so it seems as though they've got something at stake here. Add to that that the American anti-declawing movement originated in hippy-esque circles which aren't really known for their adherence to science, and I have doubts.   I was wondering where the skeptic community falls on this issue and if there were any resources out there that might make a case for declawing not being harmful.      Vote You in 207^4^4^4^4^4^4^4^4^4^4^4^4^4.            Okay, so this is a long shot, but there was an incredibly catchy music video played at the beginning of the Dub Your Own Hentai track with surprisingly high production values and showing surprisingly little in the way of nudity. Does anyone happen to have it?   So they've been handing out those buttons for free Momocon passes if you should happen to find your match. Why not have a Reddit thread to try to find our opposites?  I'll start. Mine is 624               As a disabled man, getting around the con is somewhat difficult. I feel that having a room in a host hotel would alleviate this to a degree, but no matter how early I check, they seem to be booked up. What's the most reliable way of getting a room at one of the big five?      This is going to be big, people.                        Until the 80s, the US had been a leading participant in the World's Fairs, and many of those held on US soil have become regional and national cultural touchstones. Why has the US seemingly dropped all involvement in World's Fairs?   They're both about evil shadowy groups of supernatural baddies conspiring to take over humanity and they both have persistent screen captions as an integral, tangible part of the universe. Fringe is simply Kill la Kill's Boston.  Karma, plz.         It doesn't make sense to me. The best I can figure is that COMPNOR needed an enemy for the widespread human majority to hate and aliens were a convenient target.       It may be due to the rose colored fog of nostalgia pervading the game, but for me, Metal Gear Solid's music just felt so much more atmospheric and evocative than the music in Metal Gear Solid 2 and its' successors. It could just be due to how much I fell in love with the game, but MGS1's duel music and cutscene music just stuck with me so much more. Am I alone in this assessment? I get that it's all completely down to taste and there are no wrong answers, but I'm dying to know how everyone else feels about this.      In the BioShock series, the city of Rapture is shown to be an astounding testament to mankind's technical expertise and the tenacity of the "utopian" vision of Andrew Ryan.  In the viral game Something in the Sea, we are shown that the initial construction of Rapture (with stage I being completed in late 1946) is financed by shell companies such as Warden Yarn who buy large quantities of materiel from Scarlet Sovereign with these contracts then being reneged upon receipt of the raw materials.   This presents a problem, however. With Ryan disappeared to Rapture and his shell companies on the surface surely made pariahs by his lack of payment on large contracts, he was surely cut off from receiving raw materials from sources on the surface. However, we're told that Rapture continued to expand until 1951. This surely would have required a vast amount of material well in excess of the sums we're shown in the Scarlet Sovereign receipts. Further, any civic planner worth a damn would have a setup for procuring additional materials for repairs and expansion to keep pace with population growth.  Now, as we're not shown any sort of method by which Rapture can quarry stone or mine ores and the trees in Arcadia are surely insufficient for providing lumber in addition to oxygenating the city, I've got to wonder: where did the additional raw materials for Raptures maintenance and expansion come from?    Everyone stopped moving and it's just really annoying and inconvenient.       I know that Cerberus owns many front organizations and cover businesses and was originally a branch of Alliance intelligence, but how do they possibly have the dosh to acquire and cultivate all of their scientific and military talent? How do they finance their fleets of warships and dropships and improbable androids with complex smart AI?   Inquiring minds demand answers!      I'm going to momocon for the first time on Saturday, and I'm curious as to whether or not they have a disability services booth or something similar as Dragoncon has. As a guy in a wheelchair, the disability services badges have always been a huge help in letting me enjoy panels, and I'm hoping momocon has something similar. However, I couldn't find it on their website.   Additionally, how is Lenin viewed in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Ukraine, the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics?         4484-9758-4226, if'n you're interested.       Wat do?   My girlfriend and I are looking for rooms as we were bumped from our previously arranged accommodations. We'd prefer something close and for some privacy, both because I'm in a wheelchair. What are our chances of finding something this late?   I have a tremendous fondness for 9x18mm and the general idea of compact-ish combloc pistols really holds a dear place in my heart and in my hands. However, no gun store or pawn shop seems to have them and I prefer to avoid dealing with online purchases - even though they seem to lack these pistols as well.   And so, I turn to /r/gunsforsale. I would like to offer some delicious leafy green cashy money to anybody in the Gainesville, GA area who might be willing to sell me one of these weapons. I am highly negotiable on prices, and I can start at $120 for a PA-63. More for a Makarov PM or CZ-82. I also have a genuine Soviet Tokarev without importer stamps that I could be persuaded to trade, if you prefer.   Shoot me a reply if you're interested!      I am currently unemployed and in the Atlanta area - just north of the city, OTP, and I'm looking for work. On the writing front, I've written gaming reviews and articles for massvio.com and gamegeex.com, as well as reams of unpublished poetry and short form fiction. I'll write just about anything, really, though articles are my forte.  As for voice acting, I'm just breaking into it though I have - as a matter of curiosity - received some informal coaching and advice on the matter from Mike Dowling, audio lead at Obsidian Entertainment.   Really, I'm willing to do anything else that pays as long as it isn't too physical, as I'm a paraplegic amputee. However I am much more capable than most people would think. Don't be shy, drop me a PM!  I'd put my resume here, but I haven't got any prior work history beyond my writing and I tend to keep my portfolio closed to all but serious enquirers. I assure you, however, that I am highly qualified for a wide variety of tasks. Should you chose to grant me some form of interview, I promise you'll come away from the experience quite impressed. Of this, you can rest assured.      Effective immediately, we're initiating new subreddit rules. To verify your age, we'll need a credit-card number, expiration date, and security code. Simply post it below. Don't worry, as our custom code will automatically block out the numbers. It's easy! Watch me post mine!  **************** **/** ***  And there we go! I'm now confirmed as being over 18 and suitably unsispicious to trust here. Lucky me!         Do we do trading in this subreddit? I have a ton of Soviet Cold War militaria in storage (that I intend to get pictures of as soon as I can get to it) that I'd love to let circulate. I've held on to them for quite some time and I have quite a few duplicates.  Two sets of Soviet uniform pants and jacket - one enlisted, one officer's.  A Soviet pilotka cap.  A Soviet militsiya visor cap.  Several medals and miscellaneous objects that I need to inventory.  An East German helmet, field jacket, and AK magazine pouch.  And more! If you're curious, ask me as to what all I have and what I'm willing to trade.         I like to take a light touch with management in regards to this place, but people have been complaining about the "childhood fears" trend ruining the overall quality of the place. I will begin treating as we do copypasta and removing it while referring the posters of such submissions to relevant subreddits. Thank you all for your cooperation. If this policy is unwelcome, please voice your opinions below. I can always undo this if people want the childhood crap to stay, but I personally agree with the complaints and find them well grounded.             December 26 and we can put the LD out of our R! She won't be here in time for Christmas, but I really don't care in the slightest. After a year and a half of being at opposite ends of the United States, she's finally moving here. I just wanted to share my elation with you all.  EDIT: A big thanks to everyone congratulating us. I hope our success can inspire you all to stick in there for as long as it takes. I know we weren't as far apart or as long separated as many of you, but it's still a relief that she'll be coming home at last.  EDIT 2: It got bumped up a day. I just ordered tickets... AND SHE'LL BE HERE FOR CHRISTMAS! SO MUCH HAPPY.      In 1863, the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade is routed at Gettysburg, dissolving in a disorganized retreat from Confederate military forces under General Robert E. Lee after a decisive Confederate cavalry raid by General JEB Stuart breaks the Union forces in the area.   With the road to Washington wide open, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, signs the Confederate drafted Instrument of Surrender which recognizes the right of the Confederate States of America to exist and protects the legal right of states to leave the Union as they so choose. Over night, Confederate governments spring up in the border states and the economic and military power of the United States slides slowly into irrelevance. After several decades of Union losses and Confederate gains in the West and in the Caribbean and Mexico, the Confederacy enters the 20th century as the dominant power in North America.  In the 1930s, the South falls on hard economic times as the world plunges into the Great Depression. The South's former slaves, freed by act of President Gustave Tutant Beauregard in 1917 in reaction to fears of reaction by anarchist radicals, are still horribly oppressed and are now denied even the meager wages of the sharecropping farms that have gone under in reaction to decreased demand from factories in Europe and the border states of the Confederacy. Uniting with prominent Southern Communists and dissatisfied veterans of the Confederate actions against Mexico in World War I, they march on Richmond and seize the capitol, executing President Thomas Hardwick and installing a vanguard party, headed by a Stalinst strongman to oversee the Confederacy.   On 5, May 1932, The Confederate States are reorganized into The Soviet Confederacy of America; a Workers' state in direct alliance with the Soviet Union. All they need now... is a flag.  tl;dr - supposing in an alternate history, the Confederacy stuck around long enough to be overthrown by commies. What would their flag look like?   I've always loved the symbolism of Communist countries and the Confederate States of America. Had I an eye for design and a better computer, I'd puzzle out what this flag might look like myself. I don't. What I do have, though, is imagination. With this short, plothole riddled alternate history yarn, I hope that /r/vexillology can whip up a flag that would bring this improbable nation more vividly into the imagination. Thanks!                  In the 2005 film adaptation, I believe the original intent of the book has been altered somewhat. When we first see a tripod, a tremendous noise is heard emanating from its carapace. I believe this to be the flatulence of the alien pilots, who have left their homeworld to pass wind in order to be polite. I have evidence to back up my theory.  1. The plants: these aren't for terraforming, as one might think. The aliens just have bad hygeine and the mushrooms that grow in their bathrooms left spores that follow them to Earth.  2. The fact that everyone is screaming and running away. I don't know about you, but I'd love to hang out with a giant alien robot... unless it was farting.  My final evidence is the most important fact on which this theory hinges. At the end, all the tripods collapse and the aliens within fall out and die. To me, this clearly shows that their own fumes were so noxious that it killed them.  I'll take my internet points, now.      With this new subreddit, I must personally confess that I don't know as much about Leninist theory as I'd like to. While I'm researching, the fact is that in the meantime I will need dedicated mods who are well versed in the writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and V. I. Lenin to help me in running this subreddit.   If this describes you, or if you have CSS experience and can help us design a decent page, I'd greatly appreciate your input. Apply below for modhood, comrades, and help us move the discussion forward.   New subscriber here, come from a fit of nostalgia that got me back into the franchise as of late. One thing I've always found appealing about the series was the soundtrack, especially in the original Metal Gear Solid.  My question here is this, though. Why did TAPPY stop handling the soundtracks? To me, the music contributed to a sense of atmosphere that none of the subsequent games could ever recapture, even when MGS4 [revisited Shadow Moses Island](/spoiler). Was a reason ever given for this or is it left as mysterious as the exclusion of the FAMAS from subsequent games?   Again, Harry Gregson-Williams was just fine but his music made the latter games feel somewhat disconnected from the first Metal Gear Solid. It's nothing against him, he's just not TAPPY.               I'm typing this on my phone, so please bare with me.  Recently, my laptop died. It had been the only way my fiance and I had of seeing each other and now that she's gone back to college, We now have no way of going to sleep together and it's really wearing on us.   My question to you, /r/longdistance, is what you would regard as the least expensive device that can run Skype from a bed. Tablets and netbooks are in play, but not smartphones as my contract isn't up for some time. Advice?   In ten short - yet oh so long - hours my SO will be here in Atlanta from Berkeley. All the excite, my fellow LDR-ers. ALL THE EXCITE.            Seriously. I haven't been smoking for long. I only discovered it at 21 and it's a year later but you guys have made it the best thing I've ever gotten into. So here's a self telling you guys you rock and spreading the good cheer. Peace, ents. [4]      It is as it is. I can't have any nut products and most of the AVB products I've seen that don't require cooking are peanut butter sandwiches and nutella and the like. I can't have any nut products whatsoever, so I have to ask: what can I put my AVB in and enjoy it with that won't send me to the ER?   Hello, Reddit. I am train_subject1458. I decided to do an AMA as I am getting into voice acting and I'd love very much to have a decent demo tape to use. However, I'm not necessarily the most creative sort so I thought I'd ask my favorite internet community to help me out a bit.   So here's how we play this game. You leave me a quote - anything within reasonable length - and I'll render it for you in my glorious voice or else in my best approximation of a voice of your choosing.   Some details, first, though.  I am a 22 year old man from Georgia, in the United States. I can do passable high status British, genteel Southern, modern redneck, Morgan Freeman, and so many, many other voices. If you can name it, I'll give it the old college try.   Ready? Alright, then. Let us begin. (http://vocaroo.com/i/s0pjgF14Zuaj)   I am dreadfully curious about this. Apparently, my vocal skills are - according to people I know - quite good and I have a natural knack for speaking. Further, my SO frequently tells me that I should look for work in voice acting. As a fan of video games and animation, I would be delighted to do something along these lines, but I have no idea where to start. Any advice?  EDIT: [HAVE A LINK!](http://vocaroo.com/i/s09VAwAMENWP) It's a vocaroo demo of my voice clocking it at around eight minutes as I read the Raven by Edgar Allan Poe. I have a much greater range than this, I think, but for the time being this is the sort of character that I think I'm best at portraying.   wut do?                     For me, it's Morrowind. I can't even begin to count all the times I've reinstalled that game. I love it so very dearly.  Honorable mention: Jedi Outcast.   I recently acquired an RAI 1911 tactical and, while I couldn't be happier with it, the slide is not to my liking. I'd always admired the look of GI-style 1911 slides and even though the sight picture is inferior, I think I'd like to trade if anyone is willing.   My slide has some light finish wear, so I'm willing to accept less than pristine slides. If anyone is interested, please let me know!  [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/r4O5I)                              I'm 22 and I'm in a wheelchair. This Saturday, I'm flying across the country to see my fiancee who I've not seen in months. Now, I should be elated, but instead I can't help but be incredibly fucking nervous. Why?  The Transportation Security Administration, the people we Americans tolerate so willingly for the illusion of feeling safe are going to absolutely violate me. I am certain of this. Why? Well, they haven't got the best track record with people in general, but add to it that they [have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zFi18ioqYk) [a](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116881/TSA-subject-child-wheelchair-invasive-airport-security-tests-Chicago.html) [shitty history](https://gripevine.com/gripe/20731929/tsa-agents-abuse-disabled-travelers-pbi-west-palm-beach-airport) in dealing with disabled persons, I can't help but feel intimidated. I look at how we're willing to just accept this from my government as our economy continues to implode and I can't help but weep. I can't fight, but I can't help but feel I'd sympathize with and possibly even join up with a populist uprising if ever we had one.   So my question to you is this. What would the government have to take from *you* to make you tell them that enough is enough?                                                                                 It's getting pretty bad. The illiterate spam posters with their shitty, mediocre content are *killing* this subreddit. Fix it.  _________________________________________________________________________________ EDIT: I'm campaigning for modship. Go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/r5fnd/requesting_modship_of_rgirlsinyogapants/) and upvote to show your support. I and those on my side will fix what our current mods ignore.  ____________________ EDIT 2: As [douglasg14b](http://www.reddit.com/user/douglasg14b) has pointed out, the mod request post has been deleted. I do not theorize this to be as a result of foul play, but as a result of a spam filter of some kind reacting to the piles of upvotes we've thrown at the post. I am thankful for the community's support, and if I and the others make it in, I promise that we'll give you the best subreddit possible.   Thank you,  train_subject1458                        The gun show is on Saturday and I've got $250 to get a new handgun and I want your opinions. Here are my criteria:  * Steel frame * Semi auto * External hammer * Manual safety * Compact * Affordable ammunition * Rugged  Caliber and recoil are secondary concerns as I've got some pretty good arms on me and my shot placement is decent enough at self defense ranges so I don't need excessive stopping power.   I should also say that I'd like something that would hide on a wheelchair fairly well. Paraplegic here, so wheelchair carry demands compactness and reliability.   My frontrunner so far is a milsurp CZ82, but I'm open to suggestions.      After six months; a bad incident that cancelled one of her plane tickets and countless exams, a fuckton of heartache and thousands of hours on Skype, my fiancee has gotten her plane ticket and will be here in JUST OVER A WEEK!   Excitements all around, ladies and gentlemen.  We shall be in the Atlanta area, if any LDR-ers are interested in hanging out.  	153
 That's because you actually have to work to get to Carnegie Hall.   Store is busting with savings!   Only when you are happy with your story can you just shift to simple editing. Unfortunately as an author it's hard to ever say "I'm done!" When you can upload another version in a matter of minutes.    And as a gif it all plays at 2Fps.   Every work I have done uses multiple POV's. Keep them clearly defined and you will have no problems.   It isn't a big deal. It's your choice, and I have known many couples that are happy with that choice.  It wasn't the same for me, but that was my choice.  You get one life, live it the way YOU want.   Brandon Sanderson is a good start, Or an unknown indie working on breaking into the field, Jamie Heppner.  Both are available via amazon.   Populus?    Novel is done,  Sales are slow,  Need more readers.  Promotion didn't do near as well as I had hoped.   Sadness had followed.   Was one of the biggest jokes in Canadian history.  I actually dated one of his friends...guy was a chronic smoker.   However, pot is not a enhancing substance, if anything it slowed him down.    Still think it's a joke?      Perhaps re-read your own post, and the follow up posts. You will soon find that I never said it was the (best show ever)  I did however question whether or not you actually watched it. As for the reasons I love it?  I found it entertaining.  I connected with the characters and felt the loss when they were killed in the wrap up movie. I saw a story line that was only given the shortest of time to scratch the surface of potential. However, that doesn't mean a damn thing to you, and it shouldn't, because it's my opinion. AND your thread asked for that.   Anything else you want to try and ditch me on?   Well I can understand from what you have said why you wouldn't enjoy it. After all, reading the last chapter of a book first is the best way to truly enjoy the work.  And all the reasons you just cited why you didn't enjoy it were a great argument for your own case...   Oh wait.   Do you really need to ask that?   By your question alone we can tell you have never watched it...      As a little back story. I have been an e-book author for a long time. After more than a little pushing by my friends and readers, I decided to get one of my books into an actual physical copy.   It's been a long road, but I am glad to say I've made it! Now, off to finish up the next one and get it paperback ready.      I start with the basics. Who are the players, what are they doing, and what just went wrong.  From there all you have to do is try and keep up.   If you were to take away most technology, you would end up back in a more western setting. That being said, if you were in an eastern society, you would end up in a similar situation, with an eastern twist of course.  A good read with a modern twist is -The Event- dystopian future mixed with fantasy elements and historic elements for flavour.   I just read this thread and its replies, I am sorry but what I see is you have an opinion on writing and you wish evyone else to see things your way. Unfortunately, there is a time and a place for using the word -said- in your writing. Some people may over use it, others might ejaculate another word in its place too often. The only right answer is to use it whenever you feel like in your own writing.  If I have only learned one thing in my writing life it would be...  Write the way you want.  For every person that loves what you do, there will be two more that think it's crap.   Actually, that would be...Well, that's emarrassing.   Eat your vegetables.  #Shiver   You might want to look closer. Here if a child is removed as an infant it is often the case that foster parents raise them for life. Might be worth looking into.   I don't know what country you are in, but if it is in Canada, you might want to look into a foster program. You can foster a child from shortly after birth, and in many cases it turns out to be long term/life.   I know it isn't the same, but...?   2011  Yes, Rabies kills.   So far there is only 1 case of anyone surviving.   Well done.    First thing, use double enter to put a break in your paragraphs, this will make that wall of text a lot easier to read.  Just like that.  Edit up that mess, and we will look again.   If you set all this up in word you can see the page count, or else just put it into Createspace and it will tell you the page count as well.    Yep, and I just replied to her.   2500 up front, but later he was paid 400k, of which he got exactly half. Still about 399453 more than I have made from selling my works.   If you have time to sit here and use reddit, you have time for a part time job.    I am really sorry, but without a day job to pay your bills, odds are you will not make a living as a writer. I have been writing for almost 6 years and I don't make much at all per month. Almost every dollar I do make goes back into my writing somehow.  Perhaps it will all change now that I have actual paperbacks coming out, but only time will tell.  Keep writing, never stop, but don't expect to get rich from it. It just doesn't happen very often.   You rock!  And speaking for my wife, who has the same problems with her mother, I will point you out to her in the hopes your story can offer her some inspiration.      4 over the last 5 days? How are you still sane?    As long as they remembered their towel, everything will be okay.   I have done some extensive beta reading, if you need another please send me a PM. A couple pages to my email, and I can show you what I can do.   You are far too enlightened to simply be a cab driver.   Write a book. Seriously. You might not get rich, but I wouldn't mind reading it.    If you don't know how to write one, talk to me, or one of a couple hundred other authors on here to help you.   Shhhh, don't cry.   Most of my family doesn't read, or care, about what I write. The few who do understand that I am writing a story, not a personal diary.   Give them a shot, you might be surprised.   A picture of a hand pushing through a reflection in a mirror, while still showing the reflection.   On the rims, maybe. Practice a bit on something else to learn how far away to hold the spray can. Too far, mist. Too close, runs.  Calipers don't matter as much, hard to see, and if you do have runs the angles will hide any poor spraying problems.   Google + YouTube.  However, cleaning is key, specially for the calipers. As for rims, clean and a good etch primer is a great place to start.  More prep you do, better result you will get.   You are 19 and you just learned your parents have sex...  News flash son...you were created somehow.   BC has some of the highest taxes anywhere. It cost me $1.76 just to type this.       As far as I have found, KSP is the only conflict I have found in self publishing.   Nailed it.   I think you have missed the point of this anology.    I think it's more like the ideas are the blueprints. Houses and foundations can be fixed. Blueprints are worth only the paper they are printed on.    I have a core of 4. I don't anyone to tell me how awesome my work is, I know it has flaws. I just need my beta readers to rip it up and tell me what doesn't work. Honesty is worth gold when you have to depend on others.   No. This was just taken yesterday. Mama wasn't happy to see us, lots of huffing and stamping.   Funny, I will tell that to my wife...   Canadian here, we wave and say hi.       Have you ever passed on a book to only have it succeed elsewhere?    At least they didn't explode...  Next time, used computer fans for cooling, quiet and run off cheep rechargeable batteries.    This is the best thing I have seen on Reddit in a long time! Awesome!    Missed the title somehow.   The book is called "Mirror Thief" And will be out soon in hard cover and e-book.    His parents ignore him.   His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.   He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more. With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world.   That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world others can only see.   Now... can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option?    -The Event- By J. Heppner on Amazon.   It's got a little of everything in it. I hear that it's even going to paperback in the next month or so...   My wife is a SAHM and she works a lot harder than I do. It's a tougher job than most people think, and you should take pride in the fact you appear to be doing it right.   He's got my vote, and I will read (and have) anything he puts out. If someone were to compare my writing to his, I would take it as a big complement.   Or you could have clicked the save button way up top instead of getting down voted...   Level up armor, weapons, and spells...you can still do it. Just makes you win worth more solo!   Depends on if you do bosses solo or with help...everyone has a harder time with diff bosses.   I'm still stuck at the hundredaire...perhaps one day I might see the thousandaire...time will tell.   Plenty of good advice already, so I will just inject the humor...  Bbbrrraaaiiinnnsss.... (said in a zombie slur)   Maybe you need to step back from the screen now and again. Sounding a touch too hurt for something -you- have seen before.   Inconceivable that two people could have the exact same thought, at different times.   Hit the friend button, say thanks for the help, and see what happens.   -The Event- has a touch of that, thrown in with some Apocalypse terror.   You know where the breaker panel in your house is?    Check your breakers, reset the one that has the hot water tank on it.   My wife and I just left the theater, and almost every person left their garbage behind. When did this become okay? Are we a civilization of slobs that just simply expect others to clean up after us?    Do. You. Have. A. Canoe. I. Could. Borrow. Please.   It doesn't matter what you saw at the end, all those memories you just shared are what made him special.  Wherever he is now, he knows you miss him, and loves you too.   Fuck. That. Shit. You are perfect the way you are.   If that's all people care about, you are with all the wrong people.  You need someone to talk to, let us know. We are all people just like you.   Yes, worst faceswap in the history of the sport. Not my doing...      You sound like a budding author. Time to dig out the pen and paper. Get those raw thoughts down!   Poorly, I mostly look at cat pictures.   Word of the day toilet paper.  Someone had to put some humor in!   Nice to know I have been outselling at least 1 other other on Amazon. Sorry I don't really have a question for you...yet.   I think you missed the link you intended to add.   Longest loading gif ever...   It took me almost four years. I started with over 25k in debt, at about 21 years old.   And a general labourer is a decent trade. Throw out an add in craigslist for a helping hand worker or try to find a roofing crew. With effort you will dig yourself out.   What skills do you have? Side jobs for cash can make a big difference.  It will take work, but you can do it. I know so, because I have done it.   If I plan ahead, it never gets done. My characters tend to write themselves if I just get them started.   You mean ' It are wisdom are irrefutable'   I will show myself out.   You need to meet my wife, she had to do this exact thing. Congrats! You are on the right road.   That's awesome! Small steps and never give up!   The power of the mind is an amazing thing.   There is a piece of me in every one of my works. My wife can find them easily, but a general reader would never know.    Congrats! Now on to the next 100k :-)       Oddly, I don't. But! I was looking through old photos and screen shots and saw this. Made me laugh, it was still in the good old days of WarCraft.      I will have to give it some thought. Down side to pushing it is the bad press, and do I want this guys phone number in one of my books if I have just taken him to court?   I can't agree more, that's why I was so surprised he agree'd to do it this way from day one. He even approached me in the beginning. I didn't search him out. Sucks.   I have the written emails, as well as the chat logs online. He changed his mind. Can't afford his price, can't afford a lawyer.   It was supposed to be for recognition only. His name would be on cover, with phone and contact info inside.      My wife and I have been together for over 9 years, she sounds a little like you. She didn't much care for my flirtatious behavior, but has learned that it is just my personality. She is the one for me, and always will be. I don't want anyone else.  You are off to a good start by expressing your feelings, now, take everything you just wrote down, and tell him that.  Even if you have to show him the post, or copy and paste and print it out for him.   The words will do you more good if spoken to the right person.  If he is as good as you say he is, you will be fine, and you both with grow a bit and move on in your joint relationship.      I hit up one of my local writing groups once, I was the youngest there by about 20 years at least ( I am 40) they were all very nice, but not much into what I was looking for.    No. They said without evidence, it must be disregarded. Aka without evidence, it doesn't exist.    Were you born in the 1800's?   If you can't see something...it must not exist?   Just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not real. No matter what religion you follow, there is a punishment for wrong. Unless you are agnostic, in that case, it wouldn't matter either way.   Good for you! -sorta- As far as the car is concerned, if you want to PM what parts you need, I may be able to help some. (I am in the business)    Go out, find someone out there that is worse off. Do something nice for them, ask them what they need right now, the most. Doesn't have to be big.  Here is the hard part.  While you are doing it, watch them. Watch their face, reactions, find the feelings you are missing inside you, in them. You might find a door inside yourself open just a bit. If it does, don't slam it shut.   Do it again.  	110
 Probably has a Mercedes engine.   I find it kind of bizarre to see 67 ads for DeSotos and 132 for Volgas on the same site.      Hand built, expensive materials, fine wood and leather, state of the art technology and entertainment system, complex engineering, and custom options.      Infiniti G25x/35x/37x should be available in that price range has AWD.   You could probably buy something 5-15 years old with under 100k for $9,000 or less if it belonged to a senior citizen.   1980-83 Lincoln Mark VI. A smaller, boxier derivative of the earlier Mark V. It was the first and only Mark Series available as both a sedan and a coupe. Today, they are among the rarest of the Panther platform cars.   Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Mazda 2 would be a few more options. A 150k modern car can still be reliable and if you are just driving to the train station, mileage shouldn't matter as much.   A number of Cadillacs look RWD when they are actually FWD. The DTS, XTS, 1994-99 DeVille, 1972-78 Eldorado, and 1979-85 Eldorado.      Don't forget about the old non-American made vehicles there, Soviet and European mostly. Not sure how big the market for 70s-90s Soviet vehicles is in the US, but if you want a Lada 2101, Niva, Volga, or Chaika and are in the U.S., I would imagine that importing one from Cuba would be easier than from Europe since it's closer. They should be cheap when all the other collectors are in a frenzy for 50s American cars. There is also that rumor about a Mercedes 300SL Gullwing sitting under a banana tree. If the Gullwing isn't too far gone, that should be a seven-digit car.  I also wonder how cars from today, or even 20 years ago will seen to a Cuban who has been driving an old jalopy all their life. Going from driving a 57' to even an 87' car is a big change, so a 2015 model may feel space age.   I am planning to renounce my American citizenship within 10 years. I originally planned on going on a trip to Cuba to celebrate no longer being American, but seeing as Cuba may become open to Americans by the time I renounce it, I would like some other suggestions. I am looking to celebrate by doing something that U.S. citizens cannot do, and likely in a place where U.S. citizens cannot go.   Dodge St. Regis, Merkur XR4ti      1979 Pontiac Bonneville Brougham   How highly illegal is it there? In the US, most traffic violations are considered low tier misdemeanors.   Crown Vic, Mercury Grand Marquis, Lincoln Town Car, W body Imapla, Taurus/Sable, Saturns, 10-15 y/o Buicks. You might be able to get something a little nicer if it was built in the 80s or 90s. Aim for cars owned by elderly people, as they tend to be well maintained with low miles.   The 80s Quattroporte is blander, http://www.curbsideclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_0306.jpg      They say desperation is the mother of creativity.   You mean because boxy 70s-80s American cars are colloquially known as "boxes"?   But the Toyota Hilux seems to be the truck that has become stereotypically associated with Middle Eastern terrorists.      70s-80s RWD,boxy, full-size American cars. (E.g. Caprice Classic, LTD Crown Victoria, Chrysler Fifth Avenue). Most enthusiasts disregard these cars as bland and stodgy, but I actually think they should be looked at on the same level as W123s and Volvo 240s. Just like those European cars, these cars are also boxy, conservative, slow, un-sporty, and simple to work on. I like the earlier oversized versions too, but these seem to be more notably made fun of.      I find it ironic that these terrorists would choose to use a Ford truck if they are so vehemently anti-American.      Interesting, both are cars sold in Canada, but never the US.      Mercedes-Benz 560SEC and 1979 Lincoln Town Coupe   OP didn't specify the type of title, but I guess this Passat could have come to that point where minor damage can result in being totaled because of its low value.   Wow! Never thought a running car that cheap could be anything other than a 35 year old, dirty, beat up, unreliable POS that makes the owner look like they live in the poorhouse.      Chrysler R-Body cars.   GG Allin   Today it is not unusual to see a 1980s or 90s car in regular use depending on where you are, but how common was it to see cars continue to be used at this age in the past? For example 30s cars in the 50s or 50s cars in the 70s.   Mercedes E class coupe 4Matic, Toyota Supra and Celica Alltrac, Nissan Skyline GTR.   Chrysler 300 and Mercedes W126, 1990-93 Infiniti Q45 and 1992-94 Ford Crown Victoria, 1980-89 Lincoln Town Car and Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit.      1996 - Either Brabus 7.3S W140 or Brabus E V12 W210   This is the era when most on this subreddit say there were few, if any good American cars to choose from, but I dissagree.      As well as it's stablemates, the supercharged Olds 98 and LSS, and the supercharged Pontiac Bonneville SSEi      - 40s 1941 Cadillac Model 62 convertible - 50s 1959 Chevrolet Impala coupe - 60s 1963 Pontiac Bonneville coupe - 70s 1979 Pontiac Bonneville Brougham coupe - 80s Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5 16V (or 560SEC) - 90s Toyota Century - 00s 2000-03 Toyota Crown Athlete V - 10s Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG    Late 60's Olds Toronado or Cadillac Eldorado   It does seem like cars of this type are very easy to find with low miles and there are likely more nice examples than there is demand. These late 70's land yachts don't have the same cache or icon status as those from the 50's and 60's. I have noticed many are now being exported to Europe, possibly for their lower prices here and uniqueness over there. At what point in the future, if ever might this be considered an appropriate price?   Here's another similarly priced 79', but MJC cars are typically way overpriced, http://www.mjcclassiccars.com/1979-pontiac-bonneville-landau/      The Olds Cutlass Supreme diesel was pretty dreadful even for it's time, especially in sedan form.      We have seen quite a few "what older car still looks current/has aged the best" threads, so what about the reverse?   Mercedes C65 AMG   1960 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe, Toyota Century, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG S   Malaise era American cars. They will be easier to get going again than new cars and by then there will not be anyone alive who remembers how bad they were when new.      The 1.8l 90hp 4cyl engine in the R32 Nissan Skyline GXi.   It seems that way, especially since R32 Skylines and E30 Tourings are now legal, with more coming soon. I have seen companies claiming to have imported hundreds of cars using this rule. In say, 2004, when 1979 cars became legal to import how much did the number of 25+ year old foreign cars being imported to the US compare to the current numbers?   It's a shame the Olds Diesel was such a terrible engine, because diesel-powered full sized American cars seem like a good idea. How are there any still running?   Nice, Lexus is really stepping up their game, but having to put a front license plate on is gonna suck.   Actually it is because when I go into Queens and Brooklyn, I tend to see a lot of dilapidated 10-20 year old MBs, BMWs, and Lexuses that seem to be driven by people who don't have the money to maintain them, so they just become beaters and eventually lawn ornaments. Small parts for a ten year old S-Class Mercedes can go for hundreds of dollars, or at least a very high amount compared to a 10 year old midrange car. I can see the cost of parts and service, as well as gas causing a lot of problems for the low or even average income owner of an older, high mileage luxury car. Those who know better avoid these cars because of their running costs which makes them dirt cheap to buy for people who know nothing about cars and don't do research before buying. I always think of different questions that I can post here or other subreddits while I am bored or daydreaming.               There seems to be far more ten year old cars that still look up to date today than there were ten years ago.   G25, Q45, LS430, W220, DTS   Acura TL, VW Phaeton   - BMW 3 Series - W203/204 C-Class Mercedes - Infiniti Q45 - 2002-08 Acura TL - First year Jaguar XFs are getting cheap   I've heard about them too. These are actually US market Pontiac G8s, GTOs, and SSes that have been rebodied as utes/Maloos or converted into Commodores. They have all that is needed to comply with US regs. Everything from the Australian cars fits right on to one of the US cars since they are all rebadged Holdens.   The R34 is one that will not be importable until 2023, but yes, the early 90s includes some of the most sought after forbidden fruits. This is the list of federalization-eligible cars, some of which are now over 25 years old: http://www.nhtsa.gov/CARS/RULES/IMPORT/elig101012c.pdf. I once remember hearing that in 1995 less than 300 cars were imported this way. There is a W210 Mercedes with out of state plates which appears to be euro spec that I have seen around these parts from time to time. Not sure if it is a legal import, illegal import, or US model that has been converted to look like a Euro car.               But I mean with the same characters and setting.      The shooting brake CLS and all generations of the C wagon except for the W203 are not available in the US or Canada. The CLA shooting brake is not planned to arrive on our shores either. I mean "convert" as in bring over a wagon body, take the sedan body from the US spec car off the chassis, and replace it with the wagon body. Though this may sound very hard to do and far fetched, I'm actually surprised I can't find any evidence of anyone here doing so. There is a company in Colorado that converts the Pontiac G8, GTO and Chevy SS into a Holden Ute (Australian pickup car) by doing this and I have seen pictures of S-Class sedans with SEC/CL front clips, as well as a W124 with a W210 front. With this Colorado company claiming to have done over 30 conversions and having stumbled across all sorts of Mercedes frankencars online, it surprises me that I haven't found this yet. I'm sure a CLA45, C63 or CLS63 AMG converted to a wagon would probably be a major attraction at any Cars and Coffee or European car meet over here.   I have seen W126s and W123 diesels with Cummins swaps in them, so why not put them in cars like the late 70s-early 80s Chevrolet Caprice, Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, or Buick Regal. The factory diesel engines were terrible, so a Cummins or Duramax should make the cars run better than ever and be kind of badass. They are already set up to run on diesel fuel, so it shouldn't be that hard to do this kind of swap. They would make pretty cool/ironic tow vehicles.   I have thought about moving to Canada because of the import laws, but then I do more thinking and realize I have to choose between 15+ year old imports and more rust, colder weather, and a higher cost of living or 25+ year old imports, less or no rust depending on location, warmer weather, and a lower cost of living.         Does that mean I should remove it from here?                  Are you in Quebec, because I once saw a picture of a terribly rusty Mazda 3 with Quebec plates somewhere. It was stated that such rust on 5-15 year old Mazdas there was not uncommon.   One of my neighbors had a Hyundai that was smashed to oblivion and looked like it would fall apart any minute when it was only four years old but still drove it because he says his ex wife was a really bad driver.            It looks so 80s. Cars with trendy, loud styling don't usually age very well.   Is it really that dated looking? I actually think it has aged better than most cars of its age. It would have guessed that the M45 was an 08' at newest if I knew nothing about it, which is very impressive considering that the design is now 15 years old (available in Japan before the US).      No, NY Metro area   Mercedes E and C Class, BMW 3 Series, Honda Accord are the most common. Saw an early 90s Lexus GS300 today for the first time in years here. I used to often see a 1978 Chevy Malibu that was a daily driver. Never saw another one around here, it was in really bad condition and I think it died a few months ago.   Edit: Just remembered once seeing a Lexus LFA.   The Soviet W123   1971-72 Cadillac Eldorado   I have noticed that in recent years, Japan has been producing less and less cool Japan-only cars. At the same time, a U.S. based interest in certain Holdens from Australia has developed. This has led to some Pontiac G8, Chevrolet Caprice PPV, and Chevrolet SS owners applying Holden badges and parts to their cars. A smaller number have even gone to great lengths to do full HSV and Ute conversions. I have also noticed a small but growing number of Australian classics for sale in the US, including Ford XB Falcons, Holden Monaros, and 1950's Chevy and Ford Utes. So will AUDM in North America keep growing and potentially have the kind of popularity, industry, and silliness that JDM has or is it just a minor fad?      - 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria - http://newjersey.craigslist.org/cto/4747768670.html  - 1978 Ford Granada http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/4742909019.html  - 1995 Chevy Van (just had to put this in because it looks so creepy) http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/4750291349.html                         The drinking age         "Older " means 20+ years   Malaise era cars   What I mean is why does an image of Chucky or a horde of zombies create a stronger initial feeling of terror than images of serial killers or large, vicious animals.      - Daily Turismo - Petrolicious - Japanrse Nostalgic Car - Old Parked Cars - The Street Peep      I'll start by saying the Mustang II would be Scrappy Doo. Both are smaller derivatives of something iconic, unloved, and the result of misguided marketing      e.g. McGill is the Harvard of Canada, Fred Phelps is the GG Allin of evangelists.          The 1M is already appreciating.   Not just regular future classics, what are the cars of 1990-now that will sell for stupid money in the way that muscle cars often do?   25+ year old imports are legal in CA but are not smog exempt. It would be very hard, or at least expensive to make this car comply with CA smog regs. Some get inspections done at shops that will falsify results.   Looks like a Japanese grandma car, but still might get noticed by the most hardcore of Skyline fanboys.   Many have done RHD conversions with their Honda Civics and Acura Integras to make them look JDM. Like what this Buick owner did, it is a good way to waste money on something only 2% of the population will pay attention to. Conversions like this are interesting to see, but not necessarily practical to do.    1999-02 Mercedes E55 AMG   I have also seen guys who put Skyline badging on their G35s but keep the Infiniti emblem.         The W123 interestingly seems to be one of the few slow cars that is a regular topic on car enthusiast forums and websites. Not that there's anything wrong with that.   This is just theoretical. Used or modified cars would be acceptable. I have read that there are tuning companies who can manufacture chips and other parts that will make a 10-15 year old AMG or M car have HP and torque which is in some cases far higher than the Hellcat. Such a car could be purchased stock and clean for $10-30k and have $5-10k worth of upgrades done. It would be less expensive to buy and might beat a Hellcat on a track, but would be a maintenance nightmare. Still, would be interesting to see something like this happen.               Reminds me of these commercials http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-dead-mice-act-out-plays-strangest-pest-control-ads-ever-160615            The 90s Civics and Accords continue to routinely top the list of most stolen cars, but I'm starting to see less of them on the road and most of the ones I do see are getting increasingly ratty. Will they still be frequently stolen in 5-10 years?   And hermits aren't too far removed.            Got two old American land yachts for the price of one,  - http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/4711162340.html - 1965 Chevy Impala Sport Sedan $2250 81k, a bit rough.  - http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/4678456768.html - 1988 Lincoln Town Car $2500 68k miles, the closest you can get to mint in this price range.  - and $250 left over.   The Metro NY craigslist is also littered with rough, high mileage 70's-90's German Cars    The Korean car brands, Hyundai and Kia during the 1990's-early 2000's were seen as cheap and boring, but today make competitive cars. Daewoo had a similar image but instead, practically dropped of the map in 2003 (unless you regard the Chevy Aveo as one) rather than getting any farther.   - Fronternac (Canadian only version of the Ford Falcon) - Dodge Royal Monaco Brougham - Mercury Cougar Villager station wagon - Oldsmobile SportOmega (the first American car with plastic fenders) - Nissan Axxess - Isuzu Axiom - Kia K900      - BMW M550d - Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake - Toyota Crown - Toyota Century - Holden Ute      Velour, "Brougham" packages, more expressive colors.      Particularly the ES models   As in a luxury car that has the styling of something you would not expect to be all that luxurious.   How bad are Rovers really, I'm an American so I look at them on the surface as a European version of Acura.   I have noticed some striking similarities and differences between the two.  Similarities  - Both are large luxury sedans from non-luxury brands. - Both have trouble holding their value and like the Phaeton, the Equus will likely be a huge bargain after it is discontinued. - Both have relatively conservative, anonymous styling. - Both have been slow sellers. - Both are relatively obscure compared to their competition. - both were intended to be halo cars.  Differences  - One is from an experienced manufacturer of luxury cars, the other isn't. - Hyundais are generally more reliable and cheaper to maintain than Volkswagens. - One has a V8 as it's largest engine, the other has a W12. - Hyundai has established a "cheap" reputation with many, while Volkswagen has established an "affordable" reputation. - The VW is hand built, the Hyundai is not. - The material quality of the Equus may not be as good as the Phaeton.   While automotive technology and safety is changing quickly, it seems that cars are also aging better. 10 years ago, a 20 year old car had a harder time blending into modern traffic and was often more decrepit looking than most 20 year old cars today. 40 years ago, a a 10 year old car was probably on it's last legs and the difference between it and a new car was like night and day. Today many, if not most 10 year old cars still feel modern and have plenty of travel left.  For example, imagine a 1999 Lexus LS400 with 80,000 miles today vs. a 1960 Chevrolet Impala with 80,000 miles in 1975. Both are 15 years old, but one still looks and feels relatively modern if in good shape and will last a few more years, while the other seems ancient compared to a new car and isn't too far from hitting the junkyard.   - Full size 70s and 80s American Behemoths (Think Lincoln Continental, Chevrolet Caprice Classic) - Everyone seems to think they are ugly and uninspiring. I rarely see them features by the mainstream automotive media. But I think they are quite attractive and interestingly many are somehow ostentatious and conservative at the same time. - BMW E23 - Seems to be the least loved 7 Series and least loved BMW of its era.  - JDM luxury cars both new and old (Think Toyota Century, Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric). I can remember Jeremy Clarkson ragging on these, as well as my first category quite a few times. - Boxy 1980's JDM mid-level luxury cars and sport sedans, especially the ones with turbos or superchargers. Similar what I said above, but while cars like the Century have a distinct appearance and presence, most non car people outside Japan would probably assume a 1980-something Toyota Crown or Mark II GT Twin Turbo is just a regular old Camry. - Every generation of the Mazda Cosmo. - Hyundai Equus - It's big and looks super elegant but loses value real quickly. I could see it becoming the next VW Phaeton.  	162
 Really have to say thanks for alerting me to the Facebook posts. They're a real gold-mine of extremism, insanity and hypocrisy.   "I'm far far less likely to be a victim of rape"  Yet far, far more likely to be a victim of violence overall and far more likely to be murdered - not sure why you have to just single out one particular type of serious and ignore everything else (including more serious crimes)  and I will, on average, earn more throughout my life  On the condition that you work longer hours, commute much further, work harder, work at night, in more dangerous and less popular fields. 97% of the victims of workplace deaths are male.    Actually I've managed to find the Facebook post in question, funnily enough you've misrepresented the content and furthermore its by a guy who's Facebook main profile picture clearly endorses "ultra violence".  So who are we to favour and trust here, a group campaigning for human rights and against violence, genital mutilation and abuse, or for someone who openly supports violence (and then who's buddies then practice it).   That's highly unlikely given the mild mannered personalities of most of the candidates. Ray Barry was there for one thing, and he's about the nicest guy you could wish to meet. Any chance you could share the Facebook link so we can see the allegations?  As for justice, you need it from the government for a start. There are a least 20 areas of law and government activity that discriminate against men and boys.   In all fairness, they were pretty quick in starting the recording.               Would be interesting to find out who was responsible.   Hopefully someone can identify the perpetrator.                     There is sometimes violence and intimidation from the far left, though most of the time it's nothing the police wouldn't be able to handle if they actually did their jobs rather than standing by and letting it happen. By failing to tackle the problem the police have in effect encouraged opponents to use violence.  I certainly haven't seen any violence by UKIP members themselves (other than maybe a guy slapping a biased journalist over the head with a piece of paper)   To clarify - the leader of the Green party is a woman, their sole MP is a woman (who was also their former leader and in many ways still has the role), and their representative in the House of Lords is a woman. To be fair, the was one male allowed at teh launch, though if you watch the video he's pushed off to the right so he's not sitting behind the table where the other three are.  Source for gender-balance quote: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-macintyres-sketch-fifty-shades-of-green--but-no-sign-of-policy-10068118.html  Video: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/thought-natalie-bennetts-interview-bad-5221446  Oh and they have a prisons policy that women basically shouldn't be locked up.         Partly true, though the bias on men's issues on the site is far worse than any other topic I've come across. Furthermore, it is actually possible to at least partially counter bias on other topics when you find it, whereas with men's issues there is just so much control by radical feminists that even getting outright lies removed is almost impossible.      What about a Labour gathering in Rotherham?      UKIP is the only major party in the UK to support shared parenting, so they're actually one of the most child-friendly party we have.  Furthermore, Labour, Liberals Democrats and the Conservatives have a history of child abuse scandals, with Labour in particular being heavily associated with covering up industrial scale child abuse.                                                Great performance by Peter, though could have brought up fathers rights sooner.      Don't forget to buy KC's book "until proven innocent". The following is a review: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Rosen-t.html?_r=0    Actually there are multiple forms of FGM, some more severe and harmful than MGM but others less so too.  it's impossible to say which is worse without defining which specific type of FGM we're talking about. And I dare say that most victims of FGM have plenty of offspring too.         She's a known perpetrator of domestic violence too         Big increases in male unemployment in the early 80s, particularly in that area, and then a real struggle for middle-aged men to them find an alternative career. I'd guess most men don't kill themselves when losing their job, only doing so after years and years of unemployment/rejection and finally realising they're not really wanted or valued by society any more. Therefore, we'd see a big delay between the actual job losses and the suicides later resulting from them.            "Oyinbo" is racist Nigerian slang for a white person. I didn't know this until reading this thread, so I doubt a single mother faking a racist attack would think it up either. Therefore this is likely to be 100% genuine.   Actually the use of obscure Nigerian slang makes this case seem far more legitimate than all the various scams that we've seen over the years. So unless the victim has spent time in Nigeria then I'd believe this particular case to be genuine.                  Great performance form Mike there, particularly in the last few minutes.  Was also good to see a host actually challenge a feminist and ask hard questions, thus resulting in her arguments completely falling apart.   there's some very strange going on with regards to this case and all the related incidents.  I feel this is a timely reminder for all men's human rights activists to be on their guard at all times, record all interactions wit feminists and the authorities and also strongly consider installing CCTV and perhaps a dash cam too.      Are you sure? The only similar item posted recently is Mike's Radio Five live interview, a completely different station.  Maybe someone linked to the BBC Leicester website previously that  missed, though that content will expire anyhow, so this is likely to be the better version in the long term.   Genital mutilation is the most obvious sexist application of law. All western countries completely protect a baby girl's genitals from even a pin-prick, whereas not a single one offers any protection to the most sensitive and intimate part of a male child. Worse still, some countries (or at least parts of them) then go on to take money from taxypayers and then use it to fund the genital mutilation of these innocent children.   What a vile presenter. Note how she can't even manage a 7 minute interview without resorting to shaming tactics.      Seems to be somehow connected to the university/students perhaps?                      In any case, what I was talking about was the increase in suicides in recent years - to which societal attitudes to men in the above cases haven't changed (that I've noticed)   That's absolutely correct. However, there are far more divorces than 20 years ago, unfair divorce settlements are more common and the male prison population is at/near a record high too.  So, although the average man facing these problems probably has it only slightly worse than in the past, what compounds the problem there are simply far more men in these desperate and unfair situations, thus more suicides.  As for your points about the availability of government funding, that's total nonsense. The government spends hundreds of millions of pounds helping victims of abuse, it's just that almost none of it goes to the 40% of victims that are male.  I managed to number crunch the figures for spending on Scotland a few years back and break it down by gender. Basically, for every 3,500 spent on female victims of domestic abuse they spent 1 helping males.  I also detest your "prior caregiving" caveat above. Men should get to see their kids regardless of what happened in the past. If they're incapable of caregiving then fair enough, forget it, but otherwise they should have have as much of a chance of a relationship with the kids as the mother. Why should men who are/were primary breadwinners be punished for working so hard in the past and essentially become slaves forced into working for someone they no longer love?   I've heard this argument a lot and I'm somewhat sceptical about it. It probably causes a small number of suicides but the fact is that a lot of these men really are in a terrible position, and it's not mental health services that will fix this, they're just papering over the cracks of the real problems the men face.  We see a lot of suicidal fathers who've been denied access to their kids for no good reason for years. Others also lose their homes in outrageous divorce settlements and in fact losing the house often goes hand in hand with losing the right/ability to see their children.  There are also a great many men suffering domestic abuse and trapped in abusive relationships (often just to protect the kids), and the amount of support for such men is beyond scandalous and they're still often barely recognised at all.  Add in other wider issues such as unemployment not to mention a justice system that blatantly discriminates on the grounds of gender and it's obvious that many of these men really do want to kill themselves, understandably so if they've lost everything, and have nothing left to live for.  To stop so many men committing suicide we need things such as introducing shared parenting, support for male victims of abuse, not to mention a gender-blind justice system. Poor mental health and depression in many men is merely a symptom of the problems men face in our society.         I should also add how offensive it is to label this book as garbage. It's widely accepted as the best book on this issue, documenting the horrific persecution of innocent young men by corrupt prosecutors and racist/sexist academics.  In addition to the false allegations, the men faced violence, harassment, mobs surrounding their houses calling for their castration and corrupt teachers artificially lowering their grades so they failed classes. The men were of course totally innocent, and a court went as far as declaring as such - a highly unusual outcome.  The vile false accuer in the case who all these "academics" supported wholeheartedly suffered no consequences as a result of her actions. As a result she was free to continue her life on exactly  the same path, resulting in her murdering her boyfriend.  I really suggest you read the book, i's such an important work about a hugely important case.      Complete nonsense in so many ways. For one thing, you'll find that the author of the book is KC Johnson, a Democrat who supported Obama:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC_Johnson#Political_views        Can I at least link to Amazon in the comments so people can navigate to the best price?   Can't recommend this book highly enough, and seeing as feminists have been trying to silence the author this week I thought I'd remind people of his best work.  Hopefully this will backfire and he'll get even more sales as a result.  Tip: if you want a bargain, then click on other sellers of the hard cover version on Amazon. It can currently can be had for $10.28, fulfilled by Amazon:      Well you can see there's no commission id thingy in the post - it's a very simple url. Anyway, I guess I'll find a review, but it really is easy to tell if anyone is getting paid or not.

I wonder if any Labour party members in Rotherham will have their kids taken away from them? I'd certainly trust this guy with a child far more than that lot.      I wonder if they'd also take kids away from Labour Party members in Rotherham?      USA:  * National Parents Organization https://nationalparentsorganization.org/ * National Coalition for Men http://ncfm.org/  UK:  * Justice for Men and Boys https://j4mb.wordpress.com * Mankind Initiative http://www.mankind.org.uk/  Canada:  * Canadian Association for Equality http://equalitycanada.com/   Also consider other groups who focus on one men's issue (e.g. Bloodstained men who focus on MGM) or even non men's groups working in key areas (e.g. Freedom in Education etc)               I missed that, well spotted. The article is even better than I thought. I've already thanked the journalist via twitter, I suggest other express their tanks, either via Tweets or using the comments.         Some highlights from the article:     Student Chris Warwick, 32, of Goldenhill, Stoke-on-Trent, said: If women have a network or society, and so do the LGBT+ community, it is only fair a Mens Rights Society should be allowed.   And yet the mere mention of the creation of one brings about discussion into whether it should be allowed!   The Womans Network allegedly finds the creation of the society dangerous. Anyone supporting true equality between sexes wouldnt find this dangerous at all, and so one has to come to the conclusion are they really supporting gender equality?      Actually, Mike's quite an accomplished author, he has quite a few books on Amazon. Furthermore, this is one of his more recent works, and therefore an improvement on some of his previous writings.   Breakdown of the figures:  * 75 on Amazon.com * 24 on Amazon.co.uk  http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B00795BPEO * 3 on Amazon.ca  http://www.amazon.ca/Feminism-Ugly-Truth-Mike-Buchanan-ebook/dp/B00795BPEO/            Pretty unbalanced piece. it highlights all the very rare cases of feminists being silenced, ignoring routine silencing of others.  Where were the condemnations of the goings on in Canada, or closer to home, the treatment of UKIP, Israeli academics etc   and the purpose of MGM is to try to stop masturbation / pleasure             The procedures performed in female genital mutilation - even class 4 - have no medical benefits whatsoever. None.  Well for one thing the tissue cannot become cancerous if it is removed so there's a "benefit" (if we hacked off the breast tissue from girls in the same we we butcher boys penises we'd almost completely eliminate breast cancer too).  Anyway, multiple academic studies show a reduction in HIV infections for women who've undergone FGM, so you're talking complete nonsense. Here's two, both from different countries: http://www.tzonline.org/pdf/femalecircumcisionandhivinfectionintanzania.pdf http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113 context=iph_theses  other scientific studies show reductions in HPV infections   (And note, in case it isn't' clear, I find all forms of genital mutilation completely barbaric, regardless of the gender of the victim).    I would like to see both seen as equally bad.  Well some forms of FGM do clearly cause significantly more harm than MGM so it's not exactly fair to say all cases are equally bad. On the other hand, less severe forms of FGM are actually less harmful than MGM. Therefore FGM is both more and less harmful than MGM, it all depend on which particular type we're talking about.   Further study from Kenya shows the same thing:  http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113 context=iph_theses  Probably a good idea to add these to that spreadsheet of essential MRA studies?      That's great, the same should apply to MGM.     I feel the need to point out that female genial mutilation is in no way, shape or form equivalent to male circumcision in a medical or anatomical way.  Utter nonsense. It's true that the most extreme forms of FGM are significantly more harmful than MGM, but on the other hand, many forms of FGM are entirely comparable with MGM as are all the supposed "benefits". In fact women produce far more smegma than men (10 times more) so in many ways it's 10 times more beneficial (assuming butchering kids genitals is your thing).  Here's the recent comments by a senior UK judge noting that MGM can be more harmful than FGM: http://www.inside-man.co.uk/2015/01/15/male-circumcision-can-be-worse-than-fgm-rules-senior-judge/   Yes but FGM is also a "private decision" using your logic above. And many forms of FGM are no more monstrous than MGM (and sometimes less so as noted recently by a UK judge).   Presumably you feel exactly the same way about FGM? (and FYI all the supposed "benefits" of MGM apply equally to many forms of FGM).   They do at least employ Neil Lyndon, so that puts them ahead of 95% of outlets in itself.   Thanks. The only reason I linked to the article was because it was only 90% nonsense and becasue it allows comments (and voting on those comments).            MGM is actually funded by the taxpayer in some parts of the UK and carried out in taxpayer funded facilites.                     In the UK at least (where the video is from) there just isn't a major issue with huge percentages of male officers not being able to do the job.  The stats for the London police fitness tests were recently released. obviously the standards are  low, but only 1.2% of male officers failed and so it shows that they at least somewhat fit for duty. On the other hand, 8% of female officers failed the test, a quite extraordinary difference.   The problem is that by constantly lowering standards for the benefit of women then you're also helping those fat cops.  Furthermore, if these women barely pass the much lower standards when they're new recruits, the just image how useless they're going to be when fat and out of shape. An overweight but quite muscular and tall man is going to be a lot more use in detaining criminals than an equally out of shape female half his size.   It's legal if there's a similar session that bans women.   She was living in Rotherham from 2008, so that's 7 years she's had in the area. Previous to that she was in Manchester, where again grooming scandals were prominent in surrounding towns. It would be interesting to establish exactly when she first spoke out against the blatant and industrial scale of rape, abuse and exploitation of children. The fact she was also working with children also would increase my expectation of her making such a statement.   You don't have to be an MP to speak out against something and as a labour Party member not to mention a citizen of that area she'd be well placed to raise the issue with the previous MP.  I'd say even wanting something done 10 years ago might even be downplaying things. In neighbouring parts of the country these gangs were public knowledge more than 10 years ago, so she could have done anything at any time during more than a whole decade, instead she focuses on irrelevant distractions such as Palestine, even on the day the most damming report was published.         Incredible how people can twist things so much in their own mind that they completely turn reality on its head.   Haven't seen the film but these things need to be all about context.  The bumbling idiot male concept is fine for occasional use and can be extremely funny not to mention harmless.  The real problem arises when the concept becomes almost the norm and /or when it is accompanied by some sort of equally inaccurate genius / superhero mother which just compounds the problem.  If a company has a history of misandry or producing feminist propaganda then go ahead and boycott such a film. On the other hand, if they don't have a reputation for pushing this kind of bullshit then give them a break and focus on more important issues.            At the very least we should not link to Misandrist articles where comments are disabled (or heavily censored).   Yes, but one with more intelligence and insight than almost anyone else one the MSM. It's rare to see someone who actually "gets it" who also has the ability to articulate his message to a large audience in an entertaining and accessible manner. Comedians have a far bigger role in society than simply making us laugh. Comedy can be perhaps the greatest form of activism of all.   He makes a great point about how they're empty threats in many cases and that men should sleep in their own beds. I enjoy his material and think he's an extremely funny guy.  However, he does gloss over the plight of the hundreds of thousands of men trapped in abusive relationships. Perhaps their wives can't dominate them physically in a fair 50-50 fight, but there's plenty of knives in the kitchen, not to mention the huge advantage of the surprise attacks. He also ignores that act that the man is not allowed to fight back or defend himself, so there is real danger for many men out there. Poisoning is also favoured by female abusers, which again has nothing to do with strength.  Of course if physical attacks fail then all that's required is a 30 second call to the police falsely alleging abuse and the man is in all sorts of trouble, and the sofa is a much nicer option than a police cell.  The best point to take from the video is that men should not tolerate minor abuses. Those men agreeing to sleep on the sofa are probably the ones who end up as victims of much more serious domestic abuse in future, so it's good to see people taking a stand and encouraging others to do so.                              I see people have added a bunch of 5 star reviews and the book is now in the top 10 feminist theory books on Amazon.com  Excellent work everyone.       the party in the area is strong  Well it was strong once, but surely a lot weaker now people have seen how terrible the Green councillors in Brighton turned out to be? Their awful track record has caused a huge amount of damage to the Green Party brand there, and thus her reasons for not using it are blatantly obvious (and extremely sensible)      There are now over 60 fake reviews thanks to the campaign by Erin Gibson: https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/erin-gibson-the-genius-orchestrating-spoiler-reviews-of-feminism-the-ugly-truth-on-amazon-com/  Doesn't seem to be the best strategy though because sales are up significantly. I guess people don't like this kind of thing. What do others think abut this tactic? (and about the book too if you've bought it)      The campaign backfired and all the one star reviews generated a lot more interest in the book and thus a lot more sales. While I'm sure a few feminists have bought it, the number is clearly VERY small because none of the reviews mention anything about the content of the book. Therefore most of the sales must be from other people who have been outraged by what the feminists have done and don't like to be told what they can and cannot read.   No it's still there, the category only shows below the book if it's in the top 20 sellers. Sales seem to have slowed a little in the last day or two, hence the category isn't showing at present.   Not nearly as funny as the huge boost they've given to sales. It was in the top 20 feminist theory books for quite a while following the campaign (and various other top 20s too).  The reasoning behind their spam crusade is pretty hilarious too. The following is the quote from Erin who led the campaign:  **"Lets Internet justice the guy who would like to legislate that less efforts be made to help girls into STEM careers."**  Think about that for a second, J4M B are simply suggesting the government doesn't give thousand of ponds of taxpayer money to women simply for going to university while the same money is denied to men. He's not introducing any evil legislation banning women in science, he just wants equality of opportunity, yet the feminists intentionally twist the truth.  The whole campaign is based on a lie, and that of course is typical of feminism. Perhaps an updated version of the book will outline this whole saga as yet another example of just how ugly (and stupid) feminism can be   * 51 on amazon.com:  http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Ugly-Truth-Mike-Buchanan-ebook/dp/B00795BPEO/ * 2 on Amazon.ca:  http://www.amazon.ca/Feminism-Ugly-Truth-Mike-Buchanan-ebook/dp/B00795BPEO * 8 on Amazon.co.uk:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Feminism-Ugly-Truth-Mike-Buchanan-ebook/dp/B00795BPEO            anti-circumcision people  I'm not anti-circumcision. It's a completely appropriate and very useful surgery for a very small number of children and men who have significant issues with their foreskin and for whom other less severe option will not work. It should just be the last resort, as with all other amputations.   If they are going to "educate" on the benefits then they also need to educate on the harms. It's not education if you're only telling people 10% of the story.   Because all the "benefits" are massively less than the huge amount of harm and damage caused by both procedures and it's complete insanity to amputate healthy and important tissue, particularly in that area of the body.   Well how about we educate teenage girls about the "benefits" of fgm? Pretty much all "benefits" of MGM apply to the more moderate forms of FGM. And the "benefits" of removing breast tissue from teenage girls would be greater still.      What the hell is going on?         Half of the MPs from his party are projected to lose their seats at the next election (100 days from now). Lets hops he's one of them.   Just in case people doubt that this is a pussypass, here's the reality of the sentence. In the UK only those with long sentences tend to serve the full term. Your typical prison sentenced to 1 year will only serve around six months in prison!      No, feminist want equal rights for women but not equal responsibilities.

Radical feminists hate to acknowledge that men are human beings, and they really couldn't stand those "men's rights are human rights" posters.   Mike only opposes radical feminism, though he argues that's been the only type of feminism of any significance in the west in the last 40+ years.  Also, bear in mind that there are an awful lot of inaccuracies in this article, a feature of almost all the J4M B coverage in the last fortnight.

Haven't the paris shootings said anything about trying to burn a book?  The organiser actually has "je suis Charlie" as her Twitter image! The lack of lack of self awareness is astonishing.   Exactly,  If they actually left critical reviews that pointed to possible flaws in the arguments or challenged perhaps the very worst source used then that would be great, but they just can't debate with others because they know they'll lose.   A quote from the feminist behind the campaign to leave all the negative reviews:  "Someone gave Mike a toothy blow job and now he hates all women.

Very nice setup! Photo seems a tad bit contrived, like you're trying to show off all your cool hobbies at once. Or maybe you do just juggle producing, browsing, streaming and programming all at once. Either way cool rig man.    I kept holding out hoping for a less fucked up answer... but even I can no longer deny this seems like a mass murder/suicide :(   I've read more than a few comments to the effect of "I hope that scumbag murderer co-pilot rots in hell." Don't underestimate the ability some possess to rapidly condemn strangers to hell based on pure speculation.  Nothing wrong with harmless and educated speculation, but some definitely take it too far once they've made their premature opinion.   All these americans going "In the US we...." are soooo helpful       Cracked front windshield, cockpit depressurizes while the one pilot steps out, co-pilot starts emergency descent but then passes out in cockpit from hypoxia, pilot either can't get back in for whatever reason or does eventually get back in but then also passes out..plane continues unguided emergency descent into mountain     There is still the possibility that even after the locked-out pilot regained emergency access, whatever incapacitated the co-pilot got to him soon after. Think about it... if it was a cracked front windshield causing depressurization leading to hypoxia like experts are now hypothesizing, merely regaining access to the cockpit wouldn't be enough to save the plane. It would likely just lead to more incapacitated people.   You're telling a recently deceased man to rot in hell before you even know he's guilty of anything? Fucked up dude. It still could have been lots of other things. Speculation now is that a cockpit windshield pane could have cracked, causing depressurization and knocking out those in the cockpit.     "Like exactly what I like or you're just a noob lolz"  Seriously though, I love Ducky but objectively, they aren't even well designed keycaps. The designer literally just made a bunch of jagged lines for the "cityscape" with the pen tool in Illustrator then plopped a monument or two in each depending on the city. And everyone still loses their shit over it.     Love it! Definitely reminds me of Unreal Tournament's soundtrack    My other bike is a bike.       Nice web, Mr. crackspider.    Sorry nooby question maybe but whats the thing on top of the Marshal? looks interesting    nice man I figured from the setup you did something techno-y and your soundcloud didn't disappoint.    B W filter and you've got yourself a Techno album cover   dude I looove these!     First thing I thought was PRIDE    Korg Nanokey or MPK Mini's are great for le plane    Lots of classical music is what gets me. Stuff by guys like Ludovico Einaudi or Yiruma. Idk why..  I find the darkest of atrophic, nihilistic berlin techno to be more happy than that shit.     Nice one man    I'm a design student with limited extra cash for designer clothes (go figure) so I tend to wear a lot of plain, cheap dark clothes (plain black v's, drop crotch sweats, black slim fit jeans, black converse/high tops, dark scarves) and cheapish techy outerwear (think Superdry). If I had the money, I'd be decked out in DEMOBAZA, Rick Owens, and a Google Glass tho LOL..    Edmonton, AB! New to this sub but long time lover of dark things so I feel right at home :)    I think it's usually an indirect way of letting everybody know "I would have even more cool stuff if my money didn't all go to books/bars/subway"  At least that's why I would mention that i'm still in school.     Soundcloud is the way to go my friend! Join a group or find a few artists you like and go from there. Most artists have contact/booking info right on their profile. It's really easy when you can see the likes of your favourite artist, just follow the trail to new stuff.     oh Russia...    nice but definitely not original. We actually learned how to use the pen tool recreating vector lotuses just like this at my school.       Woah! I've been using this as an avatar on a random music forum for years now. Cool to finally know the source. I think I originally found it on tumblr.     Great photo! Made me hungry for some reason...    Music producer and graphic designer... Wanna be my best friend?   oh yeah...wow, how about that?    Love it :)    more like hikikomori stations. The second last one made me laugh tho. Some 4channer eating frozen yogurt up in a crawlspace.    I lost it when I saw the calculator!    Honestly probably not a whole lot, but they exist for the same reason luxury vehicles and $5000 suits exist. People like nice things. :)    Oh man those are soo gorgeous.    First thing I saw too    zoomed in on the sticker set thinking it was something super cool..    Also I LOVE the framed Starcraft race emblems!    I want to go PLP too but then i'd be covering up my monitors :( small desk/room problems..  Anyway nice setup, just made some student jealous ;)    Hello, welcome to Gamestop....    I love this! Simple and understated but you genuinely get the feeling that work gets done here. Not just another fap/anime station    source? looks exactly like the kind of cheesy low budget cyberpunk films i've come to love so much.    Are you afraid of it?    didn't teach it any new moves hope that's alright    I can help ya out!     [item] Yeah so I just want to move my stone from my copy of X over to Ruby. Will trade it along with the charizard. Appreciate any help!    Great setup man! love the baman/piderman sticker haha.. nice touch.    Yeah until they realize how much fun it is to play MTG blazed...    Nice! I was impressed and then I saw the pano and now i'm really impressed. I too hope to someday have a big 3 desk setup just like this for mixing, production and gaming respectively. Also I didn't know people stream their studio sessions on Twitch, good to know..    all that beautiful desk space!    Just imagining the possibilities if I had a desk that big..    LOL I kinda got used to the hat for a while, since he could actually pull it off, but then back by season 4 I was like dude... enough with the damn fedora. He's dealing with the worlds most elite rings of thieves and he's dressed like a fucking Le Chateau mannequin.   I find the writing is consistently great and I love Neal and Mozzie, but the way they wrap up EVERY SINGLE episode with Jones and Diana busting in at the last possible second and then the "caught the bad guys" happy ending slow jazz track rolls out. I still don't even hate the endings, just hard not notice the pattern after 5 seasons..    haha fair enough! I think tipping within Canada is different but yeah I could see the ones who go down for the winter on a budget tipping poorly.   I'm an apparently gullible Canadian and i'm genuinely curious as to whether you're serious or not.  	64
 Keep in mind that Tel Aviv is very far from Gaza. Not to mention US flight plans go via europe and into tel aviv, avoiding gaza.   This should be the top comment lol   I for one wouldnt ever want to leave Earth! This place is great. If you dont think so then you need to expand your horizon and travel!   True. But also give a gift receipt. So they can just change it.   This is ideally what this tip is centered around. Find if its ur ideal path.   We need a new toilet because i've spent way too much money on trying to figure out how to fix it and have come up with failed attempts.   So... I need a new toilet! Less than $300 and preferably one that wont have any problems with clogging and is elongated.  Terrylove.com seems to recommend toto alot. Do you recommend that or something else?  We have an American standard that has been great for years but lately it just takes multiple flushes for everything to go through. We have used an auger, used pumic stone to remove any scale, and nothing that helped. So instead of wasting anymore money I think I must buy a new one.      So i tried all of the suggestions and it does seem to help. Lol stupid eye contact! Why the heck is this an issue!    Is there any medication that helps the body from getting anxious during eye contact?  I can make eye contact its just that I have to hold my breath and I can barely concentrate on what they are saying.   Yupp. Its called being burned out! Take a break! Though more importantly, you're not doing this from your heart so why even bother? I say that because you're ultimately going to get bitter whereas volunteering should produce some form of joy.       Theres a whole facebook page devoted to it   It used to be. In philadelphia area there are still many cricket grounds.   I say it was bombed in the indian ocean and they're covering it up. But literally between India and China. Why? There was an article about a lady who saw debris off a plane in the ocean from her flight. She reported it but the search was never concluded in the area she mentioned afaik.  Now im going to speculate and say that this plane was headed for one of the stans via india. And india wasnt going to let some lunatic fly and danger its people so they bombed it or maybe malaysia bombed it. Now if india did bomb it and that information was disclosed than china and india would be at war. Something no nation wants.    7.1.1 im on iphone 5. My coworker, my phone and my moms phone are affected. But my cousins iphone 5s isnt. So maybe its targetting specific phones? Idk.   Same here   Well i was talking to my coworker today who mentioned that the latest patch makes the phone stop using non-oem wires.   Which is the issue i am having now. Only oem wires r workig   Why does the iPhone recognize the non-oem cable and whats the difference?  Im referring to the iphone 5 cable but obviously its a general issue.  Why cant we replicate the cable to the t?   I'm thinking about stopping my 401k contributions which are roughly $400/month. I was trying to meet my companies match but I think it doesnt make sense when you have loans with 7% interest rate. hmm.. edit: lol and ive been also trying to save up for wedding. and only saved up 5kish aiming for 12k at least.   How much were you paying monthly?   Look into Loan Forgiveness programs. Such as the military. Do national guard and get some of that removed.   If you dont mind me asking but what is your financial situation? Salary, etc. Because 3 years is ambitious for 40k.   So apparently I have 49k in student loans. Its been four years since i have graduated and the main reason I guess I wasnt as aggressive in paying off my student loans was because I bought a car (audi a4) which just took all of the money. Thankfully I paid it off so now I should have more money to pay off student loans but it seems like it will take forever.  So how long did it take you guys   gals to pay off your student loans and how did you save up for a house, etc?   Apparently goat. Im from india.   I like the quote on Ruth Graham, wife of Billy Graham, grave. "End of Construction. Thank you for your patience"   I hear ya man. I feel the same way. And the older u get its harder to make new friends, esp christian ones.    Check out glassdoor.com. Read reviews.  See how management interacts with the team. I went to one interview and the manager was talking down to his employees. Thankfully he didnt act like too much of a jerk off when he interviewed me but nonetheless if he cant act appropriatly with all of his employees then i cant work with him.    Lol i can counter this and say it can also be good to go independent of ur parents and enjoy life.    Lol   Piano is easy to pick up vs guitar, etc. as you either press a key or combination of keys. Plus you can play any instrument you want using it.     I've had the same issue. The best thing to do is put pill in the back of your tongue.  Stick tongue on the roof of your mouth. Swallow. And wallah you have solved your prescribed pill swallowing problem.   I believe its called music theory.   http://www.musictheory.net/lessons  I cant read music myself, dont have an extreme or urge or need for it so no real desire. But my advice would be to take your time, pace yourself, and practice.  Check out youtube clips too.   I completed the one year bible few years ago and i so agree with u on this. The whole trying to finish the bible for the sake of it does not help u at all besides saying u "finished" reading the bible.  If u do however do it that way than at least dont restrict urself from reading it in one year. Lol it made me very depressive because it took me much longer than i thought it would take and it just made me feel dumb.   That said, i have read the bible multiple times. And i would say that the best way to read it is understand how the bible is categorized, and see which category interests you. And then pace yourself through it.   I absolutely love the red letters for what Jesus spoke.  You know what would be cool? How about what God spoke in Blue?  i dont like references. It just gets in the way of reading the passage. And i absolutely cannot stand that there are no gaps at the left and right of the pages. I understand bibles need to be minituarized but there should still be some space.  Make paragraphs. Alot of time ur just reading a constant group of text. It would be great if paragraphs could be added. I see it as a positive thing for grouping content, supporting contextual reading, and lastly offering people the optiong to pace through the text.   whow we can ask these kinds of questions. i so need this question answered.   My mom has a pinched nerve and i believe a bulge near her l4 l5. Her recent doctor recommended that she get only a sitting job. I dont think her current employer has a sitting job and she is 58 and has constantly complained about her lower back. She is currently in short term disability and does have long term disability insurance. Whats the procedure for getting long term disability? And also does she qualify? Im worried that if we go to the companys HR and ask then they might lay her off eventually if they see that she has this problem.      Not really. The move for punching and kicking is trivial.  For example, punching requires an arm extended and feet in proper alignment. I know the powers comes from the hip but I guess what I'm asking is that maybe my hip doesnt have that much power. So how do you increase it.   How do you increase the force of your attack?  I feel alot of my moves are just moves without any packed strength / force behind them.   Save money and but Crest Whitestrips.   Everything else is going to be a waste of money.   Im surprised this doesnt have more upvotes. This is the only logical comment.   Andys Hot Fries   Sort of, I offer Slingbox hosting services out of Philadelphia. What my subscribers get is a full Fios TV experience for a monthly fee. So yes, technically.   What kind of issues do couples that are "yoked" together face?  I can understand the reason bible is against unyoked couples. But i also know that all marriages tend to have issues. So what kind of issues do couples who are both believers face?   Lol  	45
 "I'm gay."   "Eh, I got work in the morning. Catch ya later!"   Huh?   Ron Paul suggests using DDT to stop the spread of Ebola (like malaria), and is quite wrong about that being an effective treatment. From the article:  "'As far as I can make out he's wrong about everything,' Fordham University's Dr. Alexander van Tulleken told Foreign Policy. No licensed or approved treatment for Ebola exists. Yes, the experimental ZMapp drug seems to have effectively treated two American aid workers transported from Liberia to Atlanta, and more such untested drugs are in development. But those patients have also benefited from expert care, van Tulleken notes, so the jury's still out. 'The only treatments for Ebola really are supportive care' such as ventilation to support lung failure, dialysis for kidney failure or fluid replacement via IV.  As for Paul's claims about DDT and organic phosphates, neither is an actual treatment nor control mechanism for Ebola. While some in the public health community view DDT as a legitimate solution for slowing malaria, there's no science that says it would cure or control Ebola. 'What Ron Paul has done is confuse Ebola with malaria,' van Tulleken says. **'If you hose DDT around, you get rid of the mosquitoes, and maybe get rid of malaria. But Ebola is transmitted by bodily fluid. He's really fucked it up.'**      /r/botsrights                  Isn't voting mandatory in Australia?   God this is gonna be a question on ELI5 in like 6 months, the way things are going.   [link to study](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2335.html)            Yes, indubitably!                  He really could've just given a straightforward "I was happy to see so many great law enforcement folks there last week, whether they were on duty or not." It was a little too bullshitty of an answer. Gotta really tread that line carefully between "bullshit" and "steaming bullshit."                                                                                         	53
 I've been searching for months for meets in the western Massachusetts area. The only one that's around me is my local elks club and it's really all old dudes in corvettes.    He can't even    Mines been sitting in our backyard for about 4 or 5 years now. My dad and I plan on making it into a straight axle drag car.   Holy shit another redditor with an F85!   Good God that thing is gorgeous, you should cross post it back into r/Porsche    My dads friend has a 1985 Countach. I don't think I have ever ridden in a car that was so amazing and so shitty at the same time. It looked and felt like it was built in a shed. But it was just such a surreal experience being able to ride in one of my hero's.    Or as Regular Cars would say FIX IT AGAIN TYRONE!   I spy with my little eye a turbo Buick :D   I can't remember what they're called, but the rims that are on the 993 GT2, they're a 3 piece rim that's based on the cup rims.   How can we see if our eyes aren't real   Or did a line, because you know, 80s   My dads best friend has a Countach that had a throw out bearing that went bad, and he asked us to fix it. We have to pull the engine out to get to it. Literally no idea how this is going to go  Edit: Once the time comes, I'll post a whole album of us doing it.   It just looks so goofy that it works    As much as I hate low riders, I would definitely drive this one. It's not every day you see a Tercel like that.   This is Falken stupid, these Falken puns need to stop   The submarine factory called, they want their porthole back.   Wilwood big brake kits will do wonders.   I have a story as well! Last year, my cousin and I went to a swap meet and I brought literally no money. My dad was in Hong Kong at the time, so he told me to use some of his money if I found some Oldsmobile parts. Well, we head to the car corral, and there's this god awful 1980 Cutlass that's brougham 2 tone baby blue. The seller was asking $3,000 for it, so I told me dad. He said to go get some money and my cousin and I can go halfsies on it so we can flip it. Well, that's what we did. We ended up getting the car for only $1,300. I tell my dad we had bought it and he was pretty proud because we managed to get the price that low. We brought it back to my house and my mom was PISSED. We already have 8 cars at my house and when she saw this Cutlass roll through I thought she was going to kill me. My dad on the other hand, proud as fuck.    Ballaban is way worse IMO   Good God... What the hell is going on the with the front bumper cover    Ok I'll have to try that, but no of my other games are crashing like GTR2 though, even the other simbin games.   I tried configuring it through steam and through the directory for the video settings, but I took a break so I'll try audio next time I get the chance.   Tried all of that, and nothing. I asking tried running it in compatibility mode, uninstalling and reinstalling and still nothing.   http://s1374.photobucket.com/user/train_subject1541/library/Mobile%20Uploads   I can see why, there is no such thing as a cheap Porsche. The price of parts isn't too terrible, the thing that gets you is how often you need to do maintenance and all the special tools that you need. It's my autocross car so it only sees wear and tear for about 5 minutes each month. The Cutlass isn't bad at all, just because it has the 3.1 and not the 3.4. I bought mine for a grand and pretty much did a mini restoration. I bought 2 parts cars, got what I needed, and sold what I didn't need. I'm currently into the car for only about 1,200.  Edit: Words      Damn that sucks, I absolutely love it though. I can't tell you the last time I've ever seen one driving on the road. I basically restored it my freshman and sophomore year. When I first purchased it, it was red, broken into, rotted, smelt bad, and had the most disgusting interior ever. Bought 2 parts cars, swapped out all parts I needed, then sold the unwanted parts. It basically looks brand new now inside and out, and I'm only into it for a grand.   Picked up a girl after school one day. It was pouring out, and I mean pouring out. I love my Cutlass to death, but since it's a convertible, the thing leaks more than Chernobyl leaks radiation. We're driving home, and water is literally going everywhere and it's not stopping anytime soon. Of course my side doesn't leak that much, and it's the passenger side that's terrible. Needless to say, she wasn't a fan of my Cutlass, and I took that shit right in the feels. Edit: Completely forgot to mention I spun a bearing in it while in the school parking lot. Made the most horrifying sound ever.   I'll trade you the 550 for my 917/30   Did someone say new wheel bearings every year?   Gotta go fast   I have a really soft spot for the Javelin, ever since I saw the old Trans Am road race cars, I've been obsessed with them since.  http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FoXyvaPSnVk/S_rkktXroxI/AAAAAAAC4ss/8MaD1Te2Jb0/s800/1971-AMC-Javelin-Penske-Transam-001.jpg  	32
 truth hurts            And a BIG THANKS to u/chinstrap for another great week of Check-ins!  Who's doing Next week's Check-in?               I'm not anti-second amendment, I'm anti-perversion of 2d amendment to defend individual gun violence as some sort of God-given right of man.  It' ain't.    You're not getting my point. I never said you were wrong, I said you were too biased.  That's like saying "I didn't call you an asshole, I said you were an anus."  The ignorance is in this weird and phony historic-isms to manufacture neutral meaning for a racist symbol.  It's like arguing the swastika is just a benign Sanskrit good luck symbol.     All "libruls" are tired of racism and gun violence in the name of distortions of claimed "states rights" and 2d amendment perversions.   Um. you're re-framing racism.  They LOST that war.   In 2001 I celebrated 15 years of continuous sobriety, but I felt as you are expressing in this post.  I felt like I had accomplished alot; I was sponsoring; professionally, I was doing the best work of my life and not enjoying the financial rewards that I felt like I was due; I was frequently enraged; and, finally, I relapsed.  The relapse miraculously ended in 2009. My [story is fairly well documented in the Saturday Share](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) so I won't repeat it here.  My lesson: give TIME, TIME.  They like to say in AA: "don't leave the room before the miracle occurs."  This advice in my experience is totally true.  It's harder, much harder to come back and dig out of the damage--but, miracles of change in the human experience happen around us all the time, and if we're patient, within, too.   Like?               I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I am SOBER in Cleveland after a tough but constructive week.         Go for it--many of the SD sobernauts are in the rooms.  We're waiting on you!   Honestly, I don't get what Ohio voters are understanding about this pro-biz court.  The Ohio supremes are all about the 1%.   Are you working a recovery program?  Seeing a counselor?  Those things were invaluable to me when I was newly sober.  The AA 12 Steps for instance offer a systematic approach to identifying issues, and clearing away the wreckage of the past.   Welcome /u/dan_doomhammer to /r/stopdrinking -- so have you [tried the Baby Steps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  Its a post that lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Lots of SDers use aspects of it or so I'm told, to start stopping.   Good luck to you.   Welcome /u/omarhajar84 to r/stopdrinking.  So at [this link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out exactly the next steps I took to start stopping.  I hope something there resonates for you.  To talk to the SD community in real time [try the chat at this link.](http://is.gd/rsdirc)  Good luck.   no problen         . . . mas guacamole, por favor.   That is exactly right.  Purely pandering.   This is the number one reason I will never vote for Jeb Bush.  He used the power of his office to enact a private law to intervene and prolong the "life" of this dead woman against her husband's wishes.                    Why don't your join us on r/stopdrinking?  We have a great sober community there and you also qualify for r/dinos--I'll send you an invite.         This is probably going to shock my friends on SD, but yes I believe that there are some people for whom controlled drinking works; but, I'm not that person.  Not only, am I not that person, I can't even get in the head of someone who would think controlled drinking is a good thing, although at one time I thought it would be nice to drink just fine wines--when I was in my pre-relapse home cooking phase and watching Food TV in the day when they had real cooking shows with teaching chefs.  The reality is that after 15 continuous years of sobriety my "controlled drinking" spun wildly out of control after about 2 weeks and then it took me 7 long hellish years to get back to recovery.  I have fully answered the question for myself--why would I want to?  I only ever wanted that elusive sensation that I got from drinking (or so I told myself) and after I relapsed, I discovered to my satisfaction that all I really ever could do was drink myself into stupor.                   The expression: Vanity Fair is a literary allusion to Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress--where the pilgrims after true spirituality are drawn to the material and absurd--debasing their quest for true connection.   I'm trying to remember ever meeting an alcoholic who LIKED being told what to do.  I'm sure there are one or two, but they're rare.  I love giving advice and I hate taking it; but I guarantee you that when I finally right-sized my ego, the good advice that I took worked out well for me.    I love AA and AA meetings, but over time--not drinking, actively listening, I learned who I should listen to, and who I could discount.  Believe it or not, after awhile, people I discounted started to make a bit more sense.  Funny, that.      Jack London was a genius writer, and the story is autobiographical;  the Traffic track is amazing.

You are more than welcome.  You might also think about doing the morning check-in--usually one of the top posts on the sub.  The morning check-in adapted the first idea from the Baby Steps into a daily ritual.   Um, where are the dumpsters going to be kept?   Good for you!   Yeah, that sounds pretty dreadful. So did I share the [Baby Steps post with you in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) These things worked for me, and I too was in a pretty dark place.  Good luck turning this around.  P.S. Rock Bottom is only a metaphor, we can always dig deeper.   Welcome /u/throwaway78913080 to r/stopdrinking--I like to offer the [link to the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out some positive next steps to start stopping drinking.  These are the things I did and which I can honestly say still keep me sober today.  Good luck to you.      I don't think that's the issue, here.  The issue is the promises confidently made by this Governor who wants to be president and who got his cred by "disciplining public labor unions" as a pro-growth and pro-business political paradigm.  Typically, the rhetoric doesn't match the reality.                     Respectfully, this is ridiculous; CLIMATE change and the POPE's encyclical is explicitly about current US Politics and if you don't know this fact you aren't reading US Politics.  Once again, this is why it's on the Washington Post's POLITICS and OPINION pages. I could have take a dozen other articles about current GOP presidential campaigns dealing "explicitly" with this encyclical.                                     I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Thursday SOBER in solidarity with the SD sobernauts all around the world.   Thank you, Mouse, I've had a really stressful run of tough days--nothing to compare to yours--nonetheless, this was a great reminder.  TODAY is the new day.  Let's do it SOBER.     I agree.  Also don't be put off by beginner meetings and meetings where there are a lot of DUIs.  Lots of us came through the door on paper.  When I came back from a long multi-year relapse I was on paper for 2 years, I was no less sincere about recovery.   Hey [I'm just an old chunk of coal](https://youtu.be/uwxYbb5uils?t=5s) but I'm gonna be a diamond some day  I'm gonna grow and glow till I'm so blue pure perfect  I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face  I'm gonna kneel and pray every day last I should become vain along the way  I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord but I'm gonna be a diamond some day   I'm gonna learn the best way to walk gonna search and find a better way to talk  I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough edged self till I get rid of every single flaw  I'm gonna be the world's best friend gonna go round shaking everybody's hand  I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age I'm gonna be a diamond some day    Welcome /u/Siryn to r/stopdrinking.  I frequently share the [Baby Steps post with our subreddit newcomers](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is at that link and which lays out exactly how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I hope that there is something there that makes some sense for you as possible "next" easy things to do to start stopping.  Good luck to you.   I'm glad you chose to vent, here.  This place is a good outlet with tons of support and lots of participants with decades of sobriety.       Welcome /u/thecuriouswine--it sounds like you have a solid plan.  Best of luck.   Why not come clean with your wife that you are stopping drinking?    Try doing this for yourself: I am not drinking TODAY, help me keep this commitment, because I can't do it alone.   Hail new centurion!   It totally got easier for me at a 100 days; in fact, it sounds to me like you are on the verge of a significant breakthrough if you aren't already there.  Keep doing what you're doing.            They almost always are.   This is a brilliant bit of advice; look for healthy new lifestyle reinforcers.  For me, personally, AA meetings and counseling helped enormously in the early days.      I am sure you're right.  Predators are predatory, they pick and choose victims opportunistically.  Remember during a significant part of that 15 years he was in prison for other crimes.      Does anyone else think this cafe design looks like a fancy shed?      When I was newly sober I was sitting in an AA meeting when someone said: It wasn't the 5th drink that sent me over the edge, it was the first.  Someone else interjected, It wasn't the caboose that killed him, it was the engine.     My late mother, God bless her--was NOT a good cook.  But her pineapple upside down cake made in a cast iron skillet was food of the Gods.  Yum, must make soon.     You really have come a long way; I am so proud of you.  Your presence on the sub has added real grace.   In prison, the Sally port was the secure and controlled entry point for pick ups and deliveries.  It's where inmates would report to before transit to or from off-institution appointments.   This.    And always remember, your actions will speak louder than your words.   Welcome /u/_CalmBlueOcean_ to r/stopdrinking.  Yeah, that's pretty awesome that you had your "psychic shift" on the traditional day that Bill W. and Dr. Bob "founded AA."  So at this [link is the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) post which is a description of the things I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope something there is helpful to you as you move forward.  Good luck and I'll see you around.   Cleveland-Akron.           Goodbye asshole.      Yay, Shalee!   Best wishes to you /u/namastesober!      You know what this means, right?  Blumenthal HURT the cause of his GOP interrogators.         I think this poor mortified woman made a spectacular mistake, but the press really gave her the Scarlet Letter.  I think they went too far.   But I agree, she's not watching my children.   A *down* escalator.             I've gotta remember I am just not someone who can drink. I really really just can't.  I would turn this around, it's not about what I "can't do" (being an alcoholic a "can't do" is usually just a challenge "to do something I shouldn't); nope, what I CHOOSE to do is not drink TODAY, only.  I don't 'quit drinking" instead I make a renewable daily decision not to drink TODAY, only, no matter what happens good or bad.     Congrats on 6 months!   Hail new Centurion!  Keep doing what you're doing!   Congratulations, /u/vinylsquares!  I'm really happy for your progress.      He's already indicated that it should be Oprah.      VERY GOOD POINT, but here's the thing--in 2016 we are on the precipice of electing the next person to nominate judges and Justices to life positions on the federal court.           As Jon Stewart said the speech was "the most beautifully ridiculous jibber-jabber ever to pour from the mouth of a batshit billionaire.                                          Last night, my alcoholic brain started convincing me to drink and that death is a good reason to drink. That is when I knew I was in the danger zone today.  The alkie brain is a big fucking liar.    I'd cling to AA meetings and my support network.  I'd jump on the [SD Chat](http://is.gd/rsdirc) and get real time support.     Many of us are "double-winners:" alcoholic and al anon-qualified.  Don't hesitate to seek support for dealing with your Mom at /r/alanon as well.   At some point in my drinking career my only "friends" were guys who drank like me.  They reinforced my drinking.  When I made the decision to stop drinking I had to extinguish the old reinforcers.  I needed new friends, new venues, and new activities--that's what I got in recovery.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; here's to basements free of storm water and zombies.     Sweet!      Bummer on the root ball.  So what's the frame size on the Gitane?

  or better dexterit  Might try that. I de-set the kit a few weeks back, it's cased up and waiting to be set up in my new house (will be re-skinning as well). The Zil-Bel I might return to putting it on top of the china (felt, china, felt, zil-bel, felt, wingnut).   I have a pearl icon rack in the picture, but too many things to rack everything (it already carried the four high toms and most of the cymbals).   You're correct on the china - I only use the tip on the right hand one. I could invert the left one, not sure if there is much advantage though.     The bass drum of my Roland TD-8 has become quite unresponsive sometimes - any tips for making it work properly again?   Remember flams are ultimately used for accent. Little things like "bass-bass-flam" work well inside longer fills. Or starting fills around the tom's on a flam (or ending on one).    Total agreement here. I haven't gigged in a few years - so the kit has grown. If I got a band back together (which I intend to do now I'm building myself a music room in my basement) then I'll probably go down to 3 toms, 2-3 crashes, ride, hi-hats, snare and bass drum.   Would like to get a picollo snare for the left of the hi-hat   A bit of it is perspective. The four crashes are almost touching each other. Their height is eye level, which suits me well. Perhaps this picture will make it a bit easier to see: http://i.imgur.com/mll48ib.jpg The smallest roto-tom is awfully positioned, but it was either keep it there and balance the other two, or just remove it - it doesn't get in the way even if it is almost untouchable. Agree with your point though.  12" drum is perspective again, you could almost put a ruler along the top three toms and it would lie on all the skins.   China's are actually the normal way round - but many people prefer them upside down. I don't - since I often play them with the stick tip in the middle.  Floor tom's are touching, but there is a cramping issue which is why the 16" tom is a little too far to the right for comfort.   Appreciate the thoughts though.   Hehe, I bought some Quick beats a few years back and sold them within a week. I do like my New Beats - had them for about 10 years.   Perhaps buy better sticks. Otherwise watch the technique. Swipe the cymbals rather than "slapping" them. Let your fingers and wrists bounce your strikes off your skins (and don't angle the drums to sharply). Go for accuracy on rimshots not power (i.e. to hit rim and skin perfectly together)   It's probably the cymbals I'm most careful with. I used to invert the 14" China, but changed back a while ago.    When I've played small venues I've been loud enough to hear over the band un miced If I've played a bigger venue they've tended to mic the drumkit out of course.  You can play loud without breaking sticks. Hitting cymbals in a swiping motion, keeping hands and wrists supple on skins, and going for accuracy rather than power in your rim shots.  If you hit the kit too loud you'll just dull the sound of the drums/cymbals.   Good technique, particularly on cymbals, and you can get a big noise without damaging your sticks. Saves money too.   Yeah I like to have it so I can use the tip or shaft of my sticks. I've only broken one stick in 15 years of playing.    The 16" Tom is in an awkward position. If I'm running round the tom's or playing I tend to turn towards it, but I use the 14" floor tom much more.  The small roto-tom is the only thing there almost impossible to hit due to the hi-hat rod. I keep it on the kit to help balance the bigger roto-tom on the bar that holds all 3. I need to find a solution to that.   Reuploaded and deleted old one since photobucket is rubbish and won't allow full size image links - used IMGR      Steep angles tend to result in dented heads and worse resonance         Here is a clip of the beat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZX72C2MTRE  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v108/londonprophet/Dislocatedday.jpg is my best guess   I would only ever recommend Roland V-drums (having played both Roland and Yamaha).  They also need to be a "high enough" series of V-drums to have the mesh pads on all drums.   Don't play too loud and have fun   K's are darker, A's are brighter, but every cymbal (even identical make and models) can be slightly different.  I prefer the A Customs, but I used  mix of A, K, and A Custom (I think I prefer the A's the most).            Science communication   Moreover. Teachers are underpaid. Overworked. And the government in the UK is constantly berating them accusing them of not working hard enough. They are regarded as mid-level jobs. Why should top students be teachers as we set the system up now?   I quit teaching after 3 years (I came in through Teach First, the UK's version of Teach For America). I don't regret doing it, but my entire life became about teaching.   Now i get paid more and have more time to do other things i enjoy   I'm not sure about responsible people, but some people who aren't PETA            Was surprised this hadn't been posted already                  Fair argument         Shouldn't doesn't imply moral reasoning.

The stats are not remotely related. It's like saying that First year TFA turnover is close to 0%.  Find the stats for retention of teachers after their first two years in a single school and you'll probably find it remarkably similar to the TFA. Lots of teachers want to move on after 2-3 years to find another school with new challenges.    Certainly graduating from an Ivy league doesn't automatically make you a better/worse teacher - but these are top graduates who have got into top schools and these kids can benefit from that.   First year TFA teachers are ill equipped to go into the classroom, nonetheless studies in Louisana showed TFA'ers were "statistically significantly more effective": http://www.nctq.org/docs/TFA_Louisiana_study.PDF There are various other state studies as well.   Now you point out cost, which is an issue - especially when long standing teachers experience is sorely needed (and as noted, TFA'ers often have lower retention). I do think some schools do pick TFA'ers as a cheap option.         Can you evidence the idea that 86% (100-14) of new traditional teachers stay at their initial placement for more than 2 years. That stat wasn't in the link you provided.   Also, there is higher turnover at high poverty schools where TFA'ers go.   Why wouldn't we want the most able students to go into teaching?

 Could be a failure of the imagination...   IN THE GAMEEEEEEEEEE   Dragon Knight's stun is the worst scaling stun *in the game*!  Dragon Knight's stun is the worst scaling stun.  I know many of you would prefer the first - but consider why.  The phrase "in the game" is constantly used to express emphasis, often as part of a hyperbolic rant about how much a hero sucks or is OP.  What's really meant is something more like  Dragon Knight's stun is by far the worst scaling stun; it fucking sucks.  Consider this: all of the mechanics we will ever discuss are, in fact, in the game.  That phrase adds no coherent meaning to the sentence, and is only included for emphasis or dramatic effect.  This might be fine if it were a rare occurrence, as it once was - an occasional cry of emphasis from casters.  But now, the community seems to have such a limited collective vocabulary (or is so intensely hypnotized by fluff casting diction) that there is hardly a thread that doesn't invoke this idiom at least once.  And so, from just outside, the community begins to look like a collection of underage hyperbolic cunts with no awareness of the vast and diverse array of adjectives just begging for use as emphasis in some inane diatribe about Lina's shit attack animation or whatever.  So uh...please use real words instead.   Cheers.   What is the dose?      I don't see why not.  Composting works better...      So far, none of this conversation has been quantitative except my $.35 btc.  In economics, supply and demand are often represented as functions of price.  This is where the common visual of supply and demand curves intersecting comes from.  Supply at various prices and demand at various prices are plotted in one coordinate plane; the intersection point is a theoretical equilibrium, a price at which the two should be equal.  Perhaps in the future, bitcoin will be supremely useful, but only a tiny amount of coin will be needed to make complete use of it.  In this future, one would expect an equilibrium price to be quite low relative to a future in which bitcoin's utility was as a direct currency instrument.  You could call this "low-demand," though I think it would be better to think of it in terms of price.  People might buy it all the time!  But it would not cost much.   If you believe that an idea about supply and demand contradicts the possibility of bitcoin being profoundly useful for everyday transactions and also dirt cheap, then we probably disagree about supply and demand.  I'm quite comfortable with that. :P   Did you read the OP?  It seems like a reasonable assessment to me:  The explanations is and has always been simple. The REAL price of bitcoin was never so high yet, and it's is better for everyone to have a properly priced asset and not an over inflated bubble. Maybe current correct price is under $200, like it or not, but that alone doesn't remove the huge potential for bitcoin.   Such profundity!   Bitcoin is entirely unique by being the first time anyone has been able to directly invest in a technology.  Perhaps that is true, and means something, but I don't see how it has any relevance to what I've said above.  What is Bitcoin worth if it makes the internet 10x valuable as it is currently?  Well, nobody knows.  I think that's one of the main points of the OP.  Perhaps the next phase of bitcoin is to become so profoundly useful for everyday transactions that it transforms life as we know it and we reach a singularity hive mind consciousness that explodes the fucking galaxy into a cosmic mindfuck jism explosion of funkadelic sex magic, while also being worth about 35 cents apiece.  In that case, it would have been a pretty shit investment despite all its utility, as in this scenario the utility of bitcoin for any particular person is independent of the magnitude of that person's bitcoin holdings.   Very interesting...  The trolls worked in teams of three. The first one would leave a complaint about some problem or other, or simply post a link, then the other two would wade in, using links to articles on Kremlin-friendly websites and comedy photographs lampooning western or Ukrainian leaders with abusive captions.  Marat shared six of his technical task sheets from his time in the office with the Guardian. Each of them has a news line, some information about it, and a conclusion that the commenters should reach. One is on Putin offering his condolences to President Franois Hollande after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris.  Vladimir Putin contacted the French leader immediately, despite the bad relations between Russia and the west, reads the section explaining the conclusion the troll posts should reach. The Russian leader has always stood against aggression and terrorism in general. Thanks to the presidents initiatives, the number of terrorist acts inside Russia has decreased dramatically.   This seems like a good argument to change OP's view.  College education can be made free without inviting everybody to enroll, or stay in school if they're already there.  We could make admissions requirements higher and raise the minimum GPA to avoid expulsion.    Supply of Bitcoin is decreasing while users are increasing. Who's selling? Who really knows? Probably the miners paying for their bills. Next year when the supply of BTC halves that may be just enough to get the swing going back to Bull.  What are you talking about?  By your language, it sounds like you're equating creation rate with supply.  Is that right?   The two categories are not mutually exclusive.   The supply is decreasing?  Are you sure you're not thinking of the rate of bitcoin creation?  edit:  I also took an econ course or two in school.  It is not so simple and straightforward to apply elegant quantitative laws of supply and demand to real life.  In that context, you do not actually know the supply, demand, or even the price of Bitcoin with precision.  Economics, like science, is math.  If you can say it in English without referring to a chart full of numbers, it's not economics.  It's not science.   That is not a good summary of the findings at all.  Also, the parts you quoted above are actually part of their introduction; the authors are referencing prior work in those sentences, not the work being reported.  The relevant bit is actually  Results demonstrated a duration- and dose-dependent reduction in cell viability with each cannabinoid and suggested that THC-BDS was more efficacious than THC-P, whereas, conversely, CBD-P was more efficacious than CBD-BDS.  and then   Similarly, pretreating cells with THC-P and CBD-P together for 4 hours before irradiation increased their radiosensitivity when compared with pretreating with either of the cannabinoids individually. The increase in radiosensitivity was associated with an increase in markers of autophagy and apoptosis.   Yes, those are all fair points.  I find this interesting, in particular:  5-10 years down the line Bitcoin could be a million a coin. Or it could be zero. Who knows.  My understanding is that there are many commodities that offer a much more predictable return.  There are also many other potential tech investments with an uncertain fate.  If your goal is profit, investing heavily in Bitcoin makes little sense.  Bitcoin is not special in this regard; it is a risky investment that has its place, but should not be expected to pay off huge just because it possibly could.   That is an interesting point of view, but it is irrelevant to this particular conversation.  Vlarocca was talking about investments, and I am curious about Vlarocca's reasons for investing as they seem to believe there is some compelling reason to expect a high return.    hey found that cannabis in combination with chemo yields better results (generally) compared to chemo alone.  You misrepresented the study as only investigating the combination, and were arrogant about it.  You were wrong; the study specifically tested both the combination and cannabinoids alone.  Doesn't that bother you?   The fact that it did is compelling reason enough to believe it will again.  If this were true, then all commodities whose price ever rose substantially and then fell should exhibit infinite cycles of substantial growth and decay.  But they don't... :/   You seem to have misread the study's abstract, which contradicts what you've said.  According to the scientists themselves, this study tested whether specific cannabinoids inhibited glioma growth with and without radiotherapy, and found them to be effective in both conditions.   Cannabinoids have been shown to specifically inhibit glioma growth as well as neutralize oncogenic processes such as angiogenesis. In an attempt to improve treatment outcome, we have investigated the effect of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) both alone and in combination with radiotherapy in a number of glioma cell lines (T98G, U87MG, and GL261). Cannabinoids were used in two forms, pure (P) and as a botanical drug substance (BDS). Results demonstrated a duration- and dose-dependent reduction in cell viability with each cannabinoid and suggested that THC-BDS was more efficacious than THC-P, whereas, conversely, CBD-P was more efficacious than CBD-BDS.  Then:  Similarly, pretreating cells with THC-P and CBD-P together for 4 hours before irradiation increased their radiosensitivity when compared with pretreating with either of the cannabinoids individually.   **You should do your homework before pontificating on the errors of others.  You were wrong; they were not.**   I have lost money on my bitcoin investments. I will continue to buy faithfully. Bitcoin will go through strange changes, still I am excited for it's future and believe it will succeed.  What do you mean by success, though?  If you keep buying because you believe that you will profit in the end when BTC inevitably rises in price, then you are not a wise investor; there is no compelling reason to believe it will rise substantially again.  It seems to me that OP's most important insight above is that success for bitcoin does not necessarily require a high USD value.   You should not combine amphetamine (Adderall) with an MAOI because of the potential for physical harm from the interaction.  Combining low dose amphetamine with LSD should be fine if you're used to the dose.   This image is being reposted a lot lately.  I don't see how it contributes to discussion here.   That is not necessarily true.  The law you quoted was not made to be interpreted on Reddit, nor to be left open to interpretation as you have just done.  It is not as simple as it might seem.  There are many ways in which the actions Edward Snowden took in releasing classified information may not satisfy the conditions in the law you quoted.  Perhaps because he gave the information to American journalists, it cannot be said that he furnished it to an enemy.  Perhaps it cannot be shown that the information released has any tendency to weaken the power of the United States to attack or resist its enemies.  Perhaps there is important context not in the words quoted (hint: there always is) that could disqualify his actions from applying.  Etc.    That hardly seems like a fair assessment; he's been quite consistent, honest, and straightforward so far as a senator, and has often voted against party lines.   All people's fingerprints are unique; no two people have exactly the same fingerprints. However, Leo's fingerprints contain the Mona Lisa on them. Therefore, Leo's fingerprints are ______.  What is the most correct English way to describe how Leo's fingerprints go "above and beyond" the normal level of uniqueness associated with human fingerprints.  Such a person's fingerprints are no more or less unique than any other fingerprint - all fingerprints are unique in exactly the same was as each other.  They are either unique, or they are not.  There is no problem.  It is like the number 5.  I either have 5 digits on each hand, or I don't.  It doesn't matter how incredible the fingers on my left hand are; they are either 5 in number, or they are not.  What you are probably looking for is a word describe how peculiar, unusual, distinctive, or remarkable this person's fingerprints are.  "Very unique" does not accomplish any of these ends.  The same problem affects phrases like "very pregnant." English does not have an easy way to compare someone who is 3 months pregnant vs. 6 months pregnant vs. 8 months pregnant.  Sure it does!  "She is pregnant."   "Oh really?  How pregnant?"  "6 months pregnant!"   I have noticed the GMO downvote/flame phenomenon and found it surprising.  If I had a large stake in a product whose adoption depended, in part, on the views of educated 20-35 year olds, I would devote some resources to influencing views on Reddit.  It makes sense that companies like Monsanto would, too.  It would be very inexpensive and easy to do.  You could even do it with a small botnet and a simple AI that creates new accounts, browses Reddit making generic posts here and there, and frequents science subreddits to downvote anti-GMO posts.  It wouldn't have to be perfect, but just good enough to have a net pro-GMO effect.  Come to think of it, there are probably systems like this already acting on many different issues where stakeholders exist who have access to strong IT resources.  I don't necessarily disagree with your assessment of Monsanto activity on Reddit, except that I do not believe I *know* what is happening.  I was hoping you would share some evidence (e.g. a link to a fairly transparent shill post).   Well that's all true, but hardly relevant.  Rodney King was beaten by LAPD almost 25 years ago.  Few would argue that police brutality in the United States has improved in that time, yet nobody can deny the awe-inspiring growth of technology over the same period.   Prohibition has delayed the growth of scientific knowledge and public understanding for a long time, but at this point it doesn't seem to matter nearly so much.  There is a great deal of research happening now.  In some ways, we have a better understanding of cannabis as a whole plant drug than we do of tobacco (where research is mostly about isolated nicotine).   Well, those are very extreme statements.  Information technology has empowered ordinary people in privileged countries to create and distribute media, and this has led to some change in people's views and increased awareness of some issues.  But neither of those things is as extreme as you state - plenty of people were aware of police brutality before Facebook and smartphones existed.  But there is no evidence that I've been able to find that police brutality has decreased in the United States due to these changes.  I do not see how a modest change in awareness and public opinion is evidence that society's progress is matching that of technology.   I think reasonable people could disagree about most of what you just said.  You cite social networking and videos of police brutality as evidence of social progress.  To me, these things both seem like clear evidence of how sick our society is.   Wow.  That's a really interesting take on how augmented reality could play out.   They look fine man, don't worry.   But 1.3 grams won't get you very far. :P   cheers 3   Sounds like you vaped pretty fucking hard before you typed that sentence. :P  I have no idea what you're saying, but it sounds like you don't understand that there is no conceivable health risk from the copper in this device except through drinking acidic bong water repeatedly.  OP established that very clearly.  There are no copper fumes coming from the device.   So you have nothing behind it.  I could just as well say later that I encountered a paid shill whose job it is to make people who support Monsanto look like paid shills.  You're undermining the position you claim to support by making such obviously unsubstantiated claims.   I'll still try to minimize any health-concerning weak points I see when it comes to the colorful spectrum of things that go inside me.  If that's true, then you should use a vaporizer before concerning yourself with a little copper in your bong water.  Whatever tiny amount of copper that you might ingest from the bong water that may have trace amounts of leeched copper in it is benign compared to the relatively large quantities of known carcinogens in the smoke.    You eat copper every day, you know - if you didn't, you'd get sick.  It's food.   Perhaps it's actually quite common, but stoners are, as a group, very slow to change their views.   The pH of the water doesn't matter anyway, unless you plan to drink it.  If copper leaches into your bong water, you'll have copper laden bong water.  So what?   Copper also has low toxicity.   Oh yeah, no worries.  If you verify that it is fully dissolved and agitate the pan before introducing the blotter, then yes - you can safely assume that the LSD is evenly distributed.   Yeah.  By measuring an amount of LSD into a volume of fluid (e.g. alcohol) that you know can be absorbed by a sheet of blotter, and then laying the blotter in a pan of that fluid, you can have precisely measured doses with minimal variation between them.  Dropping LSD on individual squares is rare, and introduces far more error into the process.   The only reason to think it wouldn't be is if you see signs that the tabs have had LSD solution dropped on them with a dropper.  This would mean that your LSD was laid on blotter by an amateur; LSD is properly laid on blotter whole sheets at a time, usually in flat pans.    In all my years of taking LSD, I only ever saw this problem once.   Well, I'd like to think he has a better reason than that.  Maybe he'll surprise you?   Ugh.  All this mancentric language really turns me off.  Why talk in such a backward way?   It is a bit ridiculous.  But the power of self-interested corporations to skew the availability of scientific evidence is not trivial.  Science follows money; if you don't have funding, you can't do research, and you can't make a living as a scientist.  Because large corporations will pay for work that makes their products look good, and will not pay for work that makes their products look bad, these corporations do exert an influence over the relative availability of research into various questions.  Corporate funding for science rivals that of governments, and is a major force in the scientific community.  This isn't necessarily bad, but it is one form of bias that exists in the literature.  This is one reason why it is important not to weigh the existence or lack of evidence too strongly when reviewing evidence for or against a particular point of view.  There are plenty of bad ideas that have yet to be refuted, and plenty of good ideas that nobody has yet investigated.   Come on...if you're going to make a claim like that, you should provide examples.  Anybody can say that; why should anybody believe you?   No anti-LE posts will be tolerated, posting something that even remotely resembles anti-LE, baiting an LE poster or "poking the bear" you will be banned, this is your only warning.  Ask law enforcement - for all those questions you've always wanted to ask a cop, as long as those questions make us look good.   Rest in peace in peace? :/   Also some kind of multitap delay, or a series of long feedback few hundred ms ish delays, and some kind of relatively fast (1hz ish) modulation on the reverb    Makes sense to me too.  I think it's important for the psychedelic community (in the broadest sense of that term) to continually explore potential harm from psychedelics and how to care for and prevent it.   Well...I guess there are a couple of assumptions there.  One is that these stories are approximately true (I can't comment, never having seen such a story), and the other is that the causal attribution made is accurate (that psychedelics caused the troubles).  Those seem like fairly large assumptions to me.  If psychedelics actually permanently fucked people up, I'd expect to at least be able to find a case study or two on pubmed..   I'm going to be honest, here. I love the header image, I think it's an awesome piece of art. That being said, to the average person, it is a bit... scary. Does that makes sense?  Yup.  It's a very dark image, and to be honest I never liked it; I don't believe it communicates the intended vibe of the sub.  Perhaps it would be good for those active on the sub to discuss what feelings and ideas they'd like to communicate to newcomers at first glance; the header is a powerful part of seeing a new sub for the first time, and it could be used more effectively.  Unless the consensus is that this sub is about darkly trippy third eye new age duders :P   Seldom will anyone in these circles admit that the drugs they do ARE dangerous and that they DO fuck people up (sometimes permanently). They can be psychologically devastating.  Well...I was with you for most of this, but I feel that you've gone well beyond established fact with these statements.  What evidence is there that psychedelic drugs have permanently fucked anybody up?   No, it wasn't.  He didn't say "look here's a study showing why psylocybin in particular will probably produce a nasty withdrawal."  He said   psilocybin affects the levels at least three known neurotransmitters (and probably a host of unknown ones) that can be adversely affected following a withdrawal  and therefore  Abruptly stopping a microdosing regimen of psilocybin will almost certainly have ill effects.  That conclusion can't possibly follow from the argument, as all kinds of substances that affect those neurotransmitters *do not* produce withdrawal at arbitrarily low doses.  And it is not specific to psilocybin: it is a general assertion about any substance that affects those neurotransmitters.  What you consider yourself is not relevant; if you can't comprehend such a simple line of reasoning, you are either very naive or you do not value reason enough to have learned how to use it effectively.   Rude...   His argument was not specific to psilocybin.  He claimed that any substance that altered levels of neurotransmitters would produce a negative withdrawal if taken regularly.  No evidence has been provided to support that idea so far.  edit:  I guess this is an anti-intellectual sub. :/  Disappointing.   The same way history is written: by whoever wins.   I am not misrepresenting his argument.  He is claiming that any substance that alters neurotransmitters will produce negative withdrawal effects if taken regularly and then quit.  I pointed out one instance in which his argument produces a false conclusion.  That is not a straw-man argument.  A straw man would be if I created a new argument that resembled his, but with flaws of my own making, and then pretended that my new argument was the original argument.  That is not what I have done.  I'm beginning to wonder if this is just a stoner sub. :/   It's not a straw man at all :/  Your own exact argument entails a ridiculous conclusion.  Doesn't that bother you?   If you have basic soldering skills and an hour or so to spare, you could make your own and save a good bit of money.  I make my own audio cables using parts from Redco.  Even if I only bought the gear to make a single cable at a time it'd be cheaper for me to build my own high quality cables than it would be to buy the worst cables in store.   I understand your claim very well!  I simply don't believe that it's true!  :D  What's so hard to understand about that?  Ingesting chemicals known to affect neurotransmitter levels and processing in the brain, for a prolonged time, and then abruptly ceasing that chemical is known to most likely cause side effects.  By this logic, if I ate .000000001 grams of chocolate every day for a prolonged time and then stopped, it would most likely cause side effects.  You have yet to make any quantitative claim or provide any quantitative evidence.    How do you know that this level of use will produce a significant withdrawal effect?   Troll post   Did you even read the pages you just linked to?  They aren't primary sources, and few of their references are either.  It's not purely chemistry and physiology - it's purely speculation!  Physiology doesn't happen with a logic like "X affects serotonin, serotonin makes you happy, therefore X could make you happy!".  Physiology is an extremely complex science and happens more like [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342005).  Interesting that I've been downvoted for pointing out that your bold claim had no apparent evidence behind it.  Is psychonaut an anti-skeptic / anti-science sub?  edit:  If you truly have seen clear evidence to support your claim, link to an actual study that supports your claim directly.  Not speculation about psilocybin having some vaguely defined effect on a vaguely defined neurotransmitter system - actual evidence of a specific effect that could be harmful.    Abruptly stopping a microdosing regimen of psilocybin will almost certainly have ill effects. Just prepare yourself.  That's quite a leap!  You have no way of knowing it will have negative effects.  It seems just as likely that there would be no ill effect.   Pretty garbage article.  What makes this relevant to /r/anarchism?   No - this is not a trivial problem.  If demand for desalinized water exceeds demand for the salt produced by it indefinitely, there will never be a time when the excess salt is needed.   Well, that view is contrary to the article's main premise and it seems implausible to me.  You really believe those graphs and the article's systematically biased wording are the result of naivete?  Why?   This hardly seems relevant; this article isn't about ineptitude, it's about deliberate obfuscation.   Just edit it so that the specific employee can't be identified.  You have important feedback for them - don't just sit on it. :)   Wow...great read. :(  [google map of the 'lake' showing its size relative to nearby cities](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B037'32.9%22N+109%C2%B040'10.1%22E/@40.6401853,109.6958997,6916m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0)   The way the word is used now, it often is no different.  A cooperative *can* be structured so that the workers own the fruits of their own labor and collectively decide how to run their business.  But in practice, most cooperatives function as small businesses that pay workers a wage to obey a boss.   Hey, it was a fair question.  People toss words like that around all the time on reddit and the definitions tend to slip.  It's good to clarify yourself when borrowing vaguely defined buzzwords.   Well, ok then.  If you're determined to ignore studies that contradict your point of view, I can't stop you.  I really think you should read that last link I sent though.  Science doesn't work very well when you pick and choose what results to believe on the basis of ordinary thinking.  edit:  It is interesting how you can't produce a single reference to support your view.   Welcome to /r/philosophy!  This is not like some of the subs you may be used to, where snarky one-liners with only a tangential relationship to the OP are taken as valuable contributions.  Please read the sidebar and FAQ!   Dude I have stuck with scientific evidence.  But you refuse to acknowledge any scientific evidence that contradicts your predetermined views.  Why?  Doesn't that seem odd to you?  There are plenty of studies done on mice including live ones too that show it has the opposite effect.  Link to one study that shows the opposite effect (hint: there are none).  The study you showed me I had read about when it first came out. I studied it and wasn't convinced because in much better conducted and well performed studies including tests done on live humans or apes there wasn't a correlation between THC and brain damage.  Show us one study in live humans or apes that could detect such inflammation, or the behavioral expression of it (e.g. memory impairment), that gave a contradictory result.  I doubt any exists.  And amandine is different if it wasn't, there would be no point in using THC. The difference is THC is more stable and dosent break down as easily making it stay longer. However fact remains that it is only a partial agonist to the cannabinoid receptors it still isn't strong enough to do massive damage to the body that just doesn't make sense.  I don't see how any of this contradicts the finding that THC produces inflammation in the hippocampus.  And inflammation is not massive damage - it's part of the body's natural response to injury.  But chronic inflammation often causes damage over time.  ...  You keep bringing up reasons why the finding could not possibly be true, which don't actually contradict it's being true.  In science, theoretical understanding *comes from empirical observations*, not the other way around.  If our theoretical understanding (e.g. your idea that THC can't cause inflammation because it is similar to anandamide, which you assume does not to cause inflammation) is contradicted by an observation of reality, then the theory must be abandoned or changed to match the observation.  In this way, our theoretical understanding gradually approaches a perfected model of reality.  If we threw out observations because they contradicted our theoretical understanding, we would no longer have an empirical discipline, and our theoretical understanding would gradually decay into a fairy tale with no particular correspondence to reality.  edit:  [Here is a helpful chart and explanation of the scientific method and it's excellence.](http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_scientific_method.shtml#overviewofthescientificmethod)   This has no relevance to the OP.   I see...well, without some explanation of the standard they use, and some quantitative expression of how "low " or "high" your hormone levels are, the test results don't really mean much, right?  Maybe your estrogen level is dangerously high, and you need to take a drug right now to prevent developing breast cancer next year.  Or perhaps it's actually within what a health professional would call normal limits, there is nothing wrong at all, and any attempt to change it would only introduce unnecessary risk.  Given the information available, it's hard to see how the internet could possibly tell between these two scenarios.  If you have cause for concern, a doctor can surely help you to sort it out. :)    Every time it's done on live animals or live subjects it's completely different.  That's not true - I just showed you two studies, one using neurons in a dish, and another using live mice, each showing the same result.  In fact, cell culture is an invaluable and highly reliable tool for investigating the effects of drugs, toxins, and nutrients on various types of cell.  Your ideas about it consistently producing wildly incongruent results directly contradict established scientific consensus.  For other studies similar things happened. They used tissues or neurons from the animal and placed them in dishes. Than they used live animals to test out there hypothesis. Huge differences, it always seems that thc in tissue samples in dishes, are much more negative compared to tests on real animals.  Except in the two studies I linked to and summarized above...the cell culture study and mouse study showed the same result with the same mechanism. :/  There is so much evidence on both sides to this plant. And on to what you said earlier, about how you can't ignore that THC causes memory impairments. Of course it does. That wasn't what I was referring to, all I said was the memory impairments were due to different neurotransmission which is a fact. This is how every drug works whether there are a depressant or a stimulant or whatever they all act on increasing or decreasing chemicals. To say that THC causes brain inflammation in the hippocampus, and that is what is responsible for its effects is irrational at this point.  How is that a fact?  I provided you a study from last year that established the fact that - at least in mice - THC induced memory problems are caused by COX-2 signalling (inflammation).  How is it irrational to accept an established scientific finding?  By that logic, every day we would get brain inflammation from anamidide since it works in the same pathways as THC.  Not necessarily; you're assuming many things about *how* THC produces inflammation in the hippocampus, which may not be true at all.  Perhaps there is some meaningful difference between [THC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Tetrahydrocannabinol.svg) and [anandamide](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Anandamide_skeletal.svg)?  They sure look different to me...  What about other drugs? Drugs like cocaine, and amphetamines increase brain function. Does that mean since the hippocampus is more active, these drugs cause the opposite effect? Well we know these drugs are neurotoxins despite there excitory transmissions. So Obvisouly just because they temporarily increase brain function doesn't mean there healthy. Hard stimulants are some of the most neurotoxins out there.  I don't see how this is even relevant.  Why not stick with the science and consider what I've shown you in the actual research literature, instead of speculating about other drugs?  edit:  I forgot to reply to the bit about lung cancer.  [Smoking cannabis can increase one's risk of lung cancer](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/resp.12298/full)      You should consult a medical professional before screwing around with your hormone levels.  There's a lot of garbage on the internet about this kind of thing; these systems are incredibly complex and generally poorly understood.  You can hurt yourself.  Who did the testing?  Did they tell you anything about the results' clinical significance?  Do you have any reason to believe that anything bad will happen if you do nothing?    If cannabis were legal it would be great, because than we could do studies on actual live humans, people who smoke the flower, and test there hippocampus to see if it is inflamed one way or another.  Hmm.  I have two questions for you:  How many studies have there been in the last decade in human cannabis users?  (hint: many)  How would you design a study that could test for inflammation in the hippocampus of a live human subject?  edit:  wait, you never did answer this...If THC doesn't produce inflammation in the hippocampus, why did [Hippocampal Neurotoxicity of 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/14/5322.full) find that THC produced COX-2 mediated neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons in a dish in 1998 - and why did [9-THC-Caused Synaptic and Memory Impairments Are Mediated through COX-2 Signaling](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.042) that THC produced COX-2 mediated neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons in mice in 2013?   Personally, I think the robothooker would be far *more* desirable than a human - assuming they were indistinguishable.  Prostitution is not an easy line of work!  Given the choice, wouldn't you rather enjoy uncomplicated roboconsensual sex instead of weird, potentially traumatic, wage slavery sex?   Huh...well, good luck with that.  I don't think you understand how science actually works; it's not a process of deriving new truths from old truths by thinking about it.  It's an empirical discipline; ideas about what might be true are generated by thinking about things, *and then tested in the real world to produce scientific findings*.  I read you drawing many conclusions on the basis of your own sense of how thing seem, or ought to be in your view; this kind of process is only tangentially if at all related to science and isn't a reliable means of producing knowledge.  The study of cannabis is about as confusing as the study of any drug or collection of drugs - it's a very complex, but ultimately straightforward and well established science.  It doesn't require guesswork or speculation.  You can go read the studies and learn things about what THC and other cannabinoids do in the brain, and you can come up with new hypotheses that could be tested as well.  But you can't decide that THC doesn't inflame the hippocampus - it does!  You can't just decide that THC doesn't cause memory impairments - because it does!  These are well established facts.  There's nothing confusing or ambiguous about them.   Haha!  I apologize for my mistaken assumption; something about your writing style suggested to me that you were probably a teenager asking on your own behalf.   I'm going to have to somewhat disagree because THC has been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory drug, this is why is is very medically beneficial to patients with inflammation or disorder or conditions that cause inflammation. The main reason (based on what I researched) for the hippocampus related deficiencies was due to the differentiated neurotransmission that goes once thc has entered the body. For example we know that THC and the endocannibinoid system work uniquely because the system works backward.  So rather than the pre synaptic cell transmits to the post synaptic cell it works backwards. This allows the pre synaptic cell to limit the amount of neurotransmission that occurs such as dopamine, GABA, etc. so the deficiencies in the hippocampus I dont believe are related to inflamation but rather the reason there are problems with short term memory and learning is because the amount of neurotransmission is decreased if it's decreased this means the hippocampus is going to work not as well because it's getting certain neurotransmitters blocked which are important for memory and learning.  But how do you explain studies (e.g. [9-THC-Caused Synaptic and Memory Impairments Are Mediated through COX-2 Signaling](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.042)) that demonstrated a causal relationship between THC induced inflammation in the hippocampus and specific memory problems?  Your ideas about cannabinoid induced synaptic feedback mechanisms are interesting, but I don't see how they would contradict the finding that THC induces inflammation in the hippocampus, thereby causing specific memory impairments.  Also, do you have a link to a study demonstrating this feedback mechanism?  edit:  there is often confusion about inflammation and anti-inflammatory drugs.  Many compounds have the potential to produce inflammation, even those that also have the potential to inhibit it (e.g. [counterirritants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterirritant)).  So there is not necessarily any contradiction to the finding that THC causes inflammation in the hippocampus if THC is found to have anti-inflammatory effects as well.   I dunno about that; I think there are euphoric states within the psychedelic experience rival the euphoria of opiates.  I don't think most people experience them on psychedelics, though.  With opiates, if you get the dose right you *will* experience unbelievably strong euphoria.  It's reliable.  But I don't think it's necessarily the only way to experience such strong euphoria.   If you're not going to shoot it, though, there is really no point in using heroin.  You could get the same or stronger effect with a known pure dose by using one of the euphoric pharmaceutical opiates, instead.   Forget the bullshit about metabolism - it's a vaguely defined pop health concept that has no particular relevance to your problem about drug testing.  If you need to defeat a drug test, there are specific, evidence-based, well established methods for defeating them.  The method used will depend on what drugs are in your system, in what amounts, and what will be tested for.  You could use google to find the answer, or reformulate your question and get great answers here.  edit:  Damn bro, you should eat more.   Grapefruit juice actually prolongs the time it takes for many drugs to be processed by liver and thereby removed from the body.   The mechanisms are, of course, dependent on the drug being used, and likely on a variety of other factors related to the individual's health.  But the mechanisms aren't really what matters to you - you need to know whether you're going to fry your brain!  The answer to that question is:  you may, and it's much better to be safe than sorry.  There's a big difference between once a week and twice (100%), but either may have lasting detrimental effects on your development.  Anyway, your question:  The main source of cognitive impairment from cannabis is likely due to it's toxicity in the hippocampus, a part of your brain that creates and works with memories.  This is why you often can't remember a fucking thing when you're really, really stoned.  Where are my keys?  Why did I walk into the kitchen?  I don't know, because my hippocampus is inflamed as fuck right now.  Could inflaming your hippocampus once or twice a week as a teenager affect your cognitive development?  Of course!  Is it certain to?  No.  But is that risk worth it to you?  *How much* risk of lifelong memory impairment is worth it to you?  Although it's been reasonably well established that marijuana use in adolescence can cause lasting cognitive impairment, the mechanisms of that impairment are not, so far as I could tell, known.  Scientists have learned a great deal about the mechanisms of acute impairments caused by marijuana - for example, we know that THC causes inflammation in the hippocampus, and thereby impairs memory.  But I haven't been able to find any studies proving that this change in the brain remains after cessation of use, nor any that examine the mechanisms of impairments that are found to endure in some populations.  I think it'd be good for you to study some more science.  This is how I came up with the answer above:  [I searched pubmed, the leading database that biomedical researchers use to find each others' work](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=marijuana+adolescent+mechanisms)  Then, I skimmed a few abstracts (research summaries) to refresh my memory.  Stuff like this:  [Mice on cannabis are dumber than mice not on cannabis, for really interesting complicated reasons](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036610)  [THC is toxic to the hippocampus](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/14/5322.full.pdf)  There's a vast wealth of information out there if you know where to look and how to read the language.  edit:  I almost forgot.  If you're going to smoke marijuana, it's a good idea to protect yourself from some of its harmful effects on your memory by taking an anti-inflammatory drug or plant medicine (e.g. ginger).  [THC's effects on the hippocampus can be somewhat blocked by NSAIDS](http://www.elsevier.com/connect/preventing-marijuana-induced-memory-problems-with-OTC-painkillers)   Ahh - I'm afraid I can't recommend anything in particular.  It seems to me that most vaporizers of that quality and design are in the $200-$300 range these days.  I will say this:  although I almost never use the vaporizer away from home, I love the portability of it.  I guess part of this comes from being used to pipes; the thing fits in with my usual routine of going about my business while smoking.  If I owned a hookah or a stationary vaporizer, I'd probably never use it unless I was entertaining friends.  If you don't care about portability, there have been a few vaporizers of [this](http://dabuddhavaporizer.com/index.php/dabuddhavaporizer/da-buddha-vaporizer/da-buddha-vaporizer-blue.html) design over the years and they seem to work really well for plant material.  There used to be one like this that was quite good and ~$100, but I can't recall the name (this is was in 2005 or so).  There a many cheap vaporizers on the market now that are intended for use with hash oil and/or nicotine bearing liquids, but which are unsuitable for tobacco and other herbs.  You want a vaporizer that heats plant material with hot air, not a hot surface; the experience of vaporizing plant materials with a conduction (hot bowl) vaporizer is not pleasant.  Anyway, best of luck.  Feel free to run different finds by me if you like.   You're quite welcome. :)     You're using an incorrect abbreviation.  CBD is commonly used as an abbreviation for cannabidiol in particular, both in popular writing and in research literature (e.g. [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799920) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25779454) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777582)).  edit:  in general, it's very easy to learn the accepted convention for any particular abbreviated term in the research literature; simply search for the term on pubmed or the appropriate service for your discipline and check the first few articles' abstracts for the convention used.  There is usually a clear consensus.   Just want to second the vaporizer suggestion: they're way better than e-cigs as a pipe replacement.  I have a [DaVinci](https://www.davincivaporizer.com/davinci-vaporizer-black-bundle/) that I've used for pipe tobacco and occasionally cannabis.  I imagine my experience would be similar with another well designed convection vaporizer (like the Pax and many others).  It works very, very well with the pipe tobaccos I've tried it with (VaPer's and English, no goopy aromatics).  I like that I can adjust the temperature quite precisely, and that the tobacco remains highly responsive to the frequency and strength of my draw.  In some ways, the flavor can even be better than smoking; it tends to complement fruity, floral, and sweet flavors very strongly.   You could list it on ebay and offer local pickup as a shipping option, then link to the ebay listing on craigslist.  This removes the cash problem and allows either person to ask ebay for arbitration if something goes wrong.   We, inside the bodies, are still the same individuals; it's our ability to act through them that is impaired.  This makes no sense to me. :D  When I drink (or sleep poorly, or take a drug, or whatever), I *feel* and *think* and *perceive* very differently that when I don't.  It doesn't seem like there is any separation to me.    When we die, we are exactly the same individual as we were before death, except that now we don't have a body.  I see no reason to believe this is true.  When I drink alcohol, I become a new person.  If I suffered a head injury, I would become a new person.  The person arises from the body, in a sense; the person's qualities are dependent on the body's functions.  When the body is changed, the person changes.  Why should the person stay the same when the body changes so dramatically that it's no longer a body?   "Causal questions get causal answers" was meant to be the reason the statements are contradictory.  In that case, I believe you have misunderstood Chalmers' statements paraphrased in the OP.  Anyway, I don't see how the statement "Causal questions get causal answers" demonstrates any contradiction.  Could you explain?   Yes; Chalmers used the word consciousness to mean what chaosmosis would call experience[ness].   Causal questions get causal answers.  Seems reasonable enough.  To exist is to have experiences.   Whoah!  Now you're positing an answer to the hard problem by proposing that existence entails consciousness.  David Chalmers actually discussed this exact answer in a [recent talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness?language=en).  But you were in the middle of talking about a contradiction in the problem itself...  ...which I don't see.  How do the two statements OP made contradict one another?  Could you be specific about that contradiction?   What would suffice as an answer, then? If you define a problem to be insoluble, you'll obviously never solve it. In what sense does Chalmers mean "why"? If it's not in the causal sense, I'm inclined to think it's a meaningless question.   [He means it as a causal / explanatory why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#Chalmers.27_formulation); it's not a meaningless question.  He did give it some thought, you know!   I think it was opium dissolved in ethanol.   If you buy a cutting or whole cacti, you could juice it instead of having to make tea or ingest powder.  Probably more enjoyable.  	104
 Um I guess that depends. I think there are some RDAs that have a kind of tank attachment but a true RDA is a "deck" you build your coils on. Instead of a glass tank you wick them with cotton and put your ejuice on the cotton, so when the coil(s) heat up it/they burn the juice off the cotton, giving you vapor.   A vape store owner I know runs .02 on a mephisto with an el diabolo 26650 mod. I've seen the build but am way too nervous to be around when he uses it.   What size wire and how many wraps?   No worries. Its rebuildable dripping atomizer. Look into them, you'll need one of them to get awesome clouds. The only tank I've ever seen that would give you a decent cloud is the arctic with the .2 coil, but that still could never compare to an RDA lol.   My two favorite mods are my el diabolo 26650 and my hammer of god that takes 4 18650s. I feel like a mod is only going to get you so far though, the RDA is (in my opinion) much more important. The best I've used were the Buddha zephyr, the 26650 mephisto, and the mutation. What RDA are you using now?   That's awesome! I've just heard stories about it melting so I've not really been interested lol   I've not used nickel yet, but with kanthal that would take a year to heat up! Lol   Came here to say this lol   Wake up sheeple jet fuel isn't even flammable!!   for those who are interested: https://www.etsy.com/listing/175112598/cat-battle-armor   isn't this the stock photo from etsy?

A few burn holes in my carpet/couch/deck/everything motivated me to switch. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!   Yeah me too. I've drawn up a lot of plans for a box similar to this, I'm a machinist so I could really go crazy with it. I'm a bit nervous though so I'm reading up a lot on the wiring and stuff. 4 batteries that close to my face, really wouldn't want to do that wrong!   I feel like not many people know about this guy (at least not many people around me), so I thought I'd share:  http://vaperzcloud.com/products/hammer-of-god-box  It was my first mod and it's still my favorite. 10/10 woud buy again.

 Alright, so if I think my local laundromat has boxes of drugs in the basement, am I allowed to break in and investigate? Honest question, because the other user seems to be implying that'd be perfectly legal, and that doesn't seem correct (though I really have no idea). To me, that seems to be what the bill is about.   As for why farms, it's because Wyo. has a huge farming community, and I always figured states created laws to cater to what's relevant.    Here's something from Slate saying why the practice would be good for women:  http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/04/legalize_polygamy_marriage_equality_for_all.html   * High taxes on the rich  * Reduction of wealth inequality   * Labor rights  * Fighting religious influence   * Gun control   * Leveling the socio-economic playing field through government action (such as affirmative action)  * At one point being anti-war, but the progressive silence during Obama's tenure has changed that  * Feminist positions (pro-choice, etc)  * LGBT rights      * Anti-privatization   * Anti-charter schools    I'd think you'd only be allowed into a strangers home if you suspect someone (or something like an animal) is in need of immediate help. I don't think, for example, I can just break into your home if I suspect you for smoking crack and want to collect evidence. The legal thing would be to call the authorities.   I could be wrong though, so let me know if I am.     Casper with the Red Cross. But rent is like ten billion dollar :(    They can be protected if they remain anonymous. That's fine, as they're not trespassing since they are employees.    Good. In case things go wrong, hit the gym, and lawyer up.    Yes. Browsing invisibly is a good touch for me.    Should trespassers not be charged? I'm stuck on that question. On one hand, I know some farms can be abusive, but on another, private property is private, and I don't see what's wrong with strengthening protections against intruders. What's the alternative? To force farms to let anyone who asks to come on in?    I'm looking for the same thing. Even /r/libertarian is bad.  The only pro-capitalism sub I've found to be tolerable is /r/anarcho_capitalism.        Is that a bad thing? I need to keep some money of mine - if someone took all, I'd be homeless.       Pretty much not expected, but if I'm really stuck somewhere and they spend a good amount of time getting me out, I'll throw them a little something.    Making it look like I'm active   When I got an awesome job offer...that was in Wyoming again. Fuck.   What's your favorite book, album and movie?   What do you do there?   From the right-libertarian perceptive, liberty would include things like property, the right to vote (if that applies), right to a fair trial (if that applies) and so on. More or less, you can look to the US Constitution for examples of this. It's the basic right to your personhood.    I was supposed to have drinks with a date but she canceled due to illness. Drank anyway at a bar. Listened to music. Cried tears of much sadness on the drive home.    Met for beers two hours North of me. Talked China, Mormons, and other things. Played pool. Simple and easy. Not sure she wants a second date though.   1/10 for that reason alone.    How much wood could a woodchuck chuck wood if a woodchuck could chuck wood?   Goes great with a side of Sarah Silverman.    Something cool I heard about him was that he originally thought the Constitution was a racist piece of law, but after studying it some more he changed his mind and found it to be good for African-Americans.    The Drudge isn't a news source. It links to other sites, and doesn't report anything on it's own.    Highfive, obviously    Effort, probably. Tinder is easier to use and set up.       I bookmark interesting people with really long profiles, who I might message later in the year.   * Someone to go dancing with me, while inebriated by substances  * Going church to church to see where the qt's are   At this current moment, I'm comfortable with having a relationship. With Yemen, Syria, and Iraq all in turmoil, it's good to have an ally on the ground. Certainly I agree that SA's human abuse issues are very bad, and should not be overlooked, but we should wait to evaluate the relationship until after ISIS and the Yemenis rebels are taken care of.    I've been in Utah a month and already got work at a cal center (and got three other offers). Look around the outskirts of SLC (Provo, Orem) and you might have better luck.     The call center I'm going to be working for is looking for new hires. Would you be interested in doing that?   I've gotten 5 dates on OKC in a month, but only one through Tinder during the same time. OKC is way easier if you use it right.    Look to the North Shore or South Shore. Towns like Cohasset, Beverly, and Marblehead have such places.     Very true. The dealership often can't tell the true condition of the car until they get a full look at it. Number of miles on it are also a factor into lowering the price.    Awesome list. Saved.    That's super interesting! Got any sources? NYT, RT, WSJ, etc? I'd love to write about this for a blog team I'm a part of, just having difficulty finding any sources on the matter.    You are waiting for what evidence, exactly? People who have worked on these teams have themselves come out and made posts about it with their instruction booklets or memos(no I don't have sources because I'm not writing a peer-reviewed scientific journal entry, sorry, you can google it though  You mean posts on Reddit? That's not really credible, is it? Peer reviewed journalists aren't the only ones that use sources - anyone making claims usually have them. For example, I can say the Moon is made of cheese. The only way I could convince anyone of that would be proof, right? Or should people just take it at face value?  Do I suspect companies are playing Reddit? Sure, it might be a thing. But every time I ask for proof so I can convince others, I get non-answers and I'm told to just "think about it". Very frustrating. I'm just so skeptical because of the amount times I personally have been called a shill (which would be nice, but is sadly false).    Which ever ones have proof and sources are fine! I keep digging, but I'm not coming up with a lot of solid proof, just a lot of speculation without sources.   Damn, most if those aren't actually about Obama's recovery package that went to the roads. Ah well, thanks for trying! I guess I'll just have to wait until someone else provides better links.    So you don't think the lack of evidence has any barring on folks being outraged? Just speaking for myself, if I saw more evidence of astroturfing, I'd be mad. But I can't be because I don't see it. My guess (and you can prove me wrong here) is a majority of folk are the same way.     That place will accuse anyone of being a shill. I have some conservative views, and was called a shill at least three times for espousing them.    Probably because we haven't really caught people doing this. Most accusations are speculation, and don't carry proof.    This is my most successful method, too. What I do is I offer the date without time it place specifics. That way we set those two things up via texting, and everything is easier.    So which rich and connected persons then? Googling for names isn't helping me find out who you're talking about.    How do you mean? I saw plenty of stimulus projects at work a few years ago. Which rich specifically?    Yup. I had a girl message me back two months later. She apologized, and wrote a good response. Wasn't an issue.    I would take new ones. The other two are okay, but you need more for sure!   Your main has bad lighting, so it's not particularly flattering.   I found the time travel joke a bit overused. Using it once or twice is okay, but more than that feels boring.    Do you know any details? Like time?   An American guy flipped off the police every time he drove by them. They would pull him over for it (not sure if they cited him or anything). He later sued and won.    I would use the dog pic as your main. It's really cute.    I had some food with two homeless gentlemen earlier, Mike and JP. It was really cute how they got so sleepy after they ate a full meal in God knows how long. They took me to the shelter they're at and told me their stories. Pretty cool experience.      It shouldn't be. It's clear many Millennials are turning towards libertarianism and socialism due to a lack of connection with the two parties. Diversity in the political field is exactly what this country needs.      Some people think jet fuel couldn't possibly melt the steal beams of the World Trade Centers (which is what is commonly accepted as the cause for why the buildings fell). If these people are right, that would mean the buildings fell for someone other reason, namely, explosives (some people think the planes were carrying missiles or were missiles themselves).    There definitely are. A good portion identify as libertarian too. Groups like Students For Liberty and Young Americans For Liberty have a growing presence at CPAC and college campuses.       No, nor do many universalists. Sin comes from scripture, telling us what God wants an doesn't want. Many universalists don't read such scripture, so it's an irrelevant topic.    Seconded. I'm a deist, and also a universalist. I have to mark "other" on my profile because I'm not sure how else to describe it. I'm religious in that I believe in God, but don't follow any scripture.      Hmm. You're right. Seniors are better targets.    Ur just jealous.   (I'll be shaving within a week or two).    It's funny about the bi-thing. Most of my visitors are guys (which I expected), but even they seemed turned off/aren't messaging.   And yes, I'm messaging first when I can.   Thanks for the tip!       I'm with Americorps, and our living stipend is not made for super expensive places like Casper.  My job is looking to move me there, but I just don't know what to do. I can afford around 400 a month, maybe 500 if utilities are included.   There are a couple places I've found online which seem to serve low income individuals. What kind if prices should I expect from there?    One really bad thing is cost of rental. A lot of 1br places are 800+. Really crazy.    More local government, less federal government. That is, a state/province should have a lot more power when determining it's own destiny.   Also, many want public utilities replaced by private companies.      I'm not sure on figures, but it rarely seems to work for attracting celebrities. However, requests for less famous type people (magicians, truck drivers, fast food workers) seem to have a fair chance of getting an AMA.    When we report using the app, who receives our report?     That was until he visited Mecca, where he saw integration working.    Love their laughs. Thanks for sharing!   That's a cool suggestion! Thanks for the link!   I'd say so, especially if you're part of that group. How are groups supposed to self improve if no one (outsiders or insiders) criticize them when they do wrong? At one point in time, western political thought was dominated by racism, sexism, and colonialism. Had people followed your line of thought, nothing would have ever changed because everyone was doing it, so why bother?     So then what's the proper way to criticize a group when you see trends, like the ones the speaker pointed out?   One can criticize a single group without having to criticize all groups.    Was this in utah?   It's a joke. Someone snagged it before actual people from SF could.   Sometimes VICE and Reason, which cover a of issues like police abuse and war.   I'll say 2 is the lie. It was Morgan Freeman instead, wasn't it?      How often do you break things in the lab if you're drinking? Last time I drank at work, the whole place burned down. Need ideas on how to avoid that.     Seconded with FIRE. Amazing group.    Liberal Mormons seem to be common for SLC   It can mean either. In my experience, if they want you to have a license from the state they are located in, the company will give you time to get one.     All good points to me! How would I go about putting a union job on a resume, though? "Worked for unionized call center doing A, B  amp; C"?   I'm assuming you went to ISFLC? Hope you had fun, glad you made it safe!    Appreciate the write up! Job security is definitely a concern of mine, so that's a great point on disciplinary action.    Got two offers from two different call centers. One is union at 10/hr, the other is non-union at 12/hr. I could do either just fine, but the union one also seems to offer better full-time benefits.   What would you do?   If I suspect someone is going to ask me if we're Amish, I just start slinging plainspeak around.    Seconding on length. Cut it down like a lumberjack in a forest.    Mucho gracias!   Hopefully I'm doing this right:  You've reached my profile, please send a message after the beep.  Rejected from Massachusetts, new to the West. Show me around your town, and I'll buy us matching socks. Often hanging around SLC at museums and libraries.  Simplicity is my goal. You'll find I don't own much, with great pleasure. It's an easy lifestyle, ya dig?  Mover, shaker, also a Quaker. And before you ask, no, not like the Amish.   The American Friends Service Committee. It does a lot of broad work on ending racism, war, and poverty. Besides my occasional donation, I'm a part of my local Quaker community, where we discuss such things at the local level.   http://afsc.org   Went to a concert Friday night with a girl (Authority Zero, Reel Big Phish, Less Than Jake). Didn't see her dancing much, so I thought it was a waste. Wound up going back to my place anyway. She talked a lot though. Like, a real lot.    Do different tribes stereotype one another? As in, would tribe X have stereotypes about tribe Y? And if so, what kind of stereotypes are there?   Doing pretty well myself. Killer profile, good pics, and a killer message is all it takes. Practice makes perfect. Just keep working at it, and get that critique.    I don't think mentioning work for people my age (18-23) is that important. A majority of us are in school and working part-time, or working full-time but not at a fulfilling job. The job market sucks for Millennials       I'm getting job offers and interviews after only being in my state for since the start of the month. Feels good.    Not totally sure, but there'd probably be needed proof that it's actually alcohol, regardless of what the bottles might look like. Again, could just be water, even if the bottle says it's not.   When you get in trouble with the law, there needs to be proof   There'd also need to be proof of what is in the beverage. You could be faking being drunk, and your drink could just be water.    Another difference (for the US) is a college can be 2 year or 4 year, but a university is always 4 year.     I've just started viewing apartments on my own, and have no idea what I should be asking. I know to ask about rent and utilities, and move in dates, but what else should I know?   Message me if section only says "you want to"   Lol no we dnt jk   Acting stupid cute with me is the way to my heart.    I've had a two first messages from girls, lots of guys but none of them said anything beyond "hello how are you".    7 hours. Yup, desperate as fuck.    A girl mentioned having a minor in Chinese. I know a bit and sent her something asking her general questions. I reviewed the message later, and the grammar was shit.  Oh well.    Yup. After trying search on the website via Safari, I got a message saying the search function was overloaded.    Same age and same grade for me. Remember watching the news but not understanding what the heck was going on. Didnt seem very special until a few years later.    No issue!    Maybe you can if I run again :p  Because if I didn't run, the cop would run opposed. WE NEED CHOICES, DAMNIT   I did! Ran for state rep. I was never, ever going to win (the city had a clear preference for one party). But I got 16% of the vote.   A lot of people were mad at me for running, and the local paper announced my candidacy with this title: "John Smith (the cop) announces bid for seat, faces no serious competition".   Makes my heart sink :(  	110
    Nope it doesn't. There's no farm. I just put that there because I thought it looked good. Good idea though! Might do that in the future.       Awesome. Thanks for this. Saved.      Is that Amplified?          There can only be one.       What if the entire universe is just one of the millions of cells of some being?       Today I learned.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IITJsTbPvlQ   Using the Kobra method, you can theoretically get an infinite number of spawners close together.     Would like to know the answer to that question as well. Wow.    Thanks. Just to clarify. I just want to try it once for experimental purposes, to see what it feels like. I feel like reading the research on these things isn't enough, you also need personal experience to truly understand how people who use it feel.    They left out the part where celebrities use nervous system stimulants like amphetamines to not gain weight, oh and the part where athletes and performers use testosterone products.       This. It depends on body fat percentage.    And also, you fear that I might hurt people. That's because you assume that I talk about these things in real life. Let me reassure you, I don't. My friends merely see me as some fit guy who works out a lot, but they don't even talk about food, so discussions on food in general rarely come up and even when they do, I just remain silent or out of the conversation, or if my opinion is asked, I give out some random generic bullshit nutrition advice. Sadly, they don't even understand the importance of nutrition for changing your body or in general, and I don't want to carry the burden of having to educate them on the subject.    You're right in the sense that I personally feel very, very alienated. Primarily because of my beliefs on food and health, which stem from my outlook on life in general. It's not something that I discuss with my friends or family, because I feel it would just make me feel further alienated to let other people know that I feel alienated, but I do feel this way very strongly.  And this is why I don't want to have children. I would have to choose between transmitting them the values that I believe in and the things that I believe to be true, and making them feel relatively integrated into society. If I did transmit them my values I'd be no better than the obese parents who transmit their unhealthy eating habits to their kids, thus condemning them to endure the same fate... But with my particular outlook on life, I don't believe that there is an in between.   And Minecraft is just a game that I play. I play many other games as well. Online gaming is my main hobby outside of bodybuilding. True, sometimes I mine blocks while watching TV shows or doing homework. But I still go to university, work part time, prepare all my food, lift 4-6 days a week and get my 8 hours of sleep daily. All these things and online gaming aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, it's all about time management.    I don't mean poison in a literal way. I don't know if sugar has a lethal dose, but if it does, it must be insanely high. But it's what it does to your brain and body in the long run that's seen as poisonous. Evidence regarding the 'toxicity' of sugar mostly points towards more refined commercially types of simple carbohydrates, such as fructose and HFCS (HFCS is basically corn syrup that has been engineered to transform some of its glucose into fructose). Which is why soft drink and other 'artificial' sugar-rich products are particularly harmful.    I agree with what you said mostly. But if I'm going to 'enjoy life', I would resort to something that's less harmful than alcohol, like ingesting THC or Psylocybin. I believe that the need to alter one's own consciousness is inherent to human nature, but it does not mean that you have to destroy your own body in the process. And this is just me - but drinking in a pub with friends got old after about a year for me. When I was 18, I had that phase too, where I wanted to go out, drink and 'party hard', but after a while I started thinking of how shallow and superficial that was, and that my time could be used more efficiently. There are so many things to do in our vast world... It baffles me that some people would spend most of their free time doing something that has little benefit in the short run, and only negative consequences down the road.    Let me explain this in simpler terms. Nature does things well; humans have evolved to like sweet things, because originally sweet things were also healthy and necessary for survival: they were mostly fruits, which are rich in vitamins and minerals, and rich in dietary fibers, which balance out the nefarious effects of sugar by controlling appetite and maintaining gut flora health. But sugar on its own is a poison, as it makes you feel pleasure without satisfying your feeling of hunger, thus making you want to eat more of it - this is what is meant by the sugar-craving cycle. At some point in time, the food companies became aware of this, and they realized that they could make a fortune by exploiting humans' natural predisposition towards sugar and removing the things that usually accompany it and therefore make it fine to ingest, such as things found in fruits. And from this were born soft drinks, chocolate bars and most of the nasty processed sugar-rich food products that obese people and society at large consume nowadays. This is essentially an evolutionary mismatch between people's predisposition to eat sweet things for survival purposes and people's desire to acquire physical richness. What is the outcome of this? Widespread obesity and a bunch of other related health issues.    If that's all you got from what I wrote there, there's nothing I can do to help you. Either you didn't take the time to read, or you have nothing to answer that would support your own point of view and contradict mine.    There would be no psychological need for sugar if sugar was never consumed to begin with. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have evolved to like sweetness, but sweetness does not only equate to cake and candy bars. Look, you were not born with the need to eat chips or cake, or with the need to drink beer or hard liquor. The fact that you 'crave' certain foods is merely the product of a culturally enhanced evolutionary predisposition for certain nutrients and other chemicals, but it's not necessary for your survival. When it comes to the point where the instant satisfaction that you experience from the consumption of something far outweighs whatever long-term consequences may be on the line due to frequency of consumption, there is a big problem IMO. And this is why society is so fucked up when it comes to food.    If you knew what sugar in general does to your body, trust me, you would probably avoid it too. Sugar is decent for high endurance sports athletes, but not for the general sedentary population. The sugar in fruits is probably fine for everyone anyway, but certainly not the highly processed sugar that things like cake and candy bars contain. You see, from an evolutionary perspective, humans have evolved to associate sweetness with energy density for survival purposes - in the past, sweet foods were usually good. But this has nothing to do with the toxic, obesity-inducing , devoid-of-nutritional-value food products that are mass produced for economic purposes nowadays. In those foods,  sugar is a poison. In fact, sugar affects the brain's reward pathways and the nucleus accumbens, a region of the basal forebrain associated with motivation, pleasure and reinforcement of behaviors, but doesn't trigger the brain's satiety mechanisms, leading to something that nutritionists colloquially refer to as 'the sugar-craving cycle'. This is why when people eat cake, for example, they usually don't have just a piece, but rather 2 or 3 or more... and even if they have just one, it takes them a huge effort to 'resist the urge to eat more', because it just tastes so good and they feel like eating the entire cake.    Just a clarification: fruits are also sugar. In fact, they're primarily made of that. The reason why they're still healthy is because they're rich in sugar but also in dietary fibers, the two of which balance each other's effects on the body, and also because they're also relatively low in calories and rich in micro nutrients. But they are still sugar.    Not based on any research, but I would say the DB press.    So what you're saying is my kid would suffer socially speaking if I didn't allow her/him to do what her/his friends' unhealthy ignorant parents are allowing their own kids to do? Makes sense, and this is why I don't want to have children. But you're right, having cake once in a while is probably harmless. But the real issue is that parents who allow their kid to have cake also allow them to regularly eat a lot of a bunch of food products that are rich in bad fats and processed simple carbohydrates. This, in the long run, definitely has consequences.    Firstly, the assumption that you need to eat any food product, such as cake, is a cultural construct. Humans are born needing macro nutrients in order to survive and micro nutrients in order to be healthy, that's it. The rest is just a byproduct of the society in which we live. Also, how do video games and obsession relate to each other? Do you even know what an obsession is, medically speaking? A lot of different things could be byproducts of some kind of obsession or obsessive disorder, I don't know why you're pinpointing a video game in particular. If by 'you might consider seeing a psychiatrist' you mean 'I can't get over the fact that your outlook on the world strongly differs from mine', then sure, I agree. Otherwise, I just think that you're making a bunch of mostly baseless assumptions and you don't really know what you're talking about.    And that's why I would never say this to anyone in real life. But on the internet I don't come care as much. I just express my opinions in an unfiltered manner.    I agree. I love it so much that I've sacrificed everything for it. My good friends became shallow ignorant people (I don't tell them of course, but secretly I believe that). The foods that used to taste good, I now see as unhealthy processed crap that's all part of the grand industrial scheme to make tons of money from mass slaughter of genetically modified animals and production of addictive nutrients while slowly sending people to their death. All the people surrounding me and their petty lives... The person that they are only means as much as their inability to understand even the very things that they put through their month on the daily, and the fact that they'll unconsciously transmit those irrational and unhealthy habits to their offspring. In other words, they are utterly meaningless to me. When you come to truly understand what fitness and being healthy mean, your understanding of the world also changes drastically, and the light that once filled your unknowing mind is replaced by darkness as the reality of the pitiful lives of most people that inhabit this world unfolds before your eyes.       Whoa! That's fascinating! Thanks for sharing.       Avoid exercises that make you feel knee pain until the pain is gone and you get the okay from whatever professional is following your case?    Contrary to popular bro science, you don't need to exercise to lose weight. You just need to use more calories than you ingest. If you aren't exercising as much, simply eat less to make up for it. Eat lots of proteins and vegetables and there should be no muscle loss either.    The only thing that will bring back your pain is doing deadlifts with poor form, which is also what probably made you feel pain in the first place.    My first priority is always to increase muscle tissue. Second one is to reduce adipose tissue. When I was younger and fatter, it was the opposite. But the closer I got to 10% and the more I realized the truth: gaining muscle is much harder than losing fat.    Refeed days should be at maintenance, not above. They should also be high carb, moderate protein, low fat days. This is because the only thing that research has shown to affect appetite hormone serum production is complex carbohydrates. No significant correlation has ever been shown with fat, protein and sugar. Also, carbohydrates and fats do not mesh well together, because carbohydrates increase adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides.       Sounds to me like another excuse to have cheat meals more often.    What caloric deficit you should be at depends on your body fat %age, on how long you've been on a deficit and on how long you plan to be on one. If you are above 20%, you could be even on a 1000 calorie deficit and eat lots of protein and be fine. If you are closer to 10%, I would not go above 500 calorie. In all cases, I think it's better to just be on a daily deficit rather than only have some days where you're on a deficit. Discipline is not just something that you decide to have one day, it's also a habit, something that you learn and that becomes easier with time. If you wanna lose weight more slowly, just be on a smaller daily deficit.    It sounds to me like you're looking for excuses to not be on a strict diet. I don't see how eating with your girlfriend or eating out occasionally prevent you from being on a caloric deficit or roughly respecting your macro nutrient breakdown.   Speech giver Eric Thomas said: 'the most important thing is this: the ability, at any moment, to sacrifice what you are for what you will become.'   If you let the small things of your daily life, such as the ones you're describing here, get in the way of the future you have envisioned for yourself, then that future will never happen. There's a reason a lot of people don't go very far when it comes to changing their body: it's because they keep coming up with excuses like these. 'I want to diet but I don't want to never eat out', 'I can't be on a deficit because I have to eat with my girlfriend.'   Sounds like a bunch of unfounded excuses to me.    I wasn't referring to you in particular, don't worry. This is sent towards the community as a whole. But I agree with what you said!   -Have you:   -Made an Ocean Monument farm?  -Made a squid farm that uses Guardians to kill squids?  -Used the Ocean Monument blocks to build cool things?  -Used sponges to do things that involve building underwater or removing large areas of water?  -Made cool redstone contraptions that use slime blocks?  -Used red sandstone, diorite, granite, andesite, and chiseled   cracked stone bricks to build cool things?  -Found a Killer Bunny?  -Made a Minecraft map that uses the new Command blocks?  -Made a bunch of cool features   models that use the new Command blocks?  Because these are just few of the things you can do in 1.8, and I think that if you haven't done them yet, you have no right to complain that you are bored of 1.8.    Nothing is holding me back. And I am in fact reaching them. It's just a matter of patience now. It takes time to change your body.    I know the feel. It was hard for me to lower my bench weight so I could bench press with straight wrists. But in the long run it was worth it.    It's fine to be a small idiot with a big ego. It's fine to make mistakes. What I can't respect is when people stay that way and never learn and never change. But you managed to see your own shortcomings and overcame them. Congrats bro.    It depends on your body fat percentage. Even a 1000 calorie deficit, given sufficient protein intake, is probably fine for someone who is at 25% body fat. But at 10% body fat, I would never be on more than 500 unless I'm using steroids.    You're either at maintenance or on a deficit. If you're eating enough calories that you'd be at maintenance if it wasn't for the calories you burn doing Muay Thai, you're at a deficit. Period. Also, I'm no Muay Thai expert, but I would guess that you need mostly general strength, which means a strong core and good intra and intermuscular connections, which means heavy compound exercises, like squats and deadlifts. That's what you're already doing. I'd say keep doing that.    Healthier foods are said to work for weight loss because they are generally lower in calories than their less healthy counterpart. However, caloric intake is still what mostly matters in the end. You could eat a lot of healthy foods, and still not lose weight because you are not on a caloric deficit despite eating 'healthy'. Inversely, you could be on a diet of Twinkies and chips and still lose weight if you are on a caloric deficit. In experiments conducted in a controlled setting, reducing caloric intake far outweighs any other factor when it comes to lowering adipose tissue percentage and improving general health. Therefore, you should count your calories. 'Common sense dieting' is the best way to never drop sub 20%. It will obviously work for the morbidly obese, but isn't an effective long term method if you want to be serious about changing your body.    Unless you are really muscular or really tall or a mix of both, there's no way your TDEE is at 3500 calories. You must have made a mistake.    'Obsessed' is the word the lazy use to describe the dedicated. And having a nice body is what makes me happy. Perhaps I'm a weird breed, but isn't it what life is about - doing what makes you happy?    'Research suggesting that...'  OP offers no source to back up claim that research suggests what he's talking about.  Didn't read the rest, sorry.    I don't know if you guys have or have had a similar experience, but personally, I feel like the answer to the question in the title is yes.  My main hobby is bodybuilding, but it's a hobby that my friends don't share nor are interested in, so it's one central subject of my life that we can't talk about.  I also feel kind of alienated from society, because I don't really eat the foods that most people eat, I don't really have breakfast, dinner and supper and all that, I rarely eat out because the foods that most places serve don't fit my macros most of the time, and I don't drink alcohol. Sometimes I go out, but since I don't drink, the whole idea of 'going out, getting drunk and partying hard' doesn't appeal to me as much as it does for my friends and so most of the time I end up preferring to stay home and playing video games instead.   I also tend to turn off social opportunities a lot because I'm busy lifting, doing cardio, preparing food or sleeping. I don't really have time to see people as much as before I started this new lifestyle. I get up, eat, prepare food, go to class, eat, go to class again, eat, lift weights, go home, eat, study, go to sleep, rinse and repeat.  It was never intentional, but I feel like the more I've immersed myself into the lifestyle, and the more I've felt alienated from society and the less I've had interactions with others. Is it just me?    Whoa! Looks good man!   What would you replace them with?      Looks like bamboo sticks.    No, but everyone keeps telling me that I should make one, so maybe I will.    I wanted to release a save, but I've heard of people getting their work used and not being given credit for it, so now I'm scared.    Amazing!         I have a Nether fortress farm. Wither skeletons drop coal.    There is a reason people who are insanely dedicated tend to only eat chicken, rice and broccoli: because there aren't a million optimally healthy food products out there. Of course that diet isn't sustainable for most people, but it's still the truth.    No, peas do contain sugar as well, but they have a much better dietary fiber/sugar ratio. Milk is higher in sugar by about 4g on average, and contains no dietary fibers. A cup of peas contains 9g of sugar but also 9g of dietary fibers.    For most people and most of the time, yes. Sugar stimulates the nucleus acumbens, a region of the basal forebrain that is associated with motivation, pleasure and the reinforcement of behaviors. Fructose in particular has also been found to affect the brain's reward pathways without triggering its satiety mechanisms, leading to something that nutritionists call the 'sugar-craving cycle'. Nonetheless, there are times when sugar is good. For example, when combined with a high dietary fiber content; this is because dietary fibers are known to decrease appetite, and is partly why fruits are healthy despite being made primarily of sugar. Sugar is also good during times of insulin sensitivity, such as during the first meal of the day and immediately following an intense physical effort. This is why sugar is especially good for high endurance sport athletes, such as marathon runners.   But is it good for the average mostly sedentary overweight adult who does a moderate physical effort 2-3 times a week? If you ask me, no. These people have no understanding of the biochemical principles on which nutrition is based, let alone any self control, so they should stay away from sugar. When people ask me to help them lose weight, the first advice I usually give them is to stop eating industrial food products that are mostly made of highly processed sugar and bad fats. And when they don't follow that advice, they rarely succeed in the long run.    Of course you don't. You've been consuming sugar since you were a child, like most people. You associate it with feeling good.    It's not that I personally don't want milk. I just don't think it's a food product anyone other than a baby should be drinking, for the reasons mentioned above.    IMO drinking milk isn't needed in adults. It's good for babies who can't eat solid foods, but that's it. There are other sources of food that have the same protein, dietary fat and vitamin   mineral content, but without the added sugar. Take for example a cup of peas. It contains slightly more calories than a cup of milk and a little less fat, but more proteins, more vitamins and minerals, more dietary fibers, and much less sugar.    Alcohol slows down metabolism, reduces the synthesis of testosterone, reduces the synthesis of growth hormone during deep sleep, and depletes the body's reserves of vitamins and minerals, many of which are involved in various processes that relate to muscle tissue growth and maintenance. There is also evidence that it might reduce protein biosynthesis. Needless to say, if you're serious about changing your body, it should be a big no-no. If you're an athlete, it's even worse.    Love the use of the bed and trapdoors!   Something iconic about the game. A creeper, like you said, or a diamond, or a diamond sword. Maybe an Enderman.       Wow. This is truly amazing! Thank you!   Really nice use of the packed ice.    Holy mother of blocks.    Ok. Thanks!   Nope. Well it's not exactly a chandelier. But I wasn't sure what else to call it. I meant that thing made of light blue glass and sea lanterns.    Soon (I hope).       The technical definition of a village in Minecraft is actually a door.      Good tip. Thanks!       Got a world download?   Whoa! This is awesome! Thanks man! The things you can do with command blocks in 1.8 are crazy! A map maker's dream come true!   Thanks!   Is there a video out there for such a design? I've been looking but can't find.    Indeed.    Sorry I should have specified - yes you can, to answer your first question. The only thing that you can't do is the opposite, that is, using the snowball design for the Wither tree farm. For a cobblestone generator, you can use both designs. I'm not too sure which one is actually most efficient, though.    Different designs. The snowball design can also be used for the Wither tree farm. However, you would have to be planting saplings and creating snow at the same time in order for it to be AFK-able, which is impossible unless you are on a server and can control two accounts at once. However, in this case, since cobblestone is created on its own by water, lava and pistons, creating snow is the only thing that you have to be doing. In the case of the automatic smelting system I posted about yesterday, it's actually the reason why it cannot be fully automatic. You have to plant the saplings in order to create the charcoal, and attack a snowman in order to create cobblestone. If either process could be fully automated without requiring any action from the player, the entire process would become AFK-able. Maybe some day Mojang will make dispenser plant saplings, or make another block that does that. Who knows.   Dayum! This looks mighty fine good sir.    Even though I obviously don't know Notch personally, I always frankly thought he was just a weird funky dude. But I respect him for the incredible game he brought to life.    World download: http://www.mediafire.com/download/1dwooomofkg24b1/compact_cobble_farm.zip   Designs used for this farm:  [Cobblestone generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUfzi_A80pc)  [Snow generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlVZc4tQ8Yk)      Mojang have shown that they are able to make NPC craft items. I wonder if they expand upon that idea in the future and give us more crafting automation. This would open up a whole lot of possibilities.   For example, right now it's possible to make the process of transforming cobblestone into stone almost fully automatic. You have a Wither that breaks logs, the logs get sent into a charcoal machine, the surplus of which gets sent into an automatic smelting system. You also have another Wither breaking cobblestone blocks that get created by lava and water and then pushed in front of him with pistons. The only things that aren't automatic are providing the dispenser of the Wither-log-breaker system with bonemeal. But, in the future, if we have a mob that, for example, can craft bones into bonemeal, this process could become fully automatic.    Whoa.       No, but it sorts and collects them!   There is no need to prevent that. The Wither's upward and downward movements are limited by the ceiling above him and the hoppers below him respectively. And he will never try to break either because he's busy shooting his skulls into the Bedrock/Barrier/End portal frame block. The idea that you need something special to hold the Wither in place is a myth. You could literally place the Wither inside a square of iron blocks and as long as there's an unbreakable block in front of him and a hostile entity on the other side, he will never break out of the square of iron blocks.    Indeed!   :)   Nope. This design only works with oak, birch and jungle wood. The Zipkrowd design works flawlessly with all types of food except dark oak, but my understanding of redstone is not good enough to reproduce it and they haven't made a tutorial.    Dig out the Stronghold, replace the empty space with the farm itself, and make the Wither cage around the Portal blocks.    [There you go.](http://www.mediafire.com/download/vgzgat41y16ar3h/1_8_Tree_Farm.zip)   Well personally I have an Iron Golem and a witch hut farm, so it wasn't complicated at all to get all the resources necessary. But I see your point.       Maybe. Would have to test it before I can tell.    Lol. Your comment made me smile thanks! :)   Not sure what you mean. Can you elaborate?   It is. But you have to use the End portal frame blocks of a deactivated End portal.       Lol sorry I should have left out the '100%' part out. Simply 'almost fully automatic' is more appropriate.   End portal frame block is the only block that can be used to make a legitimate 100% safe Wither cage. The 3 other blocks that the Wither's blue skull attack cannot break are the End portal blocks (the actual portal, not the frame around it), the Barrier blocks and Bedrock. Although you could theoretically use Bedrock, it would be extremely impractical. Barriers blocks are not available in Survival. The actual End portal blocks won't be destroyed but the attack will still go through them.    Thanks! Pleasure's mine!   I probably didn't do it properly. I'm sorry.    Holy mother of villages      Exactly. I have a villager breeding   sorting system so getting emeralds and trading them for diamond tools is really easy. Also, I don't wear diamond armor because I find it boring that you're unkillable with enchantments. I mainly use Chainmail armor which looks cooler anyway. :)   I wanted to do this in my survival world, but it's a more complex design so I worked things out in Creative first and this was the result. Also, my world has a Nether fortress farm-powered smelting station that uses coal and blaze rod drops from Wither Skeletons and Blazes and I wanted to compare the efficiency between the two.    Why what? I'm so sorry I don't understand the question. :(   Why? I think it looks nice!   Well I did this in my survival single player world. :)    Oops! I fixed it! Sadly I can't fix it in the pic. :(   [There you go!](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6t0bbowre79uv/1_8_Tree_Farm)   Oh, I know about that. I'm just not sure of what would be a good website to upload it.    I would really love to, but I'm not sure how to do that. When I have some time to figure this out, I will.    Yeah. Fixed that. Thanks.    This farm contains:  [-An AFK-right click wood compressor for oak, birch   jungle wood logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I07oHxkwV8g)  -An AFK-right click 130 block/min cobblestone generator that can be mined with an Efficiency 5 diamond pickaxe and a Haste II beacon (basic design)  [-A 100% safe 1.8 Wither cage using Barrier blocks (Deactivated End portal frame blocks in a Stronghold can be used for Survival mode)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I07oHxkwV8g)  -[An infinite charcoal producing machine (only works with a constant input of wood logs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1BQAUl134)  [-An auto smelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xzbx7vFqqE)  [-2 item sorters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHjWYCDYJ4s)  You can also make a similar design using a witch hut, blaze or Nether fortress farm instead of the Wither Wood Breaker-Charcoal Maker combo used here. The only thing that you need is a renewable source of fuel.   [Here's a world download.](https://www.mediafire.com/#6t0bbowre79uv)       Mine uses charcoal. Saplings grow into trees, tree logs get pushed into a Wither cage, the Wither breaks the logs, then the logs get turned into charcoal in an infinite loop and the surplus charcoal is used to smelt the blocks.       Yes. It's not like making a Wither-based farm is easy anyway. It's already something that takes a lot of work and general game knowledge. It should be something that is hard to do, but that can be reliably done. That's just my opinion anyway.    Yes.Technically, it might be possible to make a design that uses the End portal blocks as a wall for the cage, although I can't tell for sure because I've never tried this. But in all cases it's extremely inconvenient to do that.    It is the only reason why Wither cage farms cannot exist in 1.8 Minecraft. The players from the Zipkrowd server, which is pretty much the most advanced server in the community when it comes to redstone and general game mechanics, have studied the Wither mechanics quite a bit, and they have concluded that no reliable Wither cage design is possible in 1.8. This is due to the fact that the Wither has a 0.1% chance of shooting out a blue skull when targeting an entity, and that blue skull destroys everything except bedrock, end portal and barrier blocks.   Redstonespire, formely from the Zipkrowd, has made a tutorial on how to build a tree log compressor, and his design is pretty much the only one that works reliably and compresses all 4 types of wood (dark oak excluded) without glitches or issues in 1.8. You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9-bHUmBbQ). Since all Wither cage designs are based on the idea of a Wither targeting an entity that it cannot kill, you can see how this is problematic.  He explains why he hasn't made a tutorial on how to build the compressor itself or how to connect it with a Wither cage: because, like I said, there is no way to make a reliable design in which the Wither won't have 0.1% chance of breaking out and destroying everything.  In light of evidence, I believe that if Mojang removed the Wither's blue skull attack, it would be beneficial for the community, in that it would allow the player to interact with the Wither a lot more in order to create cool farms and other things.    The [farm from the Zipkrowd server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNZsP36hqxk) is much faster than Tango Tek's. Literally twice faster, actually.  And you don't need to build it inside the spawn-chunks either, as it repairs itself.    Yeah. This really sucks. I have a friend who plays on a survival vanilla server, and on that server they said that since the Wither has a 0.1% chance of shooting out a blue skull when targeting an entity, there is literally no 100% survival design that can work reliably at the moment. So what they did is they placed a wall of bedrock using Creative mode in front of the Wither (Bedrock and End portal blocks are immune to the Wither's blue skull). They built everything rest in Survival, but still, this isn't 100% legit.    I don't know if anyone has thought of this before me, but I couldn't find any videos. I don't know if this is technically possible either, but I would say it is. The logs get broken by the Wither, then sent to a charcoal farm where they get turned into surplus charcoal, then the charcoal goes to an automatic furnace system. Meanwhile, the cobblestone from the cobblestone generator is sent to the automatic furnace system as well, thus cooking it into stone. You could put something heavy on your mouse's right click button, create cobblestone for an hour, then do the same thing for the Wither log breaker and go AFK while you're placing saplings for an hour. This way, you'd get massive amounts of stone with little effort.   Do you guys think this would work?    [Correct.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTSieOFzldk) The farm design in itself is not mine, of course. I just wanted to show off the aesthetics of the whole thing. :P    All you need now is a jukebox!    Looks yummy. What is it made of?       Whoa this is amazing! Thank you! Will most definitely be using! Also, I LOVE that it has some of the mod blocks included. Once again, amazing!    Just so you guys know, I haven't tested this yet. But I just came across it and thought it was very smart.       Yes. But that's just me.       Good to know, thanks!   I want to build one, but I hear there's a very small chance (less than 1%) of the Wither somehow not targetting the Iron Golem and breaking free from the cage? Is this true?    You don't need to do cardio in order to lose adipose tissue. What you need is a caloric deficit. You do cardio to - you won't believe it - improve your cardiovascular ability. I suggest you focus on maintaining a daily caloric deficit and lifting weights. Especially the deficit part. Good luck!      Thanks!   It is though. That's the reason why we are the dominant species on this planet. Instead of adapting to the environment, we adapt the environment to our needs. Humans have thrived on almost every continent and piece of land for thousands of years.    Similarly, why aren't there villages in every biome? Evolutionary speaking, humans can adapt to any climate/environment; this should be true in Minecraft as well. I think having snowy/jungle/Mesa themed villages would be really cool. Also, villagers could be trading different things based on the climate/environment of their biome.    It's a question that I've been asking myself for a while. My understanding of redstone mechanics is limited, but I know that you can make things move on their own with redstone, pistons and slime blocks. I was wondering if it would possible to make a Wither cage move on its own and, this way, automatically break and collect virtually any block that the Wither can destroy?    Great idea. Thanks.    Haha me and Etho are the only ones. :D   Fair enough. To be honest I had a double chest full of Endstone and felt inspired. That's mainly why I did it lol. Inspiration is a weird thing, so you take it as it comes.    What would you have replaced the Endstone with? I just think it's very fitting in this case, but I could be wrong.    H... How? I don't even. This is beyond my builder's understanding. Explanation please.       Nice beginner gains man! You did a good job on the training. However, you won't be able to get away that easily with eating 'pretty much whatever' in the future, you might wanna know...    Right now, I'm cutting so:  -Clenbuterol Hydrochloride  -Ephedrine Hydrochloride (when I'm not taking clen)  -Creatine Monohydrate  -Omega-3 fish oil  -Multivitamin  -5-HTP  -Aspirin (when I'm not taking Clen)  -Potassium tablets  -Taurine capsules  -BCAA supplement  -Caffeine tablets  -Glutamine  -Beta alanine  -Whey protein (not really a supplement but yeah)      Lol maybe (I wish:D)   Thanks!   Hum, maybe, but what? Sure sand would work, but wouldn't that be too much sand?   Haha I didn't mean in the End, like the dimension lol. I meant 'in the end' like 'ultimately' 'at the end of the day'. :D But on that note I think Endstone can look good with a few things... In fact I've used it as a building block in the past, I just can't remember for what or give you a specific example atm, will edit when I do.   	173

 One can show that every developed country was aware of the risk of harm from continued emissions, as early as 1992 and in a number of cases even earlier.

The Washington-based research organization did a review of terror attacks on US soil since Sept. 11, 2001 and found that most of them were carried out by radical anti-government groups or white supremacists. Almost twice as many people have died in attacks by right-wing groups in America than have died in attacks by Muslim extremists. Of the 26 attacks since 9/11 that the group defined as terror, 19 were carried out by non-Muslims. Yet there are no white Americans languishing inside the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. And there are no drones dropping bombs on gatherings of military-age males in the country's lawless border regions. Attacks by right-wing groups get comparatively little coverage in the news media. Most people will struggle to remember the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed six people in 2012. A man who associated with neo-Nazi groups carried out that shooting. There was also the married couple in Las Vegas who walked into a pizza shop and murdered two police officers. They left a swastika on one of the bodies before killing a third person in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Such attacks are not limited to one part of the country. In 2011, two white supremacists went on a shooting spree in the Pacific Northwest, killing four people.   /r/postnationalist   finally some good news   its too far to walk but only 1 subway stop away though, right? wont i be kicking myself doing a 1 subway stop transfer every morning?    Rather corporate control than government..   The TPP brings together 12 strong westernized countries!   Big  corps already dominate our political system..   oh pls u just dont like my message   cmon , spending limits are just limits on free speech   is it?   CANADIAN IP LAW IS ALREADY SUPER STRICT   im banned from /r/history too.. they really dont like questioning the narrative    yea reddit loves killing isis members, bans?   the 12 countries involved in the TPP are all rich and our friends. why the fearmongering?   because its a trade agreement.. and voters ruin trade   how can u argue its a secret and a train wreck at the same time    the American worker is deluded.   yea.. so what area do u recommend looking.. walkup is no way.. mm.. beijing is fucking pricy!   Australia already has brutal copyright laws...   They're right    Wow.. Ya just for housing    I want a 2bdr    Lol no    Fuck you    Why are people here so concerned with government power now? Let it go l..   Let it pass.. The biggest complaints don't even apply to Americans..   Appeal to authority fallacy    Anyone talking about "jobs" is just arguing for national socialism    Why do Canadians oppose a trade treaty that includes so many of our good friends and allies?   Looking at this list of countries why does reddit oppose the TPP so bad.. It's all allies    Typical TPP scaremongering    Well I support the TPP bug hate politics mods haha    /r/postnationalist ~    /r/postnationalist   Wait a minute.. This  isn't /r/conspiracy    In China everyone cheats    Who said /r/china likes Muslims?

The problem is our love of punishment.   nationalism = the state   are the states and the corporations not already married? TPP just makes the state an even weaker partner   Does corporate America have bad days lol   how can u prove that is for the TPP..   heh well the picture IS all white people~   Good!!   People never say why they are opposed    Maybe if they had a big population..   Cmon Iceland has a good 200 citizens..    Democracy exists now? I love how /r/conspiracy pretends the government is working just to attack a trade deal that brings people together    And that's different from American culture how??   A United globe is the future. /r/postnationalist    Because America is too stupid to vote for it    How is the TPP fascism?   The real conspiracy is how many anti-Tpp articles this sub gets without a single pro TPP article    It'd simultaneously a secret but being attacked on specifics?   Trade leads to peace.. Nationalist protectionism leads to war    Why does removing government power make something fascism?   Ya it's like people think the corporations don't run it already.. At least the TPP will be good for trade    why is /r/conspiracy so distrusting of governments except when it comes to the TPP removing their sovereignty..   AnythingGoes   thats because your chinese accents are so bad..   westerners always deny refugees because it costs too much money..   whats the greens stance?   And very CLASSist    Didn't the Constitution specifically forbid military deployment in the USA?    Because people who dislike the TPP never mention specifics    @freemigration   /r/postnationalist   yea thats the other side of the equation   Oops ;(   /r/postnationalist supports refugees  why are we paying to turn them away when we could throw them in the mines ~ (not 100% serious but)   come recruit in /r/postnationalist    bit different than usual posts but hope u guys like it   Given the kind of low bandwidth conversation we often have about immigrants ('assimilation' vs. 'multiculturalism'); the title could be a touch misleading to today's audience. The author is arguing that there is not an indigenous American culture (Indians aside) and that immigrant cultures have helped to create a fertile, pioneering spirit that is the genius of the US. What is believed to be indigenous is a shallow Anglophilia and a coarse transient popular culture. Forcing immigrants to adopt these "rudimentary" characteristics would lead to stagnation in the US. "It is not the Jew who sticks proudly to the faith of his fathers and boasts of that venerable culture of his who is dangerous to America, but the Jew who has lost the Jewish fire and become a mere elementary, grasping animal. It is not the Bohemian who supports the Bohemian schools in Chicago whose influence is sinister, but the Bohemian who has made money and has got into ward politics. Just so surely as we tend to disintegrate these nuclei of nationalistic culture do we tend to create hordes of men and women without a spiritual country, cultural outlaws, without taste, without standards but those of the mob."   They are in there, often unnoticed. The words that have become part of everyday English. Loot, nirvana, pyjamas, shampoo and shawl; bungalow, jungle, pundit and thug.  What are the roots, and routes, of these Indian words? How and when did they travel and what do their journeys into British vernacular  and then the Oxford English Dictionary  tell us about the relationship between Britain and India?  Long before the British Raj  before the East India Company acquired its first territory in the Indian subcontinent in 1615  South Asian words from languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam and Tamil had crept onto foreign tongues. One landmark book records the etymology of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases. Compiled by two India enthusiasts, Henry Yule and Arthur C Burnell, Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India was published in 1886. The poet Daljit Nagra described it as not so much an orderly dictionary as a passionate memoir of colonial India. Rather like an eccentric Englishman in glossary form.   do you have any sources/figures on this effect? im interested in it  id say foreign investment is a good thing overall but i can see this creating resentment surely   actually this type does have some mounted sub-types, I recommend OP mount at least one for testing purposes   if fighting games had a business model more like League, they would keep on top of patches and updates etc .. would be great   I responded to you before!

 Ah you mean this one (sorry for shitty Instagram) http://imgur.com/13jsmOn   http://imgur.com/4tbM0AP    Tunnicliffe was touted as a rising star, not to the level of Pogba but people thought he would be able to do a job for us as a destroyer which we were sorely lacking in at the time.   I don't know how many matches until he proved his worth because I don't watch Juve that often but as someone who goes to about 80% of our youth and reserve games (at home) I can tell you Pogba didn't deserve to be getting games for the first team. He got put in because of his complaints and when that happened didn't actually do anything to cement himself as a first teamer. We couldn't give in to him otherwise every youth player would do it like is happening now with us and pereira who once again is playing for the reserves and feels he deserves to play for the first team and won't sign a new contract but he doesn't deserve to be in the first team as he is playing quite average himself but no doubt if he leaves and starts playing well then it will be the usual "oh United made a huge mistake"  You argue obviously he was ready but with Juve he is in a midfield 3 where as with us he was in a 2 so maybe that's why he couldn't shine with us, maybe that's why he was able to look so good for you because he plays in a formation we never would have usually under fergie  He wanted a chance that's true but he can't just say he wants a chance and then continue to be bang average playing against people that were inferior to him, he should have been tearing people apart to prove he was ready  Also don't know who's down voting you and don't really no why, you're just putting your opinion across   Then he should have played better for the reserves that year instead of just moaning about not playing, the year before he alongside a youth team that consisted of Morrison, tunnicliffe, keanes etc won the fa youth cup. Pogba played well for us in that but still wasn't our best player in the kids hat year, tunnicliffe rivalled him in midfield and Morrison was the standout. The next year (where he complained about not starting) he was absolutely average for the reserves playing poorly at times and just doing enough so why would we play him when he wasn't putting any effort in? Tunnicliffe was playing better and we didn't play him either and he wasn't signing a new contract so why play him? The times he did come in the first team he didn't set the world alight and yes he was only off the bench but he still had time to try something and he didn't do anything   After the great battle of the wounded knee massacre a lot of towns knew that there would be trained soldiers who would need a new job after being kicked out of the military due to severe knee injuries, so they contacted the empire to try and get a job for them with health benefits that included things like physio. This offer looked good to the returning soldiers and boosted the economy and the towns now had trained soldiers protecting them.   Why that battle targeted knees however is still a mystery...  EDIT - Sorry the source is my friends dad called Thorin who was at the great battle of the wounded knee massacre and is now a guard in Riften   Which God? Several Gods?  Was it Gorr the God Butcher?   Wahey. He was handing a check over as he had raised about 25 grand for the hospital.   Met Michael Owen when he came to our work (I work at Manchester Royal) and that was ok, seemed a bit dull and like he couldn't be bothered.   Then met The King Denis Law as well and he was amazing kept me talking about football, got pictures with him and just an all round great bloke and a pleasure to talk too   I don't know what he would learn, I'm just giving an opinion. I'm basing my claims on the fact the finding stuff out in 6 months would be easier than 3 so he could have more chance of exploiting weaknesses   Would give him more time to get better materials, maybe research supes a bit more and find out about red sons etc. 3 months he might scratch the surface of these but an extra 3 would be a lot better   Build a suit that could possibly beat superman   To cook for themselves on a small budget, just in case.

 Last post and I'm done discussing this with you. By the very definition it's not clickbait.   How is it clickbait? Clickbait is something that makes you click with the sole purpose of driving up ad revenue.   THe article is from the Smithsonian Magazine which is hardly a clickbait site.   The story on plastic cells was particularly cool to me. At what point do we simply start replacing all of our aging cells with artificial ones?   The story on the plastic cells was really cool. Makes me wonder at what point are we simply going to replace all of our parts as they wear out.      The source for the boundaries seems to be this:  http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/downloads/united_states.html     Stunning example. Yours?   Sorry, try this   http://movies.benschmidt.org   If you want to see how U.S. counties have changed over time then this is your vid. You'll need to show it full screen to really see the changes.  Most telling to me is just how fluid the west has been . I assume part of that has to do with population growth but I wonder what other factors there are.   Search for trends in the dialogue of thousands of movie and TV shows, based on subtitles from Open Subtitles Bookworm is like a lot of other word frequency sites. But unlike most, it directly incorporates links to every text searched, so you can actually see what drives changes; and it lets you customize the corpus so you can exclude texts that aren't interesting to you.  This particular instance looks at movies and TV shows. Genre, location and language information from the Internet Movie Database textfiles. Click to see the movies/TV shows where the matches are found. For some caveats, explanations, and examples, see the accompanying blog post.   It's interesting seeing the trend over time of words. For example I put in "horse" and "car" to see how the trend looked over time. Unsurprisingly the use of the word "car" has gone up and "horse" has gone down.         I still don't think that it could penetrate the side. Armor thickness only describes part of the characteristics of modern armor. Modern armor isn't just steel like tanks of old.   If it hit the rear then I could imagine it could disable it.  But, as mentioned below, there's little chance of a WW2 tank getting the draw on a modern tank with it's sophisticated targeting systems.    I don't think that's true. The depleted uranium armor on the M1 has a a projected thickness of an estimated thickness of about 610mm. The 8.8cm KwK main gun of the Tiger I could only penetrate 138mm of armor at 100 meters. It could only penetrate 171mm at 100 meters.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_KwK_36  Edit, the Tiger II main gun could only penetrate a max of 202mm. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_KwK_43  	14
 H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide. It is different than the chlorine dioxide (ClO2) being discussed here, particularly if your father is diluting it.   I don't know if it is safe or effective though in COPD, although "The American Cancer Society states that "there is no scientific evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a safe, effective or useful cancer treatment"[53] The therapy is not approved by the U.S. FDA."     yea it's just horrible.  The b*stard that is selling the stuff claims on his site "... in one year since the first book was published more than 200,000 Americans are using The Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)."

Mar 11, 2015 4:26am EDT   (Reuters) - Russia is ready to hold talks on a new agreement to control conventional arms in Europe, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday, after Russia announced the end of its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.  "We are ready to look at the possibility and carry out corresponding talks on a new agreement which would adequately address new realities... and take into account the interests of the Russian Federation," Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the ministry's department on arms control, told the Interfax news agency.

What /u/jewelsteel said makes sense.   I want to add though that I withdraw from people when things in my life get tough. It's just what I do. This could be loss of job, financial difficulties, almost anything particularly worrisome.   I'm fairly pedestrian, so I'm betting there are plenty of others that do the same.  I think it is in fact that, as per u/jewelsteel, "But I NEED to put all of that attention in myself, to improve my mental health and make me happier."       especially when they died, and one wakes up confused as to whether they are really dead or not, after having spent time together in dream time.

Type II: Excision of the prepuce and clitoris together with partial or total excision of the labia minora.  Type III: Infibulation. Excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching together of the two cut sides, to varying degrees.  Type IV: Pricking, piercing, incision, stretching, scraping, or other procedures harming the clitoris or labia, or both.  Types I, II and III of FGM/C present severe health consequences that have been well documented by several authors. The immediate health complications include shock, haemorrhage, infections and psychological consequences [11-13]. The long term health risks consist of chronic pain, infections, cheloids formation, primary infertility, birth complications, danger to the new born and psychological consequences [13-18]. Even FGM/C types I and II, sometimes considered as more innocuous, may involve severe health complications. For example, they have been reported to provoke unequivocal complications like shock, haemorrhage, urogenital complications [12], obstetric complications [18] and sexual dysfunction [15].  Despite the documented adverse effects of FGM/C, a recent review article states that its overall prevalence has declined very little [19]."   /r/redditisland ?

This paper seem to place the possible origin outside of china (http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Black-Death.pdf)  "Infection and migration Spread of the black death in Europe.   The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.[15]    Nestorian graves dating to 1338-9 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgizstan have inscriptions referring to plague and recent investigations by the Russian archeologist Chwolson show a high incidence rate and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which they could easily have spread to China and India.[16]   In October 2010, medical geneticists confirmed that the plague came from China.[4] In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with plague arriving soon after. The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60 million.[17] The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.[18]  The disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.[19] By the end of 1346 reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".[20]  Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants.   The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.[21] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death."

While I agree that this does seem a hoax post, I think your presumption that a 70 yo will be unable to understand what trees is after 1 day on reddit is mistaken.  I am not quite 70 (yet) but got off the defaults on ..think it was the 2nd day on site. I stumbled on trees (which I am not subbed to) in some roundabout way ( I do sub to /r/marijuanaenthusiasts though so maybe I was looking up an actual tree? lol idk).  70 years olds   those near/aapprox that age are often active on many sites, so the lingo thing is moot. I know a few personally.  Ageism is so unattractive.   "One girl said: "I turned up at the police station at 2/3am, blood all over me, soaked through my trousers to the crotch. They dismissed it as me being naughty, a nuisance."  Another told the authorities: "The Asian men felt they ran Oxford. That was exciting. People were afraid of them. I felt protected. People respected them."  Fear is not respect.

 original guide?   Holy Fuck! I have a friend with that last name. Oh myy.    oh i was assuming it was $60  It says on the box. It is easy to see. It is on the top of the box. http://www.bestbuy.ca/multimedia/Products/500x500/103/10341/10341740.jpg   At walmart it is $40 new with code. How much did it cost a Gamestop?   That is exactly what I was wondering...   Nerd3 crashed the site! I didn't know of the game before him. I would like the fans to know we are sorry! xD   Outer Wilds even!   No DLC if pre-owned. Even if the person didn't use them. I only saw New Day One at walmart. TBH You should probably take it in a get your money back, then save a little to get the preorder bonus if you want it.    Pick me!   I didn't preorder, I didn't have the money at the time, I really wanted the exclusives. I got them, legit, here is how. If you don't have the game yet, great, if you do, you need some extra money. Anyway here's the point. At Walmart, because they don't know how games work, you can still get the Day 1 edition! The code works too! It is valid until 2099, so you'll be fine.  EDIT: Sorry! Only console!! :(    You know why he did this? To show her that he had been wanting to marry her for a fucking year.

The container has these tear able flaps. What are they for? Does anyone know?   Oh, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for telling me. This will help me a lot. xD   We've all seen these messages, but can someone explain to me what they mean   Yep, because there sure were lots of black people in medieval times. Don't even get me started on how many important roles females had! That post is like saying 12 Years a Slave is racist because there was slavery.   The swipe and the hand laser always gets me.

He knew that to begin with he had a 50% chance of being right, or 2/4. Then he knew A was red and that he only had a 1/4 chance of being red, and a 3/4 chance of being blue. Prisoner C also had a 75% chance of being red since when B left, who was blue, he knows there is only one more blue. so the 50% became 75%. Correct me if I'm wrong   So sad, please don't.

So he will overlook the use by the rebels just to save face? Are you ok with this? To me the man doesnt have much credibility left. And if he condones the use of Sarin by the Rebels, but not the regime, then he will lose even more credibility. His red line should be for anyone using Sarin. This isn't a game. I think we just need to stay out of it. Its not our fight. Are we going to have to go to war with these rebels in 15 years after arming them to the teeth?   What about the UN having reports it was the Rebels that used the sarin..?

             Well, those shelves have all the SF teen dystopian fiction like Hunger Games and Divergent, right? Basically just YA fiction has taken over shelf space.    Right?   The other thing funny about these articles is they get written for every genre. "SF has triumphed!" "Superhero comics have triumphed!" "Crime thriller have triumphed!"   Okay, guys, everything is winning!   What I posted in the r/books thread:    I like ASOIAF and a lot of other things mentioned here, but honestly this feels like an article that's written every 5 years. "Is Game of Thrones the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Harry Potter the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Peter Jackson's LOTR the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Terry Pratchett being the best-selling UK author in the 90s the triumph of fantasy?" etc.   Basically, there's always one or two fantasy books/TV shows/films that break out into the mainstream every couple years. That's been true for a loooong time. But the genre itself never provides a lot of popular products at the same time.   I even specifically remember a lot of "Fantasy has taken over YA for good!" articles during Harry Potter/His Dark Materials, but then like 5 years later it was all dystopian SF (Hunger Games/Divergent/etc.) and now it's dominated by sappy realism ala John Green and Rainbow Rowell. Basically, cycles move quickly.  Fantasy has been considered pretty legitimate for a while now in the literary world. Not sure there is much new in 2015 other than one popular TV show.    because he writes so quickly and doesn't spend that much time editing them. I like him (see username), but, yeah. You publish 1-2 books a year, they are going to be more hit or miss than a writer who spends 5-10 years on every novel.    This is a really common question here, but honestly ideas are a dime a dozen. It's the execution that always is the hardest and what counts the most.

Basically, cycles move quickly.    Yes, it's nonsense. The problems with all of these articles is that the numbers are just basically made up, because the actual numbers are all over the map. Trad publishing debuts can range anywhere from a mere 3k to 2 million in advances (there was a literary debut novel that got 2 million a couple years ago). Self-publishing authors mostly earn zero dollars, but those who do earn can range from 1 dollar a month to, who knows, 400k a month.   Without knowing the work itself or the market you are looking at, there's no way to know what your potential money will be.            Oh sorry it didn't come up in search, must have been submitted with stuff on the end of the actual link         haha. Maybe the "walkers" refers to those things old people use   That all makes sense, but winter is coming was just my shorthand for how much winter and the white walkers are hyped up as the major threat (and I think they still will be in books 6/7) yet take forever to happen.   It's not just the starks saying it. The first books have everyone talking about needing to prepare for winter, get grain stored away, etc.    I mean honestly, I haven't read enough of all three to make a big case here. Only 2-3 books from each.       Of those two, Dostoevsky because he is more dark and existential (but Gogol over both)   Right? I mean, are you telling me Italo Calvino and George Saunders aren't cool, entertaining, and fun to read?    Dunno, seems self-publishers are almost all reliant on Amazon which has been known to change terms and restructure algorithims at the drop of a hate. Didn't they slash royalty rates on audiobooks recently with basically no notice?    All I'm saying is that Book 1 made it seem like winter (and white walkers) would be the main battle the characters would face over the series. Instead, it's barely even talked about until the ends of books 4/5. Just kind of funny, not a big criticism. It's like if LOTR started out talking about Sauron and the rings then forgot about both until halfway through Return of the King   ***SPOILER ALERT***  haha come on, the winter of snow piling up hundreds of feet, everyone being locked down, the white walkers finally coming.... none of that has happened yet.   And even the stuff you are talking about only happens at the VERY end of the 4/5 simultaneous books.       Something like a million books get self-published each year, but only a few thousand novels get published through actual presses. So, yeah, odds are most people calling themselves authors are just selfpublished.    If you don't think that there are lots of entertaining books with cool stuff in them shelved in literary fiction, and lots of wanky bullshit in the genre sections, you just haven't read many books.          ** SPOILER ALERT ***  lol right but that means we won't actually see any real winter until book 6. Book 5 is still people preparing for it.    Kind of like when Martin told us "Winter is coming!" in book 1 then, lol, April Fools, it doesn't even happen until book 6... maybe!               Well, by that logic nothing should ever cost anything since some things are free. Youtube and so on are supported in part by ads though.     To me it just feels as if the pricing of audiobooks (and also books to a certain extent) is stuck in some kind of premium category of entertainment, while it today with everything being digital it is not really different from any other form of entertainment.  People say this on here a lot but I don't understand it. Books operate basically the exact same as other mediusm as far as I can tell.   * You have Netflix for movies, and you have Oyster for books at same price.   * You can pay 20 something for a DVD of a film or 15 for a CD of music and you can pay 15 or so for a paper book (more for fancy hardcover).   * You can get a digital DVD/CD/ebook for a few bucks cheaper than the physical version.   * You can watch some limited content free on YouTube, and there is tons of free fiction on web journals.   All that said, an audiobook subscription service seems like a good idea. An audio counterpart to Netflix/Hulu/Oyster makes sense to me.    Are you saying you read 90% of the book, but not the last chapter?     also more expensive than going and seeing a movie.  huh? Most movies are 2 hours and most movie tickets cost more than 8 bucks. Also, most audiobooks are more like $2 an hour, and movie tickets are waaaaaay more than $4 bucks at least where I live.    $4 an hour is really cheap for entertainment. Movie tickets cost more than that. Concert tickets cost way more. A professional sporting event costs way way more.   As to why it costs more than a paperbook.... not sure. Probably because the voice actor has to be paid too.    Goodreads. Amazon tends to have ever few reviews, unless the book is very famous, and has more scam and fake reviews.   But I read professional book reviews over either.       I think the first 70 pages or so are easily the hardest part of IJ. If you push through, it gets easier to read. The book is intentionally confusing at first (it starts at the chronological end of the narrative)  But if you don't like it, no reason to force yourself to read.          Impressed that you read every one!   (I'd rank Marlon James and VaderMeer much higher personally)            Depends what you mean by "common." Mandarin has the most speakers by total number, but you'd be far more likely to run into an English speaker in most countries in the world. All of the Mandarin speakers are concentrated in China and a couple neighboring countries, while English is the primary or secondary language of a huge number of countries and more or less the "global language" still.    You should read everything in the language it was written in if you have the choice... meaning if you speak that language.   Otherwise read in the language you are most comfortable with.          Ideas, in books, come in the form of words. Changing words absolutely changes the meaning of ideas.    My point is that it's very easy to believe that people will make apps that do more than just censor a few curse words.    I can think of a couple recent mainstream adult novels that were anthropomorphic  * The Bees by Laline Paull (came out last year, about, well, bees)  * Albert of Adelaide by Howard L. Anderson (2012, about Australian animals)  I haven't read either so can't comment on the quality, but both were literary fiction published by big houses. Clearly an anthropomorphic novel CAN be sold. (As others note, it's even more common to find SF/F books with anthropomorphism.) I'm sure it is harder to sell, but on the other hand there are less people doing them      More importantly, Clean Reader can censor words, but it can't censor ideas.  Why on earth do you think that future apps won't do this?   There were news stories about a woman who rewrote Harry Potter to be about Christianity instead of wizards and witches, removing all the "evil" witchcraft.   I could easily see future apps being designed to filter out ideas or to cut out portions of a novel that the app makers don't like. Say, The Jungle, which ends with a pro-socialist message. Surely some conservative would be down to read that book with the ending cut off, and a future app might oblige him.    Great book!               Even if he isn't comparing his exact work, he's saying the style of writing he prefers is superior to another style   Except this is one writer saying his style of writing is better than another writers.    I would say the hallmark of bad writing is being boring. Most of the other stuff people say isn't true. By which I mean, there are great books without round characters, great books without plots, great books that are heavily stylized and/or with very little style, yada yada. Any of that kind of thing can be done as long as the work is interesting.   A hallmark of mediocore writing is that it's not memorable, to me at least. So a book that's interesting superficially while reading, but which you never think about again isn't really "good" writing in my book. (for me most "airport fiction" / beach read books fall into that category).     My idea is "simple": after an author dies his books must be given for free in digital editions, while the physical copies must be sold at a price that covers the costs of the production, plus an income for the editors and all the work that is behind it.   Isn't this basically how things already work except instead of "right at death" it happens after copyright runs out. Once that happens, Gutenberg and other places give it out for free digitally and cheap paperback companies like Dover Thrift sell paper books for like 1-3 bucks.   Basically you just want a shorter copyright?    digital distribution doesn't have costs..   This really isn't true. But again, once copyright is finished places like Project Gutenberg make free digital copies.   I'd like to know if my idea is in some way feasible  A post on reddit isn't going to change international copyright laws    While James Joyce is vastly superior to Coelho so...         I'm not sure what to think of this, a lot depends on if the company HELPS you crowdfund.   Meaning, do they have a dedicated base of users who you wouldn't have access to otherwise? Or are they bascially asking you to do your own kickstarter and then saying they will take a cut if it works?    Unless you only read books by Stephen King and JK Rowling, most of the authors you read are probably not making much money. Most authors do not earn enough to live on from writing even if they are best selling authors.    i don't see how writing a book is any different from completing an album.   I agree, but aren't most paperback books about the price of an album? And much cheaper than most concert tickets?   That's really rare though. Most ebooks from big publishers on amazon are between 4 and 8 bucks from what I've seen.  I agree that ebooks should be a few dollars cheaper than print books, but I think they basically always are. If the paper book cost less it's probably because Amazon or whatever site you were on discounted the paper book but not the ebook.    Wealthy people have such an advantage because they can afford to purchase all the new books that come out at full price.  There are more public domain books than you can read in a life  There are more free articles online than you can read in a life  There are libraries in every town with free books     You dont have to be writing high art to not want it censored.  Question: would you be fine having your work with your name in it sold through an app that inserted racial epithets throughout?   Some people actually do have principles and beliefs and care about more than just sales   Okay, I didn't realize you were going off about DRM. A few things:   - "authors" do NOT have the power to stop any shop selling their goods, unless they are self-publishers I guess. Authors sign contracts with publishers, who sign contracts with distributors, who sell to retailers. As I noted before, many authors wanted to pull books from Amazon during the recent Amazon fight but couldn't because they'd signed those rights away.   - In general, I'm not a fan of DRM. But DRM is hardly unique to "authors." All digital products can, and frequently do, have DRM. Conversely, many publishers don't use DRM at all.    In other words, authors can stop their ebook from being sold by "White Power Books" for the same reason there is no such thing as a 'used ebook store'.   Well, no. As I noted above, authors sign contracts. If you sign with a publisher who sells books to White Power Cafe or ebooks to WhitePowerCafe.com, you are shit out of luck really. All you can do is complain and ask for them to be pulled, but you can't legally make that happen.    Let me ask you: would you think authors would be wrong to complain about an app that inserted sexist or racist terms into their work? Would they be bullies for asking the app makers to not do that?    Would it be bullying if the service in question was, say, a same-sex dating app and the media firestorm was from the conservative press?  If someone developed an app that inserted Satanic references, gay marriage, and, what else do Christians hate these days?, global warming into Christian novels, and Christian authors got upset about it I would not say they were bullies. I mean, I think it would be pretty funny because gay marriage is cool and climate change is real, but conservative authors would be in their rights to say they don't want the app used on their books.    If you can change the names and none of the logic and up with a radically different conclusion, then maybe you should reconsider how honestly you've arrived at your opinions.  Haha, dude, whatever our disagreements here, your "change the names" example was COMPLETELY unrelated. Here Christian conservatives are attempting to change the words of artists and the artists are upset. That has nothing to do with a same-sex dating app that Christians hate because they are homophobic.   No author is saying that all books should have profanity! No one is saying that Christian books shouldn't be allowed to exist!   It seems like you have a problem with words, because this is not "bullying" and these people are not "victims."    Who is calling for new regulations?   Why do these threads always turn into silly straw men arguments?   There are plenty of things that are within someone's legal rights that they rightly get criticized for. What it really seems like is that people like you think that everyone should shut up and never ever speak out against racism, sexism, censorship, or anything else.    All the whining about "reader's rights to their property" is so absurd in this case to me.   Look, there are one million books published a year. There is a near infinite back catalog of books published in human history. You don't like a book because of the language? Don't buy it! Buy any of the millions of books that don't use those words. You're "rights" are not being infringed that a book exists with words you don't like!   This simply isn't a problem that needs fixing! Go read a different book. Jebus.     The fact is that bread companies don't have the power to stop any shop from selling their goods. This is because bread companies don't have monopoly rights on their bread.  What on earth are you talking about?   A bread company absolutely has the same rights as an author/publisher. They can enter into contracts with retail shops, or they can not.   I seriously don't understand what you think is going on with books? What's different?   p.s. authors do NOT have the power to stop any shop from selling their goods, they have to honor the contracts they enter into. Many authors wanted to pull books from Amazon but couldn't because they signed contracts, for example.)    You would be a monopolist if you had the power to stop "White Power Cafe", but because you don't have that power you aren't a monopolist.  Again, authors do NOT have that power. Even in this case, it was authors complaining that got the Clean App to take them off. They didn't legally force the app to stop it. IF there was a legal basis for it to be stopped, it would be on some intellecutal property grounds that would apply to other goods as well!  You seem to be very confused about the situation here.    If you have legitimate reasons to not read a book--such as actual PTSD, which is a real thing not just "feeling icky" at curse words--then you teacher will almost certainly give you some alternative. Teachers are normally pretty sensitive to that kind of thing.   if you don't actually have any real pyschological need to avoid a book, but just don't want to see words like "penis" or "piss" then your teacher will likely roll their eyes at you.   Again, I don't see what this has to do with Clean Reader. Trigger warnings are for things that can trigger PTSD. This app does not scrub out rape scenes or violent war scenes. It just changes curse words and some body part terms.     But as another redditor mentioned, what would happen if you do have a serious psychological issue that multiple psychologists/psychiatrists/etc have proven, should you still be forced to read it?  The issue here is with a teacher FORCING you to read the book, not with the author writing the scene.   I think trigger warnings and what literature can or should be taught in school is an interesting question, but it really doesn't have anything to do with this app (unless you are suggesting that seeing the word "piss" instead of "pee" could cause serious psychological damage...)    Authors demanding "My book, my rules, and that includes my words. ALL of them." is no different than any monopolist making outrageous demands for using their service, because they have the power to do so  Sorry it's... totally fucking different on every single level.   First off, this app sold ebooks through it. So authors wanted their books pulled from a store that was promoting religious censorship.   Are you telling me that if I sold muffins and didn't want my muffins sold at a White Power cafe, that'd be a "monopolist"?   Or if I was a rubber band maker and asked for my rubber bands not to be sold through a openly anti-gay office supply company that it would be "horrid" of me?   Really? If I make rubber bands and don't want a company to stamp "fuck [some racial group" on them and sell them, then I can't tell them not to use my rubber bands without being some evil, "horrid" monopolist? I have a hard time believing you really think this.     But authors have the right to not sell their work through an app that censors it. So it's different than the sharpie. It's more like authors demanding their books be pulled from a Nazi bookstore.                Well, I disagree. Not that Martin can't do that, but that having "rules" actually changes anything. Plenty of books with strict magic "rules" still find plenty of ways to have cheap plot twists, overly powerful spells, or other such things.    I'm not sure how you are using deus ex machina. The term, as I understand it, is, to quote wikipedia,    "a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object. "  Stoneheart is unexpected, surely, but she doesn't solve a problem. It's not like Ned Stark is the hero of ASOIAF and just when you think he can't possibly survive, Stoneheart revives and saves his life. She's just a weird character and plot twist, but she isn't a deus ex machina. (Hell, so far she barely even impacts the plot at all. Just kills a bunch of no-names)   Anything, or at least any magic system, can be used as a deus ex machina. (Rowling, or whoever, can easily just have Dumbledore cast some crazy spell, or if she decides a plot point needs a certain kind of spell can just write in a silly scene where that spell is mentioned earlier. There's just as much freedom there.)  But where do you think Martin uses it that way?    Honestly, ASOIAF.   I like   A) that it's mysterious and not spelled out as bluntly as most books  B) involves sacrifice. Almost all the magic seems to be some from of "blood magic" where people have to die or at least get injured for spells to work.   C) Competing (i.e., ice magic, fire magic, warging, etc. all seem to come from different groups and different religions)  D) Rare.       But let's be clear. "Viewed" here means how it can be sold and read, not the "interpretation" or "meaning."   I'd say it was fucked up if a book store cut a novel in half and only sold half the novel to people. Maybe you DGAF if the author wants the novel sold in full, but I side with the author there.    You are correct. There is zero "fault" with an author not wanting their book rewritten by dumb parents. Quit literally zero.    Oh please, the only thing slapping anyone in the face are idiotic christians thinking it's their job to censor novels   Not really, because this app promotes itself for children, basically it's for parents to censor their kid's reading   I'm not advocating for DRM, but you can still respect an author's work without there being a law or DRM to enforce it.   Buuuut you pay for a book, physical or e, not a word doc. And this isn't a user going through and blacking out words in their personal copy, it's more like a company that sells books in a way that authors don't consent to.    I've increasingly found no use for my e-reader. I prefer paper for a dozen reasons, but I'm happy to e-read... however, I have an Oyster app on my phone that's much more convenient than lugging a Kindle around. Then when I'm at home, I have paper books.   Just no use for a Kindle except really long trips I guess.          Very much agree with this. Authorial consent matters. And this extends to shit like pirating people's books without permission.    Thanks! I try, I thought this one was good and adjuncting is a big issue especially for writers            Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is all that counts.    She is one of the best short storie writers ever in my opinion         I would say: best idea!     Yeah, it just becomes a really narrow echo-chamber kind of thing from what I've seen.   I do use Goodreads to track my own books, but I don't review or share or comment.    Yeah I think it's a bad trend, at least for me. I also think it makes everyone read the same things. You want to be "in on the conversation" so everyone buys the same books and has the same opinions...      Also, EVERY single editor and agent who has worked in the industry for any amount of time has passed over a ton of books that ended up doing well. That's the nature of the game.   Granted, Harry Potter is an exceptionally huge miss, but you are going to have a lot of them.              I know a few people who are making serious money as self-published authors (I'm talking more than $500,000 each year)  You know three or more people who are raking in a half million a year?   That would put you well into the top 1%   I totally believe he know the general endgame of book 7 from the start BUT over the course of the expanding series he's introduced all these new people and given then major narrative weight (Euron, Vicatarion, all the Dorne people, etc.) and he'll have to have them all do something. They can't all just die suddenly without impacting the plot really.       Most writers do NOT plan everything out.   Or at least, most literary writers don't. Genre writers are more prone to developing detailed plot outlines.     "Of the top 7000 best-selling books, indie books have higher average review scores than the traditionally published suggesting quality is not a significant problem for indies."  lol lol  Look, no one in the industry takes the Author Earnings seriously. They fail basic statistics.   But the above is really comical because fake reviews, purchased reviews, and scam reviews are RAMPANT in the self-publishing world. Of course they get hire reviews when the the reviews are all from friends, family, or people they paid to review!   Beyond that, people who "review" a free or 99 cent ebook hold it to a lower standard than a 25 dollar hardcover. It's fair of them to do so, since they are paying way less, but they aren't reviewing the same thing in that case.    Also, I'll point out that the trads publish their share of crap (Twilight, 50 shades etc...)  You know that 50 Shades was self-published as fan-fiction first?    Everything I've read has been uniformly awful. I'm sure there is SOME good self-published work out there. I can even think of one--but only one--book that started self-published then was lauded as a traditionally published book: The Martian. (There was also Hugh Howey, but everyone I know who has read Wool says it's mediocre and not worth reading, and 50 Shades of Grey, which is considered one of the poorest written books ever published.)  But yes, of course it is low compared to traditional, for a very simple reason: numbers.   There are something like ONE MILLION self-published books each year. Some of those are by bots and such, but the point is that there are vastly more self-published books than traditionally published books. Even if you believed there were as many good novels self-published as traditionally published, the self-published "good" ones are buried under an entire mountain of horrible ones. And there is no reliable way to find them, since the review system is a total scam with people purchasing reviews, leaving negative reviews on rivals, and begging their friends and family to review.    Yes this kind of thing is depressing. It's bad enough that popularity matters more than talent, but it's even worse when it's just popularity in any medium that gets you a book deal. Getting film rigths to a film series is one thing, but given the person a book deal who hasn't written a book?    I noted marketing! Agree though      He's certainly right, but that's small comfort for us now   It's not just your average novel though. Lots of best sellers and awardwinners had some rejections, often way more than Rowling.    That's why it's a big deal. In a rational, fair world, where author skill is linked to ease of getting published, you'd expect the most popular books to be identified as such from the people whose job it is to find them.  I think you make a big mistake equating "author skill" with "most popular books"!   I'm ready for these distinctions to die. In the past, all this stuff was separated. But now everyone readers and watches everything. You can't exist in 2015 America without watching/reading SOME fantasy (GOT/Harry Potter/LOTRetc.), science fiction (Star Wars, Star Trek, BSG), some superhero stuff (Marvel films, whatever). yada yada.   We all read and watch it all today.       I'm with you! I don't think Harry Potter was pure luck. She writes pretty well and mostly the books are SMART, but which I mean they combine popular genres and they came out at a time when there weren't many big fantasy YA books or children's books. So smartly done.     But a shit ton of people liked it anyway.  Well one thing we should do is separate "sold" from "liked." 50 Shades became a big phenom, which means tons of people bought it just to hate read it or because it was famous and then didn't like it.   But yes some people like it. I guess I don't think it follows that the book "did something" for those people in any real way. Or at least, I think there are 10,000 other books that could have done the exact same thing for those people. That 50 Shades became a mega hit and not the thousands of similar erotica novels is, to my mind, really just luck and marketing. It doesn't say anything about the quality of the work on any level.    Even if you, in your refined book taste, does not see it.  I don't think it has anything to do with refinery FWIW. I just think we should acknowledge that much of what gets popular has to do with luck, marketing, and other factors that don't relate to the work itself. I also think that fame is all about snowballing. Once something starts getting famous, it gets more and more that way. That's true of even high brow literature (say the Goldfinch the other year). Also true of films, restaurants, and a million other things. That's all.      And there's where she should totally get some real credit: World-Building  Really? I normally see even big fantasy and HP fans ding her for her lazy world building. Like even the basics of the world make no sense: there's the greatest villain ever in England, and there are magic schools and wizards all over the world yet... none of them come help? They aren't involved at all except for a silly school tournament?   I agree with you that she deploys the tropes well. Like I said, they are fine books and way better than other mega sellers like Twilight/50 Shades/Divergent.     If she was such a mediocre writer, the series would've died before it was finished.  50 Shades of Gray is the best selling book around and the author literally can't write basic sentences that even make sense. (Google "worst 50 Shades sentences" if you want to see and cringe.)   Rowling is WAAAAAY better than EL James. But a book selling really well truly isn't any measure of quality. In fact, shitty books are more likely to sell well. And mediocre writers finish bad series all the time. Hell, there are probably literally thousands of self-published novel series on Amazon that haven't even sold 100 copies.    The book has to have done at least one thing really well so it resonates with people.  What do you make of the fact, posted below, that Rowling's pen name novel was selling horribly until it leaked that she was the author, then it shot up to #1? Was the book not doing anything well at first then magically started doing things well without being rewritten?    Sure, of course it took thought/care/skill to create. They are fine books. But they are also highly formulaic and use very overused formulas. The orphan hero who learns he has a magical destiny is like THE classic hero journey trope. And /r/books sometimes has threads where people marvel at Rowling's creatures, not realizing they are almost all classic myth/fantasy creatures who've existed in a thousand other books.   But hey, there's a reason they are formulas: they work. Most blockbuster films and bestselling books adhere to well-worn formulas. There's a reason, too, that Hollywood reboots the same characters and franchises over and over. It works and it sells.     because the entertainment industry isn't about producing quality work - it's about fame and power.  Well it's a business, but I think writers make a mistake blaming the industry. The problem is really readers. As you note, readers only buy books from names they know:    If I remember, her pen-name book was 5,000th on the best-sellers list. Until it was leaked that she authored it - then it jumped right up to number 1 for weeks on end.  If readers cared about emerging writers or unknown names, we'd all do better.     They're just hyped and got popular so we all love them.  The thing people forget in these conversations is that luck plays a huge factor here. There were probably dozens of books as good as, say, Twilight or Divergent even coving the same subject matters... (probably 10,000 books in the case of 50 shades) but they didn't catch on because of timing/luck/lack of marketing/ and whatever else.   Point being, an agent is only "stupid" for passing on those books in retrospect. 9 times out of 10, Divergent would probably be a flop.    Harry Potter is not all that well written. It's not even very original, it just combined two highly popular British genres (high fantasy and the boarding school novel) and caught on.  But it's better than Twilight, Divergent, 50 Shades, and most of the other mega sellers that came after. They aren't great books, but they were smartly marketed and came out in a great time without much competition.    Agreed that isn't much rejection at all.   Imagine if you were a NBA player drafted 12th. "No teams wanted me!" Uh... not really.       It's for the full body of work, but there are several names there who are among the most famous international authors.     and at present none of the top contenders for being the Magic-Zoroastrian warrior-messiah are in a position of power,  This is just classic Hero's journey trope stuff though. The great prince/princess always falls farthest (Snow being killed by his own men, Dany having her empire crumble and ending up in the dessert) before they rise to glory. I feel pretty confident that one or both of them will be the Azhor Azai and save everyone   Totally agree. The world is overpopulated and there are tons of kids who need adoptions around the world. Having a kid is pretty selfish when looking at those facts. You really need to have YOUR genes propagated in a planet of 7 billion?   I don't look down on people who have kids mind you. But I definitely think that if one of those routes is selfish, it's having kids not deciding not to.    From the NY Times.    Marcel Proust never had a job.   Emily Dickinson never had a job.   Gustave Flaubert, Sartre believed, exaggerated or fabricated an epileptic condition so as to get out of law school and instead move back in with his mother.   Vladimir Nabokov was born into vast wealth, lost most everything, eventually landed a teaching position at one university and then another, wrote arguably his best works during that time, and later retired to Montreux, Switzerland. His wife, Vra, by his account, served him as a secretary, typist, chauffeur, teaching assistant, research assistant ... and so on.               Well, I don't think he'll reconcile everyone! I imagine Euron and Littlefinger will play chaos spoilers and have to be killed. And I bet the whole thing will end with an uneasy peace.   But I bet that Dany and Jon will unite, joining the wildlings, the north, and Dany's army and dragons to fight the walkers. Dorne will probably join them (after Aegon gets defeated). Stannis will joing.   Lannisters are already a spent force. As I said, Iron Islanders and Littlefinger (with the Vale?) will cause trouble. Aegon will have to be defeated. It won't be some easy happy thing!               Oh, I think Davis is totally deserving. But we seem on the same page this year.    Well, those four writers are from 3 different countries and 2 continents, but I agree would be nice to go to someone like Aira or Krasznahorkai this year   I think you are confusing the Man Booker with the Man Booker International (they are two different prizes). The International prize was never restricted to the Commonwealth. The regular booker is now open to any book written in English, but the International prize has always been international.    Yeah I don't think she is named after the publisher, the publisher is named after something else.    US english:    "What do you mean, 'That's final?'" said Emma.  UK English:    'What do you mean, "That's final?"' said Emma.     Yeah I can see that. But bookstores do have authors sign a big stack of copies everytime they do a reading so lots of signed copies floating around. (Store normally puts a sticker on it saying "signed copy" though)                     This seems like a trick question      Well, I'm not saying it's how I'd write it, but I'm saying that's what the narrative has built up. Winter is coming, Azhor Azhai prophecy, dragons (fire) vs. white walkers (ice), The Wall... so many of the huge elements of the book are about the Walkers.   I think Martin's point WRT human treachery is that the "players" in the game of thrones are killing each other over fleeting glory and ignoring the true existential threat coming from the north.     As much as I agree that the Others will need to be addressed at some point,   I don't think they will just be "addressed" I think they are the end game of the books. The others aren't just some random thing that's been mentioned, the narrative has totally  built them up as the central question. Consider:   1) "Winter is coming" is like the most famous phrase in the book and we hear it from book one. The White Walkers bring winter.   2) The Azhor Azhai prophecy is all about a hero saving humanity from the white walkers. Either Dany or Jon is AA reborn.   3) The most magical and amazing element of westeros, the Wall, was built to keep out the others.   4) The book is called A Song of Ice and Fire. Ice are the walkers, fire are the dragons (I guess).   etc.   Plus, Martin has said we are going to travel far north in book 6 so we'll learn a lot about them.    If Martin doesn't flake out and make the Others vanish entirely, then I suspect the show won't make them much more than a damp squib.   I think you are totally wrong. I'd place money on the walkers being THE major baddies (from humanity's POV) who invade a Westeros weakend by war and are only stopped by Dany and her dragons, as well as the kingdoms uniting together.   This doesn't mean we'll have a happy ending. Dany will probably die saving westeros, but still.    Yeah but the outline was very different from what happened in the books, so...   I like Martin, but he seemed to be kind of scrambling in the last few books and introducing all these plots lines and stories he never planned on doing.   Now, before you say that I don't know what he had planned, remember that Martin himself has openingly admitted that:   a) Books 4/5 weren't even supposed to exist. He was going to do a time jump for book 4 but couldn't make it work so wrote two entirely unplanned books.   b) Admitted he struggled for years to figure out the "meeranese knot" problem with Book 5  So Martin himself is pretty open about not fully having all this planned out and getting himself into trouble.    Fight Club also didn't come out in the age of Twitter and facebook.   (although i disagree that GOT is building towards who is king. It's building toward the White Walkers invading and humanity having to band together to survive)    Seriously, this stuff can't be avoided at this point.    You've got more faith than me. Books 4 and 5 introduce a ton of plot lines that I think will take him a lot of effort and time to clear up.   People say "oh, he can just kill everyone!' But the problem is that lots of characters have been set up as major movers and shakers and they will all have to do something meaningful before the end: Varys, Littlefinger, Bran, Dany, Jon Snow, Arya, Euron, etc. etc.   We'll see though!   Yeah she's totally boring in the books. Would be easy to cut.    It's common for bookstores to get authors to sign copies of the books when they come to read, including Barnes and Noble. So, yes, it probably was a promotional thing at B+N.   I've never heard of an author randomlly signing books. Not sure what that would even mean. The books are printed in one city, shipped to distributor in another, and then sent to various bookstores. They don't pass through the author's hands.   I guess an author could go randomlly sign copies in bookstores they enter to amuse themselves though.       Yes, the only way I could see them working is by having them each be like 500,000 words, so "technically" 2 books but the length of 5 normal books.   (The last ASOIAF book was over 400,000)    The first three books are the best, so might as well start there. But if you just want to know the plot or something, start with book 4.    lol      Well the books are best sellers so they are a cultural phenomenon too. I see people reading them all the time. Sure the show is more popular, but that doesn't necessarily mean the books can't be the definite version. For example, I'm sure more people have watched Harry Potter than read the whole series, but the books are probably still the "real" version. Ditto Lord of the Rings.   But Game of Thrones... if the show ends the plot it will probably go down as the real version.    Honestly, I can't imagine how he can tie up all the plot lines in only two books      I thought that HBO said they wanted more BUT would respect the showrunners wishes. (Of course HBO wants more, its popular and makes them money!)   But look, let's say GRRM somehow gets The Winds of Winter out by spring of next year, right as season 6 starts. That means he only as a year to get a book out before season 7... but even if they go 8 or 9 seasons he'd only have 2-3 years to write the book. He doesn't seem capable of doing that at this point.           onto a path that seems to make stuff gory because it generates PR, it seems.  Odd... I feel the show has gotten LESS gory and LESS sex-filled as it's gone on.. to it's benefit too.    I do wonder if the show will end up being the definitive version for the culture at large. Pretty strange to think about that happening, but it isn't totally unheard of (e.g., The Godfather film is THE Godfather, not the novel.)      Yeah but the early books are always easier in a series. Tying up all the loose ends (especially when Martin keeps adding subplots!) takes more time, I think.                  	200
    we could just power them from the energy from those solar panels. Power enough for one planet vs one solar system, it should be more than enough.            Hey don't look at me, I'm just an accountant.   It's actually incredibly logical. It's one of the most efficient ways to permanently harness power from a solar entity, and would permit a civilization to gradually scale its economic investment with its power needs. For instance, a younger spacefaring civilization would probably only require a Dyson ring, whereas a mature one would probably have a complete sphere which almost completely envelops the star, save for sustainability requirements. It also has the advantage of drawing power from the star without actually interfering with it and possibly invoking supernova, such as with a fusion solution.       This is actually one existing concept of the multiverse. To summarize, Einstein discovered that there is actually no such thing as "distance" or "time" as independent concepts, it's actually one cohesive unit of measure known as "space-time". It's only when viewed from insignificant dimensions like ours that space and time have distinct characteristics. This space-time is considered to be the subsequent 4th dimension to our existing 3 dimensions of point, length and height/width.   The gravity characteristics of black holes exhibit the limits of space-time, which is why it is often portrayed in science fiction as portals into another dimension. It is posited that beyond such limits lie the entrance to a higher dimension, which some theorize as the multiverse, whether through black holes or not.   Like you said, an entity existing in a lower dimension will be unable to observe an entity existing in a higher dimension, e.g. if you existed in the 2nd dimension you would only be able to see in a line (i.e. left and right), but not up or down (i.e. in the 3rd dimension); hence if I were above you you would not know I was there even if I were right next to you. Similarly, an entity with access to the 4th dimension could exist and interact with us in the 3rd dimension without our awareness. So an entity bearing the characteristics of "God" as defined by popular culture could very possibly be a being in a higher dimension, and it would still be internally consistent with our present theories of science.         Woo! Awesome!            erm... Eurozone?   got a job opening open?     I see, that is exceedingly excellent. Thanks again.      Wow thanks! Question though, who wrote the annotations? What is their significance?   Nuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh uh   The Yellow Pages!   The longer I stare at this picture the more it seems to change.   Buffett's shorting though right? If he claims the money upfront, what risk does he run?   How about Monkey   elidumb?   could you elaborate on that please? What would a no-risk supply chain be?   Pillowy.

If you think it can exceed that then it's fairly priced. Having said that, to say it's undervalued is a bit of a stretch. There are other better opportunities out there. If you don't want to do any research and want a decent growth blue chip, AAPL is not bad.   You might think so because you haven't yet been a millionaire, but I'm afraid you might be a little naive. I have yet to meet a millionaire who was satisfied with his wealth.    The majority of millionaires who aren't already on their deathbeds or facing unrelated personal crises are actively trying to become billionaires. You'll feel the same way once you become one, trust me.    As much as any individual human being tries, he can only do so much. He may be an ant where others are mere atoms, but he is still an ant. Beyond that insignificant capacity, it's completely up to chance.   If you take the time to study history, you will find that all great successes in history were at least 60% up to luck and chance. The disparity is explained by survivorship bias, where you only see the winners but not the losers.   It's because Buffett once said that a company's value is equal to its discounted cash flows over its lifetime. People then started harping on it without truly understanding its significance.   1. The identical CoC used as a growth rate simply means the CoC is growing at the CoC rate. It's purely arbitrary and just meant to reflect a non constant CoC in a simple way; doesn't really matter what growth rate is used.  2. ROIIC   ROIC has the same effect for the purpose of the table. You gotta look at the bigger picture of what the table is trying to convey, which is what you were first asking.   Ok.      and I'm Shirley!   Every account on reddit is a bot except you.

It's not plus, it's multiply. The 2nd CoC is just an assumption that cost of capital will grow at a constant rate over time.   2. Yes, it's because of that. The idea is that earnings growth can be expressed as an average of a large one-time number, whereas ROIC can't be window-dressed. Hence, his example of a poor acquisition demonstrates that growth numbers alone are illusory and can hide deeper symptoms which ROIC picks out.   It's a pretty good article, and is one of the best attempts I've seen to provide a theoretical explanation for P/E. However, it still doesn't provide a perfect practical solution to the real world. As far as I've gathered, P/E doesn't seem to be grounded in any fundamental principle, it's just a reflection of sentiment to the share.

 My expertise is earlier than the 19th century, but I would say this looks pretty legitimate. Most forgeries or imitations typically would be of something more historically important (i.e. the bajillion copies of the declaration of independence). Something like this is certainly beautiful and can have personal value, but it doesn't have much monetary value. TL;DR: LEGIT   I feel traumatized for having just read that.    This saved my skin (literally!). I had a waitress drop a pot of boiling water (for tea) right on my lap causing second degree burns. A few centimeters and it would have gotten my lady bits! A friendly chemist in the Blue Mountains recommended the oil and a vitamin E lotion. Absolutely no scarring whatsoever.   I should have been more clear - it's not the *certification* that is as important as the **training**.    Wow, thank you!! This is great, I too wish I could give you more upvotes :)   The thing to keep in mind is that if anything happens to a human being, you can be held liable. Your dog can be the sweetest, most non-violent pup, but therapy dogs are trained in order to be safe around all people, especially the most delicate.  Imagine the scenario: you are in the hospital visiting an ill or elderly person. A medical alarm goes off. You non-violent pup reacts as many creatures would - with surprise. It might do something as innocuous as jerking its head up or jumping off the bed. This could cause any number of problems like bruising or scratching a fragile person, pulling out IVs, etc. One of the main pieces of training for therapy dogs is to NOT REACT to these sorts of stimuli. To become certified there are tests like being put in a room and have various loud and unexpected noises (boxes dropped behind them, etc.). They must remain calm and fairly still to pass.   So just please keep this in mind. I'm glad you brought happiness to someone, but realize that a golden is a pretty big dog to take a chance with all of these things.  Source: my mom has dog that she has specially trained to be a therapy dog to elderly and dementia patients.   I would like to see this with Bran and Hodor instead...   It wasn't. That's why absolutely everyone drank beer, ale, wine, fermented drinks...all of which involve boiling up until essentially the modern era. Water killed you. Well more precisely, the microbials in water, but they didn't have germ theory either.   Ctrl+F: Doctor Who.

Do you actually have any obligation to send emergency vehicles, or talk them through crap like this? Can you actually just hang up on someone?   My husband is the same way! From my understanding, it's a histamine reaction; and yes, cooking fruits and veggies helps. When we make guacamole, we microwave the mushed avocados and it doesn't affect the taste.   All of this works out perfectly because since birth I have hated most fruits. Especially anything orange-like.   Yeah my mom used to bribe me with quarters. I also refused them unless I had my Batman pillow.    It's cool to see him applying it himself...builds up the Bowie mythos even more in my mind   Also, when you're playing some of the early games, part of why you're even playing is to get the cred fro beating it. And part of the cred is playing with an original controller. Because when you put up with hand cramps and making sure the buttons are the right amount of jiggly and sticky...you're a real champ.   This will get buried, but a co-worker of mine knew John Wayne Gacy really well. To the point that Gacy painted a picture of his son.    I definitely read this as though you snapped your fingers...[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/edSgh0f)    I knew Chris when I was at Wake, he was a year ahead of me. He was a genuinely great guy who was very down to earth. Legitimately intelligent too. I worked as a tutor for student-athletes, and he  had a reputation of excellence. I was sorry to see him go after his sophomore year, but at the same time I completely understand the career move. Glad he is still working for his degree. I was thrilled to see them retire his jersey, I only wish I could have been in W-S to see it!      I never quite understood why it was so freaking difficult. I was seven or so when it came out, and like many young girls at my age, was obsessed with dolphins (thanks, Lisa Frank). I had been gaming since birth (my dad bought me an NES when I was 2), so I had a bit of a leg up on many of my  girlfriends who desperately wanted to play. That and I already had a Sega Genesis. I still think I only would get to level 3 and fail. I even went back a few years ago to give it a shot, and got about half way through before rage quitting. It just boggles me that you would make a game where you are a freaking dolphin at the height of dolphin craze, a *perfect* way to get young girls into gaming...and then you make it stupidly hard to play. Asinine.    Man, I was just talking about that game with my husband last night. I was a huge TMNT fan. So of course I had both of the NES games. Being four, I was awful. I would usually just play the first few levels, then die. I haven't actually gone back as an adult to try my hand at them.    You're doing God's work   Well, there certainly was a majority of religious texts, but it wasn't exclusive. William Caxton, the first English printer, for example, printed the first editions of the Canterbury Tales. Printing presses actually spread like wildfire in the first 50 years, starting in Germany and then through the rest of Europe. The first 50 years is an admittedly artificial delineation (nothing really changed from year 50 to year 51), but it is very helpful for book historians, as it really was the period with printing spread throughout Europe and became common. People were actually pretty aware that it was a Big Deal. Between 160 and 185 copies were originally printed of the 42-line Bible (the commonly called Gutenberg Bible), and there are close to 50 surviving copies and numerous other fragments, which is a great retention rate.   As for fonts, most of the early books were trying to mimic the handwriting of manuscripts at the time. From the pictures you posted, your book definitely follows this pattern. This font is usually called Gothic Textura, though paleography is quite the rabbit hole you can fall down. In terms of people developing fonts, gothic-type fonts were certainly popular in the early days, but as the Italian Renaissance started to take hold, many printers opted for the Roman monument font, as it represented the Classical ideas. It also helped that it was quite easy to read. Gothic scripts, and really all scripts in the medieval period, were systematically abbreviated for practical reasons (if you're writing absolutely everything out by hand, you build in some short cuts), but can be very difficult to pick up on if you aren't trained in reading them. I could go on, but like I said, it's quite a rabbit hole.   Just at a cursory glance from the photos, I would say that the pages were trimmed at some point to be rebound. The binding is probably early, but not contemporary.   I'll post some books later if you are interested in learning more about incunabula in general, Albert Magnus, or anything else you might like. I have an extensive bibliography at my home office, though with Valentine's Day it might not happen tonight :)   	31
 What happens if you start up a drone IN a no fly zone?    Telling someone they're sat in your reserved seat.       My friend had to explain to his teacher that his dog actually DID eat his homework. He even brought a note from home.   It read: 'Last Thursday night as Sam was sitting down to start his art home work, he found that our dog had someone gained access to his school bag and obliterated most of his work.  Signed X'   Is the fly the pope?   Does the bear finger the Pope's shitty ass before he cums in the woods?    Kevin at our school lived on a farm. On his last day he arrived in a 4x4 with 3 live pigs in the back. One had the number '1' painted on the back the other two pigs had '2' and '4' on theirs.   He let them loose around school. There was much confusion as to where the 3rd pig was.    Oh stop it you   That is some tremendous initiative from a 14 year old.    Not something I have to deal with but TEACHERS please check the videos audio is on and that it is going to play.   Oh and for the sake of our sanity make it full screen.

 hey now, ohio's an open carry state - it's totally legal for me to walk around with a loaded, ready to fire AR-15 so long as i ain't in a bar or within 1000 feet of a school and am not inside a car.   They run 3 to a patrol car, and i think that says something pretty profound about how dangerous the job must be. What an awful way to die.   The case is eerily similar to that of Loretta Gates, whose remains were found scattered throughout Niagara Falls in September 2012. Police say its still too early to confirm if there is a connection.  But family members of Gates tell 7 Eyewitness News that the victim in this recent homicide had close ties to Gates.  Here's hoping if it is the same guy they catch him quick; anyone cold enough to kill and dismember two people is a serious threat.         classic case of smart-but-dumb: he was smart enough to locate the phone, dumb enough to realize he was over his head in recovering it. I'd have just walked away and called the cops, myself, if i asked for it and they refused.               what's really strange is that this isn't even a particularly large cleaver - 12 inches overall, and it looks like the handle's a little more than half of that. I mean it's a sharp piece of steel so it's going to do damage, but i am not sure there's not something much more effective in a 12-inch knife.  Also: try explaining this shit to the cops if they catch you with it. I'd almost pay to hear someone try.   Wow that is fucking vile. What the fuck is wrong with those people?   I'm just waiting for Voat to be like "haha you know what? we actually DO need some overall administrative moderation of the site or it turns to total shit!" in a few months.   bet those would be awesome for stress-testing a transport network   No doubt!   One can hope; if they'd broken it up or at least toned it down, it might have saved some lives.   For me, Meg exists solely as a prequel to Hell's Aquarium. Imagine Hell's Aquarium done with Jurassic Park's budget.   i'd have not declined - i'd have *laughed them out of the room*.    can confirm, have had authors offer me books on goodreads to review.   There is an absolute *flood* of those 20-page books, it's incredibly frustrating. Good to see amazon doing something about it.   It's like Freud up in there. I don't think the linked image is about the friendzone at all, but they sure like projecting...   i gather it was an almost new building (built in '06 or something?) - and almost every balcony collapse the story is "it was way overloaded"   But yet there are neither 19 nor 41 bullet holes in that image.  Interesting side note: judging by the way the bullet holes look, the *other side* of the plate was shot, and this is the reverse of it.    the rest of the quote probably goes "Us and our 7 users are very happy, now"   I have no idea, but i assume whatever method was used to construct it's about to come under some serious scrutiny.    Called it when i first posted it to r/news; if there's two people in a house and one's dead, it's a fair bet the other one had something to do with it. In this case, that seems to be the case.  Hopefully justice can be done.      There's a few ways to game it, depending on proclivity. Cobble gens work pretty well, *some* mob farms work pretty well, etc. Anything's gameable in modded MC, it's just a question of how much damage you do to the server's TPS in the course of it.       the Australian answer to Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, i suppose. Creepy.   It does seem like an odd turn of phrase; i'm not sure why they'd not consider this a hate crime (or if bias crime is synonymous with hate crime, or what).   This guy sounds like a grade-a nutbar, though. Hope they catch him before anyone else gets hurt.   Indeed so. Human memory is incredibly fallible and suggestible.       It is less than helpful as a description. Interestingly enough, eye-witness descriptions of attackers are often useless unless there's some very distinguishing trait about them, or there's already a suspect in mind.      all countries (or empires, or kingdoms, or whatever came before those) change over time. I mean, the america of 2015 is not one that most americans from 1800 would really recognize or connect with, in terms of policy or stance.    Every generation always assume it'll be the last, and the world just keeps on ticking.   Indeed. Plus, either scenario is possible, at this point. Only further investigation by the police can determine what actually happened and piece together the events leading up to it.   Tori amos has alot of really clever lyrics, but my favorite is Jackie's strength:      a bouvier till her wedding day     shots rang out and the police came     mama layed me on the front lawn     and prayed for jackies strength     feeling old by 21     never thought my day would come     my bridesmaids getting laid     i pray for jackies strength  It always struck me as a particularly elegant narrative device.   People will do any drug in a recreational way. Poison's in the dose, and all that.   hah, indeed.      And i'd bet money we'll be around at least another 200 years, in some form or another.    Spartacus died in 71 BC; the roman empire persisted centuries after he died.    if we take the start of the roman empire as 509 BC (with the start of the republic) and then the fall as 476 AD (fall of the western roman empire), then it lasted about 900 years. If we include the eastern roman empire, it lasted until 1453 - giving a total run of about 1900 years.   I'll take that kind of longevity if i can get it.   How quickly people change their minds about the IMF when it says what they want to hear.   Incredibly enough, i found that replacing AE2 with Project E was net-beneficial for the server over a long period of time:  1. People didn't feel a need to "hold onto" literally millions of cobble /sand/gravel/etc for no discernible reason  2. People didn't have enormous AE systems running 24/7 dealing with enormous feed stock inputs and processing systems. I did not realize how much of a drag on a server this was until we didn't have to deal with it anymore.  We just dumped stuff into the ProjectE network and pulled stuff out as necessary. It totally liberated us from the enormous drag of the usual midgame (or, as i like to call it "build giant quarries and enormous mob traps, then profit!").   The end effect was pretty much identical to AE ("oh, i need 1024 diamonds...better pull those out of storage!") but without any of the overhead or annoyances of the AE-type systems.   It's not for everyone (and notably, i think most servers would want to turn off the automatic generation of points) but it definitely was very enjoyable and very liberating when we did it.    Yep. I'm sure in a few years it'll change (for certain if by some dark miracle a republican gets elected, suddenly being ultra-liberal will be hip again on reddit)      I think "contrarian" is probably the best way to describe reddit. Whatever's edgy is what reddit likes.   sounds like a crime of opportunity. Hopefully the DNA evidence turns up something.      It's certainly possible.   I would use "kidnapping" loosely until more information is found. This case could be more complex than it appears.   odd enough when we would interact with girls (there were a few who raided with us and a single one in the guild for a few months, with her husband) he treated them fine, if a bit distant. I never saw him do anything dickish and never heard any complaints or anything (and at least 2 of the girls we ran with would have said something, i'd think)   let alone having them die by foul play like this...just awful.   If two people are in a house, and one of'ems dead and well hidden and the other is found safe a few states away - it's a safe bet the one who's alive had a hand in the death of the other.   i always do mail.google.com - it's weird how different people do the same thing.   having a functional self-improving general-purpose AI would basically blow the lid off any kind of ability to even *try* to predict the future or long-term outcomes. It'd be the absolute definition of transformative.   A person murdered and then burned, and they only rate a few paragraphs of news, complete with this awful addition:  Brown said several items were recovered at the scene that may prove useful as evidence. Other than that, investigators have little to go on.  absolutely awful.         Wonder what the deal is, then; all the updated news reports are scarce on details.   There's not one in North Dakota - but there are 4 in wisconsin!      We weren't no casuals.   I'm a staunch proponent of the death penalty - and i should hope this asshole qualifies for it.  that said i think lethal injection is inhumane, and we should instead use firing squads or something because they are more reliable and less likely to go wrong.   Really weird situation all around. Hopefully it's resolved soon and the daughter's found, at least.    Indeed so. Either this was a very stupid criminal - or it didn't go down exactly as described.    for what it's worth, the other 20 people in the guild thought he was a lunatic on the topic, and we'd go out of our way to warn people about it to avoid problems.    I'm a pretty hardcore fallout fan, but i really could give a shit if it's vault boy or vault girl on my pip boy/girl, so long as i can shoot things and hunt slavers in the wasteland.   no joke: I played an MMO with a dude who was, 99% of the time, totally great. Real team player, friendly as the day is long, self-sacrificing to help other people. Top-Notch human being, he'd keep playing on raids and shit till he *passed out on the keyboard* rather than let the team down.  but then there was the 1% of the time that that girls + games came up, and he went completely off the deep end. His attitude was exactly that girls played games for attention, unfairly benefited from attention, and generally should be avoided for the sake of a good experience.   Trying to talk to him about it was like talking to a brick wall, so after a while we all just learned to ignore it/never bring it up.   When deputies arrived just before 3:30 p.m., several friends and neighbors were already at the home. One of the neighbors had entered the residence through an unsecured window   Nice of the neighbors to *totally fuck the crime scene up*.  Very curious what the suspicious facebook posts are like, but couldn't find anything on them.           indeed, i gotta think most people could not survive a full thread.   someone should devise an /r/news cop-shooting thread drinking game.    I'm not questioning the official version of events, but it does seem, shall we say, unlikely that someone would walk up to a group of 5 bikers and demand the keys to a bike while pointing a gun at them.  For one thing, how would the would-be thief make his escape? he has to get onto the bike and turn it on, and that would likely entail turning away from the bikers to do so.    Give me your keys, said the man, pointing a .380 caliber handgun, cops said.  If that's an accurate depiction of events, the corrections officer must have been very confident and very fast to draw down and fire with that kind of accuracy before the other guy could return fire at him.       i mean really i don't know what people think SHOULD happen, here; they literally hounded a human being until they killed themselves. If that's not a crime, then crime has on meaning as a concept.   Riptide is absolutely terrifying to me as a concept. You know that movie, Abyss? With the aliens that controlled water? I thought that was terrifying when i was a kid, because those water things could attack you under water and you'd have no chance against them. They would blend in perfectly, be totally invisible, and strike without warning.  Riptide is like that in real life.         i ain't afraid of sharks in the ocean - the rate of attack is very very low and they typically are not fatal attacks (though quite serious, as in this case where they both lost limbs!).  I don't swim in the ocean because of all the OTHER shit that can get you. Jelly fish, sting rays, sharp coral, etc. best to just stay in the pool.   I really like this, very stark.   I hope the people who harassed her get brought up on hate crime charges and the school brought up on discrimination charges. Make the next district so afraid of the consequences that any talk of it's crushed instantly.   Highly irregular to have ANY shark attacks, let alone two separate ones.       The worst part is she still had vital signs when they got her to the hospital - so they were grievously injured, but still breathing, when found. Must have made it incredibly traumatic.    Good grief! My brother had a smith and wesson with a trigger pull about that - i can't imagine pulling that thing without serious intent, let alone accidentally!    Yep. The only time i touch the trigger of my gun is when i'm firing it, or when i'm decocking it (and even then only when its pointed in a safe, controlled direction).   There's only two parts of a gun that can hurt someone: the muzzle and the trigger. If people stay the fuck away from both, no one gets hurt. that simple.   That's a lot of misfortune in a short amount of time. It's good someone was there to help him when he got to the breaking point.    There's a few tricks.  First rule is to remember FORD, which is great for any situation:   1. Family/Friends 2. Occupation (fuckers love talking about their job/profession) 3. Recreation (what do they like to do for fun?) 4. Dreams (What do they want to be doing?)   Second rule is to remember GRAPES, which should never be talked about in polite company:  1. Guns 2. Religion 3. Abortion 4. Politics 5. Economics 6. Sexuality  Third rule is: Always have a smile. Act like you're having a grand time even if it's boring as fuck. People like happy people, even if it's a facade.  Fourth rule: Observe them closely. This takes practice, but over time you can gauge out how their reacting to you and adjust accordingly.    Yep. blockbuster's probably wasn't video rentals, it was their entire business model and their entire management structure. They'd have just mis-managed netflix into the dirt.     basically, when using a weapon like this, you can choke up on the head to use the top of it for strikes. that'd require whoever used it to have some training/know how and i'm not sure they would, of course.   Don't gotta chop through the door, just have to break the hinges or the lock (whichever is easiest). It'd be pretty fast, but not as fast as a battering ram or a shotgun.   [There was a scandal about this around six months ago](http://fox8.com/2015/01/29/how-much-first-aid-training-does-cleveland-provide-its-police-officers-i-team-investigation/)  From the article:  Akron, Columbus, and Cleveland all offer 12 hours of first-aid training to their academy recruits. Thats mandated by the state of Ohio. By comparison, Boston said its recruits receive 40 hours of first-aid training, and Pittsburgh said its recruits receive 56 hours.  Even more damning:  Boston also said its officers must be re-certified in first-aid skills during various times during their careers. Pittsburgh said officers there receive refresher courses every two years.  Ive been a police officer for 22 years, Loomis said, and we had one in-service training (in Cleveland) in 2009.  the tl;dr is: Cleveland has absolute shit for first aid training for it's cops, and it is not surprising they had no clue how to handle a gunshot wound.    hey look, it's a rich guy telling everyone what's wrong with the world. That's worked out so well in the past, we should SURELY listen to him, right?    It totally baffles me - i mean, seriously i am *confused*, here - who would keep their finger on the trigger once they were off target. It's absolutely against everything i have ever learned about firearms handling.       This is 100% a human error problem. No excuse for it.   but how would you keep the oceans from pouring down onto the overworld?    Yep. I've never seen an accidental shooting that could not have been prevented. This is no different. The gun should have been kept secured, and the owner should have *maintained control over it*.   Absolutely tragic and absolutely avoidable.               That's pretty cunning, really. The risk is you'd get a lot of false positives, but still, that's probably one of the better ways to locate drug abusers.    Politicians have to beg for money; judges just tell you how much they want and take it.    If it came down to a vote for jeb bush or the Zombie of Stalin with running mate Vampire Hitler, i'd vote for the undead. You should always vote for the lesser evil.   Japan's navy is not going to go light up a sovereign country over destroyed property. They'd just cry to the UN like everyone else.   It would in fact be perfectly legal for them to pass a law where they executed the fishermen. The saudis behead people for less, to say nothing of the *really* rough countries like indonesia.    you keep saying "rule of law" but you don't seem to understand this *is*, by very definition, the rule of law. Their a sovereign country and can pass whatever laws they like.   Not everywhere is america or has the same values as america.   We actually didn't even have organized, 24-hour municipal police in america until around the late 1830's. Prior to that it was a system of constables and night watchmen.   Bet that'd be a real bastard to dig out of someone in the ER.   I've actually considered getting some and running a 50/50 mix of these with FMJ's in my 9mm.    that central dome looks like shit, the entire painting has a weird, bent feel to it, the plants look like an over-grown abandoned lot, and the artist has no eye for light.   It ain't something a first-grader would do, but it's not something i'd expect from a professional, either.   there's lots of legitimate uses for armored vehicles (among other things, valuables transport and security uses).    Those things are, literally, life-savers.    The problem with having 10,000 hitler clones isn't the ham-handed attempts at world takeovers (they always bog down in russia) or the genocidal tendencies (no one's falling for *that* trick again); it's the god-awful paintings everywhere.    actually now genitals are not only part of dwarf fortress, but "gelding blows" are a legit thing in fights.    That is correct, from my understanding. This is fucking appalling. The guy shouldn't have been on the streets in the first place.   [Here's another article from china about it, with more pictures](http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news39191.html) - the more i look into this the weirder it gets. It's like there's absolutely *zero* mention in any us media source i can find about this.   I'm just baffled at this point.                                                                                      	150
 I thought it was a bit bland, uninspiring and mediocre. The slapstick and whole tone of the movie is just missing charm, it's just nothing special. I've seen much, much better from Woody Allen.   * Superhero movies from Hollywood         * The amount of remakes, sequels and reboots from Hollywood        * Ugly orange and teal color filters       If I had to pick out 20 of the greatest ones, I would pick these:         * Bronenosets Potemkin (1925)      * City Girl (1930)      * Coeur fidle (1923)      * Der letzte Mann (1924)       * Flesh and the Devil (1926)           * Frau im Mond (1929)         * Hxan (1922)       * Krkarlen (1921)     * L'argent (1928)         * La chute de la maison Usher (1928)      * La passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928)             * Mnilmontant (1926)        * Metropolis (1927)      * Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)         * Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)        * The Crowd (1928)         * The Last Command (1928)       * Tretya meshchanskaya (1927)         * Umirayushchii lebed (1917)      * Un chien andalou (1929)           Bananas (1971).   Pretty much every movie. At least 95 percent, maybe even more.    It's not easy to put these into genres.         That doesn't mean that one should just put movies where they don't really belong.           I put this under Samurai because it needed to go on the list and I meant period drama. However, I have heard people using the term "Samurai Cinema" as a synonym to period drama.          Period dramas are called jidaigeki. Samurai movies or "sword fighting" movies are called chanbara, which is a subgenre of jidaigeki.   The last one under "Yakuza", the film by Imamura isn't a film about yakuza, it's about a serial killer that wasn't at all affiliated with the yakuza. And putting Batoru rowaiaru (2000) under "Yakuza" films too? That doesn't make sense. Also, neither Narayama bushik (1958) or Narayama bushik (1983) (depending on which film you mean) have anything to do with samurais. Just these things makes me wonder if the person who did the list actually watched the films.   Imagine Lorre trying to whistle, but just failing, poor guy! Then sweet Lang comes to the rescue. How isn't that cute?   That's quite cute.   Nattvardsgsterna (1962) (Sweden).      Favourite science fiction movie:           * Tanin no kao (1966)           Favourite horror movie:            * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)         The original, no doubt about it. The remake is horrible and just made everything worse.   Yes. Le rvlateur (1968) for example, great movie.   I'm glad to hear that! That's some amazing movies!       But you must be crazy if you think that a person who had such an acute negative reaction to Scorpio Rising would enjoy these two - similarly subversive, daring and at times campish - films. No way in hell.                  Oh, I didn't think that at all. I took those two (or three) as examples of some of my favourites just to put it in context with what is unknown and not for that specific user, because I was wondering about that part. But anyways, the user was just asking about what I considered as absolutely great of the ones that are more unknown, so it wasn't specifically something that had to be according to the user's taste, just mine. I think our tastes already differ a bit from the beginning, I for example really like Dead Man (1995). When it comes to Scorpio Rising (1964), it's quite different than the movies I took as examples though, I wouldn't call the ones I mentioned campy either.   Well, thanks! Or something, heh. I think I started going through the list a couple of years ago, maybe 4, not more than 5 at least. I did not stricly go by it though, I watched a lot of other stuff in between.           I'd love to talk to you more about the whole thing.          Feel free to ask anything if you have more questions, I'd be happy answer them as good as I can.       Hidden gems, you say? Well, it depends what you mean with great but otherwise quite unknown. The ones I like the most in the list aren't really that unknown. But it's hard to just put some titles out if I don't know what you consider unknown. A certain amount of ratings on IMDb? Checks on ICheckMovies? Or anything else? For example, Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman aren't really unknown if you are cinephile, but a general user that hangs out on r/movies may have never heard about them. Those two are some of my favourite movies on the list, same with Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. But as I said, I wouldn't consider them unknown, so it's hard to pinpoint out any specific movies if I don't exactly known what your criteria would be.   Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978). A great, minimalistic, determined and uncompromising movie about a detached and disconnected female director. Amazing character portrait, interesting and insightful conversations and a hypnotic pace.   I felt that it was qutie bad in the start, but got better as it went on. The plot felt thin overall, the same thing with the characters. I appretiate what Gosling is trying to do here, but many things felt forced and that he was trying to be poetic, shocking and cool, but failed. Almost like he wanted to do a mix of Lynch, Argento, Korine and Refn, but with mostly style over substance. It didn't have anything really special making it quite good. On the other hand, it's better than a lot of stuff coming nowadays from Hollywood at least.   I have only 5 films left on that list, so I'm guess I'm still going. I have waited with some of those I have left for different reasons. But the so called "ride" was fun and interesting so far. And of course, some movies weren't at all great, but many were. I see it as a list of movies that are good to know about when you are talking about cinema in general. The list also changes through the years. It's also many different films, so you probably get a lot out of your comfort zone, which is good if you are studying films a bit more than usual. One good thing is that you get a lot of reference to work with, which is useful in many ways. I think it's good to mix your watchlist too, to not feel obliged just to go after this particular list. Remember to watch what you want to watch. On another note, TSPDT has a list that's a bit more interesting and diverse if you want to dive into similar missions. Although, both focus pretty much on American cinema and Europe, so much stuff is left out, same with experimental films for example.                 I'm a person who likes lists, so these things are often enjoyable for me, but I of course always have other movies to watch at the same time. As someone else said, think of it as a guide, it's great for beginners, because you get a glimpse of the history of cinema in a way, and you'll probably learn about and discover different directors etc. You don't have to like every single movie, it's great to be critical and know what you like and not like. Be prepared to be seeing movies that you maybe won't like, don't forget that. What I'm saying is that it's a great list to start with as a guide if you are just getting interested in movies.   Top 10 movies that run for 150 minutes or longer:        1. Andrey Rublyov (1966) (205 minutes)       2. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) (201 minutes)         3. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) (202 minutes)        4. Stntang (1994) (450 minutes)      5. C'era una volta il West (1968) (175 minutes)     6. Solyaris (1972) (167 minutes)       7. Stalker (1979) (163 minutes)     8. La maman et la putain (1973) (217 minutes)       9. Akai satsui (1964) (150 minutes)      10. Shichinin no samurai (1954) (207 minutes)       Also worth mentioning (and some that have director's cuts etc.):      Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) (161 minutes), Shoah (1985) (566 minutes), Fitzcarraldo (1982) (158 minutes), A Woman Under the Influence (1974) (155 minutes), Marketa Lazarov (1967) (162 minutes), Les enfants du paradis (1945) (190 minutes), Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960) (177 minutes), La belle noiseuse (1991) (238 minutes), Barry Lyndon (1975) (184 minutes), Tsuit no zawameki (1988) (150 minutes), Akahige (1965) (185 minutes), Welt am Draht (1973) (212 minutes), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) (160 minutes), Im Lauf der Zeit (1976) (175 minutes), To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995) (176 minutes), Rekopis znaleziony w Saragossie (165) (182 minutes), Lolita (1962) (152 minutes), Metropolis (1927) (153 minutes), The Act of Killing (2012) (159 minutes), L'argent (1928) (195 minutes), Frau im Mond (1929) (169 minutes), The Godfather (1972) (201 minutes), No Quarto da Vanda (2000) (170 minutes), Apocalypse Now (1979) (Redux) (202 minutes), Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) (250 minutes), O thiasos (1975) (230 minutes), Edvard Munch (1974) (210 minutes), Genroku Chshingura (1941) (241 minutes), and Out 1, noli me tangere (1971) (729 minutes).   That movie is so good. That's how you do a coming of age film! I love the crazy color filters. And as you said, the soundtrack is top notch!   Andrei Tarkovsky.   I watch movies because it is interesting.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989), the best one.   Not a great one, but The House of the Devil (2009) has it.   Le trou (1960) is great and suspenseful.   Some of them are really innovative, brave, special and have much interesting political content. Just take Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami for example. It's about a man pretending to be the famous Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, he convinces a family that he's making a movie and promises them a part in it. The interesting part is that the actual people involved in the incident re-enact the actual events. It also features footage from the real trial that took place. The mix between fiction and documentary is great, just like the erasing of borders with what is real and what is staged. The meta aspects give it great depth too. Kiarostami is one of the most interesting directors working today.            Other Iranian films that are good and important to check out as well:         * Ayneh (1997)     * Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)      * Nun va Goldoon (1996)        * Ta'm e guilass (1997)       It depends what you mean with old too. But Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and Suna no onna (1964) are great and not corny or outdated at all.   And again, who could have posted this Teshigahara movie other than you? It's welcomed as always, you usually put up interesting and good films here. This isn't really one of his best ones, but it isn't at all that bad. It would look even better with a Blu-ray treatment! I have the book it's based on which I should start reading soon too.   The Tatar invasions in Andrey Rublyoy (1966). Brutal and well done, there's so much happening at the same time. Total chaos and war. Especially the way Tarkovsky cut and used tracking shots in this sequence is amazing.   Not really. The whole character felt forced, too obvious and over the top. Almost like a movie for children. But then again, even if I cared for him, the film had way bigger problems. And I should add that for me, it really doesn't matter if I can sympathize with the characters, it doesn't directly make a movie better or worse, which some other people think. Some examples of the pathetic dialogue:      * *"Chappie if you want to be in the gang you have to be cool, like daddy! Look how daddy walks! Look how cool it's! Need to keep it gangsta' Chappie!"*        * *"It's time to pump up the jam!"*        Or just about anything coming from Die Antwoord.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989).       Will 2015 go down as one of the great years in movies?      I really doubt that. Why would it? The year isn't even over yet. I don't think we'll see the amount of masterpieces this year that will make 2015 something special worth remembering as a mark in the history of cinema. I feel that a huge miracle would have to happen if 2015 could offer something that could even be near to compete with some great years in the past. I would say that the great years are long gone and that it's been like that for a long time. Of course, some good movies come out now and then, but to put this year so high up already? That seems like a stretch.          Already we've got one of the best Action, sci-fi, and Horror movies in decades.              Well, that's your opinion. But I think you should think about it and give it a couple of years, then go back and see if you still feel the same. It seems that the general public on Reddit always have a thing to hype every year this way. All of this really makes me wonder how many movies people have seen.   Kenj zankoku monogatari (1964) by Takumi Furukawa.   I thought it was horrible. For a narrative film of this kind, the story was too simple sided and in the end, you don't really care about anything at all. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue.      1. Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960)        2. The Hustler (1961)       3. Raging Bull (1980)     4. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962)     5. Fat City (1972)             Woody Allen.   Le samoura (1967) of course.      If you want good movies about geishas, I would suggest to skip Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) that some people already told you about. Instead, I recommend these:     * Gion bayashi (1953)    * Gion no shimai (1936)    * Kimi to wakarete (1933)     * Saikaku ichidai onna (1952)     * Uwasa no onna (1954)      Especially Mizoguchi's movies about geishas were great, they have a very feminist touch, and it's also interesting because his sister was a geisha too. Great director, particularly Gion bayashi (1953) and Saikaku ichidai onna (1952) are some of his best ones.      I didn't like it at all. It felt quite superficial with silly and nonsensical action scenes that were supposed to be "cool", but rather felt tiresome and perfunctory. I really disliked the visual style too. And original? I would say the opposite. The movie didn't do anything original, nuanced, experimental or interesting at all with the time travel concept. Many things just seemed rehashed from before. There's other movies that actually have something intriguing to say about time travel, this was mostly just a cheap Hollywood take on it with a big slab of shallow action to disguise everything and please the general Tom Cruise fan. But this is just what I thought and I'm probably stepping on some toes, especially here on Reddit where people seem to praise this film and have very low standards overall.   I haven't seen the movie, but I don't know why you would be alone when it comes to this, especially why you would ask it too. But to answer your question, you are not alone, I know that for sure.   I really love Der siebente Kontinent (1989), a real punch in the gut.   You should watch L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961), Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) and Zerkalo (1975).   Stntang (1994).   None.   * La notte (1961)       * La peau douce (1964)   * Le mpris (1963)              * Nostalghia (1983)      * Providence (1977)    * Satansbraten (1976)      * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)     * Il sorpasso (1962)       * Stntang (1994)       Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), Suna no onna (1964) and many more.            Stalker (1979).       Has anyone been able to watch all of tinker-tailor-soldier-spy without falling asleep OR using ritalin?           Yes.   They already did. And they already are. A movie came out last year and a new TV series about them is coming this fall.   Nope. At least not yet. On the other hand, I doubt that there would be any movie scene that could change that.         Stalker (1979)!   Because many people have low standards.   Daniel Day-Lewis seems to be high up, especially if you look at his latest roles.      * Tanin no kao (1966)       * Solyaris (1972)       * Stalker (1979)       * 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)       * Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)       * Welt am Draht (1973)        * La jete (1962)       * Metropolis (1927)       * Posetitel muzeya (1989)       * Frau im Mond (1929)                 The Limits of Control (2009).   Read, get to know your film history, talk with people, hang out on different forums and sites, check out different film lists etc.   Yeah, I have that for some.   I don't know if it maybe has to do with rights. But I agree about Iran. And it would be lovely to see more from Taiwan. Also, African countries overall would be great to see more from too. In fact, it would be interesting to have almost anything older in the arthouse vein from countries like Turkey, Egypt, Romania, Greece, the Philippines, Brazil etc.   1. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     2. L'eclisse (1962)     3. Tanin no kao (1966)        4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      5. Suna no onna (1964)         It wouldn't kill you to load the whole album, because the names and more info show up then.      La jete (1962).    The White Ribbon (2009)  144 Minutes       Mulholland Drive (2001)  147 Minutes        Blue Velvet (1986)  120 Minutes       Lost Highway (1997)  134 Minutes         2001: A Space Oddysey (1968)  160 Minutes        Dead Man (1995)  121 Minutes           Do not miss out on those!   On the contrary! Mr Bongo released it on DVD a while back, it's available from their website and also on Amazon. There's also one Japanese and one Polish Blu-ray release out.   Rekopis znaleziony w Saragossie (1965) is great when it comes to the older ones. It has a really cool frame story and it's a hell of an adventure.   There's not really an overload of Polish titles in the collection. But be sure to get Nz w wodzie (1962) by Roman Polanski. You also have Trois couleurs: Blanc (1994) and La double vie de Vronique (1991) by Krzysztof Kieslowski that are partly Polish.   * A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)   * Mamma Roma (1962)       * Mat i syn (1997)        * Rakuyju (1986)       Andrey Rublyov (1966).   Huh?   Smultronstllet (1957), Andrey Rublyov (1966) and C'era una volta il West (1968) are highly rewatchable.   Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958) and Divorzio all'italian (1961) that you are namedropping are for example available on Hulu. Netflix seems to be overall quite bad if you are looking after movies outside Hollywood or the mainstream and even older movies. To take an example, the Swedish version is a joke if you are looking for movies before 1960. There's other streaming services though, like Hulu, Fandor and Mubi that are much better if you are in search for older flicks. Also, buying physical copies is a great way to do it too.   It seems that Kynodontas (2009) could be up your alley. Maybe even Stalker (1979), which is a masterpiece.   10 good movies at least. Nice to see Ozu in the top! He truly was a master.   Some are from the DVD/Blu-ray releases, others are screen captured by me and some are from various sites on the Internet.   Better late than never. I actually rewatched Clo de 5  7 (1962) some days ago. Charming little film.   A selection:       * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       * L'eclisse (1962)       * Nattvardsgsterna (1963)        * Suna no onna (1964)            * Andrey Rublyov (1966)      * Tanin no kao (1966)       * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     * Der siebente Kontinent (1989)       * Stntang (1994)        Just by seeing the title, I knew it was you who uploaded the album! A good Imamura film, always nice to see your uploads.      I also almost forgot about Nema-ye Nazdik (1990), it really deserves to be mentioned in this case. It's quite special, because it's a mix of both fiction film and documentary. It's about a man pretending to be the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf who takes advantage of a family while promising them to be involved in his next film. It's actually based on real events and the roles of the real people who were involved in the story are played by themselves. Great movie!   I thought This Is the End (2013) was quite bad, but you have Le mpris (1963) where Fritz Lang plays himself and Sunset Blvd. (1950) where Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and some other actors are playing themselves, that's at least two good movies.      Sure, I can recommend checking out these:       * Matka Joanna od aniolw (1961) (Jerzy Kawalerowicz)     * Sanatorium pod klepsydra (1973) (Wojciech Has)      * Struktura krysztalu (1969) (Krzysztof Zanussi)          No, none. I hope they will do it in the future. Other companies have released some of their stuff though, I know that there's at least two movies from Has that's been released in Poland on Blu-ray, but several other movies from those three directors deserve the Blu-ray treatment too, especially a bit more universal versions.   And that's almost nothing compared to Polish directors like Wojciech Has, Jerzy Kawalerowicz and Krzysztof Zanussi, they get shimmied to the side even more!   It's absolutely no requirement to enjoying and/or understanding the movie, but it's of course easier to understand everything if you know more, it says itself.   To make it short, it's one of the best and most important Polish films ever made, particularly about Poland's war and post-war history, just that makes it worth watching. If you have any interest in cinema at all, it's a mandatory watch. The movie is a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is great in his role. [Here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/826-ashes-and-diamonds) and [here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/363-ashes-and-diamonds) are two interesting smaller essays about it at Criterion's website which gives some more insight.      I haven given 26 movies the score 5/5.   Many people seem to use that as an argument. Sadly.         Hopefully one or all of these:        * Himiko (1974)      * Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)       * Midareru (1964)   * Nayak (1966)         * Nobi (1959)       Smultronstllet (1957).   Woody Allen.   I'm voting for Woody Allen.   He's a superhero. Why even question things like these in a Marvel movie? It just seems pointless.   I haven't seen Furious Seven (2015), Iron Man 3 (2013), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), but I can't say that I really care about the rest or that they're good movies. The taste of the general public is usually quite bad, these things pretty much confirm it for me. A movie that's making a lot of money isn't automatically good.   Tonari no Totoro (1988).   Have you read reviews for the movie? It seems that they would give you the answer.   Michael Haneke.   Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) and La maman et la putain (1973) are two of the best ones.   Showgirls (1995).   It's not one of the best films from the wave, but asolutely worth watching. I gave it 3/5. I think it's one of the earliest examples from the Czechoslovak New Wave too.  	121
 I wonder if this could also be "hacked" wirelessly to induce overdosage and thus causing further problems or even death? A new way to attack? Great article!                                                     	18
 This was not primarily a financial decision But this has more to do with the long-term direction of the station.     I think its a lottery. Every year I remember just after the last day to enter. :(  	2

 I think the point of the documentary was not to come out with any crazy new revelations about Scientology, but to bring the information to the masses.    Before the movie I knew scientology was weird, and they harassed their former members and stuff, but i did not realize how messed up it really was.  Extorting people of money, keeping people confined through mental abuse.  I think there are many people like me that sort of knew a little bit about Scientology and that it was weird, but didn't really know about the really truly crazy stuff it has done.     I imagine this would make getting to the ISS a lot easier considering Tony's suit seems to have an unlimited amount of DeltaV, and pressure capability.  That would actually be an awesome movie Iron Man in space.   the issue is not equalizing pressure, this would only take a minute or two.  The issue is making sure they have a good seal.   There is plenty of propellant on the Soyuze to facilitate multiple deckings.  Propellant would not be a limiting factor.   Thats what I was going to say as well, I believe that the hollow point of the bullet is creating the super cavitation reducing drag on the bullet and letting it maintain enough speed to penetrate the second jug of water.  It would be interesting if he used a hollow point rifle round to see what it would do.   Me too, I thought it was so cool that he got to vote.   I just watched going clear this video on top of it just makes it that much more creepy and scary.  Started off today thinking scientology was some weird cult that harassed people who quit.  Ended thinking "Damn Scientology you really scary."   Dude get your facts strait.  Your quote is completely out of context.  When you actually read what he was saying you realize it is not that ridiculous.  It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future.   The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt  it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted, "Muslims, Christians, we are one." The future must not belong to those who bully women  it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons.   The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources  it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the women and men that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.   **The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.**   Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims and Shiite pilgrims. It's time to heed the words of Gandhi: "Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit." Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, that's the vision we will support.  The rest of the speech is here (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/25/remarks-president-un-general-assembly)  And a video of the part of the speech you are referring to (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6uZFSj_ueM)  Before you go shouting out these quotes, you should look and see where they come from and see what they actually mean in the context that they were spoken.   What does Muslim sympathizer mean?  Are there such thing as Christian sympathizers, Jewish sympathizers or Hindu sympathizers?   Obama is christian dude.  This is the same thing as people thinking he was born in Kenya.   Ted Cruze was born in Canada yet nobody seems to care because his a natural citizen due to his mom being from the US.  Well even if Obama wasn't born in the US(which he was) he is still a natural citizen due to his mom being a US Citizen.   You cant claim that every news site but Fox has agenda.  The important thing is to question what you are seeing.  cross check what you see on one site against others, did what they said hold water?  Politifact might have a slant but that does not mean what they are saying is not true, just like Fox has a slant, but that does not mean what they are saying is not also true.    Also it concerns me just as much when MSNBC tells half truths or blatant lies, as when Fox does it.  Edit: I just wanted to say I don't watch MSBC I get tired of feeling like I am being lied to, even if I do agree with what they are saying.   I can't tell if this is sarcastic or not.   I would guess that it would be handled similarly to refusing to pay your taxes, or refusing to pay a ticket.   This was my thoughts put a nosecone in there to protect the interstage.   Why not just stick a nosecone over the interstage like the side boosters for falcon heavy?  Then the 1st stage stays aerodynamic after separation.    I don't think it would take that much effort to design a nosecone to go over the interstage, and fit in the trunk of dragon   I want my flair   I understand your opinion, but you should try to phrase it better in order to contribute to the discussion.  Calling people parasitic and clueless just makes you sound like a jerk, maybe say uninformed voters who support more public spending.  It will go a long way to making your opinion herd and more convincing.   This assumes that the people who vote now are informed.  There a bunch of people that vote right now that have no understanding of the issues, and only vote one way or another because of an add they saw or the way the party has told them to vote.   There is also early voting.  Also on another point, I do not understand why early voting is not available on weekends, it seems silly.   In US only about [50% of people vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections) in presidential elections, and for midterms(the elections in-between presidential elections) that numeber is [more like 30-40%](http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/).  So it is a big problem here.  As for taxes you have a fair point and I agree with you, taxes are necessary, but in the US a lot of people see forcing people to pay taxes as against their rights.    As for Jury Duty, this is actually very interesting to me, how does Sweden get people to come to jury duty if it is not mandatory?  And to address the police question, as I said in the post you would receive a fine, police would not arrest people for not voting.     We enforce plenty of things right now that many would consider worse than voting.  Jury duty and taxes just to name two, so it is not unprecedented to require voting.    Like I said it is not that it is not possible, but it is much more work for a poor person than a rich person. A rich person does not have to wait 6 months in order to go get an ID.   I addressed this in the post.  You do not have to fill out the ballot, you can leave it completely blank if you want to.    This is not any different than how it is now.  When you get your ballot you could make a vote for every single thing on the sheet, one, or none.  There is no law that says you have to fill out the whole ballot.   I am just basing this off of other countries and what they do.  You need some sort of incentive, and a fine is the most practical. The idea is the amount of people paying the fine should be very small, less than 1% of the population.  Also you could make the fine proportional to your income. So a rich person would pay a much larger fine than a poor person.     See but I believe it should not matter what kind of job you hold.  I know plenty of people that have very successful careers, but are on hourly pay.  For instance carpenters or other labor workers.  Hourly workers are not just in the service industry.   Sorry I will add this to the post.  I will assume that this would only be for national and state Elections to begin with, basically president and midterms.  not primaries and other stuff.  Although I think there should be a national election day for primaries and county stuff too to standardize it, and make it less confusing.  Edit: Sorry National and State.   It is not just about getting fired, what I am saying is many poor people can not afford to loose 4 hours of pay or whatever it would take to get an ID.  If you are in a salaried position that is one thing, but as an hourly worker this could mean coming up short at the end of the week.    Don't mistake me I am not saying it can not be done.  A person can make sacrifices, but my problem is a poor person has to make significantly more sacrifices in order to vote than a rich person does.   A few things first.  In order to avoid unnecessary arguments.  * You do not have to vote for anyone if you do not want to.  This is the case now and would theoretically continue to be the case.  You would go get your ballot, and if you wanted to you could leave it completely blank.  The point is you showed up.  * Taking examples from other countries, the penalty for not voting would be a fine. * We are assuming there would be sufficient early voting times and possibly make election day a national holiday.  I don't know if there is anything I missed.  I would like to hear what people think.  Personally I support mandatory voting, as it would eliminate a lot of the problems we have now like poor people not having the time/money to go vote, and disenfranchisement of parts of the population.  Edit: /u/DeShawnMann brought up a good point to start this would only be for national and state elections.    The problem is a lot of times voting doesn't require effort, it requires money.  A poor person can not afford to take a day off work to go wait at the DMV to get an ID.(many states do not have DMV's open on weekends.) A rich person can.   I believe voter ID is fine, if you give everyone an ID.  There are plenty of countries were ID's are required to vote, but they also issue ID's to everyone in the country for free starting at a very young age.    Basically if you want to require ID's you better make sure everyone has an ID.   Are you just going to make it look good, or are you wanting to make it flight capable?   There are plenty of people out there that do not support interracial marriage.  My point is, would you support Memories Pizza if they said we have decided not to cater black or interracial weddings because of their religious beliefs?     I think that it is important to understand this is a bit of a grey zone.  What happens if a place says we will not serve black people because of our religious belief?  That seems a lot like Jim Crow to me, especially if a lot of businesses are doing it.  People do have a right to religious freedom, but when does refusing service go to far?  It is not quite clear.   Possibly, but I think that they want to keep the hatch open so the crew can enter it quickly in an emergency.  But who knows what they would do.   I was assuming the defect was with the seal on the Soyuze   Wanted to report a bug, when you loose internet connection the extension will continue to count down even after connection returns.  Eventually it goes into negative numbers, and just keeps gong until you quit Crome and reopen.  It would be nice if you could fix this so it resets automatically or you can reset it manually when this situation happens.  My internet goes out frequently, but returns seconds to minutes later, and it is annoying that the extension continues to count down even once i have internet again.   Not immediately, but astronauts have been evacuated to the Soyuze capsules during problems or high risk times.  Usually they are evacuated to Soyuze and then they wait for further info and directions from the ground.  In Soyuze they are pretty safe, because the capsules are capable of providing life support to the astronauts, and landing capabilities if that becomes necessary.  No sense being hasty and landing all the astronauts when the problem is small and can be easily fixed.    I just realized your question was about air leaks immediately after docking.  I suppose it matters how bad the air leak is, and what is causing it.  It might just be the seal didn't line up very well during docking, in this case just dock again and see if the seal is better.  On the other hand if there is a physical defect in the rubber seal that can not be fixed, I suppose NASA would be left with no options but to land.  In the mean time Soyuze has enough resources to sustain the three people in the capsule for at least a few days it is likely that NASA would use at least a couple days to work on a solution before sending Soyuze back to earth.   In general if their is an air leak you want to be in a vehicle that is equipped to land.  There is really no point to letting the astronauts in and then doing the leak check, because if something goes wrong you are trapped outside your capsule.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsNnGZZusiQ   Tone it down Zaheer, you are still chained up in a mountain.   Also just for chuckles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjYRYUVjhEg   How did you get the blades to spin around the central axis if this is with stock parts?   Yea this is true.   I didn't say that it would be safer, far from that. I just don't think Iran is going to be too trigger happy.  There is no incentive for them to use the nuclear weapon on the US if they did have one, North Korea is proof of that.   What would Iran do with a nuclear weapon even if they did get one?  North Korea has had nuclear capabilities for years and they have not used them.  These governments are not stupid if they used these weapons, or accidentally on purpose let them get into terrorist hands that would be the end of their government.   I think the bigger question is could we afford another war that drags on for that long.  The Iraq war is estimated to have cost almost [4 trillion dollars](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314).  And in your argument you say we should have stayed longer.  How long were we supposed to stay?  Was Obama supposed to keep troops in Iraq for another 8 years?  I don't think the US could have afforded to stay much longer.  Other points:  * Iran is much larger than Iraq, and would require more resources to effectively control than Iraq did.   * We would receive even less support for an Iran invasion than we did for Iraq.  This would mean higher costs and back lash from the international community which might lend substance to the arguments of some other countries like Russia, and possibly lead to unforeseen consequences and backlash. * On the subject of cost our debt is already in somewhat of a precarious situation.  adding to it by trillions would not help, and possibly if circumstances were not favorable push the United States to a default.   My last point and in my opinion what i think is our best course of action.  Many younger Iranians have become somewhat disillusioned with the ultra conservativeness of their government.(enforcing headscarves, no dancing with the opposite gender outside your family, restrictions on western clothing...) There is a good chance this will lead to political change within the country if we give it time.  Invading would most certainly destroy these political movements.  It would play right into the hands of the government who has been preaching for years about how the US is horrible and they will attempt to destroy us if we give them the chance.  Right now the government is becoming the bad guy for many young Iranians.  Invading preemptively would fulfill the Iranian governments predictions, and make us the bad guys.    It might be best if we let the foundations of the government slowly erode and let these social movements work over time while holding Iran to the terms of the agreement.  It's not like we our blind US intelligence will almost certainly find out if Iran begins working on building nuclear weapons and if they do we can act accordingly.  Edit: I realized after rereading that I didn't quite address your argument.  Basically I am saying yes Iraq was relatively stable compared to a few years before, but at what cost?  It is likely that no matter when we puled out Iraq was going to have problems. Were willing to continue to spend over 400 billion dollars a year just to keep a country stable?   and are we willing to create that situation for ourselves all over again?   You know I understand the sentiment, it is quite possible that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon.  But what other options do we have?  A preemptive war?    As we can see with Iraq, those have not been going so well.    I completely agree it's not acceptable on either end.  I am glad they suspended him.   What is the reference here?   I would guess it was do to a degradation in the quality of the posts.  From the daily dot article i read, it sounds like /r/atheism was just becoming a place with a lot of loud atheist bigots.  As for /r/politics which i still go to, it is undeniable that it has a very democratic lean.  I even feel weird reading over the comments there, because even though i agree with most of the stuff, I am realizing more and more that it is an echo chamber of liberal ideology and politics.  So i am guessing they got rid of /r/politics because it was becoming less about politics and more like /r/democrats.    You have to remember this is what everyone sees when they visit reddit without an account, and are automatically subscribed to when they create an account.  I am sure they are conscious of the image they are projecting, and want to do their best to keep the default site as neutral as possible.    Basically if you like that content on reddit you can find it but the people in charge don't want that stuff to be the first thing you see.   Awesome, thanks.  I wouldn't be looking to do it on a per second basis anyway most likely i would just be doing daily(martian day) changes.   I thought that the part about the Fukushima nuclear meltdown was a little off base.  Yea sure the fish are not that bad, but there is an exclusion zone where the ground is radioactive now, and can cause long term health problems like cancer, and that is not going to change for decades or centuries just like Chernobyl.   They think that making taxes zero is the only thing businesses care about.  I just hope NC doesn't go the way of Kansas, that would be sad.   I saw somebody with a blue circle instead of purple and it said 45 seconds.   I am tempted to hit the button just so i might get a trophy for it later.   I have recently created a subreddit called /r/opportunityrover I t has a slot for the martian sol date and other things i the sidebar, but as i recently learned CSS is incapable of updating these times automatically.  I read this post over at CSS http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/2xu2fd/how_do_i_add_a_clockthe_time_in_the_sidebar_like/  and the commenter explained you needed a bot to update the time.  Can someone explain to me or give me the code i need to get a bot to do that.  PS: I am supper noob at this.  I am still sort of confused how bots even work so sorry ahead of time.   you are saying this while your up and down vote icons are anchors lol   It is possible to release the trunk before you cut the engines which would give sufficient separation.   It's really too bad this is not true.  CNN would have way better sources and less hysteria.    Also I love the poking fun at /r/aviation.  It's funny because it is true.   lol its cool.   i meant the Lisa Akoya would cost 300k    You should check out the Lisa Akoya.  I ran across it recently.  It uses hydrofoils instead of the more typical hull.  Evidently this helps a lot with gas.  They claim it gets 3 gph.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwSCR0LoAyo  Fast forward to 7 minutes to see it actually flying and stuff.  Unfortunately the plane is supposed to cost around 300K. Which is just crazy expensive.   I don't think that is true. 30 years ago flying was significantly cheaper than what it is now and not everyone was becoming pilots.  A cheaper airplane would be good for everyone.   can you explain that one too.  Again I have no idea what that was.   Sorry i never seem to get sarcasm on here.   Thanks i just switched it back.   ohh sorry my mistake, but same idea.   Well fire would because it is hot obviously.  http://s3.supplyhouse.com/images/products/zoom/815628602-1.jpg  You can see the clear little bulb at the end of the red stick, that is the glass plug i am talking about.   This is silly you don't need to take pilots out of the cockpit and completely automate the plane, you just need to fix your procedure.  make it so the pilot is not alone in the cockpit.  Thats what they do in the US.  When one pilot goes to the bathroom a flight attendant goes into the cockpit.  This is just people not thinking.  its like saying we need to design cars without tires because we got a flat one time.  Maybe it is more practical just to take along a spare.  You don't need to completely reinvent the wheel.  Not to mention I would be way more concerned about my plane being completely flown by a computer rather than two very capable pilots.     I would disagree, he likely created a lot of water damage, and especially if the administration saw the video, it is pretty apparent that he is being an idiot.  It doesn't matter who you are, if your neglagence creates a few thousand dollars in damage your job is likely in question, not to mention that the fire department was called, thats probably even more money.   Yes thank you, interesting fact, what actually activates the sprinkler is a small glass ~~wax~~ plug covering the opening that is designed to melt at a specific temperature.  Edit: http://s3.supplyhouse.com/images/products/zoom/815628602-1.jpg  You can see the glass ~~wax~~ plug at the end of the red stick on the sprinkler head.

It's so cool how jagged the rocks are they are so un eroded.            I just love how people took back the subreddit that is so awesome.   How did they manage to pull this off? all the posts are from the opposite subreddit.   In other news /r/AdviceAnimals has transformed into /r/funny ohh the irony.

Didn't know bout the dips. I have never driven through the prairie of Canada before.    What in the movie made you question the religion?  Was there anything that stuck out?   That is true.  Still i feel like 90-100 MPH is not unreasonable.  God just look how strait it is.   wow cool   When do they get sealed?  They always motor out of port.   yea if you pull out your sectional you will notice that a ton of the runways in an area will all point the same way.   Yea I was going to suggest you get some meds to relax you during the flight.  My aunt has big anxiety issues on flights she pops a pill before the flight and it calm her down and the flight is alright for her.  You need to watch out though sometimes the pills can make you a little nutty, like if you have had to many mussel relaxants.   Evidently one time my aunt ate her neighbors sandwich and was saying crazy stuff but hey it makes it so you can go to your friends weddings and stuff so its a trade off.   Are there any rules about using the engine?   I feel like you should be allowed to go whatever speed you want through there.   What are they going to do until they get to port?  it looks like the bottom of the mast is good, if they can get some of the supporting cables hooked up again to the starboard side of the mast.   Sorry :)   yea I get it now I didn't get it before.   Sorry I suck at titles. (not sorry)   I thought about this, does best picture count?   ok i get it now i didn't pick up on him being tied up so he couldn't mess with the airplane.  and no i was not joking.  I was just like why is the copilot tied up?   Tell us more, what did he do?   Why is the Copilot tied up then?  That is what I don't get.  What statement is it making?            Can someone explain the comic.  I don't get it.  I understand its related to the german wings crash, but i don't get what it is trying to say.   Yea I chose to ignore the title.   I can understand that, but i still feel like the overarching plot could allow for more character development.   They are just kind of nutty, and i wasn't just talking about quiverfulls the religious crap in general is getting ridiculous.   Fair point.   God what is wrong with our country?   I think Mods need to start deleting stuff that is labeled NFSW but not NFSW it is just starting to get ridiculous, and ruin the point of the tag.   Why is this NFSW?   The problem with the Palin choice is it reflected bad on McCain's decision making, and also made it seem like he was not in control of his campaign.  The decision just didn't seem to make any sense.  It only got worse when it started to show that she had no idea what she was doing.  I would compare the Palin decision to Clint Eastwood talking to the chair and the RNC.  It was so much of a distraction that nobody remembers what the candidate said.    I am not quite understanding your logic.  Who would win?   Because with the two party system we have, you are actually making it more likely the guy you like the least will win.   Just wondering, what is everybody's thing against Hillary?  I am just wondering what are some specific things people don't like about her.   I agree you should see her bit on the Daily Show about public schools.  It is so true.    The difference is Dianne Feinstein is not running for president, Ted Cruze is.   He compared climate scientists to flat earth's while comparing himself to Galileo.  The crazy fact is it is not only completely ironic, but he got his history completely wrong.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/03/25/ted-cruz-compares-climate-change-activists-to-flat-earthers-where-to-begin/   Yea I hate it when they do that.  This show isn't as bad but they do turn up the drama sometimes which is kind of annoying.     Yea I understand why they had to do it.  I still wish once they knew there was going to be more seasons they would have developed a bigger multi season plot.   A little Dramatic in parts, but compared to TV shows in the US it is pretty mello on the danger stuff.  I liked it and liked how they let the pilots do most of the talking.      I just kept thinking they cant come up with another rime to mess up.    reminded me of this.  https://screen.yahoo.com/b108-fm-busty-rhymes-000000543.html   Yea I felt like that is my biggest disappointment with Korra there is no overarching plot from season to season.  In ATLA every season was working towards the eventual confrontation with Ozai.  Because of that you got to see a lot more character progression, on the part of the good guys, but more importantly, on the part of the bad guys.  Ozai starts off as this shadow and you never even see his face.  By the 3rd season he is completely menacing, and there has been a ton of back story on his relationships to other characters. There were still minor villans and seasonal plot points, like Zaho attacking the north, and Azula taking over the Earth kingdom, but they were made that much deeper because they had significance towards the final plot of beating Ozai.  In Korra on the other hand each season has to completely introduce you to a new set of villans and a new plot objective each season, which really takes away from the sieres as a whole, because each season is pretty insignificant to the next.  I would have liked to see some sort of overarching plot like ATLA.   PS: I think one of the best opportunities they had with Korra was with her loosing all her bending but her airbending.  I feel like they could have made the whole next season about her developing her Airbending skills to mastery and eventually getting back her other bending skills.  I felt disappointed that she basically lost her skills, and then got them right back, it was a huge missed opportunity for a great plot, and a really interesting opportunity to develop her character more.  ohh well.   American companies are notorious for penny pinching and treating employees like machines and resources rather than real people.  Would you give the delivery truck vacation time? Would you give the computer vacation time?  Why should we give the employees vacation time?  Unless there is some sort of financial incentive that is easy to calculate on an excel doc the company does not care.  This is what is bad about penny pinching and trying to make the bottom line.  You end up making the employees your enemy.  In a company that has the employees back, the employees will defend the company , and put in the extra effort.  At companies that focus on the bottom line and treat their employees like crap, you will have a whole army of employees that bad mouth the company when they are off work, and will never put the extra effort in to help out.   It also tends to piss everyone off that the employees will take a pay-cut, and then the CEOs get raises for increasing profits.  It is just ridiculous.   I didn't think about that.  It could go either way, the hydrofoils might perform better in chop.            I wonder if this article takes into account that it is a lot easier to find planets that are very close to their stars rather than far away ones.  This would certainly account for their being so many planets close to their stars we just don't have the ability yet to see the others.   Can you link to the discussion?   yes please I am learning so much about different fuels just from this thread, I didn't realize hypergolic fuels were inefficient.   Couldn't they stick an engine bell on the super Draco to increase efficiency?  I thought it was so inefficient, because the way it is designed now it has no engine bell so it can fit right in on the side of the dragon.  Are there other reasons for the Draco being inefficient?   Wow that was close I almost got put in repost jail.  Thank goodness because I don't have enough money to repost bail.   PS: I found the video on my own and posted it, I don't consider that a repost.  I am not going to waist my time looking through the whole history of /r/flying on the off chance someone posted the same video 2 years ago.    What game is this referring to?   OP What has brought you to these dire straits?!?!?!    The thing on the tv is a really bad scene from the absolutely horrible  movie who's name [must not be written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Airbender).    It is so bad that I almost wish they would make a remake just so we could permanently delete this movie.  And I didn't like the idea of a movie adaptation to begin with.  That is how bad this movie is I almost wish they would make one that is less bad just to get rid of this one... almost.    Honestly idk why they had to make a live action version, I think it wold have been so much better to make an animated movie that continued the plot.  I really hope they don't make a live action Korra.  Just stay animated, that way you can keep the same voices and everything.  That or make a live action about a completely different story line, maybe about earlier Avatars or something.  When you try to make a live action about a story line that is already animated, you have a 95% chance of disappointing everyone.  It's like movie adaptations of books, except much much worse.   I think you have to watch how much you skip in series like this.  A lot of times you don't realize it but there was character development going on that you didn't even realize was happening.  even insignificant episodes can help you get attached to a character.    (TLDR):Skipping episodes only makes the series worse for yourself because you miss small things that end up adding to the overall plot.  Edit: There are some times in some series when skipping episodes is necessary because the episode significantly hurts the series.  Avatar is not one of them.   Quite possibly runways are very long.   I forgot about ice buildup, that would be a big reason not to have it.  	138

 Well the point I'm trying to make is that people can't stand Congress but they like their representative. They don't seem to understand that their representative is part of the problem. Their local votes have a nationwide impact.   The most depressing statistic in the world: Congress has a 9 percent approval rating and yet 90 percent of incumbents were reelected in 2014.  America deserves the Congress it gets.   "Ain't no Vietcong ever called me ni  er." - Muhammed Ali  So much history and justifiable angst in seven words.      It reminds me of when Bush the old man went to a grocery store and marveled at the laser UPC system.  	5

Blade Runner       I'm at my buddy's place in Amsterdam; fairly typical European sink/faucet       Gummo   I had a followup interview for an in-store bank teller position. In-store meaning grocery store. The wonderfully flamboyant regional manager who was interviewing me said, "you'll need to leave the bank and entice shoppers to open accounts..." I told him that was fine.  He continued, "you'll need to talk to them while they're shopping..." he stopped walking when we reached the salad dressing isle.   "What kind of salad dressing are you?"  I realized this was not only a really goofy interview question, it was role-playing a big portion of the job I was after.  I grabbed Raspberry Vinaigrette and improv'd a bit about having a tangy and fun personality. He grabbed Cesar and said, "I'm more of a Cesar!" and he stabbed me in the back with the bottle.   In retrospect, I think his joke would have been funnier if the salad dressing we called 'Brutus'   I got the job.    Dead link   Please Do Not Touch      My college philosophy club: THE DIOGENES CLUB      Yeah! Paintings show him in a jar, a tub...

 That is also the first time I've have seen Moamer as a spelling for his first name.   When will the system work this well when it comes to banksters?   The Tass story has not been confirmed by any other source including Exxon.   The unanswered question was which was the better band, the kazoo players or the Eagles?   Since you do not recognize scientific racial designations, I don't think this discussion has anyplace to go.   Nigeria may be on the African continent but it is nearly 3000 miles from Cape Town or 200 miles longer than the distance form Miami Florida to Seattle Washington.   Native Americans can use whatever name they want to describe themselves but Caucasians and others should have the decency not to use racial stereotypes or slurs.   Thanks for adding the pirate's point of view.   I had not realized the size and scope of the lair.   I agree except Obama's underground lair is in Kenya not Hawaii.

Yes, but the area in which Ebola outbreak is taking place isn't where the most sophisticated medicine is practiced in Africa.   Except, in Africa with some of the worst health care in the world, [the mortality rate is scantly above 50%.](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-death-toll-in-west-africa-ebola-epidemic-reaches-2622-who-2014-9)   After over 70 years secret from Nazi death camps are still being revealed. The question is why no one looked under the road for a gas chamber before now.   No for Calpers but for some of these hedge funds it may have some impact.   The history of the civil war is still being written 150 years after the guns stopped firing.   Banksters didn't stop committing crimes in 2008.   What jobs skills does a fast food worker gain that is transferable to another industry besides learning to come to work on time.   Maybe now banksters will go to jail for the financial crimes they commit. This may be wishful thinking but we have to hope.   All well and good if both sides have the money to get their message across. However, when those making false statements can outspend those with the truth by 10, 20 or a hundred times there is a need for the government to intervene.   I guess aerial combat missions are not a strategy.   These bombing are not the work of socialists but anarchists.   No, Exxon was just starting to work on a new oil field in partnership with a Russian energy company.   This is a great victory for historians who will have the ability to access  these documents.    Chomsky is trying to make headlines. There is no way he really believes this. He is using hyperbole to make a point.   Even a broken clock is right twice a day.   One case is not widespread fraud. Voter fraud is rare at best. There have been almost no cases of fraud involving same day registration even in states that allow registration on Election Day.   You can not be serious. If the UN is a terrorist organization then what is ISIS?   I don't remember a single case of fraud related to golden week.   This is a legitimate source please go there and look. It posts stories with permission from major news sources just like Yahoo news.   The story is from the AP. Do you have a problem with the source?   Would the GOP run this ad with a man in pants? NO. Republicans are clearly making an issue that the Congress member is a women.     I guess if you're part of the majority and don't care about minority rights there is nothing to worry about.   The problem here is not that fast food workers will make a living wage, 40K, but that college profs are worth more than 50K a year.   I don't know where you are from by homes of felons do not get confiscated by the state in the US.   In this case all Palestinians involved or not lose their land and the vast, vast majority had no hand in this action. That is collective punishment.   Another little known piece of history is uncovered in looking back at the robber baron era.   That doesn't seem surprising.   You may starve if you eat this stuff everyday.   AP always does that.   I suggest you read the story. The headline is the first sentence.   Better known as collective punishment.   First you send the the country into the Great Recession. Then the government bails out your company so that it is now profitable. Finally you feel wronged and sue the government for $25 billion. That is a new level of crass capitalism. Greenberg should have been jailed with all the other banksters.   And to show their appreciation for this sweetheart deal the furniture company donated to Gov. Walker's re-election campaign. Keep moving nothing to see here.   Isn't it amazing how regulators allowed the utility to build in an active earthquake zone.   Remember Alabama's state slogan "At least we are not Mississippi."   The US constitution is not suspended for those who enter this country by extra-legal means. If that was true, we would have a two tiered legal system one for citizens and one for non-citizens. The injustice of such a setup would totally eviscerate the Constitutional protections for both groups.   I have to take issue with the word "going" in your headline.   A first small step but change many times happens in small steps.   Thanks for remembering this wonderful Twilight Zone episode.   Police still play the role of enforcing the law. The difference is the number of guns in the US.   September 11th.   Thanks, you are now on mine.   By the way Happy Cake Day.   Too big to fail, too big to jail.   Jail, they don't need no stinking jail. /s   How about an MRAP with a police officer in full riot gear on top aiming a military sniper rifle on the crowd.   Authorities previously banned the march and threatened to block the BBC Russian service over an interview with an organiser.  Please read the article to get to links to earlier stories about this struggle in Siberia.   The blue wall was in place local before police forces were unionized. Don't take due process as the reason the police are not held to account for their actions. That is a failure on the part of police leadership.   I don't think police unionization has anything to do with the militarization of the police agencies. Police forces added all these "toys" because they were free or had a minimal cost.  Unions have helped police forces not to use arbitrarily actions to remove officers who do not believe in the consensus opinion of their bosses. Unionization has helped keep dissenting voices on the force.   Brilliance is not a hallmark of bank robbers.   I think austerity during a recession or debt crisis tends to have some minimal effect in the short term but bring about larger problems long term.   Our economy is way larger than Spain's. So it is a big deal.   The Libertarian answer: lower taxes and lower spending has been a long-term failure in most western countries that have tried it. The answer for Spain's economy is not to strangle it.   It is always amazing to see hidden stories get rediscovered. WWI was 100 years ago and we still are discovering new stories.   The situation in Ferguson is getting out of hand. The local police are no longer in control. It looks like St. Louis County police are now in charge and they have a much different attitude than the locals.   Sorry your file has been lost - FBI   The source for this story is suspect.

I'm shocked. /s   The Ebola outbreak is not just getting out of control.It has been out of control for months in parts of Africa. What you seem to be saying it has begun to spread from Africa to the rest of the world.   Take a look at [world maps from the 20th century](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/documents/maps-in-time.pdf) to see how it was national liberation struggles not internal coups that shaped the world in the early part of the 20th century.   They must consider Ghandi's political activities as a coup.   The reality is between 1901 and 1960 is the era of national liberation. That is the period in which former colonial nations sought independence from there colonizers. To use this era as a baseline to compare with later eras is a false comparison.   Documents tell a story of corporate complicity with the murderous Brazilian junta. While corporate support for South American dictatorship is not unheard of, the proof it happened helps reveal how money determines corporate human rights policies.    This diary sheds light on one of the dark corners of history. A written account of what was happening in Cambodia as it was happening is a great find for historians.   Will they have to wear an ankle bracelet?    There is room for both stories.   I didn't question the facts but the source and the analysis.   That is the expectation. Maybe the voice recording aren't included in the black box system?   Who knew?   I would have no problem with all states having to get preclearance with special attention to those places with past records of clear discrimination.   Using a breitbart.com story to talk about Fox News and TV ratings is like using /r/socialism to talk about income inequality.   From 1975-1978 Pol Pot and friends were Maoists who committed genocide on their own people, no later conversion can change that fact.   This may not have gone unnoticed locally but has certainly not been a world story.   Thanks, you are correct   Are you saying mines can't operate without causing massive damage to the environment?   1.3 billion gallons of water polluting an area of Canada. No big deal. Hundreds losing drinking water. Not a big enough tragedy. /s   Would you drink water in Toledo even though the government has said it is OK? That's what I thought.   You are why Reddit is a special place.   WV, NC, Ohio the questions about industrial pollution of our drinking water is becoming a worldwide scandal.   No. This is not  a science blog. It is a progressive blog.   Even a broken clock is right twice a day.   Franklin Park Conservatory   By the way we rank about 30th as a Metro area while being the 15th largest city.   Thanks for fixing that.   Keep dreaming.    Isn't the name, Republicans?   The 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI has lead to an extensive reexamination of the war and its ramifications.   Thank you. I told that to the mods but they never really answered   I never mentioned Muslims. I think the story is important that is why I posted it with a disclaimer.   It seems the Nigerian army is not up to the task of taking on Boko Haram.   I'm not sure this is the way things happened but dozens of Uighars are dead in northwest China.   I was at the game. 9   This is a 69 year old story being told by a participant. It continues to show the history of WWII is still being revealed.    Happy cake day. Where is your cute kitty picture?   $370 million dollar fine for manipulating the world's banking system, where is the justice? Who is going to jail?   To the oil industry any day ending in "y" is an exceptional circumstance.   The only way to build a third or fourth party is not to abandon the two parties but to build local party organizations and work our way up. By abandoning one of the two parties on the national level is to give the party you like the least your vote. Until we build a new party locally we are stuck on a national level with what we have.   I have always wondered why fines and penalties for corporate malfeasance are not at least equal to the profit made by the company. I know companies write these laws but where is the public outrage and demand for equal justice   So it is the Palestinians faulted for protesting not the Israelis fault for shooting.    I used the first sentence of the story. Is that OK?    The ban of NBC preceded the establishment of /r/NBCnews. CBS News is also banned.   $3.3 million is not enough. Where are the criminal charges? The resignations? The firings?   We can't stop attacks on Dodd-Frank. How are we going to pass Glass-Steagall?   That is certainly not a reason to kill Dodd-Frank.

[China Dynasty in the Lane Ave. Shopping Center](http://www.chinadynasty-cmh.com/)  EDIT: To include link   Opening up the UN archive on WWII will allow tens of thousands of people including scholars and historians easy access to important files.

I don't disagree with your assessment and I don't think Falcone has a chance in hell to win this lawsuit.   Actually it was the other way around. the GPS bands were migrating into LightSquared spectrum. LightSquared problem is they were trying to stop or block that migration. The government considered their efforts as a threat to the current GPS system.   It is always important to see new footage from WW1. The digitization project is bringing WW1 images out of library stacks onto the internet.   I'm surprised it took so long for some in South Florida to realize Rubio's failings.   That may be true for the Kurds in Iraq but those in Turkey have been fighting for decades for a free and independent Kurdistan which would include them.   Sounds good but the Turkish government has been opposed to a Kurdish state. The Turks believe any Kurdish homeland will try to incorporate large parts of eastern Turkey which has a substantial Kurdish population.

Oops. Sorry for the error in the headline. The demo was planned for Richmond VA.   It is amazing those who call for IDs for voting do not want a national ID card. The truth is the ID is just a smoke screen to limit voting of those that some people find undeserving to have the right to vote.   Then why not a national ID card for all these purposes?   The release of 19 boxes of KGB documents is a major contribution to the history of Russian intelligence in the last years of the Soviet Union.   Voters need an ID but I'm sure you oppose a national ID.   You would think. However, when it comes to holding the right accountable there always seems to be a double standard.    It's called Larry Craig syndrome.   The words "profoundly troubled" were taken verbatim from the State Department's official statement.   The role of Poland in breaking the enigma code is often left out of the history books.

Historical preservation should not be an afterthought to development. Placing electrical power lines in sight of the Jamestown Island is like placing electrical lines through Yellowstone Park.   To Congress this is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment.   That is just one reason to ban drones.   And the House Ethics Committee finally decided to actually do their job by making a finding of wrongdoing.    Wnd.com is not a reliable source for world news.

But the judge's ruling has embolden the anti-tenure diehards.    The story was picked up by Talking Points Memo on Monday and subsequently blew up on Reddit, where tales of Congressional corruption  particularly involving Republicans  are catnip   It is wrong and illegal for Congresspeople to take money in exchange for their vote. That is the law.   Best Congress money can buy.   It is a quid pro quo and illegal.   OP says oops.   I don't think this case is about public school personnel but about corrupt officials. We know that a number of private/religious school officials are just as corrupt as public school administrators.   Oops. My mistake. I have reposted the article from the original source.   The idea the soldiers were playing games in the trenches is a fascinating look at WW1. The diaries which talk about these 'sports' were recently released in the UK.

The GOP's rhetoric has been the Tea Party is in retreat. Tuesday's results show the Republican meme is not holding up.

It is on the front page of r/worldnews. If you think this story should be on other sites, post stories on those sites.   This was a very early story. There was no attempt to downplay the number of dead or missing.   I chose the first sentence of the story because it added detail if clumsily.    Just give it a rest. This is about the death of hundreds of Turks not about US politics.   That would be totally tragic. I'm just hoping an early news report like this is not accurate.   Do you think the US would have brought criminal charges against the company? I think not.   I guess you know of a bunch of jobs that no one else knows about. People take the jobs that are available if they pay $15/hr great. If not that one they take the one that pays only $7/hr.    That seems to be the opinion of a good number of redditors. I wished these people would work at a low paying job, as their only income without help from anyone else, before they make some of their insensitive comment.   The story has changed since it was originally posted. I'm thinking of deleting the story and reposting with the new headline and story.   An increase in the minimum wage usually means higher wages for many people whose wages are just above the new minimum.  	187

    Not. even. kidding. https://www.facebook.com/tyler.creek.37?hc_location=stream   YES! Today I was looking through this guy's profile and he is obsessed with diapers.  By scrolling down his news feed he had multiple pictures that said "share this if you're an adult that loves wearing diapers"...and then I looked through his profile pictures...big mistake...he had a picture of him in a diaper...never again.

             Thanks. It was a great night...cold as shit when I was facing the lake...but still a great time   This the standard Nikon kit lens   This is pretty much right off my chip except for some subtle tweaks to colours. That's the great thing about long exposure. .you don't need much edits if done right.   Great shot, that's actually the same one I was on - the shorter of the two, right?  I was trying to get onto the taller one but the stairwell I found ended up being the smaller one - on my way down I found where I should have gone!  Oh well, maybe next time!   "The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself"  :P   Thank You!!!   one of them, yes :P   Downtown Toronto    I prefer to keep them as secret as I can to preserve them for others to enjoy                  Yes, I have been through the entire property except for up the main terminal   thank you   Its fake   Thanks!   I was in here for over 4 hours when I took these photos and I really didn't even scratch the surface.  There were dozens upon dozens of old photo albums and personal items.  There were so many rooms and closets and cubbys that it would literally take a week to enjoy it all and take it all in..  As for napping - the house is now infested with Raccoons and the whole house is covered in raccoon feces......so I'll leave that with you to consider :P            I agree its not abandoned - but a walk through anything other than the main station certainly looks like something out of Life After People!!   I agree its not abandoned - but a walk through anything other than the main station certainly looks like something out of Life After People!!   Thanks, this is from a Nikon d3200, just subtle edits to tones really - nothing much,                                       It's a cat.  I've seen it since and now all the fur is gone - it is most definitely a cat.  I though the same thing up until I saw it again.   someone's gotta do it :P                                       Great work as always!   It's either flickr or how I processed it.

The Conclusions section is on pg. 836, 1st column, 5th paragraph. The quote that ""other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates" comes from the Conclusions section on pg. 836 and not from the Discussion section on pp. 838-840. I am quoting directly from the lead sentence of the Conclusions section, so I have trouble seeing how that is a distortion of the "conclusions" from the Discussion section.   How does that not suggest that they are more dangerous than "any other breed"?  Yes, it suggests that pit bulls can be dangerous (because they kill consistently each year). Yes, it suggests that they are more dangerous than **some** other breeds (because their fatalities are disproportionate to their breed population). No, it does not suggest that they are more dangerous than **any** other breed, which is why the conclusions of the report include that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates." This is clearly explained in the lead paragraph of the Discussion section:   Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.  I've already quoted this explanation in an earlier comment, but you seem to have trouble grasping why this definition of relative dangerousness negates your assertion (or you're willfully ignoring a basic principle of Statistics 101). So, let me put it into concrete numbers to demonstrate how it leads to the CDC's conclusion that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates" and contradicts your assertion that "they are more dangerous than any other breed."  * Breed X = Husky  * Breed Y = pit bull  * Breed X fatal attacks = 21 (Table 2 from CDC report)  * Breed Y fatal attacks = 76 (ibid.)  * Breed X population = 1.0% ([source](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf))  68M ([source for dog population in 2000](http://www.statista.com/statistics/198100/dogs-in-the-united-states-since-2000/)) = 0.7M  * Breed Y population = 6.7% (ibid.)  68M = 4.6M  So, the CDC's argument in concrete terms becomes the following:   Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 21 fatal attacks by Huskies relative to a population of 0.7 million Huskies (30.0/million) implies a greater risk than 76 attacks by pit bulls relative to a population of 4.6 million pit bulls (16.5/million). Without consideration of the population sizes, pit bulls would be [incorrectly] perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.  Does this concrete example using the CDC's fatality numbers make more clear why *some* other breeds is accurate but *any* other breed is inaccurate?   leads you to disregard the best available statistics in favor of willfully blind and frivolous pit bull advocacy  The best available statistics are those described by the CDC in the lead paragraph of their Discussion section, which leads to the lead sentence in their Conclusions section. Why do you choose to willfully ignore the best available statistics as described by the CDC and instead apply your own *ad hoc* statistics to raw data buried in the middle of the Discussion section so as to reach a conclusion that's directly contradicted by the CDC?   You are behaving in a way that has been documented to be typical of owners of "outlaw" breeds such as Pit Bulls.  I am not an owner of a pit bull. I am an owner of an "outlaw" breed only if Dachshunds are classified as such. [Here are my reddit posts of my four wiener dogs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dachshund/search?q=author%3Atrain_subject2472 restrict_sr=on) I am a dog lover and a research scientist specializing in the area of risk assessment, so my mind is clouded with bias on this issue only in the sense that I consider myself an expert in one particular aspect.   even worse is your post on /r/TheGentlePitbull  Please look more carefully at my comment threads about the same report that were posted on a different sub. I do not find the study compelling because breed was eliminated from the analysis due to large discordance between eye witness identifications, animal control reports, and police reports. I felt that the discordances should have been resolved (rather than thrown out) and that breed should have been included in the multivariate analysis. I emailed the principal author (Prof. Pastronek) suggesting as much and would be happy to share his responses with you by PM.   I never suggested that the CDC didn't find any evidence that pit bulls are dangerous. [I said](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/30xla3/if_my_son_so_much_as_cries_he_rushes_in_to_save/cpxgs58) that the CDC didn't find any "evidence that pit bulls are inherently **more** violent than any other breed" (emphasis for clarity). I don't see it as inconsistent or disingenuous to believe that pit bulls can be dangerous while also believing that they may be less dangerous than other breeds.   it is bizarre and confusing that you are focusing on the statement that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates"  I'm focusing on that specific statement because it directly contradicts your ([implied](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/30xla3/if_my_son_so_much_as_cries_he_rushes_in_to_save/cpxe6xa)) assertion that the CDC report is "evidence of [pit bulls] being more inherently violent than any other breed."    and not statements from the same report such as:  I don't think that it's bizarre or confusing to focus on the lead sentence of the Conclusions section rather than a paragraph buried in the middle of the Discussion section. Using your example statement from the Discussion section, the CDC researchers go on to indicate that the "breed-specific problem" might not be due to inherent dangerousness but might instead be due to sex (pg. 839, 1st column, 4th paragraph), to reproductive status (ibid.), to breed popularity over time (pg. 839, 2nd column, 1st paragraph), etc. If one focuses on individual parts of the Discussion section, then it can be easy to take those parts out of context and fall prey to confirmation bias. By contrast, the Conclusions section summarizes the totality of the research, not just piecemeal parts, and is less likely to suffer from bias (imho).   casual disregard for basic statistical analysis  What basic statistical analysis am I disregarding? It's the CDC, not me, that looked at fatality fractions and instead suggests that fatality rates are a better method to quantify relative dangerousness. It's the CDC, not me, that looked at "several interacting factors [which] affect a dogs propensity to bite." These are basic principles of statistical analysis used in risk assessment (base rates, univariate vs. multivariate models) which I appreciate that the CDC did not disregard in reaching their conclusions.   Would you please voluntarily step down from your position?  Feel free to bring this to the attention of my fellow mods on /r/science as evidence that I should be disqualified from their ranks. I think I'd greatly enjoy defending my support of the CDC's risk assessment methodology and conclusions.

You're right, the 2000 CDC report doesn't prove there is no evidence, only that one particular group of researchers didn't find any evidence 15 years ago. However, the problem is that /u/Good_timesd didn't cite the CDC in support of his argument; rather, **you** cited the CDC in support of **your** counter-argument. And that's why I'm confused. How does the CDC report constitute evidence that pit bulls are inherently more violent than any other breed when one of their conclusions is that "other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates?"   They reach the opposite conclusion (emphasis for clarity):   Although fatal attacks on humans appear to be a breed-specific problem (pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers), **other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates**.  Bite rate and fatality rate are equated with relative dangerousness by the CDC researchers on pg. 838 of the report:   Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.  In other words, the CDC researchers concede that pit bulls are responsible for a greater number of fatalities but indicate there is no evidence that they're responsible for a greater fatality rate, i.e., there's no evidence that they're inherently more violent. This supports /u/Good_timesd's statement that there's "no evidence of them being more inherently violent" and not your statement that it's "completely false."   I'm confused why you cite the [2000 CDC report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) as evidence that pit bulls are inherently more violent than any other breed when the researchers reach the opposite conclusion.

    This Egg Didn't Choose the Thug Life   Unless you're selling privately, 10% is the industry norm... (Flippa, Sedo, etc.) Afternic is 20%, however that'll probably change seeing that GoDaddy acquired them.   I can tackle it for you. I broker domains and process all exchanges thru Escrow.com to ensure an honest sale. Feel free to reach out.   I'm too lazy to search, so do trial and error. If a host rejects masking, it will just resolve to a blank white page. Then you'll know.  	5
 Call the cops, call the swat team, call the FBI, and buy a large dog and a machine gun. Go to your friend's house and camp out until the cops arrest him.   You know I kinda really wanna keep my soul, I think I need it, so i'll hang on to that. But thanks for the directions on how to get a bony old woman eat me though.   probably not   He hasn't hurt you of anything so I say you should let him stay, and glowing walls can be useful in the dark. So yeah that's what I think.   Well then.... that happened.   nothing, it was paint     I knew it! As soon as you said you and your mom were sitting in the backseat, I was thinking wouldn't your mom set in the front with your dad.   Dun dun daaaaa!   Doesn't Hell Girl give you a doll?   I don't know why, but I laughed when you said he was naked.   This is really interesting, but why didn't you just move the box elsewhere. I dunno like a church or something.    No I understood when she was talking about the missing posters and checking underneath the bed.   This story was amazing! It just fits together so perfectly, everything connected forming a bridge between the mysteries and secrets. And when they finally came together I was left feeling sadness and dread, amazement and fear. There's only few stories that can have that effect on people. So i'm gonna throw up, laugh, and cry now.   Best comment ever.   That's so messed up, yeah sorry....  	15
 At least you're honest   Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God. How does this not have 10,000 up votes yet    That's the most important thing. I'm glad you've been able to stay away from all those other things that people lose themselves in. Keep going man :) one day at a time    Don't worry. I'm always supportive of you.    Oh mother of God that was terrible I am so sorry    Fuck. I just posted that. Didn't see this. Damn. Fuck. Damn.    "So yes. It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing *because*. That's as easy as putting a penny In your pocket. But to love something *despite*. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect."   That's true. After a nuclear apocalypse people probably wouldn't care too much anymore    Except for the religious Christian folk    A woman's hands say a lot about how she feels. For example, if she's pointing a gun at you then she's probably angry.    You're toast    Up vote just for the edit    I still remember all the cheat codes from it XD   If you and a girl are adjacent and she uses her non-dominant hand to do something such as scratch her nose or pick something up but leaves her dominant hand down and at her side (adjacent to your hand), it usually means she wants to hold hands with you.  And yes, that is grammatically correct. It just sounds ridiculously run-onny   They took away my books...    Don't believe in yourself. Believe in the me that believes in you.    That's all that really matters   A blink is actually twice as sexy as a wink. Because you're closing TWO eyes instead of just one    Whenever she is thinking hard she will stick out her tongue the tiniest bit. And she has a really tiny tongue and she just sorta wiggles it around. She doesn't even know she does it. I pointed it out one time and she didn't believe me.    I probably laughed for a good 3 minutes at this    I laughed more from this than the parent comment   	21
 So we should lower taxes so people have more spending money?    No skiing?

Well this is the first CSU post I did.  Second, get the fuck off of Ralphie!   Trying to find them is God awful    Well there goes my summer    Winter snow accumulation? Well you've never been to Boulder. It snows one day and is gone the next. Unless it's been cold for days before snowing then the snow will just melt right off the panels on contact    Above average. It's enough that 20lbs isn't noticeable, or 50 in your case          Water level should be low enough by then    Go up flagstaff or sanitas and watch the Folsom field fireworks and the many others over the skyline    I'm sure there are, I just listed the ones I knew without searching. I was hoping people would post suggestion to make the last 70 days of off season go by    It's early but Paul Richardson (Seahawks) tore his ACL in his rookie season and missed the superbowl. He's come back in the past, hoping he can do it again    Pretty sure November 2011 is Sandusky    Did a quick search and it looks like a list hasn't been done in awhile, so let this be a list of cfb movies/documentaries on Netflix or online free sites.   Off the top of my head-  Happy Valley  30:30 the U Rudy    Wisconsi, not sure if it counts since it's my flair    I think they should have a field day once it's done, let people come check it out and throw a ball around.    It's definitely enough for lighting, like you said climate control would  be the issue. However  it's cool enough sept through bowl season to not need cooling. I'd imagine they have some very efficient insulation as well.  I believe I saw somewhere that the facility would also use a feedback loop for climate control, possibly with Folsom field. I've having issues finding it  Edit- [here's the same company working on making levi stadium net zero] (https://joinmosaic.com/blog/levis-49er-stadium-leads-net-zero-energy-race/)   Sure looked like panels when I walked past.    The burp girl     "indoor practice facility is partnering with SunPower to install a 55,000 square foot solar panel array that will generate 850kW of electricity.  Almost half of the roof will be covered with solar panels allowing it to be a net-zero electricity facility, meaning it creates more energy than it consumes. There will even be a live dashboard that will display how much energy is being produced, and other information about the panels on the roof mounted in the facility." [source](http://bsndenver.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-new-cu-facilities-part-1/).  The climate control will be by evaportive coolers. These use 1/8th the power of air conditioning. They can be used in Boulder because of the area's low humidity.   Edit- apparently there's a neighborhood in Boulder that is zero energy, from 2009 http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13878645   You forgot [this girl] (http://i.imgur.com/SE2KeCb.gif)   I think redoing the west side is in discussion. They mentioned tearing down Balch Field house. I really hope they manage to keep the field house but I guess they won't need it if they can put a floor down in the practice facility for non-football events. Expanding the concourse on coors has also been in discussion, I don't see how they do that with the little room to expand outside.    And burn away the shame of another loss    How about free weed?    I thought I would try writing my own type of construction update as I pass by the facilities daily.   Construction updates are all over /r/cfb so what makes this one unique? Green innovation.  The solar panels on the indoor practice facility have started being placed. The skeleton of the structure is viewable on the [construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799). So why do solar panels matter? They matter because the [indoor practice facility](http://www.cusustainableexcellence.com/ipf.html), 110,000 square feet, will be the only self-sustaining indoor practice facility in the country.   This isn't the first CU athletic facility to lead the nation in a green initiative, Folsom Field became the [first zero waste stadium in 2008] (http://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/zero-waste-football-games). This is all part of [Ralphie's Green Stampede] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1549812) that consists of many eco-friendly initiatives to keep CU as one of the greenest and most innovative universities.   The setting of CU on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is a constant reminder of why CU leads the way in building a more sustainable future.  The new facilities will also lead Colorado football into a brighter future, with sustained success to rival that of the 90's. After all, if you build it, they will come. Well, 3 people are coming so far....    Bless your heart    Seems like a lot of reps/sets. I'd suggest knocking off some of the high reps sets    Any suggestions for protein that's easy on the stomach?   I would rethink the reps. I do 5x5 and my weights go up 5lbs a week for bench and squat. I study exercise science and high weight with few reps will get your max strength higher while lower weight at high reps is more endurance. Its fast twitch vs slow twitch muscle fibers if your interested in checking it out    You don't look much bigger, part of being tall, but your shape has definitely improved. More of a chest and less of a gut. Size will come   Because you don't have birds chirping. Call me crazy but I hate birds, mostly because they have a nest outside my window so they wake me up at dawn    Hopefully in the next renovation...   Troughs.

Have a weed garden?  Honestly it's hard to get fans to show when you're surrounded by the rocky Mountains. Having night games would help    But........we have weed    TIL how it was made.  It would be very odd if a candidate didn't use red white and blue. Obama's campaign stood out because he was a younger guy with great marketing    I was referring more to the red white and blue self portraits, the hope and change. Obama's campaign was extremely visual    So the conservative version of  think progress?   Obama knew this  Edit- referring to the red white and blue street art posters    Home life does more to education than education itself    Poor poor liberal victim. Here have some hope and change.    But why male models?  Ben stiller forgot the line and was restarting the scene. It worked well    Leaving the hospital with the failed explosion    Obesity has a very simple fix, put down the fork.  However people with obesity have reasons for over eating usually associated with lack of discipline/confidence so food because emotional support    Ah memories. I made it to every pearl st bar that night, with a drink at each, after starting at half fast.   If CU starts out 5-0 with a win against Oregon, pearl st will have a real stampede    It's simple, we kill the batman.   But seriously you have to find the root cause, no its  not movies or video games, and fix that. I don't know enough to know that cause    http://www.amazon.com/MANGROOMER-Flushable-Personal-Engineered-Executive/dp/B0090N3SKM   As someone in Colorado, weed.    That's a day's worth of food for me   Only half price for the first 12 months.

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week.     If you actually read the misleading article, he said he trust South Carolina to handle it, he never said he was for the flag.    [Just like Clinton] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/)   Very misleading title. He never said he supports it. He called for it to be taken down years ago, then recently said he trusts South Carolina will handle it.   "The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week.     Fixing our violent culture would decrease gun deaths, stabbing, assualts, and any other way you harm someone       Like when you want to return an item to Amazon but they refund you and say don't bother returning it. How do they do that? Amazing    Being a liberal doesn't make you a hippie, but being a hippie makes it near certain you're a liberal. Close enough?    Except I can leave my house and comeback with a replacement phone 30min later. Other companies require you send it in    That customer service though    1% of the world consumes 99% of the world's food    And the majority of preventable illnesses are obesity related.

Money isn't the problem. It's students who don't care because of shitty home lives, teachers (some not all) that get lazy after getting tenure.    NRA fights that data collection because the data will show how much shootings occur. However that data won't show the reason behind it. The reason being the US is a violent country. Guns aren't the problem, society is.    [were just a violent country] (http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/20/america-is-a-violent-country/). Fix the violence, and gun deaths will go down. If you think violence will decrease without guns you are mistaken. The US still has an above average rate of stabbing and bare hand assualts when compared to other countries       I'm interested in how that would work. Do you have more info?   Edit- downvoted for being interested and wanting to learn something, never change /r/politics       I don't understand what you're getting at    Jeb Bush actually took down the flag in Florida back in 2000.    Changing US culture to not be as violent would be better than gun control. Most other first world countries aren't near as violent at the US.

 I feel your pain.   I'm glad someone else has seen this commercial. I thought I was going crazy. This is by far the creepiest commercial I've ever seen thigh.   Haha I noticed the toy in the background after I posted the pic. It's part of a toy phone.         I'm sure I could find a few. They have all kinds of outdated tech hiding around the house.      I want one of those!      You should post this in r/earthporn   Well excuse me.

 I really want to see your shawls!   Many people don't stuff the puffs as much as I do, so mine is going to be super heavy. I get cold really easily so I think it will be perfect!    You are an inspiration!    I'm shooting for 400. But you can make a small quilt with 250-275. Thank you so much!    Nope! I use my 4s for all of them!   I plan on doing Sailor Moon one day!    Me too! I'm on vacation and there's this amazing yarn shop nearby! I'm planning on getting at least four new yarns for this!   When I first started it took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to make one. But, now I can crank one out in about 50 minutes!   Oh wow! I loooove your pattern!   I actually only stuff them with scrap yarn or cheap red heart yarn. I think it works so much better than fiber fill or poly fill. Less messy too.    Oooooo! I'd love to see that!   Not yet. I'm debating whether or not to crochet them all together. It looks really neat but it spaces them out more. I like how they look all touching too, so I need to figure out what I like more.    I've used all different weights to make mine. The key is to keep the larger ones surrounded by medium sized ones, and then the smallest ones around the medium sized ones. I used every size yarn. Lace, fingering, worsted, and even bulky. That fuzzy one in the picture is one of the largest.       I'm 5'6 1/2". Gotta add that half in there. Haha. What's really weird, is when I was big, I was taller. I was 5'8" according to my doctor for about four years.    Will do! Keep an eye out! Thank you!    It took a year for the first 70, and I've been toning and working on my distance running this year, and I've dropped another ten. Thank you!   Eat less move more. Lol. ;) I'll be posting an update on my progress to /r/progresspics soon. Thanks!   I will be posting an update of my progress in a week or so. I've lost 80 pounds.    I actually do have some stretch marks, but they are very hard to see. I went to see a dermatologist and I was prescribed trinoin cream and had red light therapy. Thy are only visible if I stretch my skin a certain way in specific lighting.   	20

 God damn, just spent all this time trying to install it, finally I install the damn thing, then the network adapter is being a complete dick. It says it's in there somewhere, but whenever I run ifconfig, wlan0 isn't there, there no enable wifi in the connections menu, and it's not doing anything. ugh.  Edit: fixed after running around with an ethernet cable :)   Doing it! :D   Already got Debian, Kali and Ubuntu in a VM :D I was just unsure whether or not to go for a dual boot. I think I'm going to use Windows as gaming / production boot, and Ubuntu Linux as personal / files / general internet browsing :D I love the fact how secure Linux is, and how you can set it up to do anything!   Aha, very clear, I'll look into WINE and see if it can run the programs I'd like! :D Thanks for your reply :)  Edit: wow, runs everything I use on Windows apart from 1 or 2 things. *starts downloading Ubuntu*   Download [Speccy](http://www.filehippo.com/download_speccy) (by clicking that blue link)  Run it, and then click on Summary to the left, then click file  save as text  open it up  copy and paste the bit under Summary, all the way down to Audio. And post it to us.  Then we'll find you updated drivers, as it looks like a driver issue.   How on the earth have you got 200mbps interwebs? Teach me senpai.

 I really just want a cheaper version of a brogue boot. Something inexpensive, but still durable.

I definitely want burgundy as my color, but I am definitely open to looking into other styles, materials even (doesn't have to be leather, could be suede, what are options outside of suede burgundy CDBs?)   my question really is just how much is your heel supposed to move  	3

Like the title says, I need a liquid or gel-like substance that will lubricate the fretboard without rusting the stings or ruining the neck and frets with prolonged usage. Something that wont drip or run down the guitar would be great.  Edit: Thanks for all of the helpful information!      It's actually a duel map with 22 civs and 3 city states. I don't know how this was possible, but I am using quite a few mods. Thanks for the answer!

I've know that Mexico City has lots of museums and I'm looking forward to those. Sorry this is so vague right now, I wrote it in a hurry.   Edit: I'm looking for anything that might have to do with music, traditional music preferably, and also I'm interested in fruits from Mexico that might not be readily available in the united States.   This game looks really promising so far.   From the looks of it, the player chooses whether they want to play lead, rhythm or bass at the start up of the game. How long does it take and how complicated it is to switch between these in game?     I mean what is the best invention that makes our lives somewhat easier? Just some examples of the type of things I mean: scissors, band-aids, pens... simple objects. Sliced bread was first produced in 1928, so anything made after that is fair game.  	22

The rover used the panoramic camera (Pancam) between about 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. local Mars time to record images taken through different filters and combined into this mosaic view.  Most of the component images were recorded during the 2,888th Martian day, or sol, of Opportunity's work on Mars (March 9, 2012). At that time, Opportunity was spending low-solar-energy weeks of the Martian winter at the Greeley Haven outcrop on the Cape York segment of Endeavour's western rim. In order to give the mosaic a rectangular aspect, some small parts of the edges of the mosaic and sky were filled in with parts of an image acquired earlier as part of a 360-degree panorama from the same location.  Opportunity has been studying the western rim of Endeavour Crater since arriving there in August 2011. This crater spans 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter, or about the same area as the city of Seattle. This is more than 20 times wider than Victoria Crater, the largest impact crater that Opportunity had previously examined. The interior basin of Endeavour is in the upper half of this view.  The mosaic combines about a dozen images taken through Pancam filters centered on wavelengths of 753 nanometers (near infrared), 535 nanometers (green) and 432 nanometers (violet). The view is presented in false color to make some differences between materials easier to see, such as the dark sandy ripples and dunes on the crater's distant floor.

Jets of water ice and vapor emanating from the south pole of Enceladus, which hint at subsurface sea rich in organics, and liquid hydrocarbons ponding on the surface on the surface of Titan make these two of the most fascinating moons in the Saturnian system.  Enceladus (313 miles, or 504 kilometers across) is in the center of the image. Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across) glows faintly in the background beyond the rings. This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Enceladus and the Saturn-facing side of Titan. The northern, sunlit side of the rings is seen from just above the ringplane.  The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 12, 2012. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 600,000 miles (1 million kilometers) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 36 degrees. Image scale is 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel on Enceladus.

NASA's Aviation Safety Program is developing technology for improved sensors to help spot changes in vibration, speed, temperature and emissions which are symptomatic of engine glitches. These advanced sensors could alert ground crews to problems that can be eliminated with preventive maintenance before becoming serious safety concerns. Ultimately, the sensors could alert pilots to the presence of destructive volcanic ash particles too small for the eyes to see, giving more time for evasive action to prevent engine damage in flight.

The view, from over a point centered at 46.56 degrees south latitude and 164.33 degrees east longitude, focuses on an area just west of the south end of South Island, New Zealand and was taken about 3:19 a.m. New Zealand time, March 7, 2012. Illumination and the relative motion of features in the overall series of photos suggest that the view is towards the south to southeast with the approaching dawn to the left and a strong band of Aurora Australis, from left to right. A Russian Soyuz and a Russian Progress vehicle are seen center and right in the foreground, respectively.   caption: Dusty Mars Rover's Self Portrait  This self portrait from NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity shows dust accumulation on the rover's solar panels as the mission approached its fifth Martian winter. The dust reduces the rover's power supply, and the rover's mobility is limited until the winter is over or wind cleans the panels.  This is a mosaic of images taken by Opportunity's panoramic camera (Pancam) during the 2,111th to 2,814th Martian days, or sols, of the rover's mission (Dec. 21 to Dec. 24, 2011). The downward-looking view omits the mast on which the camera is mounted.  The portrait is presented in approximate true color, the camera team's best estimate of what the scene would look like if humans were there and able to see it with their own eyes.  Opportunity has worked through four Martian southern hemisphere winters since it landed in in January 2004 about 14 miles (23 kilometers) northwest of its current location. Closer to the equator than its twin rover, Spirit, Opportunity has not needed to stay on a sun-facing slope during the previous winters. Now, however, Opportunity's solar panels carry a thicker coating of dust, and the team is using a strategy employed for three winters with Spirit: staying on a sun-facing slope. The sun will pass relatively low in the northern sky from the rover's perspective for several months of shortened daylight before and after the southern Mars winter solstice on March 30, 2012. Opportunity is conducting research while located on the north-facing slope of a site called "Greeley Haven."   Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/Arizona State Univ.   Caption: Sunspots and Solar Flares  NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) captured this image of an M7.9 class flare on March 13, 2012 at 1:29 p.m. EDT. It is shown here in the 131 Angstrom wavelength, a wavelength particularly good for seeing solar flares and a wavelength that is typically colorized in teal. The flare peaked at 1:41 p.m. EDT. It was from the same active region, No. 1429, that produced flares and coronal mass ejections the entire week. The region has been moving across the face of the sun since March 2, and will soon rotate out of Earth view.  A solar flare is an intense burst of radiation coming from the release of magnetic energy associated with sunspots. Flares are our solar systems largest explosive events. They are seen as bright areas on the sun and last from mere minutes to several hours.   Scientists classify solar flares according to their x-ray brightness. There are 3 categories: X-, M- and C-class. X-class flares are the largest of these events. M-class flares are medium-sized; they can cause brief radio blackouts that affect Earth's polar regions. Compared to X- and M-class, C-class flares are small with few noticeable consequences on Earth.   Image Credit: NASA/SDO   Caption: The Serpent Dust Devil of Mars  A towering dust devil, casts a serpentine shadow over the Martian surface in this image acquired by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.   The scene is a late-spring afternoon in the Amazonis Planitia region of northern Mars. The view covers an area about four-tenths of a mile (644 meters) across. North is toward the top. The length of the dusty whirlwind's shadow indicates that the dust plume reaches more than half a mile (800 meters) in height. The plume is about 30 yards or meters in diameter.   A westerly breeze partway up the height of the dust devil produced a delicate arc in the plume. The image was taken during the time of Martian year when the planet is farthest from the sun. Just as on Earth, winds on Mars are powered by solar heating. Exposure to the sun's rays declines during this season, yet even now, dust devils act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust, a little at a time.   This view is one product from an observation made by HiRISE on Feb. 16, 2012, at 35.8 degrees north latitude, 207 degrees east longitude. Other image products from the same observation are at http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_026051_2160 .   HiRISE is one of six instruments on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Fuckin' teabaggers.   full caption: Beside a Giant  Saturn's largest moon, Titan, looks small here, pictured to the right of the gas giant in this Cassini spacecraft view.   Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across) is in the upper right. Saturn's rings appear across the top of the image, and they cast a series of shadows onto the planet across the middle of the image.   The moon Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) appears as a tiny white speck above the rings in the far upper right of the image. The shadow cast by Prometheus can be seen as a small black speck on the planet on the far left of the image, between the shadows cast by the main rings and the thin F ring. The shadow of the moon Pandora also can be seen on the planet south of the shadows of all the rings, below the center of the image towards the right side of the planet. Pandora is not shown here.   This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from about 1 degree below the ringplane.   The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 5, 2012 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 426,000 miles (685,000 kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 20 degrees. Image scale is 23 miles (37 kilometers) per pixel on Saturn. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

During the six-hour, 15-minute spacewalk, Kononenko and Shkaplerov moved the Strela-1 crane from the Pirs Docking Compartment in preparation for replacing it in 2012 with a new laboratory and docking module. The duo used another boom, the Strela-2, to move the hand-operated crane to the Poisk module for future assembly and maintenance work. Both telescoping booms extend like fishing rods and are used to move massive components outside the station. On the exterior of the Poisk Mini-Research Module 2, they also installed the Vinoslivost Materials Sample Experiment, which will investigate the influence of space on the mechanical properties of the materials. The spacewalkers also collected a test sample from underneath the insulation on the Zvezda Service Module to search for any signs of living organisms. Both spacewalkers wore Russian Orlan spacesuits bearing blue stripes and equipped with NASA helmet cameras.  Image Credit: NASA   Photo credit: Martial Trezzini / EPA   Maybe not in public...

Image credit: NASA    Caption: Opportunity's Eighth Anniversary View From 'Greeley Haven' (False Color)  This mosaic of images taken in mid-January 2012 shows the windswept vista northward (left) to northeastward (right) from the location where NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity is spending its fifth Martian winter, an outcrop informally named "Greeley Haven."   Opportunity's Panoramic Camera (Pancam) took the component images as part of full-circle view being assembled from Greeley Haven.   The view includes sand ripples and other wind-sculpted features in the foreground and mid-field. The northern edge of the the "Cape York" segment of the rim of Endeavour Crater forms an arc across the upper half of the scene.   Opportunity landed on Mars on Jan. 25, 2004, Universal Time and EST (Jan. 24, PST). It has driven 21.4 miles (34.4 kilometers) as of its eighth anniversary on the planet. In late 2011, the rover team drove Opportunity up onto Greeley Haven to take advantage of the outcrop's sun-facing slope to boost output from the rover's dusty solar panels during the Martian winter.   Research activities while at Greeley Haven include a radio-science investigation of the interior of Mars, inspections of mineral compositions and textures on the outcrop, and monitoring of wind-caused changes on scales from dunes to individual soil particles.   The image combines exposures taken through Pancam filters centered on wavelengths of 753 nanometers (near infrared), 535 nanometers (green) and 432 nanometers (violet). The view is presented in false color to make some differences between materials easier to see.   Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/Arizona State Univ.   Caption: Closest Dione Flyby  Flying past Saturn's moon Dione, Cassini captured this view which includes two smaller moons, Epimetheus and Prometheus, near the planet's rings.   The image was taken in visible light with Cassini's narrow-angle camera during the spacecraft's flyby of Dione on Dec. 12, 2011. This encounter was the spacecraft's closest pass of the moon's surface, but, because this flyby was intended primarily for other Cassini instruments, it did not yield Cassini's best images of the moon. Higher resolution images were obtained during earlier flybys (see PIA07638).   Dione (698 miles, or 1,123 kilometers across) is closest to Cassini here and is on the left of the image. Potato-shaped Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) appears above the rings near the center top of the image. Epimetheus (70 miles, or 113 kilometers across) is on the right.   This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from less than one degree above the ring plane. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 67,000 miles (108,000 kilometers) from Dione. Image scale is 2,122 feet (647 meters) per pixel on Dione.

Larger Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across) is on the left. Tethys (660 miles, or 1,062 kilometers across) is near the center of the image. This view looks toward the Saturn-facing sides of Tethys and Titan. The angle also shows the northern, sunlit side of the rings from less than one degree above the ring plane. The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 7, 2011. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles (2.2 million kilometers) from Tethys and 1.9 million miles (3.1 million kilometers) from Titan.

Image Credit: NASA   Caption: Orange and Blue Hazes  This view from NASA's Cassini spacecraft looks toward the south polar region of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, and shows a depression within the moon's orange and blue haze layers near the south pole.  The moon's high altitude haze layer appears blue here; whereas, the main atmospheric haze is orange. The difference in color could be due to particle size of the haze. The blue haze likely consists of smaller particles than the orange haze.   The depressed or attenuated layer appears in the transition area between the orange and blue hazes about a third of the way in from the left edge of the narrow-angle image. The moon's south pole is in the upper right of this image. This view suggests Titan's north polar vortex, or hood, is beginning to flip from north to south.   The southern pole of Titan is going into darkness as the sun advances towards the north with each passing day. The upper layer of Titan's hazes is still illuminated by sunlight.  Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were obtained on Sept. 11, 2011 at a distance of approximately 83,000 miles (134,000 kilometers) from Titan. Image scale is 2,581 feet (787 meters) per pixel.

This means that materials used to extinguish the fire must be present in higher concentrations. The slow flow of air from the fans mixing the air in a spacecraft can make the flames burn even faster.   To help understand how flames behave and burn in space, FLEX researchers ignite a small drop of either heptane or methanol. As this little sphere of fuel burns for about 20 seconds, it is engulfed by a spherically symmetric flame. The droplet shrinks until either the flame extinguishes or the fuel runs out."

Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute   Caption: The Moon's North Pole  The Earth's moon has been an endless source of fascination for humanity for thousands of years. When at last Apollo 11 landed on the moon's surface in 1969, the crew found a desolate, lifeless orb, but one which still fascinates scientist and non-scientist alike.  This image of the moon's north polar region was taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, or LROC. One of the primary scientific objectives of LROC is to identify regions of permanent shadow and near-permanent illumination. Since the start of the mission, LROC has acquired thousands of Wide Angle Camera images approaching the north pole. From these images, scientists produced this mosaic, which is composed of 983 images taken over a one month period during northern summer. This mosaic shows the pole when it is best illuminated, regions that are in shadow are candidates for permanent shadow.   Image Credit: NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University   Caption: ... And on the 2,690th Martian Day  NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity used its navigation camera to take this picture showing a light-toned rock, nicknamed Tisdale 2, on its 2,690th Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars (Aug. 18, 2011). The rock is about 12 inches (30 centimeters) tall.   In subsequent sols, the rover used tools on its robotic arm to examine Tisdale 2. That rock and others on the ground beyond it were apparently ejected by the impact that excavated a 66-foot-wide (20-meter-wide) crater, called Odyssey, which is nearby to the left of this scene. Odyssey and these rocks are on a low ridge called Cape York, which is a segment of the western rim of Endeavour crater. Part of Opportunity's array of photovoltaic cells is visible in the foreground.

Caption: Testing Orion  Technicians position microphones around the Orion MPCV, or Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, and LAS, or Launch Abort System, test craft in preparation for the second round of testing in the acoustic chamber at Lockheed Martins facilities near Denver in late August 2011. The vehicle was bombarded by acoustic levels of 150 decibels to simulate conditions during launch and abort, if necessary.   Image Credit: Lockheed Martin   Caption: Ophir Chasma  During its examination of Mars, the Viking 1 spacecraft returned images of Valles Marineris, a huge canyon system 5,000 km, or about 3,106 miles, long, whose connected chasma or valleys may have formed from a combination of erosional collapse and structural activity. This synthetic oblique view shows Ophir Chasma, the northern most one of the connected valleys of Valles Marineris. For scale, the large impact crater in lower right corner is about 18.5 miles, or 30 km, wide.  Ophir Chasma is a large west-northwest-trending trough about 62 miles, or 100 km, wide. The Chasma is bordered by high-walled cliffs, most likely faults, that show spur-and-gully morphology and smooth sections. The walls have been dissected by landslides forming reentrants. The volume of the landslide debris is more than 1,000 times greater than that from the May 18, 1980, debris avalanche from Mount St. Helens. The longitudinal grooves seen in the foreground are thought to be due to differential shear and lateral spreading at high velocities.   Image Credit: NASA/JPL/USGS   Caption: Long Way From Home  This picture of a crescent-shaped Earth and Moon -- the first of its kind ever taken by a spacecraft -- was recorded Sept. 18, 1977, by NASA's Voyager 1 when it was 7.25 million miles (11.66 million kilometers) from Earth.   This photo was made from three images taken through color filters, then processed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Because the Earth is many times brighter than the moon, the moon was artificially brightened so that both bodies would show clearly in the prints.

The heat shield impact site is identified by the circle of red dust on the right side of the picture. In this view, Opportunity is approximately 66 feet (20 meters) from the heat shield, which protected it while hurtling through the Martian atmosphere.  In the far left of the image, a meteorite called 'Heat Shield Rock' sits nearby, as the sun reflected off the silver-colored underside of the internal thermal blankets of the heat shield. The rover spent 36 sols investigating how the severe heating during entry through the atmosphere affected the heat shield. The most obvious is the fact that the heat shield inverted upon impact.  This is an approximately true-color rendering of the scene acquired around 1:22 p.m. local solar time on Opportunity sol 324 (Dec. 21, 2004) in an image mosaic using panoramic filters at wavelengths of 750, 530, and 430 nanometers. Opportunity has now spent more than 2,680 sols, or Martian days, on the Red Planet.   Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell   Caption: Preparing for Testing  Standing five stories tall fully stacked, the Launch Abort System was mounted atop the Orion MPCV, or Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, last week at the Lockheed Martins facilities near Denver. Orion is being prepared for the next round of testing in an acoustic chamber. Each test will expose the Orion MPCV and its launch abort system to acoustic levels exceeding 150 decibels while instruments record the vehicles response.   The test vehicles will provide critical data used to model the spacecraft's capabilities to perform deep space exploration missions. The vehicles will undergo testing at sound pressure levels that emulate those experienced at launch and in the event an abort is needed to carry the crew to safety away from a potential problem on the launch pad or during ascent.  Image Credit: Lockheed Martin   Caption: Cleveland Volcano, Aleutian Islands  At 3:00 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time on May 23, 2006, Flight Engineer Jeff Williams from International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 13 contacted the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) to report that the Cleveland Volcano had produced a plume of ash. Shortly after the activity began, he took this photograph. This picture shows the ash plume moving west-southwest from the volcanos summit. A bank of fog (upper right) is a common feature around the Aleutian Islands. The event proved to be short-lived; two hours later, the plume had completely detached from the volcano. The AVO reported that the ash cloud height could have been as high as 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) above sea level.  Cleveland Volcano, situated on the western half of Chuginadak Island, is one of the most active of the volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, which extend west-southwest from the Alaska mainland. It is a stratovolcano, composed of alternating layers of hardened lava, compacted volcanic ash, and volcanic rocks.   Image credit: NASA    Caption: Opportunity's View of the Rim of Endeavour  NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity used its panoramic camera to capture this view of Endeavour Crater's rim after a drive during the rover's 2,676th Martian day, or sol, of working on Mars (Aug. 4, 2011). The drive covered 396 feet (120.7 meters) and put the rover with about that much distance to go before reaching the chosen arrival site at the rim, called 'Spirit Point.'  Endeavour Crater has been the rover team's destination for Opportunity since the rover finished exploring Victoria crater in August 2008. Endeavour, with a diameter of about 14 miles (22 kilometers), offers access to older geological deposits than any Opportunity has seen before. This view looks toward a portion of the rim south of Spirit Point, including terrain that Opportunity may explore in the future.

During the six-hour, 23-minute spacewalk, the Expedition 28 flight engineers moved a cargo boom from one airlock to another, installed a prototype laser communications system and deployed an amateur radio micro-satellite.  Image Credit: NASA   Caption: This Is What the Moon Looks Like From Space  On Sunday, July 31, 2011, when Expedition 28 astronaut Ron Garan aboard the International Space Station looked out his window, this is what he saw: the moon. And, he saw it 16 times. Said Garan, "We had simultaneous sunsets and moonsets." For Garan and the rest of the station crew, this extraordinary event is a daily occurrence. Since the station orbits the Earth every 90 minutes, each day the crew experiences this about 16 times a day.

The mission's rover will be placed on the ground in a northern portion of the crater in August 2012. This view of Gale is a mosaic of observations made in the visible-light portion of the spectrum by the Thermal Emission Imaging System camera on NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter.   Gale crater is 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter and holds a layered mountain rising about 3 miles (5 kilometers) above the crater floor. The portion of the crater within the planned landing area north of the mountain has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments. The lower layers of the nearby mountain -- within driving distance for Curiosity -- contain minerals indicating a wet history.   The intended landing site is at 4.5 degrees south latitude, 137.4 degrees east longitude.   The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is being perpared for launch during the period Nov. 25 to Dec. 18, 2011. In a prime mission lasting one Martian year -- nearly two Earth years -- after landing, researchers will use the rover's tools to study whether the landing region has had environmental conditions favorable for supporting microbial life and for preserving clues about whether life existed.

I'm still waiting for him to make good on his offer to be waterboarded for charity.    Unordered Fracturing Olive?   CNN is still trying to outfox Fox.   Fuck the rule of law.  He's guilty because the media says he is. Right?   lol, nice argument. Are you a lawyer?   Manning was tried in the media, not in any U.S. court.   yes   Maybe you should work at work.   Fox News isn't gonna ignore her, she's on their payroll.  I would love to ignore her, but that won't make her go away.  Ignoring her now will make opposing her in 2012 that much harder.   Ignore her and she'll go away right?   yumz   Also, she used her notes throughout the whole word salad speech -- including immediately after she made the teleprompter jab. Also youbetcha and such.   So you are changing your original comment from "Islam is not a race." to "wikipedia doesn't say the film is racist, so it isn't."   So it's not possible for the DVD to be both racist and anti-Islam?   RIP   *brap*   Caption: This astronaut photograph shows the Calabria region of southern Italy--the toe of Italy's "boot"--outlined by the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas to the southeast and northwest, respectively. The water appears almost mirror-like due to sunglint. This phenomenon is caused by sunlight reflecting off the water surface directly back towards the observer aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS was located over northwestern Romania, to the northeast of Calabria, when this image was taken.  The Calabrian Peninsula appears shortened and distorted due to the extreme sideways viewing angle from the ISS. Such a perspective is termed oblique, as opposed to a nadir view, in which the astronaut is looking directly downwards towards the Earth's surface from the ISS. This highly oblique view also highlights two distinct cloud patterns over the Calabrian interior. Patchy, highly textured cumulus clouds are present at lower altitudes, while grey altostratus clouds are stretched out by prevailing winds at higher altitudes. The Strait of Messina, just visible at image upper right, marks the boundary between the coastline of Italy and the island of Sicily.  Image Credit: NASA   GM is good at that.   Fucking leeches    Caption: As interest in Earth's changing climate heats up, a tiny dark particle is stepping into the limelight: black carbon. Commonly known as soot, black carbon enters the air when fossil fuels and biofuels, such as coal, wood, and diesel are burned. Black carbon is found worldwide, but its presence and impact are particularly strong in Asia.  Black carbon, a short-lived particle, is in perpetual motion across the globe. The Tibetan Plateau's high levels of black carbon likely impact the region's temperature, clouds and monsoon season.   Caption: NASAs Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket at 9:09 a.m. EST from Space Launch Complex-2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. WISE will scan the entire sky in infrared light, picking up the glow of hundreds of millions of objects and producing millions of images.   Image Credit: Bill Hartenstein/United Launch Alliance    caption:  This view from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is of the Proctor Crater. The relatively bright, small ridges are ripples. From their study on Earth, and close-up examination by the MER rovers (roving elsewhere on Mars), scientists surmise that the ripples are composed of fine sand (less than 200 microns in diameter) or fine sand coated with coarser sand and granules.  The larger, darker bedforms are dunes composed of sand, most likely of fine size. Ripples tend to move slower than dunes. Because of this, over time, ripples get covered with dust, possibly explaining the bright tone visible here. The dunes are dark probably because they are composed of basaltic sand (derived from dark, volcanic rock) that is blown by the wind enough that dust does not sufficiently accumulate to change their color.  This area in Proctor Crater is being monitored by HiRISE to document any changes over time.  This image is a portion of the HiRISE observation taken on Feb. 9, 2009.

 I just hit 200 days smoke and nicotine free.  According to my quit smoking app on android (QuitNow!) i have avoided 8003 cigarettes saved $2000.75 and added 33 days and 8 hours to my life.  I don't even miss it anymore. It was a long and struggling couple of years to get here also.  I made a new years resolution to quit on Jan 1st, 2012 which lasted 3 days, started and stopped over and over for a couple months in early 2012, abandoned the quest for a while, made a few other daring quit attempts in 2012.  In 2013 I hit a 3 month span (my longest ever at the time) where I quit but I got complacent and fidured I could have "just one".  There is no such thing, a few more small attempts then August 8th, 2013 was my last cigarette, now at 200 days smoke and nicotine free, just over 6 months,a nd I'm NEVER going back.  :)  EDIT: after my last relapse, summer 2013, I was really depressed over failing yet again, my dad told me, "The man who never gives up, never fails." which fueled me to push on in this quit and make it succeed.  I am 34  years old, and have been smoking for 17 years, and towards the end I was up to 2 packs (40 cigarettes) a day.  Freedom!   Praise the Sun!   thanks :)   It was tough at first, REALLY tough, and I had several false starts, but after about 30 days I stopped obsessing about it and started to feel normal again.  Now I'm 4 months and change and it's easy and trigger come once in a blue moon but they are so quiet and so quick that it is of no consequence.   there aren't any T-shirts on the official arch schwag site, but I've bought some lanyards and other stuff from them here: http://schwag.archlinux.ca/  Also as mentioned by Jethro_Tell zazzle has a lot of t-shirts and other Arch merch: http://www.zazzle.com/arch+linux+gifts     it has NO features other than a back and forward button, but here is a script I use (I didn't write this) for a python browser using pyqt4 and qtwebkit https://github.com/train_subject3168/Random-Scripts/blob/master/pybrowser.py save and run with python3   I think the average smoker starts at age 13...I would advise quitting earlier instead of thinking "I can always quit later" cause that's what most of us thought, before we knew it decades had passed.  	7
 I have a cousins 21st dinner and can't order the usual water or juice without giving away the pregnancy. They know I wouldn't pass up a drink or two otherwise.   I've seen lemon lime bitters served to children. But was recently informed they still contain alcohol. Should a glass or two with tea matter? or have you any other suggestions as to drinks that appear alcoholic but aren't? Haha.  	1
 exactly what it's like at Campises in Dallas       Hotty Toddy!   Snakon   anyone else read that with the voice of Bruce from family guy in their head   not to sound like an idiot but he is in his grave still promoting stuff?   definitely looks like Chuckie when he squeezes the face in    looks like a mix of cam newton and rg3    I am starting to see the whole Deb poisoning herself theory to be true. Yes, Dexter found a blonde hair in the bathroom, but does anyone not remember the kids staying over at Deb's place because of Isaak being after him. The hair could of easily been Harrison's, but helped Dexter believe it truly was Hannah attempting to poison Deb. just saying   Normal people can see a horse, geniuses can see a frog, but everyone will see Sarah Jessica Parker      I feel bad for the gangloff picture...no one points it out    meow means meow   fail    Got Milk!   if you look into his eyes he slowly turns into Morgan Freeman   Roll tide    PCP it's dynamite   deyyy toook arrrr jobbbsss   all I can think is Puff Daddy missing Biggie and Jesus seeing him    my bad  	21

    What is the single best Lieh Tzu book to get?                                                                                     Just discovered him.  I'm guessing most of you will recommend 'Tropic of Cancer' as the place to start.  But please tell me what his best books are, and why.                                                                                                                                               I know they both won Nobel prizes for literature.  But how is their non-philosophical writing regarded?  And do they compare to each other as writers? I am not asking about anything to do with their work as philosophers per se.   EDIT: For clarity.                                        List your top 1 or 2 or 6 or whatever.  By "important" I mean that eventual history should also determine them to have been important now.  But list whoever you think is important.  EDIT: Yes, old people count.            Looking for some good non-fiction CIA books, about their exploits, a caper, or operation, or about something a particular officer did.  Not general historical overview stuff, but a particular account.  Could also be a book about investigations *of*, or collaborations with, the CIA by others.            Would prefer page-turners, accounts of real events, crimes, investigations, conspiracies, with intrigue, etc.  Thanks!                                                                                                Does anyone know the easiest way, or any way, to get AutoCAD files into Illustrator? Thanks.       I'm somewhat new to Taoism and have arrived at a big question, or questions.  What I'm reading describes the uncarved block, and the watercourse way; basically, that nature is It. Nature is the One and only. Man should look to nature for the Way things are, and seek to live in harmony, and be united with, this Way. I'm clear on this insofar as nature is concerned. However, what about other people? Aren't other people full of all sorts of complications, delusions, misapprehensions, constructs, deceptions? If other people deviate from Nature, or the Way, aren't they outside it, or apart from it? Does Taoism include other people as part of Nature - because they may operate very differently than any sort of pure thing? Nature is lions eating antelope. Nature is the strong consuming the weak. Nature is the Law of the Jungle. Am I to assume that Taoism affirms this when it comes to people as well? What about the corrupt (politicians, banksters, mafia, etc.)? They deceive and devour anything in their way. Are they the lion, and thereby justified in their strength over the weak? Does might make right?  *What does Taoism say about this?*  And there is this from The Tao Te Ching: "Nature is unkind: It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs.  The Sage is unkind: He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs."  Lao Tzu  So....this is *potentially* an aspect of Taoism that viscerally repels me - the amoral, "I'm going to charm you then eat you", Law of the Jungle aspect. Am I understanding it correctly? Is there anything I'm not getting? What would Chuang Tzu think of Bernie Madoff? Please give me any information or direction you might think useful. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.  **TL;DR** Taoism is about nature, about the Way. This would include the lion eating the antelope, the Law of the Jungle. What about when it comes to other people? How are we to regard other people and their delusions and deceptions?  As part of nature? Does Taoism deem it natural to "eat" (notice the quotes) and conquer other people? What would Chuang Tzu think of Bernie Madoff?  **EDIT**  To clarify, I omitted the anecdote about the Taoist who betrayed me - to which most comments have been directed and which was obscuring my real questions. I'm not asking how I should have handled or interpreted the situation with my business partner as much as I am asking:  What does Taoism say about other people who betray and deceive, etc.?  Does it consider them a part of nature or not?  I would appreciate direct answers to this, if possible.  I want to learn about Taoism and am not seeking to process any event in my past.                              How would you compare AutoCAD for Mac vs. AutoCAD for PC?  I know Mac's are a far superior platform.  Is there any reason to get the PC version if price is not an object?  Thanks.  EDIT: In other words, do the advantages of using a Mac outweigh the disadvantages of using AutoCAD for Mac, if any?  I will not be needing any other software.                      From *Walking It Off*, by Doug Peacock:  "Ed Abbey had little use for organized religion but nevertheless believed there were observable guidelines for living, an accessible wisdom residing in the land, often tapped into by the native peoples, observing the natural world for the appropriate cycle of life.  Ed had always called the Taoist philosopher, Chuang-Tzu, the first anarchist.  Tao or Dao, means the Way or the Path, and this image (the nature of truth as trail) is far older than literature.  All ancient and traditional people had a Path and knew the seeking of the Way, and these instructions were often remarkable in their similarities.  It is the organic way for humans to know and think about their place on earth.  For Ed, the Way was wild nature, and the Path was a person walking in it utterly attentive.  That place was our original habitat, the wilderness, the Heart of the Lotus, and it was less a path than an off-trail bushwhack.  'When your mind is empty like a valley,' said Lao-tse, 'then you will know the power of the Way.'"                                               	164
 well get it back. why get rid of a perfectly good console?   1. Dead or Alive 2  2. Dead or Alive 3  3. Dead or Alive 4  Dead or Alive 5 doesn't exist. It is not a real DOA game.    ok I'll rent Dark Souls 2. then you only have to worry about the pug shirt.    go to E3   if you buy me a copy of dark souls 2  also buy me a pug shirt. I wear a men's small.   buy reach   sadly I do not own a PS3   I bought Ground Zeroes for the Xbox One (way too short but pretty enjoyable). Is it worth it to buy Metal Gear Solid 2, 3 and Peace Walker? I am obviously new to the series and want to have some Metal Gear Solid background before The Phantom Pain is released.   Cool, but you're going to have to have it removed once Fallout stops being the "it" game. Replace it with one representing the new most popular game. repeat. you've got yourself a never-ending karma generator.    The Witcher 3   It seems you would enjoy The Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones (if you're a fan of the show/books).   It's the "expansion pass," meaning you are able to buy all upcoming expansions now, and download them when they are released.   umm... no, it has not been released yet...      I can't wait!   only if you cut yourself really deeply. no pussy shit. but in the end it won't solve anything so *put the fucking knife down*   plot twist I'm a masochist. whip me, big boy. *rawr*   ..................*sobs*   my Son... violence is *never* the answer! this is *not* how you become a magoo!   ikr   Cease this insolence, my Son.    What do you mean, my Son?   I have a baby face. And I'm white, my Son.   srs. I'm doing ICF while fasted. no real gains yet   I am Father Magoo. AKA not a troll   That's Father Magoo to you, sonny.   Doge   no, but the one to the left of it is   100% Doge   Ok then, it is settled. I am fasting for at least 2 months.   So that I can be judged by my facial features.    Respect the Doge.   Dammit! So there is a chance that you think I am fat! I am cutting now!   I'm sorry, I just am very insecure.    Please be honest. No trolling. If just one person says I am fat, I will immediately start cutting. This is a very sensitive subject as I used to be obese and cut down until I was admitted to a mental hospital for anorexia. All I am asking is for you to be honest. I am uncomfortable taking my shirt off because I have loose skin.          Witcher 3  Witcher 3 Expansion Pass  Arkham Knight   I'm not saying I don't agree, but you have to respect the fact that the thread calls for only 6 games for whatever reason.   I recently bought that. Should I wait to play it until I finish Borderlands 2, or is it unnecessary to know the stories of the previous Borderlands games to appreciate the story of this game?   "I don't do the whole top X deal"  then don't post on a thread about "top X"     The Witcher 3; Shadow of Mordor; Sunset Overdrive; Wolfenstein: The New Order (and The Old Blood); Borderlands: The Handsome Collection; Halo MCC   Ok, good. Imlerith took me like 5 tries to defeat.    I feel like such a dumbass.   How difficult is Eredin compared to Imlerith?    ...oh  well I look like a complete idiot now.   How difficult is Eredin compared to Imlerith?    They do not stop regenerating their health. It doesn't matter how long I spend fighting them; they always get back to nearly full health. What do I do? I'm at level 31 btw. Should I go back to my save before the On Thin Ice quest and level up/upgrade gear?   The Brothers Karamazov    My Daughter, penises come in different lengths, thicknesses, and colors. Obviously as you did not know this, you are young and innocent. Please leave this Forum, as I do not want your innocence ruined.     My Daughter, you cannot limit the Children of the Garden of Men to describe my Sons as a whole in merely five words. This is *not* how you become a Magoo.   not funny   "that's the cool motherfucker that has a prius. BUT I DOUBT IT."  pls dont hurt me. im an adidas guy too, richie. can we be friends?    where is Jeff Seld   Chess   My Son, every Man or Manlet in the Garden of Men and Manlets with disordered eating does not know that he indeed has an eating disorder. Stay safe, my Son.   2 wet seasons, 2 dry seasons. well, at least it's something. D   My Son, please seek help at the Temple of Magoo, for you have what is called in the Garden of Men an "eating disorder." Usually only my Daughters have this Condition, but that is irrelevant. Please seek help, my Child.   Not gonna lie, I'm a little hard right now.    Star Wars Battlefront 2 is on Xbox...   I bet there are brown horses in many games.   you have 2 inches on me   stop being an asshole. they're just fucking videogames.   but assassin's creed isn't cool right now, dude. if you posted a tattoo of Fallout 4 or The Witcher 3 on your forearm, you would have a chance at the front page. C'mon, get this removed, and get a tattoo pertaining to one of the "hip" games I mentioned. then once a new game come up that is the talk of the land, remove that old tattoo and get a new one. repeat. never-ending karma generator   goat simulator   is this a gaming subreddit    The Witcher 3; Shadow of Mordor; Sunset Overdrive; Wolfenstein: The New Order (and The Old Blood); Borderlands: The Handsome Collection; the Metro Bundle   Magoo Senior  The Witcher 3; Halo MCC; Sunset Overdrive; Wolfenstein; Shadow of Mordor; Bordlands HC   The Witcher 3  duh   Ok, fair enough. I guess I mean't to ask, "Don't you hope Gears of War 4 reverts to the gameplay mechanics of the original trilogy rather than try to fix what isn't broken like People Can Fly did?"   It completely destroyed what made the other games so good. Now it's y to switch weapons? wtf? why are they trying to fix what isn't broken? and the campaign was awful. "30 seconds until next wave." What is this? Horde: story mode?      You've played Skyrim, right? Did you play all 4 previous Elder Scrolls games beforehand?   I'm tired of all the shit on the benches myself   I have a PhD in Broscience, so I will conclude that you should see an acutal medical doctor because you can't get a doctorate in Broscience.   I had high expectations for this game because I love DOA 2 through 4, but now it seems to have lost everything that made me enjoy those three classic fighting games.   Dead or Alive 4   cool   how evil   glad you have such high self-esteem    Pug Simulator  i dont care about goats, but pugs are cool. oh they're so adorable. i love pugs. i want to be one   but he didn't tell any jokes   ok well I have to do something, so I downvoted you. sorry   yes.    Ok, cool, you watch Game of Thrones and/or have read A Song of Ice and Fire. you are so awesome   wait prove that it's in boston. i dont believe you. after my wife cheated on me i dont believe anyone... sorry, i shouldnt tell you about my personal life. im going through a mi-life crisis   but i don't wanna   BUT HE DOESN'T KILL!!!!!!!!!!!!   I'm dying of laughter.   no wait im not actually, please don't that that to heart   ok what happens when it is almost as expensive as the game? please finish your thought   I've noticed that not every quest gives you xp.    Yes, I have the ability to time travel. I have done my research by working out after masturbating, then going back in time and working out without masturbation. No significant difference other than the fact that penises shed moonlight when exposed to cats.    lolwhut    wait are you really max payne   calm down, francis    I think so too   [This is my buddy's latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBP1d_KvOgk)   he's not fat right now.      no memes.   how do you know...  wait...  are u from the future  fuck im so high right now   Keep telling yourself that.    I know they harm children. When my son is naughty, I force him to play the Xbox. I don't know why, but he keeps getting naughtier and naughtier.    Wait, are you whipped too?   Witcher 3. My saying is: "When life gives you lemons, spend all waking hours playing The Witcher 3."   "lets me"  No offense, but you're seriously whipped.   Oh, he has a Youtube channel called "JuggernautFitnessTV" so that's why I thought you were a fan.   Quests that are at least six levels lower than yours won't grant xp   I sure as hell did. But now I'm having nightmares of crossdressing elves. FML   good to hear you follow the great Jason Blaha   But Planet Fitness is a joke. This changes nothing.   I'm afraid OP might actually take this seriously.   IIFYM   unless your diet is severely lacking in protein, there is no need for protein powder.   surprised it didn't go down more   When I grow a beard, I will never shave or trim! Never!    No. Please stop trolling. Jesus Christ, dude, grow the fuck up.   what   I'm being serious. I need to grow a beard. Time is running out. I must ascend to Gandalf the Blonde status.   Yes every male in my family has facial hair.   serious responses only. stop trolling.   So do you think I should just start the quest now?      I am playing on Death March and want to be able to prepare for this quest properly. I am level 31. The Imlerith boss fight was really frustrating. Is the Eredin boss fight even more difficult?   are you furious pete   My Son, I need more information.  ...  Deadlift, Squat, Bench PRs, and of course your 8 rep max for the Facepull. Your height, weight, bfp. How many friends do you have? Do you have a girlfriend? Is your middle name "Max"? How many Daughters of the Realm of the Garden of Men have you seduced? What are your political views? How long is your penis? What are your favorite hobbies? Are you currently employed? Have you ever stepped foot in a Planet Fitness? Are you subscribed to Jason Blaha on Youtube? What are your top 12 favorite films? Favorite books? Television shows? Videogames? Are you a convicted pedophile? Do you live in a house or a boat? Natty? Favorite color? When did you first discover masturbation? Exact date.   ...  Some of these inquireies might seem irrelevent to the question at hand, but please bear with me. Lifting weights is mostly mental in the Realm of the Garden of Men. In order to help, I must get to know you. It's not as cut and dried as you think, believe it or not. It is a very intimate sport.    Stop this nonsense.   Pass the bong, my Son, for you must be smoking the Holy Grass if you cannot figure out why you should upvote Father Magoo.   My Daughter, thank you for asking Father Magoo this question. He will answer shortly.  ...  *Sigh*  ...  My, sweet, sweet Daughter, this will hurt, but you must part ways with this Fiend. Father Magoo has checked out his Case.   It would be in your best interest to listen to Me. I promise you, he will *not* become a Magoo.   Father Magoo has spoken.   My Son, Father Magoo does not have it in Him to turn down one of the Daughters of the Garden of Men.   Please, my Son, stop this Trolling. Trolling will *not* be tolerated!  Father Magoo has spoken.       "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. "   My Son.   ...  Stop.   No.   My Son...  ...  You have so many questions. I will NOT tell you how to succeed in this theft.   	132
 [Land on your own moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxicjFRnoo)   I am starting to hate this sub... serisouly, in between the one or two good posts each month there are countless:  TIL my favorite actor / singer / band / whatever did or was in / voiced / sang / cameod in who the fuck cares... What is there to discuss about your amazing revelation that these people, well, work?  Sick of this pop culture shlock that is this sub.   Sweet, nice price point and cross buy with Vita/PS4 to boot. Def downloading once I get home.  And finally something on the Vita thats not an anime JRPG or 2D indie game.   TIL Keith Wickham is a voice actor.  Uhhh... Great OP, anything to discuss here?   The way he's holding that pistol annoys me, the angle of the gun, it just looks... wrong.   Latvian holy land?    Final destination OP... You have roughly 3 days before you meet your demise from some convoluted Rube Goldberg machine of death.    I was 22 at the time, already had two kids.  I guess that's one way to live your life.   We don't tip in Australia.   Fathers Linguini.   When I first played online it threw me into a skydiving mission and then it kicked me offline, after rejoining it threw me into the middle of a race then again, kicked me offline...

 Two brothers peered out of their house window into an all-consuming darkness, darkness capable of hiding any truth. Yet the darkness was easily and abruptly interrupted by a speeding car's oncoming headlights. The brothers saw the car drop off an object, a being... something, into the darkness. It was quite an odd event. What followed was the distinct sound of a rattling bell. The brothers who had recently lost their dog of eleven years were quite intrigued. The two boys remember no sound better than the rattling bell on their dogs collar. The younger brother spoke in a hopeful yet ecstatic tone, "I think that was a dog!" he claimed. The older brother, Mike, quickly let a dream transform into reality. He foolishly affirmed that he and his brother had just come across a sign from God. Mike claimed, "God wants us to get Jake back," (Jake was the name of the brother's late dog).  They walked along the road, whistling their mouths and clapping their knees. They were noisy but driven by the potential of a new companion. The brothers found it incomprehensible that locating a dog they had just seen would prove so challenging. They went at it for several minutes leaving loud echoes in the streets. Then they came along a wooded area adjacent to the road. They heard a familiar sound... a bell ringing. Although eerie, the brothers uncontrollably had a smile thrust upon their faces.  The smiles however wouldn't last; the brothers were instantaneously thrust to the ground. The innocent boys were thrown to the pavement, yet the force doing the throwing was not that of a dog. The brothers were thrown to the ground by a mysterious man, a man as ominous as the darkness around them. The man held a face of pure evil and power, a face reminiscent to that of the Joker. This was unsettling for the younger brother, who was an avid supporter of the Batman franchise.  The evil face proceeded to murder the two brothers with ease. He sliced their throats with a sharp blade and smirked at their inability to scream. The brothers suffocated on their own warm blood, as it filled their weak lungs. The evil faced man stood up and skipped away in joy, ringing musical bells in his left hand. He laughed outrageously and said "Ohh you will get your very own Jake back quite soon." He laughed and tucking his crucifix necklace into his shirt slyly declared, "Well Mike you're right about me wanting you to get your dog back." The man then floated away leaving the Darkness far behind him, almost as if he were leaving for the brightest destination known to man.   	1
       When we stop *burning* fossil fuels, they'll be even cheaper and more available for other uses like medicines and plastics.   Article's content is about what happens if we *don't* stop using fossil fuels. And that's very scary indeed.   I invite anyone who thinks this is *not* a good idea to attend any trade show for investment professionals, and explore deals with some of the exhibitors. If, after that, you still think brokers and financial advisors have your best interests at heart, I have shares in an unobtanium mine to sell you.    The Interstate system's actual name is the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, which says much about its original intent. It was a military road system from the outset, originally planned under General 'Blackjack' Pershing in 1922, and later built under Eisenhower.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System            Then there's [this guy](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/09/city-councilman-fagan-spreads-vaccine-conspiracy-s/).   Conspiracy theorists muttering and drooling on basement keyboards are one thing, but when they get elected to city councils and appointed to health boards, we have a problem.   Simple: the positives of climate change are vastly outweighed by the negatives. That much we know.   What we don't know is precisely how potentially horrendous the negatives are, but we know they are pretty damned awful, and they are already beginning to cost us. Unless we act soon, even midrange scenarios over just the next century likely result in the deaths of millions, a serious hit to the global economy and food supply, and rising warfare.  But don't take it from me. Read Hansen, Lynas, McKibben, Alley, Mann, Oreskes. Check out NASA Earth Observatory and Skepticalscience.com. Just beware of the fact that the fossil fuels industry is also secretly funding a bunch of crap science and misleading websites to confuse you.   Earnings for young college grads have been [declining for 15 years now](http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/09/earnings_of_you.html), even as college costs continue to climb.  For many, the only rationale for making that ruinous investment is that the alternative is [even worse.](http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Annual-Earnings-and-Employment-of-Men-with-Only-a-High-School-Diploma.png)    Meanwhile, nurses are millionares, welders buy their houses with cash, trim carpenters set their own pay, electricians charge more than lawyers, computer technicians make more than their management staff, and engineers have more job offers than they can shake a stick at.  You do realize that nurses generally have bachelor's or master's degrees, right? Meanwhile, most welders make around [$36K](http://www1.salary.com/Welder-I-Salary.html). Senior-level carpenters pull in [$48K](http://swz.salary.com/SalaryWizard/Carpenter-III-Salary-Details.aspx) on average. Etc.  The myth of boundless opportunities and princely pay for blue-collar work is a repeated trope these days, particularly on the political right, but it just isn't true. Sure, there are lucky exceptions, but they are far from the norm.  Meanwhile, colleges and universities are hardly limited to cranking out sanskrit philosophy majors. A third of grads have associate degrees, usually in the kinds of hard skills you suggest, while the top fields for bachelor's degrees include business, nursing, education, criminal justice, engineering and accounting, none of which are exactly impractical.     "Positions on climate change have become symbols of whose side you are on in a cultural conflict divorced from science."  Thanks to very clever public relations efforts by the fossil fuels industry over the past three decades, which have focused on turning climate opinions into a political litmus test. And we fell right into it.  In the US, this almost guarantees that no matter how much you know about the science, your opinions will be determined almost entirely by your age, gender, political tilt, religious affiliation, occupation, television preferences, and place of residence.        But there is no wage growth for those with less education.   Seattle is a beautiful, friendly city, and more affordable than any major city in California. Being divided by hills and water it's very much a city of neighborhoods, each with its own little shopping and nightlife district. A new light rail line runs south from downtown through some affordable but nice places like Columbia City. Elsewhere, the West Seattle Junction, North Ballard and Maple Leaf are also worth a look. Capitol Hill is the traditional gay district, and there are some lovely, fairly affordable neighborhoods to the east and south of its center at Broadway and Olive. The suburbs are generally wealthy to the east and west (across the waters), middle class up north and lower income to the south.   Two things:   The fact that college grads still out-earn the less educated does not mean their earnings are rising; some of the delta is due to pay for the less educated falling. More and more of the "benefit" of a degree is to simply avoid slipping into that yawning pit of decline.   Gender skews the data. Because they started from farther behind, women have made much greater gains in both education and income than men have over recent decades. The [picture for educated men](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/rip-van-skillsgap/) isn't nearly so rosy. And, now that women have achieved parity with men in education, and near parity in income, we can expect their trend line to start resembling that of men.           Get outside! Nothing deadens mood like a dark room on a dark day, especially if it keeps you from exercise. Speaking from experience here.  Go hiking with local clubs like the Mountaineers or Sierra Club. Some of the hikes are kid friendly. Check their websites for schedules.   Join new-mom groups like PEPS, or get into a preschool co-op and meet other moms and kids.  Volunteer to do whatever outside activities you enjoy. Join in tree planting projects, trail work, clean-up projects.   There's always church, too. And you needn't be religious to be an important part of church groups. Unitarians welcome all.   Avoid Centralia/Chehalis, which is a conservative town midway between Seattle and Portland. Also Longview and Mt. Vernon/Anacortes. And, surprisingly, Vancouver, WA, just across the Columbia from Portland, is a rather conservative enclave as well; it's where Portland-area conservatives move to dodge Oregon income tax.  Generally the most gay-friendly places are along the I-5 corridor about 70 miles in either direction from Seattle. The Seattle and Portland metros are very gay friendly and prosperous, as are Olympia and Bellingham. The northwest end of Tacoma is prosperous and progressive. Mountain towns like Leavenworth and Ellensburg have their attractions. To the east, Spokane is relatively tolerant and lovely. As anywhere in the US, rural areas and small industrial towns tend to be conservative and less tolerant, and many are economically depressed.   Most of the larger Cascade lakes would do: Lost, Olallie, Elk, Lava, Suttle, Diamond, Waldo, East, Paulina...and, if you haven't been to Crater Lake, that belongs at the top of the list.   For quiet, swimmable lakeside camping, I prefer the central Oregon lakes that don't allow fast powerboats. Boat regs vary by lake, so check online.         A good article with an unforgivably childish headline. Yet another act of self sabotage by The Guardian.   It's not exactly news that the Republican Party opposes progressive taxation, nor that Krugman is partisan. But is he wrong about falling returns to education?   Yes, but but how is that due to the ACA? Seems to me that the ACA was more a response to the contractor economy than its cause.  As a consultant myself, I was thrilled to finally see affordable health insurance thanks to the ACA, but my industry's atomization into a million consultants and contractors predated the ACA by decades.       How so?         Fatburger isn't far from it.      In addition, the long fall in corporate tax rates has disproportionately benefitted wealthy shareholders while shifting those tax burdens to everyone else.   "First, they wanted my guns. Then my pickup truck. And now my steaks?"  (Grab some popcorn. This should be exciting.)   There is almost no free market competition in energy. Least of all in fossil fuels and nuclear.   Just as the Islamic State focuses on teaching the Koran and the Hadith, the sayings of Mohammed!      Meanwhile, both growing inequality and slowing productivity growth link directly to the growing share of economic activity consumed by the financial industry.  http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2015/02/finance-sector-and-growth   "In America you'll get food to eat  Won't have to run through the jungle  And scuff up your feet  You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day  It's great to be an American   "Ain't no lions or tigers  Ain't no mamba snake  Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake  Ev'rybody is as happy as a man can be  Climb aboard, little wog  Sail away with me"   Correction: single-walled railcars are *part* of the reason that Bakken oil trains explode. The other part is that Bakken oil isn't [stabilized before transport](https://www.facebook.com/BombTrainBuckStopsWithNorthDakota) because the North Dakota oil rush has outpaced construction of stabilization facilities there, which would remove the oil's most volatile compounds, and because the oil industry just doesn't want to spend the money to make this explosive oil safe to ship.   It's simple editing, really. Everything before 1865...out! The decades of native slaughter...out! The robber barons...out! The seizure of Hawaii...out! Vietnam and Iraq...out! Etcetera.   Which, by my count leaves us with 1913, 1933-45, and possibly 2014. Who can't make a book out of that?   Two things:    *Any* rise this century will be back-loaded, with lower rises in the near term and much higher ones in later years.   This is a high-end scenario. The researchers are simply saying that IPCC high-end forecasts are far too low.   That is just so unfair.    True. Kahneman's elephant and all that. However, it's not enough to simply say, "pay a little now or a lot later"; conservatives won't believe it.  This is about getting people to recognize their own capacity for evil, and there's nothing easy about that.   Conservative crowing about cheap flatscreen TVs aside, it's important to recognize that the material required to process data has shrunk to insignificance. Dematerialization is for real, and that's good news.  What's not so good is that people use the cost savings on each product to simply amass more products.   Cortical implants and synthetic biology, which may be entirely integrated. Very exciting.  Not so thrilling: hundreds of millions of redundant, technologically downscaled workers who will be *very* pissed if society tries to cut them out--and they'll have the tools to commit incredible mayhem.   Meh. Another libertarian attack on unions, and the only American unions left to attack are public employee unions.  Lissen folks, pensions still account for most employee benefits in most of the world, developed or developing. Americans have simply given them up to fund the private health care racket, but we are very definitely anomalous. The fact that public employees haven't been rooked the way private employees have been is no reason to hate them. We need more pensions, not less.         A wild guess: this was probably unpaid or low-paid, produced on the cheap by the PR guy, Berman, to attract oil company clientele.    Here's the Sourcewatch link: http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Big_Green_Radicals                  FDR also proposed a [100% tax on income above $25,000](http://flaglerlive.com/26685/gc-fdr-and-taxes/) per year (about $350,000 in today's dollars).     When it comes to nuclear waste, NIMBY attitudes are *always* the order of the day. I agree with you, but I certainly don't expect Nevada's leading representatives to like it. This is basically a question of secure storage at Yucca to end the insecure, inexcusable mess at Hanford.   And how does one sue a company that might have hired you but didn't because it automated the job or sent it to Vietnam? How does one sue a bank that bribed Congress to legalize reckless banking practices which then crashed the economy and cost you your job building houses, which then destroyed your marriage and your kids' college funds?  I think the comparison with the 19th century stands, with some adjustments for modernity. National laws are now minor obstacles for companies whose operations span sixty nations. Unionization is no longer much of a threat. Automation provides abundant and rapidly growing opportunities to bypass even highly skilled and professional labor.    Exactly. For many it's not only a cut: it's a chat, a personal interaction, a massage, some flattery, the sense that you're getting the talents of a certain pro. Pretty hard to replace that with software.      It gets better. As cities become increasingly dedicated to automated transport, traffic lights and traffic jams vanish. Travel smoothes, enabling travelers to be more productive in transit.    He had me right up to the last sentence...  And I think this future will have to happen because the only other alternative is an aggressive transfer of wealth from the rich to the poor by force of law. I dont see that happening.     That was only slightly sarcastic. As large companies slash workforces and automation eliminates jobs, the opportunities left will be increasingly those that lend themselves to low-wage freelancing, personal services and esthetic expression, so...   Some headlines you just can't make up.   Think of it as the rise of Hairdressing Man.                  Libertarian voters frequently vote Republican but rarely Democrat. Libertarian candidates usually pull votes from Republican candidates but rarely from Democrats.   Let's face it, libertarians are merely Republicans without Bibles.                  Learn something about survey design and get back to us.    Ignore them. They are children in a prison of their own making, screaming and throwing shit to spark a reaction.    They're the terrorist equivalent of online trolls; if their last statement wasn't obnoxious enough they'll raise the stakes to see if *that* gets a reaction.  My response follows accordingly: ignore the childish fucks.   As someone who has worked on market segmentation for a state lottery, I can confirm. Essentially, lotteries prey on desperation, and the best lottery customers are about what you'd expect.      Why all the downvotes for this?    The current situation is weird only relative to the past 90 years, half of which were the most horribly weird period in world history. Pikkety and Saez say that we are simply returning to normal, and Schilling has been voicing a similar tone for the past three decades. I only wish I had followed his investing advice for more than a fraction of that time.   Which is only barely higher than the share of global GDP going to fossil fuel subsidies.    The only trouble with defined contribution plans is that those who need them the most use them the least. Left to their own devices, most people simply *do not save enough to retire.* Never have and never will. Meanwhile, we're still part of the same rich country and we still have obligations to keep one another from destitution, so the effect of reliance on defined contribution plans is to simply dump employer responsibilities onto lower income taxpayers through the most regressive Federal tax we have.   Desal takes immense energy and money.   We won't be unemployed. We'll all stay incredibly busy selling sex and pizza to one another!      Being in California definitely helps. However, every market is different, and some have restrictive rules.  Best strategy is often to contact managers through their websites in the off season.                     Like many environmental activists, Heinberg is a climate pessimist. Like many economists, Krugman is a climate optimist. It's been an [ongoing dialogue](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/02/climate_policy) for some time.   However, the studies that Krugman cites are merely two of several similar. Other researchers like Nordhaus and McKinsey Global Institute also agree that decarbonization is rather cheap (for now). There are three keys to this view: 1) Around 40% of the actions taken to mitigate climate (energy-efficient building codes, etc.) will save money; 2) Reduced fossil fuel burning produces other benefits (lower health costs, etc.) that also save money; 3) Continuing economic growth over time will reduce the relative burden of mitigation costs.  I do take issue with Krugman's reluctance to endorse nuclear power, which is part of any sensible decarbonization scheme. Still, on the whole, decarbonization is very affordable.   To me, the piece reads as a strong call to action to act on GHGs as we have on other pollutants, knowing that the costs of doing so, as before, are likely to be far less than conservative industrial interests claim.   No reference to GHGs that I can see.    Part of the cost--the low cost--is assistance to poor countries in their transition to clean energy. That would be the Green Climate Fund along with numerous deals like those that appear to have been proposed between the U.S. and India three weeks ago, in which India may have received some trade promised in return for agreeing to expand solar, probably using American panels.            http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/opinion/paul-krugman-could-fighting-global-warming-be-cheap-and-free.html?_r=0   They're smuggling crude in all directions, selling it at half the going price.    Would politicians really want to nuke other countries and face inevitable massive nuclear retaliation against their own country and people over something as petty as oil or bad weather?  Climate problems lead to food problems which lead to war. Witness the effects of 2010's droughts and floods on global wheat prices, and the knock-on effects of those triggering the Arab Spring wars ever since.  http://climatecrocks.com/2013/09/05/how-climate-change-primed-syria-for-war/    they are probably their own biggest customer for the oil.  Not with all their refineries destroyed and their storage facilities under concerted attack.    Sorry, didn't mean to attack you. I rephrased my post.   However, mere human laziness won't prevent solutions once the stakes are clear. This is cheap and easy to solve, and global agreements are enforceable as long as the planet's major economies work in concert, as they are beginning to do. Count me optimistic.   If the oil is all burned, the world very likely incinerates in economic collapse and near-certain thermonuclear war.   If you want to kill yourself with tobacco, don't let me stop you. But no one has the right to kill me, my kids, my grandkids and destroy everything I hold dear due to some psychotic need to drive an oversized pickup to the office.   I suspect the Pontiff is well aware of the Kochs.   Jennifer Francis? She says much the same. The polar jets will continue to "lose their way" in steadily more dramatic fashion. It stands to reason that the subtropical jets will as well, although somewhat less so as their amplitude is milder.   Well, spring has come a month early in the West, but you'd probably arrive just in time for another of our record wildfire seasons!    We aren't talking about all pollution; only carbon pollution.          Sure, the generation LBJ referred to was our grandparents, but now we are starting to see the catastrophic results of those alterations, we have done precious little about them, and we know that the US and Europe must lead any solutions.       What does the supply of oil matter if most of it must be left in the ground? That is now the [agreed global scientific consensus](http://www.carbontracker.org/report/wasted-capital-and-stranded-assets/), and it changes *everything*.   Poor headline. There's no *could* about it. The study finds that carbon emissions *do* dramatically increase the risk of U.S. megadroughts.      Nice piece, and it's also fun to read Matthew Yglesias' criticizing Ezra Klein for criticizing *him*.   "Killing the messenger." It's how conservatives most often deflect criticism; on climate, food safety, health care, wages, you name it.   [Here](http://theenergycollective.com/eliashinckley/2181166/oil-prices-saudi-arabia-and-end-of-opec) is my favorite explanation of the recent price collapse: threatened with coming climate regulation, low-cost producers are liquidating their assets while they can, delaying competitive energy sources in the bargain. Along the way, they also accomplish the geopolitical goals of hobbling Iran's ability to build nukes and slapping Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.   In short, peak oil is now a rather irrelevant concept. We'll have to leave most fossil fuel reserves in the ground. The Gulf countries know this, and they are trying to unload oil before it loses most of its value. This will take decades, so expect low prices to continue.    Corp taxes are mostly paid for by labor not capital.  Got a cite?  Yes, I'm well aware of ongoing discussion on the degree to which corp tax divides between labor and capital. However, putting aside the fact that nearly half of US corporate taxes are entirely *unpaid*,  the remainder probably fall most heavily on [shareholders](http://gatton.uky.edu/Faculty/hoytw/704/Harberger.pdf)--a trend increasing over time as production automates. Giving those shareholders a windfall with carbon tax offsets just means someone else has to make up the difference, and that someone else will be those who own the least stock, who also happen to be those with the lowest incomes. *Voila*, a massive shift of taxes from rich to poor.   That tax shift is especially egregious when compared to the other possibilities for making a carbon tax revenue-neutral: fee-and-dividend, offsets against regressive payroll taxes, etc..   No matter how many times they're [debunked](http://www.skepticalscience.com/OISM-Petition-Project.htm), lies just never die on the internet.   Given that so many of these science-denying opinion leaders are directly funded by the fossil fuels industry, can we just go with "whores"?    Going down the rabbit hole this seems to be the $409b number that originates with IEA for 2010  Could be mistaken, but I believe this comes from IEA Energy Outlook 2014. IEA EO 2013 specified $547b.   Extreme weather events will rise in frequency in the future, they have not yet.  Frequency, no. Severity, yes.   US imposes a $24/t tax on all production and import with 100% tax credit available against corp tax.   Nice way to shift the tax system in favor of the wealthy. Let's go with fee-and-dividend instead, rebating carbon tax revenues to all with Alaska-style dividend checks.   As for your proposed $24/t tax rate to cover the social cost of carbon, that's merely a starting point in a graduated scheme, correct? SCC is now credibly estimated by the US EPA at around $40/t and is nearly certain to rise.   Did anyone happen to notice that the sample for this claim is a handful of California universities? News flash: Berkeley leans left, really left!   In a cherry-picked sample of California universities. Shocking to hear that UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz have a liberal slant! I wonder where Humbolt State falls?   Fair enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	200
 The guys at work smoke pipes at work after lunch, and now that I've quit smoking,  (Two weeks! Thanks to you guys!) I feel a bit left out. Ideally I could find something with variable voltage that would work with all of the ego threaded things I have.   I just got an ego twist and a handful of clearos, and I'm wondering how to carry it around. It seems like it would snap in half instantly if i just had it in my jeans pocket  I was thinking about getting a metal cigar tube, but I wanted to hear what ideas you guys had.     What is the BAM?   Wow, that looks awesome!  Pricey, but I'm sure it's worth it.  What kind of atomizer or cartomizer do you use?  	4
 Write my dreams down in a journal to improve lucid dreaming. I'm trying to be productive in my sleep too :)   Time to call in the National Guard.   I've only played Persona 3   4. Is SMT a turn-based RPG too?   This is so true. Thanks for posting.   God I'm totally with you guys. I had a great day yesterday, ate healthy, worked out and figured I could do it again today...nope! Had projects galore pop up and will now have to skip working out, eat something fast and work until 9 to get it all done.  The only advice I have is to think of all the work you're getting done as one step closer to improving your life overall. I just log every major project and late night I have so I can bring it up during my review.   http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1anbix/atlas_hood/  This post had some good pics of it.   As I'm in the middle of my 1+ hour commute from my 60+ hour a week job, I've have some concerns about the accuracy of that prediction...   I love pictures like these...they really tell people are the same across times and cultures. I bet if you went back to Ancient Greece you'd find the soldiers dicking around with their spears.   And we can build this dream forever, standing strong together...   Wow nice work!   I think about this same thing  lot too. I'm 28 and just hoping to stay healthy And alive long enough for those advances to start rolling in.I'm pretty optimistic though since the pace of technological growth is accelerating so rapidly. After the airplane was invented it took less than 50 years for man to break the sound barriers and then we walked on the moon in just a little more than 20 years after that.  So I think if I can hang in there for 50 years we will hopefully be at a point when life can be extended much longer.   That's really awesome!   I saw Brazil in the title and two big round things in the thumbnail...   ...Disappointed   Pretty clever   That's really bad...   That's really great work.   After watching The Cove I have to say I agree with this.   Man that takes me back. I love how your bow sounded like a fucking chainsaw when you had it charged all the way.   God it's so true...   I'm cool with this. It's 2013, we might as well start building better relations.   "Hide the weed! Hide the weed!"   I agree with a lot of your points. Triple Triad was probably my favorite mini-game in all the FF series. And I loved Balamb Garden as a setting. I think it would be awesome to have a game that used Balamb Garden as a setting and worked in simulation elements like in Persona 3.  But yeah the story was a little too confusing and the junction system could have been better.   Nice! I've been waiting forever hoping it would get added to Netflix streaming without luck. Thanks!   I wonder if anyone has done a study on the prevalence of autisim in mixed race couples, who you would think would have less homozygosity.   Survey research. We did a study on fears around nanotechnology once so that kind of , maybe counts.   Woo Minnesota!   The phone book, newspapers, elevator attendants   Honor among warriors. When the Red Baron was shot and killed, he was given a full military funeral.   Did Bono mess up how to give the finger?      That looks amazing. Would love to hang out there for a night.   But if only half as many people buy Xbone's...   Those damn vegetarians...tofu is the work of Satan!   Totally agree. Plus with all the free games PS+ and Xbox Live are giving away, I can afford to wait.   Sony did the exact same thing.   Thank you! I can't believe I had to go this far in to find a level-headed post like this. Personally some of my best memories are playing Battlefront on my 360 with my brothers, so I'm looking forward to doing it again in the future.   Believe me, I've been there many times in the past. But one of those times eventually worked out and now I'm happily married. Nice job taking risks!   I was there for 6 months and just took a carry on. Basically just clothes, any electronics, and 1 nice outfit. You can buy pretty much anything there cheap, although if you're tall it might be a little harder to find.      Same here. Every kid should have someone to tell that in their life.   Wow, that's really good! Nice work.   Waking up early is literally the best habit I have. I can get so much done while everyone else sleeps.   That's awesome! Just listening to their new album now. Thanks!   My phone has taken the place of a ton of other electronics, so I think of mostly as a benefit. My wife and I even got rid of internet at home since we just use our phones for everything.   That's awesome! I know exactly how you feel as I'm similarly great when drunk and partying and then terrified to even talk to a girl when sober :)   He already looks fast as shit   I think fake-it-till-you-make-it can actually work in a lot of situations and I've definately done it before quite often.    Well played OP   That's so sad!   VII for sure   In future news Isreal just bombed the shit out of what's left of Assad's army.   Congrats!!   Went in Minneapolis. Great show and got to seat hop up front at the intermission. Wonderful.   Nothing says badass more than having a huge Logitech scanner hanging off your belt.   Marry Freya, kill Cait Sith, nail Fran   Spot on   Spot on   Oh Del Taco...I used to have one in a gas station by my house in Colorado. The scent of beef and gasoline was heavenly.   Totally agree. Iria was actually the first anime I ever saw and got me into it in general.   Congrats!   My thoughts exactly. It sounds like the future will be amazing but they need to get crackin on immortality/ life extension so I can enjoy it.   My thoughts exactly!    That's really sweet   Badass!   Human breast milk? That's pretty cost effective!   Manna is a great one. Got me interested in futurology.   Wow she's pretty   Or the moon from "A Trip to the Moon"  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Le_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg  	68

 I didn't even know you get an engineering ring!   So far, i've been reading to no avail. What i've found is that some limitations included: - Women, Slaves, Foreigners were excluded - Men, regardless of education, were allowed to vote so some uneducated people could be making important political decisions - Unpopular but necessary decisions would not be likely passed (can't find examples though)  Pros: - Allowed a representation of what the people want.   About writing music, i've composed a few musical pieces, mostly for the piano like double and triple fugues and etudes though i've sketched out an incomplete symphony (only the first movement)  I don't think i'll ever be a band leader, not really interested in leading, I just want to play music aha  And about the type of prog, i'm still relatively new to prog so i'm open to everything right now :)  Thank you for such a detailed reply! I'm going to watch those links now.   Hey all! For the last 15 years i've been playing as a classical pianist and did dabble a bit into jazz and was wondering what advice you could give me if I wanted to move into prog rock?   For a sense of ability, my repertoire included Chopin's op.25 (Full), Debussy Preludes Book II (Including no.12) and the Shotakovich Concertos.  Thanks!   Two worlds one sun... If only the warring nations of this world realized that we all share a single sun   That sounds cool! Thanks :)  One more question, how long after you submitted your materials did you get invited for an interview?   This one.   How much money do you make monthly?      Thank you soo much for introducing me to Palmgren! I have never heard of him or felt this way about music for a very very long time. :')  edit: Just sightread it after printing the score from IMSLP and played it on my piano with my windows open close to midnight and I am soo happy right now, thank you soo much Catt!      Never said any of my pieces were easy :p, yeah that prelude was a monster! I included it in my fellowship recital a few months back. Loved the quote of La Marseillaise towards the coda xD   Listening to it right now and I am in awe! Can't believe i've never heard of this gorgeous gem before (esp. the third one!)   Hi! Just to give a sense of my ability, here's some pieces from my repertoire: Chopin Etudes op.25 (Full) Schubert D.960 Sonata Beethoven op.110,109 Sonatas Debussy Preludes Book I and II Shostakovich Concertos I and II          Exactly 666 comments, how meta- ops I spoiled it.      So I can just buy a plane ticket right now with no preparation whatsoever and fly straight into South Korea?      It's freezing down here in Melbourne!   A high school friend of mine did a research essay on Nobili's Rings and Liesegang Rings which I thought was subtly beautiful!           	25

 People on this sub have actually beaten to death the , "Tig is the rat" theory   I just moved here from Dallas.  I want to be healthier and more active.  I love being out doors and would like to go hiking in the hills out in the desert.   Any good suggestions on where beginners should go.  I've been to superstition once while visiting a while ago. Where else is good for solo beginners?  I live in Mesa, so anything out this direction would be appreciated.   Simpsons did it... Wait no, I think that was done other show.... But which one...?   I love yo....  I mean, thanks for posting that gif.  We really appreciate it.   Could be pissed for getting sold back to the Chinese by Clay days after getting out of prison (Season 1) That's when he must his fingers.  Could be playing the long con, gathering as much Intel as Possible   Very possible   Why thank you   I appreciate it bitchwrangler.  It was a tough decision.  Basically have been saying I was going to do it for about a year, finally manned up         Queens, my bad   Makes sense for Juice, when he was being pressed in season 4 you find out he's originally from Brooklyn.  The others I haven't noticed.  Jax on the other hand, I've heard Aussie, Brit, and Nor Cal , I think he's getting tired.   Are we don't this price is right style?   And let the face swapping begin!   Marx forgave "Tig's debt" though when Jax turned over the fun business to him though.  Marx was no longer after The by the end of season 5.  Second to last episode of that season, but not sure.   I wouldn't mind being in her valley   Tell it husband he's the first person I've ever seen to wear a sons costume and actually look like the person.  Cudos   I agree with OP.  Its a possibility.  I've wrote off trying to predict what Sutter will do or assume he has rules of how a character will go out.   In not sure I get the punch line?  Help me out, maybe put a finger on it?   Checks and balances   I'm personally not taking too much stock in Sutter stating that 2 sons die.  It's possible, but seeing that Sutter likes to go the opposite direction in big episodes from what people think he'll do.....  I think saying that could have been a misdirection.   Plus, if it is true, Nero isn't a Son, neither is Gemma, the death toll could be far greater in the last 5 episode.  Plenty of time for folks to die.   Everything here mother was saying Jax took on as a direct reflection to himself.  The rent is punctuated by her saying something about a horrible father and a dead mother right before Jax puts a round through her head.  All foreshadowing Tara's death in a very sneaky way   Thunder header 2 into 1 tailpipe is common amongst the bikes in Sons.  You see a lot of the sidekick seats as well.  Its a single piece 2 up seat.  HD diamond black grips.  Those are the big ones.  Chib's earlier bike had the fork tube boots, but I think with the fairing, the boots would clutter your front end too much.    If you go with the thunder header (has a great sound) or any other full pipe you'll need to do a stage one air intake upgrade as well  Edit: also black lower front fork sliders and HD black magnum wheels   Actually very caught up, to the episode.  You didn't soil anything f for me.  Only takes 2 minutes to be considerate for other redditors though   Thank You!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks it's Nero.  When he left the room when the sons saw what happen it looked a little suspect.  Then, when the focus was in him at the end and he says, "how could they not leave after what happen".  Clear foreshadowing.   Seen the episode already but still.  A spoiler alert tag, I'm sure, would have been much appreciated by some folks here   Go back and watch when Venus' mother rants at the kiddie porn studio.  Kurt Sutter drops some serious foreshadowing.  Bravo   Minception   If have to go with the Piano Key Neck Tie   If your looking for which mods are on his bike I can let you know.  Used to work in custom accessories at a HD dealership in TX   No disrespect intended, but your mom is smoking hot.  If she were a dinosaur, she'd be a Babe-a-saurus Rex   Some chick and dude meet on a boat, at the end ( SPOILER ALERT) a big rock gets dropped in the water   Added   Serious case of MLA   Haven't watched this episode yet but I'm saving it.  I miss tales from the dark side   Blanch de Bruxelles, is Euro, but awesome   A kid called me an asshole, I told him I wasn't, he was convinced   Yes....  Yes you are   I don't follow, what's the twist?   Daaaaaaaamn   I think he's permastuck in that expression   "Chump Chance" by Big Business   My day just started and seeing this may be the coolest thing that happens all day, awesome   Pretty sure at least 2 of those are photo shopped   Years ago I bought a legit bike jacket at a Wilson's leather outlet store,  Sturdy, warm, not a logo on it and 1/3 the price   Shiiiiiiiiiit, I got serious chills down my arm from that one!   What year is that photo from?  Might be a good post for /r/oldschoolcool   Who were the graduates and what year did they graduate?   Nice, I was on my pop's Ultra, full size wind shield.   I can't imagine what it would look like without a wind screen         Looks like you're not eating any....  Dry toast   Its like ordering a sandwich on wheat, and your waiter brings it to you on rye   That you should of ate!   *bobber*      Well that escalated quickly   I got a serious chill at the end, did not see that coming   Take a motorcycle safety coarse   I do what I can.      I'm not tech savy, please be patient with me: I downloaded VLC media player last week and every since I've had problems:  Netflix App wont work I can't load videos on streaming sites like Coke and Popcorn or ProjectFree I can't figure out how to get rid of the crap programs that come with VLC  How do I fix this?  I was also curious of people's opinions on the best spyware/malware and free virus protection as well.  Any help would be appreciated.      I agree totally with that.  Both probably made mistakes somewhere   Rahr is bigger.  I believe they produce more barrelage per year than DEBC does.  I'm not totally sure, I havent checked the BA Forum letter recently.  But that is why I said "bigger than most"  I really doubt S S did what they are being accused of.  I know for a fact there are tap handles in that restaurant that local breweries didn't have to pay for.  That doesn't mean they didn't say what they are being accused of saying, but it doesn't help DEBC's case either.  As for serving Franconia over Deep Ellum, yeah, I don't get that either.  I want there, I dont know what happen.  Not serving there beer could be just an excuse for a deeper issue like you said.  One thing to keep in mind though, liking a certain brewery/style of beer/or individual brew is ALL subject to opinion.  There are some beers that most people in the Dallas scene love that I think are inferior.  There are also beers that I love other people think are shit.  Its all opinion.   I don't think they are a massive corporation.  But based on their distribution network, number of accounts, and total barrels sold, they are MUCH larger than most of the breweries in the area.  And by contrast, much larger than a single restaurant that's only been open or about 4 months   He's trying to play up being the little guy, a small self distributed brewery.  It helps him look favorable as the victim.  He leads people to believe they're still a small operation, they don't have distribution, which they do, just not in this area.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with picking up a distributor in one area and not another.  But to tell people you don't have when to look like such a small operation when you actually do else where is misleading.   In the blog written about this John states that he's the little guy and the victim being bullied.  He stated that he is not distributed by Andrews or BEK which is only half true.  They are still self distributed in DFW, but distributed by BEK in the large southern cities in the state.  Is another good example if how he's misleading and petty   FOLLOW UP:  Replaced it with a new one last night from Autozone.  After taxes it was $250.  It took me about an hour and this was my first time making this repair on a vehicle.  The three places (one dealer and 2 national chains) I looked into to do the repair for me, each gave me estimates for $550-$600 for a one hour job.  Proof they're all out to gouge.  Moral of the story... I'm doing my own work.   No sources, no references, and a weak looking site...?  Yeah, I'd believe it....  Why was this even posted?   Going back through both Deep Ellum's post about this and Scotch and sausage's, and looking in the comments of the previous note our DEBC has had, is scary to see how much some of DEBC's fans have "drank the kool aide"   Sorry. I meant to type the word "remember" not tendency.   Was trying to type at a red light and not paying attention.  Was meant to read, "do you remember the brand name?"   * remember* not tendency sorry. Was trying to type at a red light   Awesome.  Do you tendency the brand on it?   Anyone have a good suggestion on a brand of alternator for an 06'?  My first one lasted 85k miles. In sitting in an NTB with a dead alternator that's 2 years old and Ford is showing me no love.  I'm looking for a suggestion in a quality product that will last more than 2 years.  Also, if there are any maintenance tips to make one last longer I'd appreciate it.      They have similar style on Jpcycles.com      I used to sell for Harley and ride myself.  The biggest things are enjoying the ride, being comfortable, and controlling the bike.  HD has accessories and mods you can put on the Dyna series to help with all of those.  You can get things like "the reach seat" which is comfortable and moves you closer to your controls as well as curved handlebar riders that will bring your bars closer to you.  Get the bike you want and can afford then customize it to for you.  Do what you want man, is a Harley!   In guessing the frame is a 0 out 62 up?

I was wondering if anyone has a link to the drop WTDS for Sport Sturm's birthday.  It was a barrage of overlapping drops of Bob and other ticket members doing Bob impressions.  I think it ran for a little over a minute.   Looks great!  I like how you shaped a little lip on it with out going full bobtail.  Nice touch.   All I can say is wow.   The symbolism is amazing.   Mesmerizing   Michael from Lakewood here.  The whole crew is pretty impressed and very proud of you guys.   I have a buddy who rides an ultra and I busy his chops all the time just for fun.

Check for local ones NOT in green bottles   I'm so glad this is in my life   Wow. Topical humor and 16 years in the making.  There are people who are now turning 21 who can now go in there to drink who won't be old enough to get the reference. Still clever though, I must admit.   I'm a big fan of keeping it 200mm and under.  I actually prefer a 180mm.  I road the rocket custom when it first came out.  The stability in a straight run was phenomenal.  Turning was tough hard and sluggish.  It really depends what type of riding you want to do.  If you like a at straight haul go wide.  If you like a lot of twists and turns go narrow.

 Because you're one of 4,000,000 people to try it.  It's like the lottery.   I don't know, we don't share a psychic connection.   "Minimum wage is less than half of what it should be."  That's very disputable and many would not agree.  Have you ever tried to hire someone with a good work ethic, someone who doesn't steal from you or try to game the system?  Well I have.  I've hired workers who are so lazy that I should pay them to stay home.   You should ask, "Why am I so unoriginal, what defect do I have?"   I believe people pose this exact question, sometimes reworded, a dozen times a day every day.   Forget the entertainment, we couldn't access our money.

Try /r/DIY   I have two stories.  My sister once darted out into the road and was hit by a car.  I watched my dad woosh! over to it, pick that car up by himself and pull that child out.  She ended up with only a broken arm and he had a bit of trouble with his shoulder for a few days.  The other incident with her and my dad: she'd taken her aquarium into the bathtub to wash it(?) while he and I were outside throwing the ball around.  All of a sudden my mom let out a blood-curdling scream and, whoosh!, he was inside that bathroom, whipped off his belt and applied it as a tourniquet around her slashed up arm because she'd dropped it and it broke.  That man could move so fast he was a blur sometimes.   A Dominos pizza full of bad mushrooms.  Had to fly the next day and it was a bad, bad day.   3.8, UNC-CH.

So, technically you're not allowed to get gifted skins on sale. :(    Gifted my boyfriend two teemo skins... He hates me and our relationship is in ruins.

 Hi there,   I was wondering i have had this EKG's done in a year time but i notice that in lead V1 the rsR is getting bigger each time not by allot but its happening so last EKG where i don't have the print out from show an even bigger rsR in height (don't know the right terms but it looks like that) Does this mean anything? I do have som slight enlarged right ventricle on MRI.   Starting to get more and more out of breath And getting heavier quiet a bit. Without eating more.  http://imgur.com/a/aljUk     Thanks for your answer again! Very kind of you! I have no clue how many leads it has..   Thanks allot! Very helpful! so far I think it's a pretty handy and cool device!  I do have another question about ecg's i have this rsR in v1 but on the second one the rsR the R' is gotten higher if you understand what i mean. The qrs duration however hasn't become longer. Does this indicate something? Or does this already happen with lead misplacement?   that Tarte flambee looks absolutely delicious with that goat cheese and bacon!    Hell of a conclusion they are making here.   The factory is right next to my house, only it is in Delft not in Amsterdam I only don't know how you can see if its a fake o real porcelyn.    You are such a terrible dad if you don't let your daughter have sex with her BOYFRIEND unless you are both 12 years old.   edit: spelling   Do you by the way know if they can detect a myocardial infarction in such a tiny thing? Or evidence of it?    Recently watched the perks of being a wallflower and I have to say it hit me pretty hard liked it allot.   Thanks! Well unless it's a nasa rocket manual it shouldn't be rocket science!   Watched the movie again last week and it was truly a joy te see it again. Also the list of actors in the movie is pretty impressive.   Thanks really helpful!  Are you a cardiologist? :)   http://imgur.com/a/cXqQl  Have a history of some cardiac enlargement end yesterday i was severely tired but i don't know if this is edema or something to call the doctor for to see if something is progressing?     Since 2 weeks I have this Medtronic Reveal LinQ implanted but I was wondering how the report looks like and what it records and saves? Does it monitors your heart rate consistently and does it say from everyday what the lowest heart rate was and what the highest? From the manual I understand it automatically records the more worrisome heart arrhythmia but in my case it's implanted for the slow heart rates.  Edit: spelling      Yes!   That's why he hates America, makes all sense now.   Get the counseling asap just call the psychology office and just go. It won't kill you and they have excellent therapy's! Good luck!   O boy mussels are so tasty, when my dad makes them everybody is eating at home that night.    Awesome, good for you and good luck!   Remember the post on reddit about this but it was an obvious clickbait.   Out of interest is that still a big market that telephone sex? I'm always looking at those ads and thinking you must be pretty retarded to call something like that.   Thanks for the answer. Have a nice day!   I read allot of people how suddenly "die" of heart failure also at young age. But isn't it with heart failure that there would be warning signs like edema and stuff like that? Or is it just wrong information given by the newspapers? For instance here in a newspaper in Holland: "The father of the teenager found his son (15 years old) death in the bad tub. Research has to find out what the cause of death is but they are thinking about heart failure." It is very sad news but I really don't understand it first of all sudden cardiac death at that age is extremely rare and heart failure is something that doesn't develop in a couple of hours without warning signs isn't it?  t     Dit ziet er veel belovend uit, ben het volkomen eens met dat er veelte veel management lagen zijn dit is overigens in de hele zorg sector zo laatst een nachtje en dag in het ziekenhuis gespendeerd en dan heb je een doktersassistent, verpleegkundige een verpleegkundig specialist hoofdverpleegkundige vervolgens een arts-assistente vervolgens een specialist in opleiding daarna een specialist en vervolgens heb je nog 30 management lagen er bovenop voordat je bij de eind verantwoordelijke ben en die mag zelf ook niet eens bepalen hoe of wat.   Terug on topic: Ziet er uit als een fijn verzorgingstehuis!   Personally I think you would better be off without a mentor. You need to fall and stand up in life and fight your own way thru it. If you made that decisions back then it was probably the right decision. Just don't hesitate about it and you will be fine.   Are you considering an operation to get them smaller?    It is pretty funny  that those guys think you are totally in the mood and you are just making a cup of coffee.    ORS, Oral Rehydration Salts they come in little sachets. Also a good walk outside helps allot of times first you will feel awful but when you get home you feel much better.    I'm starting to think what is real and what is fake what Snowden is telling it can't be all true. Isn't he just a psycho who loves attention? Or are the Russians feeding him information he has to say in order to stay there?    Very missed opportunity for BBM to wait so long to make BBM cross platform and also computers.

 Trke nasl biliyorusun?    As for spices I think you would be fine if you just goto to the store and buy the following:  * Cumin * Paprika * Cayenne * Cinnamon  * Nutmeg * dried mint * oregano * Bay Leaves * thyme \ Rosemary  * tumeric   Perhaps also: * Coriander * Cardamom * Saffron * fennel seeds * mustard seeds * Cloves   I hate buying spices in America because you can't try them first.

Floyd in Bklyn Heights - Bocce!   www.tipsyoxcart.com   ruhlman's 20   Sound designer\accordionist here. Feedback suppressors, if you're *very* lucky address the symptom but not the overall problem. When you get to the venue you need to consider your placement in relation the speakers. Are you playing in front of the speakers? This will create feedback in nearly any system. Perhaps you're mics are gained to high. If you address these two things and it's still a problem, then you can look into some EQ - For this individually raise each band until you find the one that corresponds with the root frequency of the feedback. What band enduces feedback. Once you find it, you can bring it back until the feedback is reduced. It's much better to manually counteract it like this than to use a feedback suppressor in attempt to address it automatically (which probably won't work). I've never met a sound professional  who uses one of these devices.       hanon.

A complete reinterpretation of the commerce clause is therefore not required.   1. Babies cannot be vaccinated;  2. Cancer patents have compromised immunity;  3.

Submission statement.  A masterful discussion from 1944 of modern management theory, albeit for the purpose of how to sabotage any organisation, rather than make it work better.  I think Scott Adams got his Dilbert cartoons from this book.   The point of the link here is that sociologists as profession are pretty much to the left.  I would be a rich man if I got a dollar for every time economists were denounced as right wing in my presence. This is despite all studies showing that for example, in the USA, the average economist is a moderate Democrat.  Despite all the media reports of the bias of economists and so forth, I've never seen one report in the mass media discussing the bias of sociologists.

Measles affects about 20 million people a year, primarily in the developing areas of Africa and Asia. It resulted in about 96,000 deaths in 2013 down from 545,000 deaths in 1990. In 1980, the disease is estimated to have caused 2.6 million deaths per year.   Before immunization in the United States between three and four million cases occurred a year. Most of those who are infected and who die are less than five years old. Adults have little or no memory of before the age of 4.  The risk of death among those infected is usually 0.2%. Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus.   Herd immunity requires at least 92% vaccination rate; the vaccine is only 95% effective; babies are too young to vaccinate; and tort liability is an ineffective way of policing infections from you see http://utopiayouarestandinginit.com/2015/02/07/richard-epstein-classical-liberalism-and-compulsory-vaccinations/   an oldie but a goodie as a tall tale but true   an oldie but a goodie   Submission Statement  Roland Fryer carried a gun at 14 as a member of the gang; worked extra jobs at college to pay off his father's bail bondsman; and an assistant professor at Harvard at the age of 27.

When they arrived, they were given the film that they were going to make. The promise was broken.

I like Leonardo DiCaprio because he has a wide range and appears to dissolve into whatever character he is playing.  Most of all, in his current movie, you never think about what characters he played in recent movies or whether he is playing against type.   Thanks, the law and economics of criminal justice does not seem to be as accepted as widely as I thought.  Some of the first articles in law and economics by Richard Posner and William Landes were on the economics of the courts, legal administration and the judiciary as a whole.  When Gary Becker wrote the economics of discrimination, many simply did not accept that it was a topic for economic analysis. Likewise, when he wrote Human Capital in 1964, he later explained that is book had such a long subtitle to overcome criticism of describing people as capital.   Shouting at people and telling them that their stupid and corrupt and on the take is rarely as a successful strategy for any salesman who has to earn his salary by selling something to them.  Indeed, most of the studies show that such strategies of aggression and denunciation are polarising rather than result in people changing their minds.

A big policy dilemma when setting in income thresholds for means testing the incomes of welfare beneficiaries is you can make the welfare benefit pay.  In New Zealand, you can earn $200 a week without losing any of your welfare benefits. That makes part-time work plus a single parent welfare benefit a viable investment.  There is an argument that welfare benefits should rebate dollar for dollar on any income earned to ensure that the gap between working and not working is large and the rewards are to work full time, rather than work part time and staying on the benefit, including its various second-tier benefits related to health costs and emergency grants.   many excellent points   many do as with france and many european soccer players   net of the fixed costs of working and opportunity cost of leisure.  also, pure wealth effect only. is not a negative income tax.     people watch media that panders to their priors   the study finds equally numbers from both sides join corporate boards   her number of socially redeeming features has dropped from 2 to 1: stopping Hilary   Craven political backdown   I lived in Japan in the mid-1990s when the economy was switching from a six-day week to a five day week.

The author is now a FTC commissioner   Spontaneous murders are called manslaughter where I live, because they're not premeditated.   As for crime related murders, the large fall in crime rates in recent times as discussed well in the writings of Steve Levitt. He points out that executions are simply too infrequent to figure in criminal calculations regarding risks.  Furthermore, gang bangers, a spell on death row probably extends life expectancy relative to been murdered by business associate in a drug dispute.  The Rand Corporation did a very good starting about 10 years ago the occupational hazards of drug gang members. being murdered is a far greater occupational hazard than arrest.     Politicians like to be seen next to winners and cameras    Yes, it does sound like a bit of a slippery slope. I doubt it will survive appeal.   Actually, is a wonderful satire on what Matt Welch called temporary doves. That is, peace activists who oppose the wars started by their political opponents   Were any of the facts of the story incorrect?   True but easier to not change rather than look up each subredditt   I didn't own a car from 1995 to 2009 because the local train or bus systems were so efficient at delivering me to where I want to go with the gaps in between filled by taxis and car rentals.  Do you own a car? What is the longest time you have gone without owning a car?  Indeed, for 8 of these years, I didn't even have a licence and had to resit the test.  Did you let your licence lapse because you are so confident in the local bus system delivering on the job?   Exoneration on appeal is the criminal justice system working, not failing. As Richard Posner said, the actual number of exonerations relative to the number of trials and convictions is vanishingly small   Headline, but I'm reluctant to change the headline title because some sub-Reddit moderators and rules do not like you changing the title of the link and it's too hard to remember the rules for each sub-redditt.   Frankly, tactically speaking, I don't think it's worth the political effort needed to reinstate keep the death penalty relative to other priorities such as life without parole and three strikes and you are out. You can only fight on so many fronts   I'm told barbers must undertake thousands of hours of study, including of the history of barbers   Yes, it is an unusual headlines for a liberal lion media outlet   If there is evidence that capital punishment deters people from murder, how many horrific child murders per year are you willing to tolerate because of your squeamishness before introducing the death penalty?

Ignorance is strength   Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask a statistical perspective   That did not happen to me   Do victims get expenses paid to travel to these conferences.

Straighter shooting book reviews, you will not find   so if you were managing these facilitators, what performance targets would you set. would take-up rates be included?   Would you happily employ a facilitator were never persuaded anyone to come to one of these conferences? How would you know they were doing their job if you didn't expect them to deliver anyone to these conferences?   But that's what happens.   Ministry of Justice facilitators have performance agreements and performance targets and among those targets is making sure people show up at restorative Justice conferences. I will know for sure when my official information act request is answered.  You wouldn't last long as restorative justice facilitator if you simply accepted no as an answer to a suggestion to attend at restorative justice conference and ended the call.      So you want to use victims of crime as unpaid social workers subtly pressured as a friend was by these facilitators to do unpaid social work with criminals. Deterrence of crime is the function of the legal system.  About 2500 of these conferences occur each year which is a small percentage of convictions.   How much has the IPCC estimated global warming to reduce GDP?   I do not give a toss about the offender. The victim owes them nothing.    Does the sentence increase as a result of the restorative justice conference?      Well if they want to meet with the convicted offender, they are free to contact the police or the court to arrange to do so.  The Ministry of Justice should never contact the victims  that is re-victimisation.   Enough people complain about the trauma of having to testify in court and be cross examined. Once that is over, the victim should be free to get on with their life and never hear from the court again once they have completed their testimony. after giving their testimony, it is for the victim to decide whether to have further contact with the criminal justice system.  Why is the sentencing deferred pending a restorative justice conference?  If the offender who pled guilty is genuinely remorseful, that remorse will not be contingent on a reduction in sentence because he or she attended a restorative justice conference?     Google Robert Hare: he's the world expert on the psychology of psychopaths. He agrees with you completely.   judges are now forced to adjourn all cases after a guilty plea to give Ministry of Justice conference facilitators time to coax offenders and victims to come together.   I can think of plenty of cases, including the two examples given in the article, with the victim would never want to see or hear of their attacker ever again except that there been sentenced to an appropriate term prison.  People complain about giving evidence in court been a traumatic experience. Imagine having to meet with the offender again so they can pretend to be remorseful.   A great summary of everything you wanted to know, but was afraid to ask about Saudi Arabia. Very penetrating questions and good answers.   Do you get much business when there is not much snow   Once again from the pew research Centre, everything you wanted to discuss about political polarisation but needed data. You now have it.   We don't object paying more for a meal at a restaurant at dinner time rather than as lunchtime; the people object to paying more for the taxi late at night where the driver must risk the dangers of night-time work on their own!   Is surge pricing another name for over time and night and weekend pay?  Union contracts provide for overtime pay, if you work more than the specified 8 hours a day.  Union contracts also provide that if you work at the weekends you are paid at 150% of the normal rate; and double party on public holidays.  Seems like the travelling public don't like what they's will was very good in union contracts if they were a union member.   You can't let facts bugger a good story story.  Australian slang, for the uninitiated   yes, the rights of workers are often forgotten.   yes, the drivers are self-employed, but many employees are paid more if they work in dirty,  and dangerous jobs or bad weather.   I have not seen these 1942 reports with newspaper headlines in London before   "This paper provides a relatively non-technical survey of theoretical research on the eect of sovereign risk on the market for sovereign debt, with an emphasis on the way sovereign risk constrains the process of globalization.   After summarizing the legal environment governing sovereign debt, it discusses the forces that encourage repayment of sovereign debt when legal enforcement is ineffective.  It then reviews the recent literature that examines the quantitative importance of these forces.   It concludes by discussing a range of institutional changes and policy reforms that might act to further reduce the level of sovereign risk and hence strengthen the process of globalization."    thanks for the link   BTW, see http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=343640  Mechanisms of the Slippery Slope Eugene Volokh  UCLA School of Law   That slippery slope argument was a favourite of the reactionary right   Their ability to believe it all stone cold sober worries me more   "Since 1 January 2002, the Tribunal has had the power to declare acts or omissions of:  the legislative, executive or judicial branches of government, or a person or body that performs any public function, power or duty to be inconsistent with the right to freedom from discrimination, as affirmed by s.19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. An act or omission will not be inconsistent with those rights if it's shown to be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."

U.N. drug warriors falsely claim that treaties compel U.S. states to ban pot.   "All that a court of justice can look to is the parliamentary roll: they see that an Act has passed both Houses of Parliament, and that it has received the royal assent, and no court of justice can inquire into the manner in which it was introduced into Parliament, what was done previously to its being introduced, or what passed in Parliament during the various stages of its progress through both Houses of Parliament."  per Edinburgh   Dalkeith Railway Co v Wauchope (1842)   When was the last time a New Zealand Act of Parliament was declared invalid by a court?   The constitutional position in New Zealand [...] is clear and unambiguous. Parliament is supreme and the function of the courts is to interpret the law as laid down by Parliament. The courts do not have a power to consider the validity of properly enacted laws  per Rothmans of Pall Mall (NZ) Ltd v A-G [1991] 2 NZLR 323 at 330 (HC)   The previous posts do not discuss the arguments submitted to the court as the case unfolded over the course of the day   Why is it going to take a three day High Court hearing to establish that Parliament is sovereign and therefore can make or unmake any law whatsoever.  This isn't a matter of statutory interpretation of ambiguous text.   A specific bill was passed for the sole purpose of stripping sentenced prisoners of their voting rights as one of the consequences of being convicted of a serious crime.

"Joint criminal enterprise" ("JCE") is a mode of liability created by judges on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that allows the tribunal to bring charges against members of a group responsible for war crimes or crime against humanity even if there is no evidence that the particular individuals physically participated in the crimes.  Germany prescribed a successor to the Nazi party when it started winning seats in the State and Federal parliaments.   This party was led by the SS major who was at the centre of the coup attempt in 1944  initially he was ordered to arrest all the Nazi leaders; then Hitler got on the phone to him and he arrested the coup leaders. He was an unrepentant Nazi.      This is a great interview where Samuelson reflects on the state and evolution of modern economics with great impartiality   Nice discussion of junk science intruding into legal procedure. Some really crazy theories tend to get believed these days.  Indeed, forensics scientist have to counter the CSI effect: they have to testify before the jury to show that there are a number of things forensic science cannot prove contrary to what you saw on TV   I could not agree more.   I don't know how the media takes seriously after been so wrong so many times but as Richard Posner said in his book, public intellectuals, the media standard for public intellectuals is pretty low.

Politicians never admit error because it will be used again and again against them in the future. Oddly enough, in politics, admitting error is a sign of weakness.   One of the purposes of John Rawls' veil of ignorance and Buchanan and Tullock's veil of  uncertainty is that the basic social institutions be designed when we have abstracted from the grubby particulars of our own self-interest.  Behind the veil of ignorance and the veil of uncertainty, we would all agree that resources are limited, including in the health sector and some drugs can't be funded  choices must be made.  Once we go in front of the veil of ignorance and find out that we are the one missing out on that drug, naturally, our views will change.  Is always the case that someone just falls on the other side of any line in the sand. If you move that line, there is always another set of people who are just on the other side.   I have updated my post and discussed how your response is straight out of Yes Minister. I also repositioned my comments as replies to you so that the thread makes more sense   When a scientist makes an error, he admits it. That is what Richard Tol did.  Do have a problem with scientists admitting that they make errors? Do you praise them, or criticise them for their scientific honesty?   I notice you do what bureaucrats to an focus on error rather than the main thrust of an argument. You completely ignore this part of what I posted because it's inconvenient to you: "The recent IPCC report found that the temperature rise that we are expected to see sometime around 2055-2080 will create a net cost of 0.2-2% of GDP. The UK, Japan, and the US wanted this rewritten or stricken. The IPCC report showed that strong climate policies would be more expensive than claimed as well  costing upwards of 4% of GDP in 2030, 6% in 2050, and 11% by 2100."   Poor people of the USA are eligible for Medicaid, those over 65 are eligible for Medicare, poor children are eligible for CHIPS,   You are very correct in what you say with Pharmac making sure that its limited budget stretches further.  Expensive drugs with marginal impacts require tough choices, and some people don't like to face up to those choices.    This LSE link is an affirmation of doorknocking. It is consistent with the economic concept of expressive voting.  Models of expressive voting postulate that voters consume ideological or moral stances on issues by voting for them, even when they are against the voters own narrow self interest. Expressive voting is more likely if the probability of being a decisive voter is low - the election is not close.  People vote to express certain beliefs. Voting gives a sense of identity and purpose. Expressive voting is equated to cheering for sporting teams. People vote in ways that cheer for good things and boo at bad thing.  This is why higher income people vote Green  this allows them to feel good about themselves (and perhaps then get on with climbing the greasy pole After cleansing themselves with a morally attuned vote).  Another way to find identity and purpose is to vote for a particular candidate because he asked you personally - you're doing him a favour.

Nice story about the last holdouts to vaccination   A nice summary of the political psychology of partisan divide.  The drawback of these studies as with others is that a particular focus on the fact that people's voting patterns changes they get older, they get more conservative.  They often lack a gender analysis: women are much more likely to change their vote than men depending on whether they are single, married, a single parent or recently divorced. This vote switching is driven by the demand for social insurance in different family circumstances.   Isn't the correct course of action. A complaint to the police? It's a job of the police to investigate allegations such as this.    The 10 answers will surprise you as to what someone on the margins of society might choose behind the veil of ignorance   Richard Epstein said similar things, but in less detail in his brilliant obituary for John Rawls about 10 years ago on just what happens when you take a degree of political realism about self-interest in human institutions with you behind the veil of ignorance   A nice summary of the history of religious exemption giving the twists and turns in simple language   A nice study showing that crop by crop yields of organic farming are inferior to those of the comparable conventional farming   Documents the latest depths of medical quackery   Another excellent discussion from Vanity fair of a Euro crisis country, in this case, Greece and the terrible corruption and inefficiency in that country   An excellent essay In Vanity fair showing how the incompetent interventions of Irish politicians worsened the financial crisis tenfold   An excellent essay showing how the incompetent interventions of Irish politicians worsened the financial crisis tenfold   A superb roundup of the issues with some really great graphics   So many four way races in England, perhaps five way with the Greens, and the Scottish nationalists likely to sweep Scotland, no one knows how the next election is going to turn out.

In his influential book, Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty argues forcefully that rising wealth and wealth inequality is an inherent characteristic of capitalist economies and calls for strong policy responses, in particular a substantial wealth tax implemented globally.   This paper takes issue with the facts, logic, and policy conclusions in Pikettys book, suggesting that the factors needed to support the inexorable rise in capitals share and concentration are lacking and that among tax policy reforms aimed at dealing with economic inequality a wealth tax finds little support either in Pikettys own work or elsewhere in the literature.

The paper finds that the empirical relevance of the fiscal sentiment hypothesis depends on whether this Frisch elasticity of labor supply is closer to the relatively large values needed to account for the observed volatility of labor input at business cycle frequencies, than to the lower values estimated by microeconomic and quasi-experimental studies.

 I find no logic in comparing the wars the U.S. began after 9/11 with WWII (which was put in motion by Hitlers invasion of Poland). I find it equally offensive to simply accept the justification that there are fewer casualties in todays wars."  After 9/11 the U.S. literally raced off to war without even conducting proper, thorough investigations of what ACTUALLY took place. Evil Dick Cheney even asked Senator Tom Daschle, who was on the Intelligence Committee, [NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occassions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0).  Afghanistan offered to turn UBL over to U.S. authorities if the U.S. provided proof he had ordered the strikes--but the U.S. didnt even respond. Instead, the CIA began operations in Afghanistan by going  around Tora Bora throwing millions of dollars in cash to local tribes...Of course, the CIA came up empty handed.  We all know the intelligence was cooked on Iraq to give Bush/Cheney their useless, illegal war.        the CIA has been doing much more than intervening in Syria--the CIA has been helping to pump in cargo planes filled with weapons since 2012  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all _r=0  furthermore, Liz Cheney (evil Dick Cheneys daughter) began funding opposition groups in Syria and Iran as far back as 2005  http://prospect.org/article/commissars-town    **Q**: [Its 1961, the height of the Cold War, the U.S. has 40 nuclear-capable Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles--how many ICBMs did the Soviets have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/)   So, what happens when other countries start using drones to assassinate people?

I think part of what Shenon has attempted to capture in *The Commission* and *A Cruel and Shocking Act* was the inner workings of the way the 9/11 Commission and the Warren Commission functioned; meaning that Shenon was not trying to reveal the truth of what happened on 11-22-63 or 9/11. Shenon was more interested in the structure of the commissions, how the information flowed and the personalities which ended up controlling the output.   Personally, I find this approach to be obtuse--how could Shenon not find a way to follow up with some investigation at the NSA?

He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers.   In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.  In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.  Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.  Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.  The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.  Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks. The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.  The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed.  ----------------------  from **Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** by Tim Weiner (pages 137-138)...  FREE PDF @ [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/)    This is part of the problem--DISSENTING VOICES are being categorically stricken from the main stream media, and now from the larger subreddits as well.   The media has become fully complicit in the Pep Rallies to go to war in Syria. Far too often we are fed headlines with unsubstantiated facts. Then a few days later the facts dissolve into dust, but the headline has served its purpose: to strike fear and hate into the U.S. taxpayers so the CIA and the NSA and the Pentagon can proceed with their bombings and their spying and their killing.    Maybe the U.S. told Germany they will never get their gold back if they investigate.   and Why is RT--a Russian funded station--the Only channel still asking questions???   Which is why I found Amy Zegarts findings to be shocking--the intelligence oversight committees between 1985-2005 ranked LAST in hearings held every year except for one.   In the "Age of Terrorism" you would think we would demand a more public display of evidence. Instead, we know more about Casey Anthony than we do about the 9/11 terrorists. There have only been 2 criminal trials related to 9/11 in the U.S.--Zacarias Moussouai and UBLs driver (forget his name).    Surprising how quiet Americans are about the systemic consitutional violations conducted by the NSA since 9/11. Theres only been 1 writer (Lucy Steigerwald) that I know of who was bold enough to even suggest we think about some prosecutions (and that was for the Torture)...

Most Americans dont even realize how many countries the U.S. is actively conducting operations in...  -----------------  It is time for members of Congress who truly care about rule of law, oversight and the financial security of this country to speak up. Why? Because, first and foremost, the AUMF continues to contravene congressional oversight. For example, when the Obama administration sent 100 "military advisors" to Uganda in the name of counterterrorism in 2011, Congress received a simple note from President Obama. No oversight.  More recently, after unilaterally negotiating a "status of forces" agreement with Niger, the administration sent a note to Congress saying that it was sending 100 troops to the country. This week, we sent troops to Mali. Again, no oversight.  This is the new normal. Statistics provided by Special Operations Command (pdf) indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013. The AUMF premise, no matter how it gets tweaked, is enabling a system of eternal warfare, a reality that is not only financially untenable for a nation in deep debt, but also ethically indefensible.  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/authorization-use-military-force-blank-check   the other problem is the massive privatization of the military-intelligence sectors--how do we have any idea what they are doing? Dana Priest and William Arkin wrote the book Top Secret America (which was also a WaPo special investigation, then a Frontline documentary)...  * Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.  * An estimated 854,000 people, nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington, D.C., hold top-secret security clearances.  * In Washington and the surrounding area, 33 building complexes for top-secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001. Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings - about 17 million square feet of space.  http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/  http://video.pbs.org/video/2365004424/  (the book is available on amazon for *ONE CENT* + $3.99 delivery in U.S.)   Yes, History Commons has some surprising strains. Regarding the 70s oversight committees, last year Foreign Policy published an article that was based entirely on just one page of an internal NSA history which proved the NSA was spying on Sen. Frank Church (among many other Americans). I think it was Page 83 of a 2 Volume history--what do the other pages contain (and how many total pages are there)?  http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/09/25/it_happened_here_NSA_spied_on_senators_1970s  (the actual NSA declassified document is at the bottom of the article)      Wonder where William Rodriguez is today--and if he has experienced any blowback from speaking out...   ---------------  GLENN HASTEDT, AUG 23 2013  A starting point to deciphering how effectively Congress has handled its intelligence oversight responsibility here is to look to existing studies of congressional oversight.  They depict a weak oversight system marked by two characteristics.  First, it is overwhelmingly reactive, rather than anticipatory: it acts as a fireman responding to a problem rather than as police officers on patrol looking for problems.  Congressional oversight is thus sporadic.  It occurs when a fire breaks out and ceases when the fire is extinguished, to return again should smoldering embers produce another fire.  This pattern is very much in evidence in intelligence community oversight.  Four major intelligence fires have been put out.   In the mid-1970s the fire was widespread illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activity within the United States including wiretapping and mail openings.  In the mid-1980s controversy centered on the Reagan administrations covert action program in Latin America.  The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States brought forward the third congressional wave of intelligence community oversight.  Most recently we have witnessed a rapid series of fire alarms set off by disputes over the conduct of the Global War on Terrorism.  Collectively they can be seen as constituting a fourth major fire.  The first involved a secret warrantless surveillance program authorized by President George W. Bush in October 2001 giving the NSA  the authority to intercept communications between individuals on American soil and individuals abroad without judicial approval, in essence circumventing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court.  The second centered on the nature of the techniques used to interrogate suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Naval Base.  The third involved the increased use of drone aircraft to kill suspected terrorists, especially Americans.  The NSA revelations are the most current fire alarm to be set off.  http://www.e-ir.info/2013/08/23/evaluating-congressional-oversight-of-intelligence/  --------------------  Amy B. Zegart  The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight   Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.  These qualitative impressions are supported by two quantitative metrics most frequently used to evaluate oversight: hearing and legislative productivity. Tracking hearings held by fifteen House and Senate committees in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, I found that the intelligence committees ranked at the bottom every year except one. In 2005, the House Intelligence Committee held just 23 hearings (both classified and unclassified), compared to 77 hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, 91 in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and 104 hearings held by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Intelligence committees also trailed behind others in producing legislation. In a comparison of legislative productivity among four major Senate policy committees, intelligence again ranked last. Between 1985 and 2005, the Senate Intelligence Committee considered an average of just six bills per year. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered an average of 118 bills per year, the Senate Banking Committee considered 161 bills, and the Senate Commerce Committee considered an average of 241 bills each year.  http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/futurechallenges_zegart.pdf  --------------------  Zo Carpenter on January 30, 2014   First, a brief history. After revelations about abuses by the CIA and other agencies in the 1970s, Congress struck what Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at American University, calls a grand bargain, to accommodate the paradoxical need to submit secret programs to democratic oversight. New legal constraints on intelligence activities would be enforced not in public but instead behind the veil by the intelligence committees and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (also known as the FISA court). As Colorado Senator Mark Udall said at the Intelligence Committee hearing, This committee was created to address a severe breach of trust that developed when it was revealed that the CIA was conducting unlawful domestic searches.  The Snowden leaks indicate the bargain has broken down. In essence, the delicate balance Congress sought to strike thirty-five years ago now appears to be tipped, rather decisively, in favor of the intelligence community, Vladeck explained in an e-mail.  Intelligence officials have done some of that tipping themselves, by withholding information from the public and lawmakers. On Wednesday, Wyden said the committee had been stonewalled by intelligence officials; indeed, none of his questions received direct answers, although Wyden did receive promises from officials to get back to him by specific deadlines. Wyden also cited several incidents in which officials had given inaccurate testimony in public hearings. Last March, for example, James Clapper told Wyden that the NSA did not wittingly collect data on American citizens, a claim we now know from the Snowden leaks to be false.  http://www.thenation.com/blog/178168/can-congress-oversee-nsa  ---------------  Denis McDonough Supported Intelligence Oversight When Bush Was President Posted: 10/28/2014 by Ali Watkins and Ryan Grim  In 2006, with the Bush administration resisting efforts by Congress to look into the execution of its global war on terror, the Center for American Progress published a thorough document outlining the role of transparency in democracy.  Previous Senate and House Members of the intelligence committees were notably different from their successors today," the report lamented. "They were more interested in performing their oversight function responsibly than in protecting the executive branch when a committee member was of the same party."  The paper's lead author: Denis McDonough.  Today, it's McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who is protecting the executive branch from Senate Democrats fighting to perform their oversight function.  But in 2006, Center for American Progress fellow McDonough was deeply unsatisfied with the state of intelligence oversight in the U.S. Congress. Its completely lacking and soft, he wrote in his report on the subject, and the committees are far too deferential to the executive branch.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/28/white-house-cia_n_6064114.html  -------------         Looks like you can view the documentary *I KILLED JFK* with James Files online at newsmax tv later tonite...  http://www.newsmaxtv.com/   If he cant put boots on the ground in Syria, then its back to Afghanistan.

Handling the contra-funding arrangements was Saudi ambassador **Prince Bandar**... In 1985, the Saudis doubled their annual contra gift from $12 million to $25 million...   --------------------   Some great tidbits in the History Commons Timeline that allow you to connect the dots--Cheney saved the Reagan-Bush presidency by defusing the Iran-Contra investigation...Cheney was then rewarded with the Sec. of Defense post under GHW Bush...I also didnt realize that David Addington was asst general counsel for the CIA during Iran-Contra (addington would become Cheneys attorney in the OVP under GW in 2001).  from http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/110500b.html  -----------------  But the Reagan-Bush administration was not ready to tell all. Immediately, the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill moved to counter and to contain the scandal. For his part, Bush insisted that he was not in the loop on the Iran-contra business.  Cheney to the Rescue  One of the key congressional Republicans fighting this rear-guard action was Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who became the ranking House Republican on the Iran-contra investigation. Cheney already enjoyed a favorable reputation in Washington as a steady conservative hand.  Cheney smartly exploited his relationship with Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was chairman of the Iran-contra panel. Hamilton cared deeply about his reputation for bipartisanship and the Republicans quickly exploited this fact.  A senior committee source said one of Cheneys top priorities was to block Democrats from deposing Vice President Bush about his Iran-contra knowledge. Cheney kept trying to intimidate Hamilton, the source said. He kept saying if we go down that road, we wont have bipartisanship.  So, Hamilton gave Bush a pass. The limited investigation also gave little attention to other sensitive areas, such as contra-drug trafficking and the public diplomacy operation. They were pared down or tossed out altogether.  Despite surrendering to Cheneys demands time and again, Hamilton failed, in the end, to get a single House Republican to sign the final report.  Only three moderate Republicans on the Senate side  Warren Rudman, William Cohen and Paul Trible  agreed to sign the report, after extracting more concessions. Cheney and the other Republicans submitted a minority report that denied that any significant wrongdoing had occurred.  The watered-down Iran-contra majority report essentially let Vice President Bush off the hook. Bushs political career was saved.  With the Iran-contra scandal contained, Bush mounted a 1988 presidential campaign that set the modern standard for negativity, race-baiting and a win-at-all-cost ethic. In 1989, Cheney became Bushs defense secretary.  ------------      Perhaps the Saudis were helping the CIA create an enemy. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US defense industry needed to replace Enemy #1, the Communists...  ----------  "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."  --[George F. Kennan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan) in preface to Norman Cousins's 1987 book *The Pathology of Power*  (Kennan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor in 1989...by GHW Bush)  ----------------------  There is also a history of Saudi money being used by the CIA (which GHWB was director of in 1976)...  From [Consortium News](http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/121900b.html):  Weinberger was one of the first officials outside the White House to learn that Reagan had put the arm on **Saudi Arabia** to give the contras $1 million a month in 1984, as Congress was cutting off the CIA's covert assistance through what was known as the Boland Amendment.  Handling the contra-funding arrangements was Saudi ambassador **Prince Bandar**... In 1985, the Saudis doubled their annual contra gift from $12 million to $25 million...   --------------------   The U.S. has spent about [$10 TRILLION in total National Security Budget since 9/11](http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html) including about $5 TRILLION on the useless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.   The lies of the Bush-Cheney War Criminals have all been shredded--there were no WMDs in Iraq, there were no Iraqi-Al Qaeda connections. The Bush-Cheney administration claimed Usama bin Laden (et al.) planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11--yet the administration balked when Afghanistan offered to capture and turn over UBL if the U.S. could show proof that UBL committed the 9/11 attacks.   Instead, Bush-Cheney never provided any evidence--they sent in the CIA into Afghanistan with plenty of CASH on hand to pay off Afghan warlords to help hunt UBL in Tora Bora. Apparently throwing millions of dollars around in foreign countries doesnt always guarantee success--so the U.S. military went to war in Afghanistan.   Back in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney War Criminals began covering up 9/11 by asking the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 NOT to investigate--in fact [Dick Cheney asked Tom Daschle NOT to investigate several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0). The CIA, the FBI, the NSA all stonewalled the 9/11 Commission at every turn as well. In the end, the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen wrote a letter in the *NYT* accusing the [White House and the CIA of OBSTRUCTING the 9/11 investigation](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/).  General Wesley Clark is also on the record stating the [Bush-Cheney War Criminals intended to go to War with 7 countries in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw).   I dont know what exactly happened on 9/11--but I do know the U.S. government is LYING and the 9/11 Commission Report was a WHITEWASH. If you havent looked into any of these issues I would urge you do some research--because the USA seems to have become fixated on war.   The list of countries the US has bombed and/or attempted to overthrow the government of since the end of WWII is most likely much longer than you think.

Monday, Nov. 13, 2000**.  Europes dream of promoting the euro as a competitor to the U.S. dollar may get a boost from SADDAM HUSSEIN. Iraq says that from now on, it wants payments for its oil in euros, despite the fact that the battered European currency unit, which used to be worth quite a bit more than $1, has dropped to about 82[cents]. Iraq says it will no longer accept dollars for oil because it does not want to deal in the currency of the enemy.  The switch to euros would cost the U.N. a small fortune in accounting-paperwork changes. It would also reduce the interest earnings and reparations payments that Iraq is making for damage it caused during the Gulf War, a shortfall the Iraqis would have to make up.  The move hurts Iraq, the U.N. and the countries receiving reparations. So why is Saddam doing it? Diplomatic sources say switching to the euro will favor European suppliers over U.S. ones in competing for Iraqi contracts, and the p.r. boost that Baghdad would probably get in Europe would be another plus.  ---------------------          Still, theres a 33% chance that we will be saved from the global recession if WWIII starts by Christmas...   then they should raise the age of enlistment to 21 as well...

NOW HIRING: U.S. Boots on the ground Christmas 2014 tour in Iraq...Syria Summer 2015  Call U.S. WAR, INC for an interview     James Angleton, written off as a crank and a madman by his critics, had the hardest job in the CIA: keeping the enemy out. What he learned before his death was that we are our own worst enemy.   When I ventured to his pleasant house in Arlington in late 1985, I found him coming to grips with this thought. I realize how I have wasted my existence, my professional life, he told me. He was not bitter--just uncomfortable with the thought. His entire being told him that his beloved intelligence community had been penetrated by the Soviets with agents of great skill. He understood why his colleagues in the CIA eventually grew tired of his mole hunts and his efforts to protect the place. I was always the skunk at the garden party, and even your friends tire of that, he said.  The last time I saw James Angleton, his face, always thinner than thin, had changed little, even though the cigarettes he would not give up had destroyed his lungs with cancer. The other cancer that was eating away at him was the suspicion and fear that came with his job. He was a man estranged by his career from his wife and children and dying in total emotional isolation.  Within the confines of his remarkable life were most of Americas secrets. You know how I got to be in charge of counterintelligence? I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dulles and 60 of his closest friends. His monologue would stop only for a sip of tea or a violent fit of coughing. They were afraid that their own business dealings with Hitlers pals would come out. They were too arrogant to believe that the Russians would discover it at all. The real problem, Angleton concluded, was that there was no accountability. And without real accountability everything turned to shit.  All the trappings of Angletons legend were gone by this time, except for his love of exotic tea. But now, this man who had struck fear into most of his colleagues--the man who had been able to end a CIA career with a nod or a phone call--unassuming house seemed empty. You know, the CIA got tens of thousands of brave people killed...We played with lives as if we owned them. We gave false hope. We--I--so misjudged what happened.  I asked the old man dying how it all went so wrong. With no emotion in his voice, but with his hand trembling, Angleton replied: Fundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you would be promoted. These people attracted and promoted each other. Outside of their duplicity, the only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, in looking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and loved being in it...Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, Carmel Offie and Frank Wisner were the grand masters. If you were in a room with them you were in a room full of people that you had to believe would deservedly end up in hell. Angleton slowly sipped his tea and then said, I guess I will see them there soon.  Angleton has been portrayed as a lunatic and even a torturer, and, as this book has documented, he did harm to many colleagues. However, I hope this book also clarifies who he really was and gives the reader a sense of the man whose lifes mission was to protect the CIA from the enemy. As he told me, Sometimes you can find the real enemy right in the mirror.  At the end, he seemed grateful for the release his lung cancer brought him. I am afraid whatever sins I have committed in my life, he said as he sipped his tea, have now come home to roost...I am fundamentally a failure. I failed to protect the CIA, because there was no real desire to secure the place from the Soviets. I never understood the great advantage the Russians had over us...As Americans we just hold no real value in secrecy. God, it was such a simple explanation.  --------  Epilogue (pages 478-479), *THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE CIA* by Joseph Trento (2001)  currently [**ONE CENT**] (http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2hw8i0/list_of_cheap_dirty_conspiracy_booksmany_for_one/) on amazon          One count of aggravated assault?

It was leased by Deputy Sheriff B. D. Gossett. He in turn rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the court house, except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys**."

FYI: Even people who were on the 9/11 Commission have stated they were LIED to and [OBSTRUCTED by the White House](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) and the CIA.   At least 2 chapters of the 9/11 cOmmission Report were based in large part on testimony gained via TORTURE--which makes the evidence" inadmissible.  Senator Bob Graham also wrote a book about how the investigation by the Senate-House Joint Intelligence Committee was never allowed to investigate fully due to Bush/Cheney/CIA/FBI foot dragging.  Anyone who has looked into the facts KNOWS that the CIA and the DIA both knew some of the hijackers were in the U.S. in January 2000--but both the DIA and the CIA failed to notify the FBI that there were al qaeda in the U.S. The DIA operation which identified the hijackers was called ABLE DANGER--both cbs and cnn ran stories on the program in August of 2005: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0iKZdoYXs      So, McGovern is on a BOLO list for an arrest in which the charges were dropped...  FUCKING ridiculous.  Heres a question for Patreus: "Hey, Patreus--did the NSA OUT YOU from your CIA job...or was it your Pentagon comrades???"    I guess so--it just seems to be happening more frequently...maybe reddit might give gold members preference at some point?      Just look at William Blums Table of Contents page from his book [*KILLING HOPE: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions since WWII*](http://williamblum.org/books/killing-hope#toc)  Most Americans simply are too brainwashed to understand our complicity in so many conflicts (and so many deaths) across the globe.

Im assuming Russell mentioned 9/11 in his book and the host wanted to drop that question in to make him look like a fool.  Russell did get one great line in: The time when people trust politicians--thats over, thats in the past."   I think the members of congress who questioned 9/11 were all railroaded out of office.   Peter Dale Scott addresses this issue in his articles, lectures and books:  ----------------  In American history there are two types of events. There are ordinary events which the information systems of the country can understand and transmit. There are also deep events, or meta-events, which the mainstream information systems of the country cannot digest. I mean by a deep event one in which it is clear from the outset that there are aspects which will not be dealt with in the mainstream media, and will be studied only by those so-called conspiracy theorists who specialize in deep history.  http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/2007/ProfScottJFK,911,andWar.pdf  -----------------------  further reading at [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/)   Russell handled him pretty well--he definitely stiff-armed a couple of questions and re-phrased them so he couldnt get painted in a corner...

Thanks for your work at ae911truth...just had a couple questions:  1. We know the WTC steel was quickly shipped off--much of it to be recycled in China and India--but, what were the most important pieces to analyze for a proper investigation? and what percentage of these pieces were investigators given access to? was WTC 7 handled the same as the Twin Towers?   2.

Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimony  yet published it as if it were Gospel.  New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon Newsweek noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek: The 9/11 Commission appears to have ignored obvious clues throughout 2003 and 2004 that its account of the 9/11 plot and Al Qaeda's history relied heavily on information obtained from detainees who had been subjected to torture   http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/03/cia-spies-senate-intelligence-committee-attempt-make-sure-senate-report-finding-cias-torture-program-illegal-counter-productive-stays-secret.html  ---------------   Theyll spend 6 years investigating--then pay $50 million to have CIA-approved attorneys shred the report down to under 500 pages...then release the watered-down version which omits the names and places...   I used to think Brand was an a-hole...now, I think he is respectable for the fact that he will speak his mind and doesnt just let the media run him over...Its just fucked that no one can mention 9/11 without a tear in their eye and a fucking flag wrapped around them. To question what exactly happened shouldnt be seen in a negative light. To be clear: the 9/11 question he largely just sidestepped--but it seems likely he wrote something in his book which definitely questions the Official Story.  9/11 was the Crime of the fucking Century--how many CSI and reality crime shows do people watch mindlessly every night? But to question real life crimes which actually matter is frowned upon because the media has brainwashed the citizens.    -----------------  9/11 was the Crime of the fucking Century--how many CSI and reality crime shows do people watch mindlessly every night?

 It's gone down 0.1 pH. It's now 7.9 to 8.2.   There is one right answer. It is this one. ^  *pronounced Ehn-Cel-Lay-Dee-Ans   We can't know with just Cassini. When Cassini was sent out the idea that Enceladus of all places would look even marginally interesting (life-wise) was laughable.          Sounds like it would look like some sort of cross between Lucy and Homo habilis... so sorta ape plus caveman?   Fair enough.  And when you tally how much money every Star Trek movie grossed collectively since 1979 (without correcting for inflation, we admit), its only slightly more than that one Transformers movie made at the box office.    That's a good point...the mirror test has some flaws.   But note, rhesus monkeys have never passed the mirror test before. The study is interesting because these monkeys, which do not intrinsically understand mirrors, could *learn* to use them. That's promising, especially when you think of neurologic conditions that cause humans to fail the mirror test. If mirror recognition can be taught, perhaps therapy can help these people in the future.     ...says the biologist :P   Those Alberta servers are clearly not made to handle Redditors.   It turns out that cowbirds gauge their risk of death-by-truck based on distance, not speed.  So yeah, basically.    Robert Seyfarth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and pioneer in the fields of animal behavior and learning, wrote in an e-mail. This is the first time that a professional linguist has tackled the data on call combinations in wild monkeys.  So at least from a research standpoint, it means that we may want to start examining animal calls through the lens of linguistics. That's a sort of revolutionary idea, since we tend to think of animals noises as "calls", rather than a language or a dialect with logic-based rules. It's an interesting new avenue for research.         I always think it's ironic that Greens cite scientific consensus for climate change, but ignore the equally compelling evidence that GMOs are safe.   If you're on the side of science, stick with it.   WELL...the DoE lightbulb thing and the EXIM ban were honestly a bit draconian. It's one thing to charge companies extra for choosing the less environmentally friendly option, or to add taxes or incentives. But these were outright bans on investing in incandescent lightbulbs and coal-fired power plants. And the DoT light rail thing just shuts down current projects (the same senators who pushed for that rider are also working on new light rail projects as we speak).  The only thing that I see on your list that looks purely spiteful and "villain level" is the UN Climate Fund. Why the hell can't we let the poor guy fulfill his pledge to save the world?!   Even small farmers are notoriously bad for the environment. They all need to make money, especially the small ones, and so they often let their cash crops mess up normal crop cycles.     I mean, the good news is that these sorts of things can be easily reversed next year. They won't be...but they could be. Every year when it comes time to figure out appropriations, it's another opportunity.   It made the farmers pretty happy. It's strange, you usually think of farmers as being lovers of the land and pro-Earth etc...and then you take a look at the politics of it all, and notice that farmers are usually the ones pushing hardest against climate and land protection. Strange times.    Pres. Obama is not allowed to fulfill his pledge to give $3 billion to the United Nations Green Climate Fund, designed to spur other countries to respond to global warming.  ...that can't be a good thing.  	19

Also we used to have neighborhood cats that would stop and get fed at every house on the street because everyone thought they were strays/starving to death. They'd live with us for a while then go missing for like 3 days seeing their other families.   My mom calls my cats her "grandcats"   YOU'RE NOT MY REAL mom!   Yea kids will feed all kinds of stuff to dogs if you let them. Chocolate cake, etc.  NONONONONON We don't feed that to lard ass (I mean fido)   my cats are really good at this. I feed them, husband feeds them and then when we get home I feed them, a few hours later he feeds them again. We have a pig cat who will sit there are eat until she pukes. And then continue eating again, if we let her.   I'm real bad about popping the blisters and then they leave like a crater scar where there's a chunk of flesh missing. :-0   my pink sparkly riding crop.

They have generic versions of mederma that are pretty good   It depends. if they are keloid scars they will almost never fade. If however they are just minor lacerations and heal without a raised scar they will fade to at least be a bit lighter over the years   yay! thanks :)   Sorry sir, if you don't like it write your congressman.

I WANT IT   uh how the fuck are we supposed to remember every single customer's phone/pin number?   Yeah, if she threw her credit card on the floor it would stay there.   At my mother's clinic they had signs, basically "hang the fuck up" and people still came up to the receptionist, phone in hand.   I don't know your pin number. YOU have to do that part.    That is awesome.    That explains a lot.   oh my god that sounds horrible.

Do you guys turn them over to creditors or what?   She wants you to let her in   "Sorry honey, the cat was here first." :)   I don't understand why people are so confused. They hand the card to me. I can't see the fucking screen! Have you never used a card before?   I do the same thing. Until you hang the fuck up I am pretending you are invisible.   Reminds me of my coworker who had a customer who wanted to run her card as credit but inevitably kept typing in her pin number. So the coworker had to cancel and reset it. over and over and over again. sigh   If it was genital warts there would likely be more than one.   bah you can have it shipped to store? then shipping is free. what a whiner   hmmm $25 or $5, which is more.

Also, free babysitting   IDK, mine went through to the paypal payment screen. sorry :(   Sorry I had to downvote but your comment made me die a little inside.

 A decade of attempts to prosecute Patrick Head and Adrian Newey failed to clear up the cause of the accident - IMO we would have been better off without a prosecution looking for fault. In the years that followed the conspiracy theories surrounding the crash muddied the waters enough that anyone with a genuine interest in what happened couldn't ask even the simplest question about it and get a sensible answer.   The broad conclusion seems to be that the last minute modifications that Senna had requested to the steering column were badly executed, failed, and that caused the accident. Williams contend that the column failed on impact - but there was certainly some kind of cover up involved given what happened to the [black boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ayrton_Senna#Trial). That said there were certainly other factors both sporting and otherwise involved. At least three of the cars in that race, particularly the Benneton that Senna was racing, were running [illegal software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_cheating_controversy), there are some questions over the tyres and the condition of the circuit - but accidents are never caused by just one factor.   For me the worst part is that had the angle or speed of impact been fractionally different he probably would have survived, just as the 4 other drivers who had 180 mph crashes just there did.   The files from [the trial](http://www.ayrton-senna.com/s-files/trialidx.html) are worth a read, particularly the testimony from the 4 other drivers that crashed at Tamburello in the years preceeding the 94' accident, and its also worth reading [Beatris Assumpcao's](http://betisesportsworld.net/2014/05/01/senna-what-bernie-really-said-to-leonardo-senna/) (Ayrton's PR) first hand account of the conversation between Bernie and Leonardo Senna after the accident (bear in mind only one person in that room was a native English speaker).   Well, its informative at least. The main point behind it was to highlight the cast of characters involved in the race - and it was a great race.            Oh pretty much. This same fight has been going on since the sport began. Complaints are always the same - costs too high, too many rules, bad rules, dominant driver 'boring', dominant team 'boring', rules making body evil, people in charge demonic, money/tyres/engines ruining the sport etcetera, etcetera.  Its all happened before, and will happen again.   At the point both of those were written no one would have predicted HAAS becoming a Ferrari B team. Things change.         The wisdom in this sub seems to be that HAAS will be back of the grid, but looking a Sauber's performance this year I'd suspect mid-field, and aiming to challenge Lotus in a couple of seasons. Heck looking at Sauber this year, they could buy their 2014 chassis and still be mid-field with the Ferrari engine.  Equally interesting is the idea that they might partner with Dallara on a chassis - which could spell the beginning of a true customer car effort for F1.  I can't see why Raikkonen would go there unless he is very desperate for a seat, I also can't see why HAAS would need to pay that much for an experienced driver when there are many cheaper experienced driver options. Then again Hill went to Jordan - stranger things have happened in F1.   I agree, and I've advanced the same argument myself regarding family tickets because I'd love to take my kids to Silverstone. To do that I'm looking at 350 in tickets, 400 for accomodation, at least a 70 tank of fuel and spending money on top of that. All up it's around 1000 - 1200 for a race weekend. Average earnings are around 475 a week.  A 1991 general admission ticket for Silverstone cost me 35, plus 60 travel, 50 for accommodation, and then spending money. At the time I was earning about 250 a week.   So the price has increased substantially, obviously, but it wasn't exactly cheap to begin with, and having worked at Silverstone for a decade marshalling stands I can't honestly say that motor racing fans in general are working class - we're not NASCAR.  TV is expensive - 700 per year for a sky package - or 139.80 a season for Now TV, and I do think it puts fans off, but it also pays for the show. Its easy to make the argument that anything is too expensive, because everything is, but we do have to face the financial reality of the sport.   He's a pretty good guy and loves the competition. He seems to be loving the competition with Alonso, even if the car sucks.  Fascinating insight from him about Hamilton considering how closely they raced at McLaren.   Theoretically, yes, but they still have to deal with this season's costs. They're not going to turn down sponsors and money.   They just announced a 40 million loss, any revenue is helpful.  I like Hulkenberg, but they have a tradition of pairing rookie's with more experienced drivers and, sad as I am to say it, I don't see what they would get from Hulkenberg that they couldn't get elsewhere for less money and the prospect of a longer career in the team.   Godaddy is leaving NASCAR, and they'll be sponsoring her personally rather than the team she drives for after leaving. They're focussing more on international markets - which makes some interesting possibilities!  I hope Speed stays where he is and I'd love to see JEV back in an F1 seat, but I suspect with the 600lb Gorilla that is Merc behind him that Wherlien will find a drive quickly.   Thats a truly absurd one.   I'm quite interested in the idea of Danica Patrick to HAAS, would shake things up quite nicely. Certainly create some positive noise and controversy in the USA market, which will only help bring fans along.  Mercedes are very keen on Pascal Wherlien since they funded Force India's testing to get him some kilometers - he'd have to be in the running if Bottas left Willams, or for the other HAAS seat.               "But you will see a more determined Lewis at the next race. I remember with Lewis that when we had a tussle in a race or there was an issue between us or with the team, he would have a really bad race and be quite outspoken and emotional. And at the next race he would destroy me. He would come back stronger than ever."  "Initially, he is an emotional character, and he will be quite hurt, but he comes back strong. After a bad race he would arrive at the next one very quiet, and then go out and blitz it. He will do the same in Canada - he will probably be untouchable in Canada. And he likes the circuit."  There are quite a few variations of partial quotes knocking around the media sphere but that's the most complete one I could find.  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/formula-1-button-predicts-hamilton-will-destroy-rosberg-canada-after-monaco-rift-1450272  http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/24181/9327816/jenson-button-feels-an-unhappy-lewis-hamilton-will-be-untouchable-in-canada   This is the peak of Rosberg's F1 career - he has the best car, the best engine, the best team, and enough money to buy the best trainers and sports psychologists.   Every advantage you could want as a driver is his - his future is entirely in his own two hands. So, while I do feel some sympathy for his obvious difficulties, its not a huge amount.         True. But its also not an uncommon setup Renault are based at Viry-Chtillon for example. Mostly I suspect they would want specialised facilities and a place to house their backroom staff in Europe.   I suspect Lewis knows what's up already. As one commenter put it yesterday, he is in God Mode right now.   Jensen said that if he beat Lewis, Hamilton would be quite emotional after the race, then simply "destroy" him the next time out.               Likely as not McLaren don't have the facilities they need - Mercedes did their engine development at a separate facility.                  Why do you post so consistently like a Rosbergette then?   I post positive and negative stuff about Rosberg, Hamilton and plenty of other drivers - there certainly is no 'campaign'!   You're just sore because the driver you like isn't winning the war.     The team aren't allowed tell him where the button for that mode is anymore ;o)   We all have. Hamilton's anger in losing is directed at himself and he uses that on the track the next time out, although sometimes it gets hold of him for long periods - but its an outward reflection of an inner disappointment.  Rosberg gets pissed off at everyone else, does dumb stuff on track, plays tricks that backfire, and/or says something stupid, then lashes out looking for an external source to blame for his errors or lack of success.   Rosberg is supposed to be the engineer and thinker - but I can't see any evidence that is the case. As /u/cock-a-doodle-doo says, Lewis is in God mode at the moment, nothing Rosberg has in his arsenal is making a dent and blaming Lewis appears to be his only refuge right now.   I'm beginning to think he has a preference for that type of car.               Sad but true. Nico really needs figure out how to put up a proper fight or accept number two status - I don't think his head is anywhere near either of those things right now.               See explanation here http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/33ozaa/are_you_enjoying_the_return_of_sparks_to_f1/cqn3cey   "The purpose of making them out of titanium is threefold: Firstly, it's safer, because if they do come off they are about a third of the weight of the existing ones. Secondly, the titanium wears some 2-2.5 times more quickly than the metal currently used. Thus cars will have to be run a little bit higher to manage wear and teams won't be able to drag them on the ground quite as much as they have in the past. The third effect is that you will see a lot more sparks, which some people think will look a little more spectacular." **- Charlie Whiting**      In the days without refuelling a car's weight would change drastically during the race.   To avoid damage to the underside of the car when it was heavy with fuel at the start of the race the teams employed magnesium strips between the rear wheels. These would wear away during the race leaving the correct floor profile once the car was light enough to run in optimum trim.    Planks were introduced in 94' principally because of Senna's accident, the car's speed needed to be kept down for safety reasons. There are other factors too, no one really wants to fund the technology race stepped floors would bring with them.  If you [look at the plank](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg/1920px-Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg) you'll see there are [metal parts in it](http://f1.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/24100/24139.jpg) - there have always been metal parts in it - its just that they didn't spark.   We designed engines that output fantastic amounts of heat - the more powerful the engines became the more heat we had to deal with.  Then we designed aero that streamlines the cars movement, but throws off extremely turbulent air.  Then we discovered that a consequence of both was that you would destroy your tyres, and also your brakes, getting near the driver in front - you could barely establish tow anymore - so overtaking became impossible.  DRS and narrower cars and rear wings are a technical solution to a technically generated problem. Push-to-pass is just another solution to the same issue.   They simply changed the metal skid block in the planks to titanium rather than a heavier metal - it prevents the teams running the cars too low and it causes less punctures.      I suspect he's thinking of the 60s and 70s when people would buy and old chassis and jump in for a couple of races.  Would certainly enliven the driver market as it would open up a few more seats and allow some rookies to show their stuff. I don't think its a horrible idea.  Caterham, Marussia, and similar teams have basically been in a separate F1 class for a very long time, improved reliability has robbed us of the heroic back of the grid podium drives that you used to get when the front four blew up or crashed out, so why not.   According to [Charlie Whiting](http://en.espn.co.uk/fia/motorsport/story/167205.html) they're not just for show, the sparks are welcome side effect of a downforce reduction and safety measure.  That said according to Brundle Sainz and Ricciardo have said you need to keep your visor shut when following other cars now - the sparks do seem more extreme than they used to be (edit: I'm wrong on this last [point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmgMxqZd9jw) thank you /u/AutoEngineer22 for the reminder).  "To explain: the plank is the long bit of wood, the skids are bits of metal within the plank. The skids have formerly been made of a heavy metal, which has been very resistant to wear, and they put the skids around the points in the plank where thickness is measured. Planks have to start off at nominally 10mm thick and they can't be less than 9mm thick. However, we only measure them around certain holes in the plank. So they position the skids around those holes.  "This metal is extremely heavy and when pieces detach they can be extremely harmful. We saw two punctures in Spa previously because of bits of this metal that lay in a kerb and caused damage. In a worst case scenario they could fly off and hit someone.  "The purpose of making them out of titanium is threefold: Firstly, it's safer, because if they do come off they are about a third of the weight of the existing ones. Secondly, the titanium wears some 2-2.5 times more quickly than the metal currently used. Thus cars will have to be run a little bit higher to manage wear and teams won't be able to drag them on the ground quite as much as they have in the past. The third effect is that you will see a lot more sparks, which some people think will look a little more spectacular."  edit: here is what [the plank looks like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg/1920px-Honda_RC-F1_2.0X_bottom_Honda_Collection_Hall.jpg) on Honda's RC-F1 test car. Crashtor provides us with another example [here](http://f1.imgci.com/PICTURES/CMS/24100/24139.jpg).   Its a cost reduction effort. One engine per race would quadruple the engine costs.               I realise that's the meme on costs but where is the evidence that this is a new problem?  Most say 'teams are going under' - since 1950 there have been 137 official F1 constructors, only 10 remain active and the median average constructor competes for 3 seasons, in 20 races, with 5 drivers wins nothing, and scores no points.  'Costs are increasing' - In 2003 Jordan Ford's annual budget was around [$79 million](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today, some are as low as $80 million.   Ferrari by comparison were spending $300 - $400 million in 2003, and they're spending around $250 million this year.   Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine.  People also bang on about the race fee, but FOM has cut sweetheart deals for most of the old european circuits, and has covered Hockenheim's losses since 2009 to the tune of 27 million Euro. People act like the race fee is pure profit that is being drained out of the sport - again no evidence - F1's profits last year were $398 million on $1.6 billion revenue - most of the costs were money paid out to the teams.               Classic Senna move from Massa   I honestly don't know how I missed it - first time I've ever been grateful for youtube follow up.      Massa had the racing line and was more than half way alongside, Coulthard should have pulled out and gone for him at the next corner - he was running out of road and assumed Massa didn't want to crash.               "If he doesn't I'm going to kick three colours of shit out of the little bastard."  Nice considering Coulthard drove into Massa.   Everyone is a pay driver, its a distinction without meaning anymore, truth is it's been that way since the 70s. Getting sponsors, getting into a young driver programme, or both is now as much a part of the race as performing on the track.   Young drivers are having to form investment companies which sell portions of their future earnings to raise the cash to compete.  Sponsors go to drivers and drivers bring them to teams for all but the top four. Alonso bought Santander to McLaren and Ferrari leaving them behind when he left.   Which I've pointed out elsewhere in the thread.   But, the 5th engine was agreed in Malaysia according to Horner and is just a formal fax vote away. So in reality its going to be 3.8 (4) engines a race.     20 races / 4 engines = 5 races per engine.  German Grand Prix has been cancelled so its a 19 race season, not 20.     I imagine they were anticipating that coming along, and losing the German Grand Prix means they have one less race to manage, but that still means each engine has to last 3.8 races rather than 4.75 (obviously 4 and 5 races in practice).  Its going to be very interesting to see how the end of the season plays out.   Of new engines, sure, they'll still have re-conditions.   It also suggests that the might have some reliability concerns and some worries over Mercedes development rate.                           Its actually quite a big difference in cooling. The helmet winglet disrupts airflow into the vents on the side of the airbox and the airbox itself, area's which have become very important since 2014.   RedBull actually tested wingless helmets this year to see if they could eliminate helmet lift some other way, but you could see the air displacement in flow-viz.   http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/33dqa5/hondas_radical_formula_1_engine/   Yes, I missed the essential detail.  People could always read the article, oh wait, this is reddit.   Happy to see this story, many people tell me that drivers don't influence the design of F1 cars. Nothing could be further from the truth.   Because they knew Ferrari had little chance of getting to Hamilton if he built a lead, but a 100% shot getting by Rosberg. Look at [the race strategy](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2015/04/could-raikkonen-have-won-bahrain-and-did-mercedes-leave-rosberg-at-vettels-mercy/) report, if Kimi had got into P2 in quali then he had a very decent shot a the win.   Nico wasn't racing Hamilton, or in with a shot at racing Hamilton.          And Stuttgart. Marketing is marketing.   It was McLaren's publicly stated intent to acquire another British driver, just as when Mercedes talked about buying a team they said they wanted an all German line up.   Teams make marketing decisions, and its important within Germany that they're seen to be supporting German drivers. Its really no different than McLaren choosing an all British line up.   They'll want at least one German driver, when they launched the team the thinking was an all German lineup, and Rosberg was the only available driver at the required level to partner Schumacher. If they replace Rosberg it'll be with Wehrlien assuming Vettel is unavailable.   Equal status is about opportunity, not on track realities, it means the driver in front gets preferential treatment - the drivers job is to make sure he's the one in front.   Though, as we've seen in the last two races Rosberg has received pit priority when his strategy needed it, and so went ahead of Lewis. You don't hear Hamilton fans complaining about that...   If you read the Nico [can't hide my 'disappointment' article](http://www.grandprix247.com/2015/04/22/rosberg-i-cant-always-hide-my-disappointment/) you'll find he says it is in his contract. Judging by his results against Schumacher it always has been.            He started from the pit lane and retired after thirteen laps.            Parade laps don't count you have to cross the start line after lights out .   If you're bothered the information is on just about any F1 records site and on the wiki. Its hardly secret information.   They'd seen the brake temperate issue from the very first lap, I don't know if they'd been told to expect it, but as I said, it wasn't that the didn't have any brakes, its that the brakes they had changed all of a sudden.   Believe it or not he hasn't been in F1 long enough to break 150.  His run started at Monaco 2008 and he's done 126 consecutive starts to date.   Lewis, in his BBC interview, and Toto in his post-race on Sky, both said that the car does have brakes when the system is in failure mode, but that the pedal travel goes from short/hard to long/soft.   This is fine if you're expecting it, as you can drive to it, but Rosberg's went in the middle of the braking zone so he had no chance to adjust. Lewis remembered some kind of switch combination which managed to bring his back.   Interestingly this is just about the only F1 top 10 that doesn't feature Schumacher, his runs at this record ended in:-  - Italy 94' excluded for two races for ignoring stop go penalty and a black flag.  - France 96' with an engine failure on the formation lap. - Austria 99' missed 6 races with a broken leg.   The mistake is at the website end - the quote in the title is from Max, I posted it earlier with the original title and got flak from the anti Jos circle jerk crowd, now I'm getting the opposite and downvoted to boot. Can't win!   - Riccardo Patrese - 187 (BEL 1982  AUS 1993) - Jenson Button - 179 (FRA 2005  CHN 2015) - Fernando Alonso - 176 (FRA 2005  ABD 2014) - David Coulthard - 175 (BRA 1995  CAN 2005) - Nico Rosberg - 170 (BRN 2006  BRN 2015) active - Rubens Barrichello - 167 (GER 2002  BRA 2011) - Alain Prost - 160 (USW 1981  BRA 1991) - Mark Webber - 157 (FRA 2005  BRA 2013) - Lewis Hamilton - 152 (AUS 2007  BRN 2015) active               Yep:  For the otherwise highly-impressive 17-year-old Max, it has been a frustrating start to his career with three car failures in four races.  Maybe thats a record, the young Dutchman smiled wryly. Its a bit ridiculous. Of course Im worried about the future.  I try to stay positive, but now my fist is hitting the table. This cannot continue, but I know they understand that too, Verstappen added.    I'm not disagreeing with your logic, but even the 'great' drivers have off years. There are a lot of reasons behind them, but I don't think you can genuinely separate driver from car from team.  For me at least, its *team* sport - part of the race is getting into the good teams with the great cars and learning enough along the way to deliver on track. I've never bought the argument that you could stick any driver in a great car and they'd win - maybe because I've seen too many pairings that prove otherwise.   Clark had his off year in 1966 coming 6th in the WDC with Team Lotus - he wasn't beaten by his teammate because he had 8 other drivers and three different engine manufacturers during the season.   Senna's worst year was 84', his first year, where he came 9th in the WDC. Just like Clark he had multiple teammates that year (3) so wasn't beaten by his teammate.   Teammate comparisons don't really hold, because its only recently teams have equivalence - most of Senna's teammate's were not anywhere near his class - just reliable number twos.   I wish more people understood this point.   James Allen produces a race report every tuesday after the race that contains this kind of information. Weirdly few people seem to be interested in it.   Consequence of a powerful engine and fast car IMO some of the reasoning behind the new wing is keeping turbulent hot air away from the tyres.   Toto also pointed out that they saw the brake temperature issue right from the start of the race, so keeping the pace down would likely help keep the brake temperature under control.                  I'm beginning to think its part of their fairness strategy.   Its going to make Canada very interesting.            Strongly suspect a commentary career beckons for Mr Button when he's done racing!                        He said they were dangerous himself yesterday evening. When Williams started to best him in Q2 I thought he had some kind of problem - it's his favorite circuit so I was expecting him to beat Lewis this time around.   I'd argue that when they have a WDC winner in the number one spot they look for a reliable second tier driver to back them up in the WCC stakes.   But as I've said elsewhere Ferrari seem to have realised that their own orthodoxy is getting in their way. All I'm really saying is that a younger generation's input into their engineering team would not be out of place - many other teams seem to benefit greatly from it.   Actually a season long qualifying competition isn't a bad idea. There is a pole position trophy already so it might be fun to spice it up.   So Hamilton took his 4th pole of the season and Rosberg got beaten by Hamilton, Vettel, Bottas and Raikkonen at various points in todays sessions. Ouch.   This happened at his favorite circuit and one he's been on pole at two years in a row. Double ouch.   'Shut up and drive' never had more meaning for an F1 driver.   "I want the Ferrari's to be closer" - famous last words.      I think, since its Williams Martini, rather than Martini Williams, that they're making a smaller contribution than one might expect. I'm certain they don't have an ownership interest in the company, as Williams is publicly listed.   Ordinarily I'd agree, but I think Ferrari may have realised that 'their style' is actually a problem for them and so they need to question their own orthodoxy.  Its been pointed out by a number of pundits and commentators that the new drivers have a somewhat different style, 'feel', and approach to racing lines than most of the senior field. I think some of that is down to their having grown up lionising the attacking styles of Hamilton and Vettel rather than the more fluid (in the corners) Schumacher.   Equally Red Bull and McLaren have done very well out of fast promotions, Ferrari not so much, so I suspect they'll be having a conversation about getting the next generation in the door early on.      I've always thought that it wasn't bad luck that Alonso has ended up with the cars that he did but poor feedback from him, and a preference for difficult suspension geometry.   I'm so disappointed that JEV didn't get an F1 drive!  So yeah, I'd see him in a Ferrari seat alongside Vettel. It's going to be interesting to see who HAAS take and I can see Lotus abandoning Maldonado which would create some more seats.    I'm sure he's also in the frame! It's not an exhaustive list.   I didn't see any sector times in China that couldn't be explained by tyre deg or strategy. F1 isn't, and never has been, about pure speed, it's really about carrying speed through the corners better than the opposition. That's what Red Bull were very good at.   Drivers have a lot more input into car development than most people on here seem to appreciate - drivers move car development as much, if not more so, than car development moves driving style.   It's also a challenge to build a team around you, as a driver, that can deliver reliability and win.     I don't think that's fair looking at 2008, and the number one driver situation at Ferrari has been true for decades. Any driver going in there knows where he stands.  Kimi's 35, even he wasn't sure he wanted to race longer than 2015, and he's been happier at Ferrari than any other team.   I'd like to see him outrace Massa consistently but he and Ricciardo  would definitely be in the frame.   Too much is made of the Hamilton/Ferrari possibility.   There are plenty of other young drivers worthy of Ferrari's consideration, that Vettel would be compatible with, that would save money in the short term and deliver in the long term. Organisationally they are focussed on the next 5 years, not the next two.   Verstappen springs to mind, as do several GP2 drivers like Stevens and Wherlien. The younger generation of drivers are really quite different in style than the current senior generation and Ferrari need that input.   I do.   Aside from the fact that Red Bull are *notorious* for making late decisions about driver line ups, there is a straight commercial advantage in ensuring drivers don't take their secrets to other F1 teams. Looking at the way they've played the Renault situation it also fits with the way they think about going racing.  Leaks were a big concern of RBR's when Vettel left and Prodromou departed for McLaren - an entirely justified one as this season has demonstrated so far looking at McLaren's front wing and chassis - but its now obvious that Red Bull have problems deeper than the PU.  It's also worth pointing out that the brain drain from Ferrari over the 2010 WDC benefited Mercedes enormously, and it's a straight line from there to Mercedes 2013 success - Mercedes real innovation was getting the chassis right. They already had the most powerful engine in the two years before 2013.   In essence Ferrari fired the wrong people in their rush to find someone to carry the can for their 2010 failure, and avoid blaming senior management or the drivers, as was finally noticed at the end of last year. Equally Red Bull appear to have a blame culture problem that extends from the very top of the organisation down.   I can imagine Webber is - he never struggled for an opinion!   Its a pity that you don't. Although I really enjoy Brundle's commentary I'm beginning to find Crofty at little irritating.  Part of me hopes that Button will take up commentary when he retires - he always has sensible, well informed, things to say.            He did, and as I say, I don't want to take away from Ricciardo's achievements, which are many and impressive. There is an unfortunate tendency these days to view saying that, for example, Hamilton is a 'historic' driver as implied criticism of Rosberg - when it isn't. A fast glance at the F1 driver record books is enough to settle that debate.  I haven't lived in Aussie since 2005, but I do remember Murray Walker doing a Channel 10 special with Alan Jones on one of that era's races - perhaps it was just a special. Since I was travelling at the time I wasn't really in touch with TV.    It's not just the recession, it's the fact that the budgets have climbed so high that nobody wants to pay for the majority of the budget through sponsorship.  Nonsense. In 2003 Jordan Ford's annual budget was around [$79 million](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams, some are as low as $80 million.   Ferrari by comparison were spending $200 - $400 million in 2003, and they're spending around $250 million this year.   Which, overall, suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine.   Yep, on a circuit with two long straights Merc were always going to win if they made the right strategy calls. I was hoping Rosberg would do a better job at the start though and get closer to Hamilton in the opening laps.  Interesting reaction from Rosberg to the Ferrari threat though.                                                               	197

I've woken up right before my alarm and in my sleep induced drunk, I started panicking, wondering if I downloaded the right texture pack the previous night so I could get dressed, and then proceeded to look for my laptop in the bathtub. I wish I had a good excuse for that.    YES! Glad he won!   Thanks!   This takes patience and skill that I simply do not have. I applaud you.    I'm not Hispanic, but I'm rather advanced in Spanish.

WE NEED UPDATES!!! Unless you're dead...then that would be crazy...or this just annihilated the ending. Or Rose hacked him. Fuck...now I'm overthinking nosleep.   My radio likes to turn on on its own. All it does is make loud, irritating, static. Usually I don't mind...sometimes I'm even too lazy to get up and turn it off. When it does this in the middle of Rose's dialogue, I can't help but throw things at it in fear.    I am a native speaker and I thought that was a saying.

Fuck cleanliness too.    Ugh..that's going to take a while...I guess that's payback for derping up. Thanks!   I accidentally changed my spawnpoint...twice. The first time I tried the command, I thought it would take me to my spawnpoint. Since I didn't go anywhere, I tried it again thinking I entered it wrong. Turns out, I changed my spawn point twice. Is there any way I can reverse this? (I'm in a superflat and have been searching the Nether for my portal. Haven't had any luck with that..)

Thanks!   If you have an Underground membership, can you download all of the previous CDs/order them? (LP8 is the best!)   "Oh shit...didn't they do that thing with Jay-z?" Or "Faggots. Why do you listen to that screamy emo shit?" OR  "FUCK YEEEEEEEEEEAH!"   I like guys who are just a bit too socially awkward than expected...not necessarily the type to sit at a computer all day, but more of the kind that's almost too shy to say hi to random people. (And OP's quirk: awesome.)   The other one is Project Diva~   Would love to...but, there's a bit of an ocean in the way. But a meetup would be awesome!   Same here over in Wisconsin...the snow cam is so uneventful.         I know Hatafutte Parade, Mein Gott, Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman, and Excuse me, I'm Sorry were performed, but I'm wondering if there were any others as well.    I always tell people my dreams if they're interesting; and I hate being a hypocrite. But when people tell me about how 'demonic' or 'dark' their dream was, I usually get irritated. The only thing more irritating is when my friend tells me she doesn't dream and when she does it's a sign that something bad will happen and she should stay home and watch TV that day.   Do you get your period on both? And if so, at the same time?   We broke another website...overloaded.   Not all of them are wrapped in the plastic. I've seen them at bookstores open; they expect everyone to be mature and buy it or pirate the ebook before reading it in public.   I was wondering that too....it just disappeared. Nothing with 20000+ points just disappears.   We have a bunch of those in our science classroom. They're not plugged in though...   Found it again!      Yet the textbooks at my school are falling apart...   You lucky lucky female you,    It was! I could fly across it at a point. I took out my compass trying to find my way back to my spawn point. It told me my spawn point was right next to the huge thing! So I was dumb enough to fall out of the world...no such luck. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to come across something like that again. There were even diamonds in the caves!   There's trees on top too-a whole biome!         If someone took my bike like that, I wouldn't even be mad. They obviously deserve it more than me.       Licorice. It seems the whole planet loves it, and thinks Twizzlers are the best candy in the world, but I just can't seem to see how it tastes so fantastic.    Thanks!    Okay, this seems like a really dumb question, but I was wondering if Minecraft had to be updated for anvils to be available, since I can't craft them.    I have that printer...it sucks shit. Can't even print out a simple document without screwing up.    My friend can't remember anything. It annoys the living hell out of me when she can't remember plans or something but can remember anything science and math related. If I hadn't met her brother, I would think she was full of shit. Even though sometimes I do anyways...   "Rowling would not rule out another book set in Voldemort-ville. But as far as "Harry's story is concerned," Rowling said, "I'm done."

In science, some kid started to explain how retarded it was that we had to study paramecium. Someone decided to reply with "Don't say retarded you fucking fag!"   Most certainly!   I am honestly impressed with this website; It has tracks from extremely well known artists to artists from overseas. Even character songs! This is definitely going into my favorites~!   So...I guess we broke another website.    The bubble wrap bag things came with Vault. I was so excited when I saw the package!   Whelp, I'm done eating for life.

It is highly dubious as to wether Hitler really did have one testicle, it has never been conclusively proven and frankly it does sound like propoganda to me. However, Herman Goering was shot in the testicles during the Beer Hall, or Munich Putsch in 1923 and as a result became addicted to morphine for the rest of his life.  Also Chairman Mao, China's 'Communist' leader (lets call a spade a spade, China is a Fascist state regardless of what they call themselves) suffered from an undescended testicle.  There seems to be a pattern doesn't there, fascist dictators tend to have one ball. Makes you wonder what Mussolini's package consisted of.   As with any new medicine, the idea of a vaccination (curing one decease by infecting another) was met with great distrust. [Here is a contemporary cartoon](http://imgur.com/ar3Bu) showing just how much people were afraid of getting vaccinated when it was first introduced. Edward Jenner (the discoverer of the smallpox vaccine) is the man standing in the middle of the cartoon.   I (along with the rest of the non-american western world) find it truly and deeply disturbing that this is such a prevalent view taken by Americans, and that apparently some people in the states can't tell the difference between a high-powered military-grade assault rifle and a baseball bat. There is ***NO*** justification for such a weapon to be available to the public, no rational reason whatsoever. If you want a gun for personal protection, get a pistol or two and place it in a lock box somewhere strategic in your home. If you want a high powered rifle, join the military or just grow up and be satisfied with the penis you were born with.   "The enemy of my enemy..."   Bullshit. This would imply that Leonardo finished the Mona Lisa 4 years after he died (The Mona Lisa was started in 1503 and Leonardo died in 1519).

If you zoom in far enough you can actually see climbers, albeit climbing the glacier not the actual mountain.  For those interesting this is taken from Kalar Pathar and the new Everest Base Camp is along the bottom of the picture, under the Glacier. Everest is the peak on the left, half hidden behind a closer peak and Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest, which is the 4th highest mountain in the world!    I'd be happy to trade travel advice for your drawing! Trekking in the Himalayas is probably the coolest and most rewarding thing I have ever done, it doesn't take a lot of money or experience either! If you want to do it, go for it! I did an AMA about travelling if you are interested, [heres a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14dbv0/i_travelled_around_the_entire_world_solo_when_i/)!

I look at this as a finished piece of work, and I am exceptionally impressed.   Wow, hard to believe all that was carved out in an afternoon. Very hard to believe indeed.   Apparently it was very old glass (some of it 15cm thick) and it ruptured due to age and very cold weather. The tank contained 33 tons of water along with several animals such as sharks, turtles and rays (plus 3 lemon sharks which can grow to 10 feet in length). All the animals died and 16 people were injured, although none seriously.

'Melanie Laurent -En T'Attendant'  It's hard to define what genre this is, its the Damien Rice end of large ensemble folk music (Rice guests on the album on a few tracks). A lot of the album is french language so I have no idea what the songs are about a lot of the time, but the music is wonderful! [Here is a link to the title track.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwb8hXlUE1E)   Fun fact: Melanie Laurent is the actress who played Shoshanna in Inglorious Basterds. She is also a great musician apparently!   Everyone generalises    First Aid   Or you could just be satisfied with your penis in the first place?

I finished uni in June, and I'm about to go to bed on Christmas Eve in 25* heat. No excuses!   Rangitoto *Volcano* if we are being precise!   Remember what the dormouse said...   or yahoo news   link to original picture please   The infancy of humanity. The inability to explain natural phenomena and disease. The very apparent and totalitarian presence of death, for 99% of humanities existence it was uncommon to live past 30. Consider just how much the world has changed in the past 200 years, and bare in mind humans have existed for anywhere between 100-250 million years. We are at this time in history *just* learning to open our eyes, only now after so much time are these issues, that dominated the life of every human being for millions of years, are being addressed. How is it possible to unquestionably see that this *is* the nature of religion? Simple, just look at the prolific nature of religion. There are or have been as many completely different and varied religious groups are there are grains of sand on a beach, all of them designed to offer the same explanations for the various blights of humanity.  Humans for many years *needed* religion to explain the hostile nature of the world. Now we need Doctors.   Brilliant one. If you think about it long enough it starts to make sense, for example it makes sense for a primitive creature to react to pain, it is something else for an animal to *avoid* pain. Deep waters indeed.   One day literally everyone alive today will be dead. The sun will rise and it will be completely normal day, but *everyone* that is alive now will no longer exist, and for many of us it will simply be like we never existed.   Dude.....wow....   When I reached the peak of a Himalayan mountain. It wasn't a big one, it wasn't even snowcapped, but I climbed that bastard on my own, in Converse and after an 18 day trek with a 22KG backpack on in very low oxygen. From the top I had a view of a valley with two incredible mountain ranges on either side (one of which happened to be Lhotse and Everest) all to myself. That ladies and gentlemen, is euphoria.   [Relevant link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15a6mg/so_today_is_my_birthday_just_wanted_to_share_some/)      Anyone else find it truly disturbing they are treating this like a game, and trivialising the soldiers who are genuinely getting killed?

The fact that I don't know if you are being serious of not says a great deal about the nature of performance art.   I doubt you live in New Zealand   You OP.    OP is certainly   This is what is know as a 'backronym', all expressions (such as '*save our souls*' etc.) being invented to fit the pre-existing acronym.  The same can be said of the original distress call 'CQD', which is a combination of the original distress call of 'CQ' ('*scu*' from the French word *scurit*), then the D was added latter to stand for '*Distress*'. A common myth is that CQD stands for '*Come Quick: Danger*'.  SOS replaced CQD as the official morse distress signal in the early part of the 20^th Century and played a role in the sinking of Titanic, as there is a story that as Titanic sank the radio operators were signalling SOS rather than CQD, and no one understood that SOS was a distress call. This is probably a myth, but still interesting.   By coincidence, it was watching that episode that lead me to researching the subject where I came across this photo!   Princip provided the spark. It is probable, perhaps certain that war would have broken out eventually, however this event sent into motion a chain of events that caused the most catastrophic consequences in human history. The entire world was rocked by two World Wars and the modern world shaped by the outcome. And it all started with two gunshots, and one man.   Apologies, the title is not quite accurate as a different type of bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. The Trinity test and Nagasaki bomb were implosion devices while the Hiroshima bomb was a gun-type atomic bomb. Regardless, this pictures shows the first ever detonation of a nuclear weapon. The black specs along the horizon are trees. To imagine it puts a chill through the bones.   Regardless, this was still the first nuclear detonation of any atomic weapon. I don't think its possible to edit Hiroshima out of the title is it?      Bourbon. I am a musician and recently recorded a new EP (I'm not famous before anyone asks, pretty much do it for myself and my work) and got through a Litre of Jack by the end of the recording process.

From the top I had a view of a valley with two incredible mountain ranges on either side (one of which happened to be Lhotse and Everest) all to myself. That ladies and gentlemen, is euphoria.   No, that was the first attempted assassin, Nedeljko abrinovi, not Princip. After abrinovi's failed attempt Ferdinand (after stopping at Sarajavo Town Hall) took a different route to the cities hospital (where he was initially going) but the driver took a wrong turn and braked so as to reverse the car. By coincidence, this was only a few feet away from Princip (who was one of 10 assassins involved in the plot to kill Ferdinand), who took his chance and fired twice into the car, killing both Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophia (although she was not intended as a target). He was instantly arrested, which is when this photo was taken. He died in Jail three years later due to complications after his arm was amputated due to tuberculosis, probably caused by a poorly fixed broken bone in his arm from when he was arrested in Sarajevo.    I am not entirely sure who the photographer was, it is pretty self explanatory though. It was taken moments after the assassination, Princip is the man without a hat on the right, he attempted to shoot himself immediately after shooting Ferdinand but the gun was wrestled from him. [Here is a wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria)   Google 'The Bilderberg Group'. You may find it interesting.   Communism is a tough one to say whether it works or not, hence why there is still so much discourse on the subject even today. The trouble seems to be that all modern countries that identify themselves as communist are simply Fascist states, for example North Korea and China, though they declare themselves communist in principal (I am generalising of course and including Marxist-Lenninist politics) they can not be identified as anything but fascist. Most people seem to agree that the problem with communism is it grants too much power to too few people, as in North Korea, China and Stalinist Russia. Not to say Communism, or something close to it, can't work. Cuba is doing just fine!      The day will come when everyone who posts in this thread and who reads this comment will be dead, it is inevitable. Furthermore, the day will come, a long time from now but eventually the sun will rise on this world and everyone, yes everyone, alive now will be dead. But the world will keep spinning, the species will keep going, and it will be like we never existed at all.   Eurocentric bastards!  Sincerely, Australia + New Zealand.

Yeah I just travelled with one backpack, the trick is to travel as light as possible, which gives you a lot more freedom to move around! I also took a guitar, but that's just because I cant go without! You don't need to travel with a laptop, its very easy almost everywhere to get online and to access computers, and a laptop is just one more thing to get broken or stolen. As far as what equipment, I'm not really sure what you mean? I didn't use any specialist equipment really, it's important to take a good and well supplied medical kit and my trusty iPod, but thats about it!  Cheap is a relative term, cheap compared to what I (being english) am used to may be reasonably priced in some places. I did get in a few scrapes but nothing *TOO* hairy, the trick is to be very smart and self-aware. You learn this quick enough, especially travelling alone. The trick is to not look like you are a person of any interest, there is a real art to being able to blend into a crowd and not catch anyones eye. If you look uncomfortable, scared or overconfident or in any way affluent you will be a target for trouble! If you look like you are in control and not-to-be-fucked-with, you will have no troubles!   Don't worry, I'm sure this isn't going to be standing over your bed.   I travelled solo around the world. I fell of a motorbike in Nepal, got a concussion from falling of a skateboard in New Zealand, trekked the Himalayas alone and got AMS (very deadly if not addressed) and had to turn back but almost broke my ankle, which would have been guaranteed death. I swam with sharks (without meaning to) and once nearly got bitten by a cobra in Vietnam. Oh, and there was also the time my bus was nearly attacked by men with AK-47s in Laos.  This is all true by the way and I have photos of most of this to prove it!   You know that thing you're dreading? That.

Reverse that order and you're golden!   More are coming. Flee at once.   I know.   ...and that kids is why you shouldn't take advice from celibate weirdos!   This might seem like a strange one, but countries would certainly not exist if the everyone thought like me. After all, what is a country but another reason to form prejudice, wether positive or negative, over a perfect stranger. Try to image in it: No war, no dispute in the middle east, no conflicting militaries, no unrepresentative governments, no taxes, no restrictions upon travellers, no ruling class, no dictatorships, no reason to hate a person you have never met (other than religious grounds, but lets leave /r/atheism where it is). This is not to say that local cultures, languages, traditions and customs should be abandonded or assimilated, they should not. This is more akin to allowing people to be governers of their own destiny, and to not be collateral in political affairs. This, in my most humble opinion, is where Marx went wrong.

Fair enough, I wasn't sure where that money came from, although it is certain that is was money given for earthquake relief, that was spent on illegal whaling. Specifically it was mostly spent I believe to repair the Nisshin Maru, the main whaling factory ship.   I was talking to the first mate when I visited the ship yesterday and apparently they suspect the Japanese of using satellites to track the Sea Shepherd ships, which again is hugely expensive obviously.   For those who don't know, this is the Bob Barker, one of [Sea Shephard](http://www.seashepherd.org/)'s four vessels. It is in port in Wellington before heading to the Antarctic to prevent the Japanese ([who spent $30 million of aid given to them after the earthquake to fund illegal whaling](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/14597y/til_japan_used_30_million_of_their_tsunami_relief/)) from illegally hunting and killing whales.

Every trip has a different price, it depends what you do!   I have never done the Appalachian Train and don't know much about it so can't really give you a great deal of advice I'm afraid. I will say though that in my humble opinion real explorer spirit dwells in having the balls to leave your own comfort zone. From an outsiders perspective (I am not American, I was raised in England and have just emigrated to New Zealand) it seems that most Americans don't seem to have any interest in international travel, which is a huge shame if you don't mind me saying! If you are serious about wanting to experience some real adventure, blaze your own trail instead of sticking to the same old path that all the squares have strolled along before you, be your own explorer! You can do this on any budget, if you have a bit of spare cash though I recommend you take a trip to perhaps either South America or the Indian sub-continent, there is a lot of adventure to be had there, and you can feel free to ask me for any advice!

Any tips on how to start a blog would be appreciated! :)   I have been, the water isn't very clear but very deep in places. It is likely that there is a a large body of submerged rock under there though as it is a flooded landscape so all the cliffs slope inwards under the water (you can see the erosion where the cliff used to slope into the water)   ITT: Virgins thinking OP is glorious bastard, young men thinking OP must be an ugly bastard, girls thinking OP is a scummy bastard, married men thinking OP is a lucky bastard and [me making witticisms](http://imgur.com/2pTKo)   Sure! When can you leave?    No I don't want to give the impression the women can't travel in India alone, I know many who do! Its just that you have to be prepared for what to expect, if you are already seasoned traveller you will know what I mean. India has a lot to offer, but has a lot you need to be wary of, but definitely worth seeing, regardless who you are!   I didn't plan much before I left on purpose, to give me more freedom when I was there, just where my flights would go and how long on each continent.   Most essential items, hmm, good question!   Most essential would be the passport, obviously! I kept it on me at all times, 24/7.  Second most would be my iPod, there's a lot of boredom and sitting on buses involved in travel, I would have gone crazy several times over without my trusty ipod!   Third, my medical kit. It took up the most room by far in my backpack and I used everything in there!  Fourth, my camera! When you are seeing that much awesome every day you need a decent camera, I actually only bought one after I had already been travelling for a few months, but still got some awesome pictures!  Fifth. hmm, I didn't have that much stuff! I would say my diary. Keeping a diary is a surprisingly rewarding thing to do while travelling, and my travel book is now my most treasured possession!   How's fifth grade going?   Haha, cheers! You are my hero to! All told it cost around 6-7000 GBP, that's not bad going for such a big trip, but it can be done a lot cheaper, all depends what you do!   I spent about 6-7000 GBP all told, which isn't bad going for such a long trip! I planned and booked my flights in advance, but thats it. I booked a place to stay in USA and when I arrived in a new western city like Auckland or Brisbane, but other than that I just showed up in a new town or city and sorted out food or accommodation when I was there! Its often the best and cheapest way of doing it, although not for everyone as there is always the chance you might not get somewhere.  Ways to save money: The big ones are eating and sleeping cheap, the other best way to save your pennies is use local transport, as appose to tourist transport. You will find that in many places like Asia or India there are plenty of cosy, pricey travel options like flights and nice buses that are for tourists. However there is always local transport for local people, its usually pretty basic and more often than not cramped and uncomfortable, but its cheap and you meet interesting people! The only other way of saving money is to not spend it on silly things like souvenirs and day trips and so on.   	125
 Or if you just don't loathe her. Seriously, the Iris whining is worse here than on the show!   Stupidity? Joe's a control freak? Needless plot drama?   You definitely have them mixed. Her knowledge was never an issue, Joe's investigation was.    I think it's even worse for female characters.  Noticed that, have you?   And that cost would be 100% the same if Iris was hurt due to her ignorance - or with no regard to whether she knew or not.  Let's look at the people who know his secret identity. We've got one, two, three, *four* supervillains. Do you really think any of them would hold off on Iris because "after all, she has no clue"? She's *already* been threatened by two supervillains and had somebody she worked with killed, and this despite her ignorance.  Barry woke up and told two virtual strangers (Caitlin and Cisco may have known him for several months, but as he was in a coma he certainly didn't know them) before telling his best friend/foster sister/love interest. That is *cold*.   Why does Eddie believe Eobard, though? I mean, by his shocked look he does, but not only can any doofus mock up a fake newspage but clearly, if Eddie is Eobard's ancestor, he gets *a* girl. And Eobard is a murderer. Who knows how he blows off steam? Maybe casual emotional cruelty is to him what checkers is to normal people.   This is a guy who poked brains at a decaying zombie while crouching above her. I watched that and *cringed*. Surely a sensible person would have laid on their stomach and scooted?   Geez, is this supposed to make sense? And they say soap operas have convoluted plots!    Like she said she could help if she had known, but trying to help the Flash is the easiest way to get kidnapped or killed.  Then she could have *known that* and known *not* to get involved.   I mean if I was a superhero I definitely wouldn't tell people about my identity because knowing automatically puts them in danger.  It does not. Supervillains knowing puts your loved ones in danger. Your loved ones knowing does nothing of  the sort. That's a silly conceit that needs to die.    If Iris had laughed it off, they'd be pissed. If Iris had kept it to herself and said "I'm sure it's important to him, he had a good reason for not telling me", they'd be pissed. If Iris hadn't figured it out after that spark, they'd be pissed. If Iris had really known all the time... well, you get the picture.  Rightly or wrongly, this sub's hatred for Iris goes well beyond "she has bad writing" at this point.   Why?   Well, if it's any consolation, plenty of autistics are awful at math and computing, not big on gaming of any sort, and/or are extroverts. I have no data on how many autistics have lots and lots of friends in high school.   They certainly are more qualified to speak for "everyone else on the spectrum" than you are.  However, I would really like to see a statistic that "most" autistics are "low-functioning" (or however you're trying to phrase it). An actual citation, that is.   Yes, actually, it's quite common among autistics.  http://www.autism.com/symptoms_toe_walking  But it's not *universal* - and honestly, out of his scare list, it's definitely the least harmful. Might shorten the tendons, I suppose.   The previous system wasn't really working. You'd hear of kids "moving" from one diagnosis to another - well, under the diagnostic criteria, that should not have happened. I'm not saying this system is better, time will answer that, but the DSM-IV system was seriously flawed.   If you fit the diagnostic criteria for autism, then you ARE autistic. If you have received an autism diagnosis, but don't fit it, then probably this is because you need the services anyway but whatever your real diagnosis is *won't get you the help you need* and an autism diagnosis will. People do not get their children diagnosed - much less themselves diagnosed - for funzies.   The rise in cancer has nothing to do with "our bodies trying to adapt to how the world has changed" and everything to do with greater longitivity and better screening. If you don't die of cholera, war, childbirth, polio, SIDS, or the plague, then you'll probably live long enough to die of cancer. And if the doctors are good enough to prevent all those other deaths, they'll probably see that you have cancer sometime before you die of it.   Many older autistics were never diagnosed. Others may have been diagnosed (either as children or adults) but simply don't disclose that information to everybody. Still others who need more support did receive a diagnosis and were institutionalized, meaning the odds of people outside their family meeting them are slim.  At least one study has shown that when you take adults and use current screening methods, you find the same rate of autism as you do in children.  For the record, my grandfather was autistic. My mother has a second cousin who was almost certainly autistic. I strongly suspect both parents, both grandmothers, and my maternal uncle are part of the "broader autistic phenotype". I have several friends who are older than 30 who are autistic - and I only met about *half* of them on autistic-specific fora. But if you don't know what you're looking for, and you also don't ask, then you'll never know.   It'd be very strange for a child to be diagnosed as autistic for pointing given that it is *lack of pointing* that is typically associated with autism.  These are the actual diagnostic criteria for autism, as distinct from the ones you made up in your head: http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html  Note that examples are "illustrative, not exhaustive" and that it is not necessary for a person to hit every single note to obtain a diagnosis, and it is possible to obtain a diagnosis even if it is "by history", that is, not something they currently do.   Just because a person may appear to be "less autistic" than another person, that doesn't mean they don't "really need help".   Sorta. Asperger's only became a diagnosis with the DSM-IV. Prior to that, it wasn't listed as a disorder and many people who would now be diagnosed as autistic didn't receive any diagnosis at all.   Twenty years ago, inclusion was not as popular as it is today, and disabled children were more likely to be segregated.   Recent studies have shown that genes for intelligence are linked to genes for autism: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150310105232.htm  And when you give IQ tests that aren't biased towards verbal skills, autistics do as well as NTs: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hidden-potential-of-autistic-kids/ (I had a better link at once point, but that was two computers ago)  So your therapist suggesting this has nothing to do with your intelligence, real or perceived.   Additionally, many autistics have had healthy relationships and professional success. Of course, you can show every possible trait for autism, and if it's not negatively affecting your ability to work, go to school, or generally live your life you won't qualify for a diagnosis. Still, I assume that you had *some* problem that led you to a therapist. It wasn't unreasonable for him to try to figure out what it was.   Not all autistics engage in scripted speech or echolalia. Not all autistics are "obsessed with routine". Not all autistics toe walk. Not all autistics self-injure. (Actually, only 10 - 15% of autistics self-injure.)   Well, no argument here on the "educational environment" front, but I disagree that giving a clear label of "autistic" is "segregating an entire portion of humanity". I think it's no different from people being labelled as gay or left-handed. (But then, I'm a big fan of the social model of disability.)   We've known for a long time that autistics usually have family members with autistic traits, frequently people who merit a diagnosis themselves. And we also know that if you take the adult population and use current diagnostic criteria, you get the same percentage of autistics as you do in the youth population. I think it is unlikely that prenatal vitamins have anything to do with it.   You're talking out your ass. My grandfather was autistic. He absolutely fit "today's criteria". If you're going to use the 1:68 statistic, then you have to include the *entire* spectrum - not just those who are most obviously autistic. Most children getting diagnosed today would not have qualified for a diagnosis under the DSM-III.   Most young autistics don't bang their heads against walls. Not chronically, anyway.   Wait. You think it's the *having a diagnosis* that keeps autistics from being employed? It's not the autism, it's the diagnosis?    If I were growing up today, I'd have had the ASD label slapped on me as soon as I entered public school. Instead, I grew up 30 years ago, when my "uniqueness" was not just tolerated, but appreciated and nurtured by my teachers and parents. Did I have problems? Yes. Did I grow up into a successful, happy adult? Also yes.  You're lucky. I mean, you're *really* lucky. There are many more people who grew up the same time as you, and *because* they had no official label they did not have their uniqueness tolerated at all, much less nurtured. They got labels, all right - "stupid" and "bad" and "lazy" and "weird". Autism is a better label any day of the week.   You are way off base. Autism has a number of components. Trouble with social skills is only a small one (and, anecdotally, many autistics have no trouble at all socializing *with other autistics*, only with NTs). Even if you could induce the social symptoms, you can't induce most of the comorbidities - sensory processing disorder, dyspraxia, auditory processing disorder, faceblindness.... I'm just listing things off the top of my head, of course.   Yes, and also the average age of the paternal grandfather - that is, men who are older when they father children are more likely to have autistic grandchildren. To my knowledge, the jury's still out on whether this is something changing about the sperm or simply because people with autistic traits tend to be older than their NT peers when they start their families. But I haven't obsessively followed this stuff in a few years.   You're quite mistaken. The CHAT (checklist for autism in toddlers) has as a starred entry *not* pointing. Indeed, not pointing at things is one of the two classic hallmarks of autism, along with lack of eye contact.  http://www.autism.org.uk/working-with/health/screening-and-diagnosis/checklist-for-autism-in-toddlers-chat.aspx   Yes, there was. I don't have the original source to hand, but I do have a report in the popular press: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/autism-epidemic-challenged-uk-study/story?id=13518453   Pretty much. The diagnostic standards have dramatically changed in two ways.  First, they've changed to encompass the idea of an autism "spectrum". Many of the kids getting diagnosed today (and the adults as well!) would not/did not get a diagnosis 30 years ago simply because they could speak. They got a diagnosis of ADD or they got no diagnosis at all.  Secondly, even for those "low functioning" autistics, it is much easier to get a diagnosis. It used to be the case that the default diagnosis was *childhood schizophrenia*, that if you didn't hit enough criteria, that's the label you got. And if you're about to say that the two are nothing alike - you're right! But that's how it shook out. Other autistics were misdiagnosed as mentally retarded, which is kinda a catchall.  Additionally, reporting was half-assed back in the day. When the diagnoses started going up, mandatory reporting was improved. Then people realized how much more common it was than they had thought, and that made them look for it harder. It's a little feedback loop at this point in the story.   Do you know what her IEP entailed? They generally don't consist of "dumbing things down". For example, many people have IEPs that allow them unlimited time on tests. Evidence shows that for people who do not need those IEPs, unlimited time offers them no advantage. That's not "dumbing down", that's leveling the playing field. Some people have difficulty concentrating in crowded lecture halls and need smaller classes. Well, that might make working in an ER impossible, but there's no reason they couldn't be a pediatric nurse at a small practice or something.   You are incorrect. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of autism in adults is the same as in children, once you bring adults in to be diagnosed.  I once made a long comment about this, and lucky for me I saved it to my computer because now I can't find the original. Just gonna c+p it here for you:  Okay, now people have been screaming about the rising diagnosis rates for autism since the mid-90s. They say that increased awareness cannot possibly account for all the increase. I submit that it certainly can and probably does for several reasons.  First, starting with the publication of the DSM-IV in the early 90s the diagnostic criteria for autism changed significantly. It became much easier to obtain. Previously, if you did not perfectly match the criteria you got a diagnosis of the catch-all "mental retardation" or even of "childhood schizophrenia" - and if you're about to say that autism is nothing like schizophrenia, don't bother, I know. But that's how the diagnosis was back then. Since it was easier to get a diagnosis of autism, naturally, diagnoses went up. (And every time I say "diagnoses went up", remember that this means awareness went up as well.)  Secondly, at that same time, "asperger's" as entered into the DSM, and the whole concept of an autistic spectrum emerged. Plenty of children who would have received no diagnosis at all prior to this, or who would've been diagnosed as ADD or as OCD were now obtaining diagnoses such as Asperger's, HFA, or PDD-NOS. (This actually happened to me. My parents dragged me around to doctors for years trying to get me diagnosed (my mother had apparently worked with autistic students for a while, and they'd read some books by Temple Grandin), but back in the day you basically couldn't get diagnosed as autistic if you could speak, especially if you were bright and/or female. When I got diagnosed as an adult I was told it was really pretty obvious. Trust me, I don't act more autistic now than I did as a kid!) Of course, the thing to take away from this is that diagnoses went up.  Thirdly, prior to the 90s, reporting of autism was sporadic at best. Many states made no reports of cases of autism, or only half-hearted ones. But as awareness continued to rise, more and more states started making better and better reports, allowing us to get a better grasp of new cases being diagnosed. And this, of course, in and of itself led to increased awareness.  Increased awareness is, of course, the fourth piece of the puzzle, the one all the others lead to. Doctors, as we know, are told "when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras". Sound advice in most situations - if it looks like a cold, it probably IS a cold. But the problem comes when what you think is a zebra is really a horse.  Prior to the DSM-IV, doctors were told that the autism risk was something like 1 in 10,000. And parents didn't really hear about it at all, or if they did they thought of "Rain Man", and if their kid didn't match that profile perfectly (given that Kim Peek, the inspiration for the character, wasn't autistic they shouldn't expect that), assumed that the term "autistic" didn't apply to their child and didn't ask doctors to look into it. (I am certain that if I had been given the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers as a toddler I would have been diagnosed much sooner. I would have failed it at 18 months. Heck, I would have failed it at 8 years, and that's not an exaggeration. Now it's standard, but it wasn't when I was a child.) Because the doctors parents went to assumed it was rare, they didn't look for it, and so they failed to diagnose it. But as awareness continued to rise, doctors were more and more likely to look for autism, and thus more and more likely to diagnose it. And when the alarmist bells started to ring about how autism is "increasing", doctors and parents BOTH started to look for it a LOT more.  Now, of course, this all doesn't show that incidence is the same as it has always been, simply that incidence could be the same as it has always been. Anecdotally, though, I will say that it is a very common story among adult autistics to be diagnosed only after a child in the family is diagnosed. Sometime during the process they start to realize that everything that applies to this kid also applies to them, and then they get diagnosed. Not so anecdotally, at least one study has shown that the rate in adults is really no different from the rate in children: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/autism-epidemic-challenged-uk-study/story?id=13518453 (I've seen other sources, but it's been a while since I avidly kept up on autism news).  Another note: Many people on my family match the broader autistic phenotype. My maternal grandfather was most definitely autistic. Last time I said this, the person I was speaking to literally replied that this was impossible because autism didn't even exist until Kanner started studying it in the 1940s. I suppose that is the logical conclusion of "rates and incidence are always the same", but I laughed right in her face. Kanner himself noted that the parents of the children he worked with showed autistic traits. (It is this observation that led to the monstrous "refrigerator mother" hypothesis  which has now been thoroughly debunked, but the observation itself was quite correct.) You can see, though, if you haven't thought of it, that we really only have accurate information about autism going back a few generations at best. It's only recently, for example, that we've found that men who are older when they father their first child are more likely to have an autistic child (that applies to my father!) or grandchild (and that one applies to my mother's father). The jury is most definitely out on why this should be so, though - is it because something happens to the sperm as men age? Or is it because men and women who show autistic traits are slower to enter into relationships and take longer to start having sex? That is also most definitely possible - just as it is possible that people who show autistic traits prefer to be in relationships with other people who show autistic traits, a form of assortive mating, and one that is evidently true within my own family, though I cannot speak for how common that really is.   Incorrect... or, at least, only partially correct. Prior to the DSM-IV, people with Asperger's couldn't get diagnosed, and thus weren't included in the statistics... which, back then, were fairly patchy.  It's fairly common for adult autistics to only get a diagnosis now after a child in the family is diagnosed. Heck, my parents *knew* I was on the spectrum, and they tried to get a diagnosis back then, but it just didn't happen. I was a girl, I could talk quite well (well, if you don't consider that an inability to switch out of a formal register and a marked difficulty with figurative speech are problematic) and so little things like the fact that I didn't make eye contact or point to things at the age of eight were overlooked.   Note: Autism isn't a mental illness, it is a developmental disorder.   Not gooood, grooood.   She didn't make things worse this time.    There's a big difference between "keeping secrets" and "lying". Every time he spoke to her as The Flash, he was implicitly lying to her. (And I've said it before, but here I'll say it again, when somebody says they don't want a romantic relationship with you, you need to back off, and so does your costumed alter ego.)  Additionally, Barry had a moral obligation to inform her when her ignorance was putting her in peril. Which it *was*, precisely *because* her life had been threatened. With that information, maybe she could've gone on an extended vacation abroad, away from the RF's reach.   Yes, Kira rocks. But she wasn't a captain, and she only wore a Starfleet uniform for a few episodes. Where you gonna get a Bajoran uniform?    Yeah, that's a clever dodge, except that Trek didn't operate that way until the Abrams films, so the writers of that episode did wipe out the timeline in favor of that new one.   Oh, didn't it? I present [Exhibit A: Parallels.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29) As seen in that episode, diverging histories lead to divergent universes. The multiverse is, and has been canon, and not just the mirror universe. As further proof, we have [Deadlock](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Deadlock_%28episode%29) - two Voyagers enter, one Voyager leaves. (And nobody ever brings it up again, which is odd, but par for the course.)  To our knowledge, none of these alternate worlds were caused by time travel. However, our knowledge is patchy at best. We don't know the exact circumstances that created *any* of those branches in the multiverse. Therefore, it could have worked that way from the beginning. You certainly cannot assert confidently that it did *not*.  As proof that Janeway did care, the people who were in on her plan had made plans for the future. They expected to keep on living even if she succeeded in her one-woman mission. Barclay did not run off to Risa, he continued teaching. The Doctor didn't immediately run and tattle to Starfleet Command, he only told Harry. Kim did not laugh madly as he decided to help her, he pointed out he would get "demoted to ensign" once caught.    If it'd been photoshopped on, don't you think she wouldn't've worn the purple turtleneck under it?   That wouldn't help you very much with learning a new dialect or language. To eliminate or alter an accent you'd want to deal with a vocal coach.   You don't have to personally kill the rats, just  go down to a pet store and get feeder rats for snakes. Or heck, put out a few snap traps in the alley and call it a public service   1. Ravi becoming a zombie. Has potential. I kinda ship Ravi/Liv anyway.  2. Maybe it's because Iris finally found out on The Flash about, well, The Flash, but I'm big on bringing people into the loop. Specifically, Major. Major needs to be brought in on this whole zombie thing. (And eventually Clive does as well.)  3. I knew zombie!Arthur had a 50/50 shot of being bad news.  4. What the hell did Blaine mean "she has her part to play" or whatever exactly he said?   The 25th century. He came back in time to kill The Flash, because he's crazy and going back in time to kill people is, according to the wiki, pretty much how he solves all his problems.   It's enough to give anybody trust issues.   I'm thinking most men would've been more upset as well if their best friend did this to them.   ...a wizard did it?   Except for the whole keeping Iris in the dark thing. Well, at least that's finally over.   He kinda *does* have to go help everyone at every time. He's a superhero, that's the job description. He certainly has to help his substitute father figure.   Or at least, I don't know, *use* them.   He hasn't eaten in *centuries*.   Well, after living in a sewer we should just assume he IS dirty.   You know what would've happened if they'd done that? She would have said the exact same thing I'm about to say: Her life wasn't threatened "if she knows Barry is The Flash", her life was threatened "if you (Joe) keep digging into this". And Joe kept digging into it and didn't tell her anything!  If he really wanted to keep her safe, he should have told her *everything*. Knowledge is most definitely power when there are people who have threatened your life.            Wells talked him through that vibrating through solid objects trick--it's something Barry should be able to do, but not something he can do at the drop of a hat right now.  He ought to be practicing new tricks at home or something.   Maybe Grodd came to his own conclusions about that one.   So maybe if he already threatened her life, *as she pointed out*, she would have been safer if she'd been kept in the loop!    the fact that she wiped out an entire timeline at the end of the series in order to satisfy her own selfish wants and desires is in itself reason to detest her and not want to emulate or champion anything about her.  So did Jake Sisko, but he doesn't get this level of hate. Neither does Harry Kim, for that matter. (And if we believe that the new Star Trek movies exist simultaneously with TOS - which is what the writers insist is the case - then surely Janeway did the same thing. She didn't "wipe out" a timeline, she just created an additional one that runs alongside the first.)   No. No, it wasn't you. It was /r/botsrights.   He didn't tell Eddie that!  Also: Iris is a grown woman. She does not need her dad to be her marriage and dating gatekeeper. She does not need him to be her matchmaker.     Shining voyager far from home....  That's a great episode where nobody at all angsts even a tiny little bit about breaking the prime directive, even though you'd think they'd at least give it some lip service. The plot is better for it.   Only by breaking the temporal prime directive!   Not lost like "destroyed", lost like "misplaced". I think ending up in the Delta Quadrant is pretty darn lost!  (At any rate, given that she did end up admiral, I was mostly engaging in snark rather than seriously suggesting that she should've been demoted.)   Well, then? You tell us who is supposed to be punishing them and I'll send whoever it is a strongly worded letter to that effect.   She lost her ship! She could hardly expect to be promoted to admiral upon her return, could she?   Sometimes smart people can be incredibly stupid. The blog isn't unethical, it's just risky.   In real life NYC, the rising costs of housing is a VERY real issue. Anybody making moves to kick low-income renters out of their apartments, even without the violence, really *is* a villain to the public.   Not as main characters and you know it.   Yes, but which half?   Who knows what that did to its digestive system?   Yeah, but what a stupid messiah. All she does is show up when it's time to land on a planet? Seriously? Who the heck has a religion like that?   That's dedication for you.   Living well is the best revenge. Have yourself a marathon!    Maybe he gave it up like the time Riker was Q and decided he didn't want to stay Q.   Because she can be the captain and drink coffee. Duh.   Well, I walked right into that one.         God, who *doesn't* love the Satanists?   If I could fall into the sky Do you think time would pass us by?  NO SENSE.  And I never understood any of Kissed By A Rose. None of it.    I must say, only eating orange food is a new one by me :) With toddlers, so often they'll only eat white foods (rice, pasta, cheese sticks, plain chicken breast) or only eat brown foods (chicken nuggets, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies). Orange at least gives you room for healthy foods, even if many of them will turn her orange! (But it's harmless, seriously.)  I would suggest that if she is eating fewer than 15 foods and this has been going on for longer than three months, or if this is severely impacting her health and/or ability to function, or if you have reason to suspect that this might be a component of a broader disorder such as autism, reflux, or sensory processing disorder, that you speak to your pediatrician about getting a referral to a speech-language pathologist (yes, even if she has no speech issues) or an occupational therapist to help with the "pickiness".   That's not intended to scare you. I suggest it every time, because so often parents don't know where the line is between "normal pickiness" and "not normal pickiness" is.  If you're confident she's in the normal range, then what you want to do is start with baby steps. This might mean having her get through dinner without screaming that you put some green beans on her plate and don't you KNOW she HATES those. Or, if she is willing to sit with those things on her plate, it might mean getting her to sniff the green bean and maybe put it in her mouth before quietly spitting it out. Baaaaaby steps.   What sort of foods does she eat right now? I'm thinking squashes, sweet potato, carrots, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, oranges, tangerines? Anything else?   My own mother went (so she says) three years on pasta, salami, mushrooms, and apples. Her parents figured they were doing a good job getting her to eat and didn't stress it. "Disciplining" children for food issues is counterproductive - it just turns the dinner table into a battleground and entrenches their rule to "never eat that yucky stuff".  Oh, and in my mother's case? She hadn't "decided to be picky". She had undiagnosed asthma and only ate foods that she knew from experience she could eat without having to chew too long, because if she had her mouth shut she *couldn't breathe*. There are many reasons for a child to go through periods of refusing certain foods. Many aspies, for example, go through bouts of only eating foods of a certain color, and it's terribly common for children of all stripes to be unable to eat certain textures of food. Rarely is it them "deciding" to be "picky".   Best place to start is this: what sort of food do you like to eat? No matter how healthy it is, no matter how much of a budget it is, it won't do any good if you don't like to eat it. We start with the foods you already enjoy, then we branch out.  So... what do you like to eat? Maybe we can figure out some ways to make 'em cheaper and healthier.   Yes, they do need to talk about it on the show. (Also about Cisco's ridiculous little crush. I think that entire blog is freaking adorable as heck.)   Why is there a /r/botsrights sub?   Except you need to put up quite a bit of money up front. When you're living hand to mouth, you don't have that - especially when you have no idea how long food takes to go bad, or whether you can pay the electric bill this month, or if you're gonna screw it up and end up with inedible hockey pucks.  You're not doing a good job of putting yourself in other peoples' shoes.   I meant that you don't prefer. Is there any part of the US that only gets the native species of wrens and blue birds? (Serious question, because I surely have no clue.)   edit: starlings also aren't native, but I leave them alone.  That makes you unusual. I've tolerated starlings (not a birder, but I know the general opinion of them) ever since I saw one rescue a mourning dove by flying right in the face of a cat, but....   Are you allowed to pull out the nest and eggs of "anything else nesting" if it happens to be a dispreferred native species?                                 My mother (who has a mean sense of humor) hid her key under a *neighbor's* door mat. Well, until we found out and made her stop.  She also spoke about getting a collection of those fake rocks and putting useless keys in 'em. One of these years somebody's gonna break one of her windows.   Well, if it's official canon I take back much of what I've said about those prisoners not having any TV. They get movie nights. And it is adorable. (Still, it's illegal detention and more or less solitary confinement and dubiously ethical as hell.)      His procedure took two months, and has a high failure rate, as seen by those episodes where Jack et al. show up. (It's stated, iirc, that the success rate might be better if they could get this done legally... but "better" doesn't necessarily mean "without high risk". We don't know what the failure rate really is.) We have no idea how long it would take in utero, nor if the success rate would be any better. We cannot assume that because *this* condition can be easily treated in utero - more easily than after birth - that *another* condition is the same way.         Yeah, but Paris considered his Starfleet father to be emotionally abusive. Weren't they estranged at the start of that show?   But if you're not going to eat those things before they go bad (or get too freezerburned), you've wasted that money.    Ground beef where I am is $6/lb, easy. I could buy the huge family packages and get the price down to $4.50/lb, but I have no place to store that much ground beef. My freezer isn't that big.  Tomatoes surely aren't $1/lb either unless I get the hard ones that taste like nothing and are a waste of money. Actually, I'm pretty sure those are $1.30/lb anyway.  That cheese looks off too, but I don't know for sure. I'll check at the store.   You can rinse it and pre-soak it, that will cut down the cooking time.   You're speaking like somebody who knows how to cook :)   Oddly, there are many people in the US who don't have consistent access to a fridge or a stove. People in shelters, people who are living in motels, people who are renting a single room in some woman's house... these people are kinda stuck.   And don't forget, if your budget is that strapped, you don't want to have to throw food out. What if you screw up the rice? What if your kids decide they won't eat the beans? Hamburgers are safer, because they always taste good.   It's not very healthy if you need to eat low-carb, say, due to diabetes. And you're really underestimating the food ignorance out there - I cannot tell you how many times I've suggested to somebody that they start off with dried beans only to be told that they can't use an entire pound of the stuff at once and are afraid what's left will go bad.   We saw them fix the spinal defects. Are mental defects such as the one Bashir faced as easy to fix?   Mmm, "orphan" can mean a child who has lost one out of two parents. That's not the usual definition, but it has been used that way, usually in the context of "widows and orphaned children" where one presumes that we care about the orphaned children even if their widowed mother is still alive.   It's canon that everybody has enough food and medical care and a place to live and clothes and leisure time and an education. It is not canon that everybody gets everything they could ever want.  Let's suppose that only a tiny minority of doctors is capable of doing this sort of genetic engineering - perhaps one for every thousand babies. No amount of going "but we're post scarcity!" is going to make that number higher.   Why would we need to be able to do that?    Good thing the Federation is post-scarcity and thus everybody can "afford" it.  Post-scarcity doesn't mean "everybody gets what they want". It means "everybody gets what they need".    There is nothing inherently bad about becoming super-human. All it means is that we are objectively better than we were before.  "better" is not by any means an objective word.                                 Maybe it's really hard to do it right, and there's 99 failures - even with legitimate doctors instead of the back alley approach - for every "success".                     It's the oldest one we've found, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the first. There may have been others which have been lost.     I read that book at least once a year.         When were you in the 4th grade?         Yeah, sounds like a lot of victim blaming in your family. It's more likely than you think.    Space is big. Really big. Really, really big, and three-dimensional as well. So long as the Krenim aren't causing any substantial trouble, the Zahl probably don't think it's worth the effort to try to track them down.    And Tuvix, who gave a reasonably good deathbed speech. (Not that good, but, y'know, he was pressed for time.)   Okay, first of all, you're assuming that Julian is utterly truthful about how impaired he was before the procedure. That's the assumption I usually make as well - no exaggeration, he's not misremembering. However, in fairness, it is *possible* he is mistaken somehow.  So you've more or less asked two questions resting on that assumption.  The first is, why on earth didn't Julian merit genetic treatment under the law? And that is an *excellent* question, because that's pretty darn impaired. Exactly what sort of therapy or help *was* he entitled to? No answers on that front, and I wish there were. I agree with you wholeheartedly here. Julian Bashir should have had *real* help for his *real* problems. Had he been able to get that, this whole second question could have been avoided, because he probably would have ended up as average instead of as a super genius.  The second is about whether or not it's moral to punish the child for the sins of the parents. In this case, I have to disagree with your conclusion. If you only punish the parents, you run the risk that pushy parents are going to risk it anyway to give their children an edge. And if the pushy parents do it, then a great deal of non-pushy parents are going to feel they have to do it as well just so their kids can keep up! Remember, Julian's parents didn't ethically stay within the spirit of the law (if not the letter) by simply having his impairments corrected, no, they made him *special*. And that's what every other parent would end up doing if there was a loophole. You can't be honest if everybody else is cheating. The only way to ensure that people don't break the law is to make sure that if it's caught, it all comes for nothing and *everybody* involved, parents and children, gets punished - the parents by being imprisoned, the children by being locked out of the best jobs. It's unfair, but at least that method has a chance of working.  One note: We have no idea if his genetic changes are heritable. It's not unheard of for people to carry two genetic codes. There's a case of a [woman who was accused of welfare fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Fairchild) because genetic testing on her children showed they were somebody else's! It wasn't until they tested the third immediately after she gave birth that they realized her reproductive organs had a different set of chromosomes than the rest of her body. There's no reason that this might not have been done to Julian. (But was it? I have no clue.)   Thanks :)   Yes, but do you really think that schools are unsegregated today? Not in NYC they're not.   Oh, god, I had teachers like that. Fuck 'em.   All trains of thought eventually hit the racism station, have you noticed?   Until recently?   Because if we accept that dialect we're "dumbing down" English.  If you ask what the hell that even means, they go "It's common sense".  If you point out that they used the phrase "it's common sense" rather than explaining what the hell they mean, they whine that you're mean.     The assumption that there's anyone on reddit who's unaware of this controversy by this point.  They may as well ask if we've heard of Jesus Christ.   That, my friend, is why I exclusively say "from the gecko". I mean I don't, but I think it in my head.   Is your aunt, um, all right? I mean, I don't want to make fun of people who are *actually*, you know, not... right.                     Alternatively, you will see a world where police are even more obsessed with covering shit up, because they're scared of the collective punishment.   Punished by whom? The cops? Yeah, right. Buffy? She's got a blind spot a mile wide when it comes to people she cares about. The Watchers? To be honest, I'm not sure they *care* so long as they don't call too much attention to themselves. So who does that leave to do the punishing?   Her mom loved this other kid she made up in her head, her *son*. She was in huge denial over the real kid she had living with her. It's not so surprising she didn't want to accept the suicide, especially as suicide is also widely considered a major sin.                                          LOL, I'm not criticizing, though if you think it's better we can just delete everything and pretend it never happened. I'm just gonna assume that anybody interested in the subject *is* caught up.   Yeah... of course, if I hadn't, that reply would have given away everything. That's why I didn't bother with spoiler tags, because their very existence gives away everything :P   That title is too long, and spoils the ending.   Really? Do you have a link? I'm surprised Einstein has an opinion on this!    Oh god that's painful to read.   Yeah, if he's the only one doing the zombification.    Okay, but nobody else knows she's in the loop yet because that just happened, and since she had to figure it out on her own I don't think that counts.   I could never stand Kes. Seven at least doesn't give off this air of being mystically perfect.   Except for Iris. EVERYBODY IS IN THE LOOP BUT HER. (I don't care if you like the character or not, that's just not right.)   Liv has met two zombies. Each of them did the "how do you get your brains?" thing first time. Whats-his-face-Bad-Guy said he got his by grave robbing. Lowell says that a guy at the morgue will look the other way for cash. We know that Whats-his-face is lying.                  Honey, if somebody is "rejecting your kindness" that's because you're not actually being kind. You're being a nuisance, and they want you to stop.  And yes, kind people are nice to everybody.       The ! part means not... though not in IPA, where it means an alveolar click. (Wait, am I [reading this right?](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/IPA_chart_%28C%292005.pdf))   It's gonna be a cover *now*. Doubtful it was involved in the brain "farming" before.   Oh, I'm sure it's an excuse. I'm just saying that the fact that it's an excuse doesn't actually preclude them finding bodies on the property.  	200
 Not really scary as much as comforting.   Mike reminded me of Danny DeVito as Owen in "Throw Momma From the Train"    Effects like that happen in a queue. It's odd, but a great mechanic to learn to be pro. Pretty much first effect play, first effect resolved. When you played Shadow Madness first, it had to resolve  before Power Overwhelming. However, Power Overwhelming triggers at the end of the owner's turn, so when owner's switched the effect stayed.   	2

 But the government seems to make such a big deal about stopping child porn?! I'm confused.   The consequences have already started. Crazy snow, random storms or super-storms, irregular rain periods, droughts, wildfires etc. All those have an impact if not on your living conditions (Californians may disagree), at the very least on agriculture (therefore on your food).   Which is FINE, but everyone, including Microsoft, keeps pretending that this *future* will happen by the end of the year...when it's more likely to happen in the 2020's.  AR has always been about a decade behind VR in capabilities (like if you wanted the same graphics quality or field of view as a VR headset) - maybe more if it actually needs its own tiny hardware to do that.   I doubt we'll see a mass-market AR product in the next 10 years. HoloLens has a way too small field of view to be practical, and it will probably cost quite a bit, too (considering it needs its own specialized processors, etc, while VR headsets feed off another computer's resources).   Maybe the DD-WRT site got some malware? I'm sure it will be fixed in a few days.   Still no word on end to end encryption.   Should've used Signal's protocol (which is also end-to-end encrypted, something Facetime Audio does as well).   Or the NSA blackmails.   Not really. Still no end to end encryption by default.   If only Telegram had good end-to-end encryption by default. Otherwise I can't find the allure. It's another Whatsapp clone.   Didn't work for me. My battery was at 49% and it recommended 50%+. I wonder if it has a hard failsafe for that.   Cand? Chiar limitasera la 30Mbps *toate* conexiunile la scurt timp dupa ce au bagat Gigabit si dupa ce au "dublat" (asa zic ei, eu nu am observat) vitezele de dowload (50 la 100, 100 la 200, etc).   Let me guess, Microsoft is depriving the majority of users once again of Bitlocker encryption by not enabling it in Windows Home or Mobile.    ~~One~~ Seven Windows.   Sony's sensors are good. Look at what Apple or Samsung can do with them (some Galaxy S6 models have Sony sensors yet there are very small differences between them and Samsung's own sensors).  Sony's problem is camera firmware on mobile. It's often not quite as good, especially on lower-end devices.   Windows 10 will be the last version of Windows...until Windows 10.1 or Windows 10.0.0.1 (so we can pretend it's the same one).   Indeed FPTP is the least democratic voting system out there.   But hey let's all be excited about AT T's [fiber to the press release](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140307/04485626475/weve-entered-age-fiber-to-press-release.shtml) announcements!   The problem is you're describing ideal stuff - stuff that will likely never happen, like "humans committing no crime". Okay - define what's "crime"? Being gay? Having sex with a robot? Masturbating to "teen" cartoons? Carrying [too much cash](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/11/how-the-dea-took-a-young-mans-life-savings-without-ever-charging-him-of-a-crime/) with you on a trip?  Crimes are defined by the society, and often by abusive law enforcement agents who re-interpret the law to their liking. Crimes not something that are completely objective. Therefore you can't put that in algorithms.  As for a "completely secure machine that you can trust" - yeah, that's not going to happen either. Right now the whole cryptographic community agrees you [can't build perfectly secure systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk78_zmH4QI), in most cases not just because of the poor design of the crypto-systems (which also happens [quite a bit](http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2407891/dumb-crypto-in-smart-grids-smart-meter-encryption-standard-fundamentally-flawed-claim-researchers)) but because of the code written for them. Maybe we can revisit this topic in 50 or 100 years when we all talk through quantum networks, but my guess is not much will change by then either in terms of breaking systems.   In other words they are preparing for the mass surveillance showdown. Privacy is a human right and the ECHR is likely to rule against the legality of mass surveillance in the UK. The UK Courts have already largely sided with the spying apparatus.  Also the Tories are preparing to reintroduce the Snooper's Charter. Theresa May has already announced it.   It seems like they are stepping over themselves to find new ways to give the NSA their customers' data more easily.   Seriously, what if someone *brings child porn into the country*? Can you imagine that?   I would rather get something like anti-gravity boots (like the ones in Jupiter Ascending)   Their prices are only raised to cockbag levels.   In that case you should never - *ever* - have Netflix throttle on you. Is that the case?   Nor UK. You can be put in jail for not revealing your passwords if they ask you to.   Yes, it's exactly like that. Google backs up your conversations by default. If you haven't enabled "off the record" chat, you should be able to see that for yourself. All your conversations can go back well into the past. Google has access to all of those.  But now you might think "oh - so I just enable Off the Record chat and myself and Google can't see the past messages anymore!"  Wrong! You won't be able to see them, but Google still saves them....(Why the hell Google would do that? The hell do I know - but they do).   It works with all OTR/XMPP chat apps.   Maybe. Possibly. Who really knows. Whatsapp has never publicly stated they do that, never changed their privacy policy to adopt that, and there's no visible change in the UI that shows (or guarantees) you you're using end-to-end encryption.  http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Keeping-Tabs-on-WhatsApp-s-Encryption-2630361.html  In other words, you shouldn't trust that yet. Just use TextSecure (the integrated Signal version with Voice should come real soon.)  EDIT: By the way, I see some people are genuinely surprised that Hangouts is *not* end-to-end encrypted (you shouldn't be - you should've assumed that *by default*, otherwise you would've learned about it), but just to make things clearer for everyone **Skype also doesn't use end-to-end encryption**.  In fact Microsoft specifically killed its P2P capability to make Skype more wiretappable. Also Microsoft has either outright *lied* or avoided saying it has changed its architecture like this - so much that even one week before the Snowden revelations, the New York Times was recommending Skype as "secure for activists" (which became a laughable fact post-Snowden).  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_for_skype_pwnage/  http://www.computerworld.com/article/2509604/data-privacy/microsoft-seeks-patent-for-spy-tech-for-skype.html  http://www.extremetech.com/computing/132935-microsoft-tweaking-skype-to-facilitate-wiretapping  http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/07/nsa-taps-skype-chats-newly-published-snowden-leaks-confirm/   What about extorting African "colonies" for tributes to add to your GDP? Is that moral?   Just please add end-to-end encryption to Hangouts already. Strong protocols (TextSecure, OTR, ZRTP, etc) are already out there. You just need to implement them. If that means you'd have to kill some features to do it (such as Google+ integration which nobody likes anyway, or SMS integration, which also pisses people off) then so be it!  Whatsapp is doing it - so why can't you?   That would be so awful for her. So let's hope she doesn't become president.   WebRTC is P2P and end-to-end, and I believe it allows video-conferences. The only thing you need is a "signal" server between them, but it doesn't handle the encryption.   Out of curiosity, how much money is the oil/gas subsidies costing the government?  I have no problem with *only* encouraging a certain industry that's "the future" for 5 or 10 years at most with perks and subsidies. I wouldn't want them to get those perks for a century as long before then it starts distorting the market too much, to the *detriment* of the consumer. Yet, that's exactly for how long the oil and gas industry have gotten subsidies.   Eh, that's a very extreme hypothetical. In reality, the adoption of solar/battery combo will likely *outplace* the EV adoption, or at least go more or less at the same pace. We won't replace 2 billion vehicles with EVs "in this instant".   I'm actually quite worried about that. What most people don't understand about this stuff is that if you can "improve" something as critical as the engine, breaks, wheel, gearbox, and so on, simply through an OTA software update, that means you can also BREAK those systems through hacking.  Now, I'm sure Tesla has pretty good engineers who understand why security will be important for stuff like that, unlike say [BMW](http://hackaday.com/2015/02/01/bmw-remote-unlock-wasnt-using-secure-http/)...but either way, no system is infallible to hacking. And this stuff can kill you - while you're on the road. Say you're on the highway with high speed. All the hackers need to do to kill you is turn your wheels a little and lock them in that position.   If there aren't new versions and there won't be a subscription required, how will they get money for it?   Chromebooks it is.    Safari does not support AES-GCM  Ugh. Why not? It's not that new, is it?   I would like to see a Snoop Snitch-like firewall against Stingrays as well.   We've seen how much oversight they have - so much that there had to be two different review committees to investigate NSA's activities post-Snowden revelations, Feinstein herself admitted that they need a list of all of the NSA's programs because they don't know about them, and Obama came out two or three times saying "he had no idea" NSA was doing some stuff (like spying on Merkel). Not to mention the FISA Court rubberstamps all of their requests.  If that's their "strict oversight", I don't know what *no oversight* would look like.   Give the people what they want: bread and circus (which in this case fits HBO quite well).   I think Rand can beat Hillary, as the article says, but the challenge will be getting him to win the primaries. Remember what the right-wing did to Ron Paul the last time? They may treat Rand Paul slightly better until closer to the primaries, but not much better.  That said, in my ideal world, both Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders would win the primaries. Can you imagine those epic debates? I think America will come out better after that, and I'd be happy with whoever wins, although Bernie Sanders would still be my favorite. If it was Ron Paul vs Bernie Sanders, then I wouldn't picked Ron Paul. But I trust Rand less to keep his promises (still an obvious choice over all the other Republicans though).   Ghost Ship - [spoiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22XdYRbFHoE)   With such voting systems you *at least* need to have 2 rounds of voting to alleviate the problem of voting fragmentation for one side or the other, allowing the side that shouldn't be getting the majority of votes to win.  Otherwise, approval voting sounds about ideal:  http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/cc04   Major ruling today from Appeals Court that says:  1) bulk collection was NOT authorized under the Patriot Act  2) for such "bulk collection" programs people DO have standing (otherwise it would just be circular logic - you don't have standing because you can't know you're being spied upon, and you can't know you're being spied upon because that's secret....that's not how justice is supposed to work, or logic for that matter)  https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150507/07372730922/huge-win-appeals-court-says-nsas-bulk-phone-records-collection-not-actually-authorized-patriot-act.shtml   We need to go BIGGER!   HEADSHOT!  Ok more like a bullet in the arm, but still.   Thank you, Snowden!   Thank you, Snowden!   So far Tesla has had a pretty good track record on that front. All of its launched cars look pretty "normal" on the outside - just completely overhauled on the *inside* (engine and such).  This is unlike virtually all of its competitors who want to be "futuristic" or whatever with their electric cars on the outside, which makes them look weird on the road, and many still haven't completely redesigned their cars to be fully electric from the ground up, and instead re-use some of the old design and stick a battery and a motor inside, which makes them less efficient as EVs.   Yeah, it will boost the System D/grey market economy alright.   We'll probably see such a car by 2022, even from Tesla. But there will be others who will probably launch one sooner (such as Nissan).   The batteries make a big proportion of a cheaper car's cost. By then EV technology should be more mature, at bigger scales (cheaper), and Tesla will probably have several Gigafactories online (not to mention Samsung LG becoming a lot more aggressive with their own battery businesses too). I expect batteries to drop in price by 75% or so by 2022, so it should be possible to have even a $15,000 car with a 100 mile range, or a $20,000 one with a 200 mile range.   Not a space station, but a web that could catch asteroids ahead of time.   I'm surprised people still keep TheVerge reviews to a high esteem and upvote them here.   Because other browsers that do allow Adblock exist. You may say "yeah, but that's what - 5% of their users? Why would they care?"  They would care because that's a category of people that's highly influential/vocal/know-it-all tech types. In other words, the same people that started using Chrome from the early days and recommended everyone they knew (and they tend to also be the type that everyone asks for computer advice) to use it, too.  If Google loses that group of people, it's over for Chrome. Not overnight, obviously, as it will still take some time for those who left to convince the rest to switch yet again to another "better" browser, but that's just a matter of time.   We ought to have a Comcast for asteroid mining! Heck, it could even *be* Comcast.   Hopefully we don't end up destroying Jupiter with out first try.   I think the point stands, no? Nuclear reactors need some kind of "fuel", too. But if we can get to Jupiter with solar panels alone, I guess that would satisfy the majority of cases for the EmDrive to be "fuel-less".   Ever heard about the Gillette razor business model?   Seriously? Of course it's also Cerberus' fault. Not like there's "legal" hacking (no, not referring to security research and stuff).   Meh. You can't have that because "perfect" is a *moving target*. For instance, in one year Samsung may release a phone with QHD display while Apple may release a fingerprint reader for its phone, and people will be like BUT WHY CAN'T I HAVE BOTH?!?!  And then the next year there will be a phone with both, but now some other featured appears in the market, and people will be like "MY PHONE IS NOT PERFECT WITHOUT THAT FEATURE!!"  So yeah.   Facebook ban-hammer in action. I wonder what kind of similar "executive decisions" they'll take with Oculus in the future.  Anyways, what I care most about is full end-to-end verifiable encryption and authentication for Whatsapp - when are we going to get *that*?   Please, Moto, PLEASE!   The decision to assassinate people with drones is already informed by algorithms. Not sure I'd call that being "better for it".   I don't think you understand the meaning of a "clone". The 50 other 2048-like apps are *clones*. 2048 is just inspired by threes.   It's becoming more clear why Merkel and her prosecutors didn't want Snowden to testify in the German Parliament. They knew what's up.   Precedent doesn't mean all lower Courts must 100% of the time follow the previous precedent, does it? Otherwise how could we ever have progress?  The third party doctrine ruling happened 30 years ago under different circumstances. How do we get it again up to the Supreme Court for another review of the "same level"?   This sort of stuff is going to happen even more now, as the authorities *can* and *will* use the third-party doctrine against *any* US-based service:  http://motherboard.vice.com/read/one-of-the-biggest-privacy-wins-in-recent-memory-has-been-reversed  Solution:  1) Use only services *based* outside of US (make sure they don't have servers in US, because many foreign services do)  2) if you do use a US service to store your data, you have to encrypt it locally on your PC before uploading it, and only you have to have the key  3) use only end-to-end encrypted communication tools (Signal/Textsecure, Peerio, Tox, etc)   Ahem: http://motherboard.vice.com/read/one-of-the-biggest-privacy-wins-in-recent-memory-has-been-reversed  This should apply to all companies that "hold your data". And even if that's not explicitly clear quite yet, law enforcement has already been using the third-party doctrine like that, or at least the NSA has. Now they have even more reason to do it.  Lesson: don't keep your data in other people's servers, unless you encrypt it before you upload it there yourself and only you have the encryption key. Or don't use services based in US.   Tor is better than any VPN.   They keep doing that because apparently judges keep buying it.   Police brutality - NOW IN 4K!   Is Facebook in a hurry to beat Comcast for the shittiest company in America? Because that's what it looks like.   I think Android 5.0 should support "device tree" - isn't that helpful for this purpose?   This means everyone should:  1) start *requiring* from all service providers to offer *strong end-to-end encryption* - This will put the data back in your hands and removes the liability and onus to share your data from the providers (btw this ruling applies to *all* "third-party" providers, not just carriers, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc).  2) boycott the ones who don't do that and keep your data in a centralized place either unencrypted or they can use their own key to decrypt it    Not quite. The "security" Schneier is referring to here is *digital security* - or hell, *cyber*-security if you will, which the government keeps pretending to support.  In the "security vs freedom" equation it's more about "national security/public safety vs cybersecurity/privacy".   All that + no end-to-end encryption for me.   I wish Google would rip out Java for Go and make a system of unified updates that come from Google - screw OEMs if they don't like. We need unified updates for Android phones.  And if they don't like that, they can just go use Windows Phone....oh wait, Windows Phone *already* forces them to take updates from Microsoft. Guess the OEMs can SUCK IT!   A million? You don't say. You think that maybe you're exaggerating a bit? Maybe by 999,998 or so?      allows telcos to track  **Aha!** - So that's why they didn't enable HTTPS for those sites.   No more Microsoft.   I think the lizardmen got to it and shut it down. They're everywhere, man.   [Google link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 ved=0CB8QqQIwAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fu-s-will-change-stance-on-secret-phone-tracking-1430696796 ei=OfFGVcD4HcGSU8-wgbgD usg=AFQjCNG3Nacbr2zPMS3WLYmtlERPrEMsdA sig2=d23Gk7yRtGqSXkXgn_MDng) for full article.   They have, but on a different time scale. They double in capacity (or halven in price) every 10 years or so. Assuming that will keep happening (including discovering new technologies, etc) then within 2 decades batteries should have 4x the density as they do now, at all price points, which means even sub-$20,000 cars should have a decent range by then, so just about anyone could get one. As for the more expensive ones, the range anxiety will all but disappear.   Hybrids are *at best* a "transitional" product. We're going to see much less demand for hybrids than full EVs. "Future" cars will all be fully electric. The problem with hybrids is that you need the whole "cruft" of the gas-powered designs and then add the battery-related components as well, making for a very inefficient design both in terms of cost and space.  I understand why people say they need a hybrid though - the range may not be good enough yet for *some* or for a certain lower price point, but as batteries improve in cost (and they do by 8% each year), EVs will become "good enough" for more and more people.  If you look back at all disruptive technologies, they all start out as "good enough" only for some people, and as they improve they become "good enough" for the majority later on (SSD's vs HDDs, notebooks vs PCs, etc).   Would you eat "pork" made out of bug protein?  I think provenance matters. I'd rather eat meat made out of plants than insects.   Wrong. It's only free for consumers to upgrade.   OEM-installed Windows versions - you're paying money out of your pocket to pay for the Windows license, too.  All businesses and institutions will also pay for Windows licenses.    rich people pay a disproportionate amount of income taxes  Only if you're referring to the "total amount", but rich people tend to pay much less as a *percentage* of their income than lower classes (where a high percentage of their small salaries actually impacts their living conditions *much more* than it would a rich person).   I think it's doable, especially now that we're starting to see battery "products" for combining them with solar power, which should increase the demand for solar power.   When did this switch to encryption happen for torrents? I remember Bram Cohen, founder of Bittorrent was quite against it many years ago.  And what kind of encryption does it use exactly?   No, thanks?   That's short term thinking and you know it. Solar panels have come down drastically in price over the past few years. Batteries are likely to  cost half as much too in about 5 years, once the Gigafactory 1 is in full production, and they'll come down in price even more as Tesla builds more of them. There's also a ~8% improvement in energy density/pricing every year, even without the Gigafactories.  People have been saying for years that solar can't be competitive, and now the voices are dying down as solar quickly becomes more competitive. What makes you think solar and batteries are as good as they'll ever get *now*?!  The industry is just scratching the surface as investments are just *now* starting to treat solar/batteries seriously. Wait until this thing becomes "obvious" for everyone, and more companies and countries decide to invest billions into researching the technology and scaling the production.  I think by 2040 80% of the world's energy will be from solar/batteries. We might try to push for more, but even I think the rest 20% should probably come from something like *fusion* (I think we'll figure it out by then) or at least thorium reactors.    Microsoft gives NSA zero-days months before they fix them, which NSA can use to hack into vulnerable systems, though. Why do you think Microsoft complained so much when Google forced it to fix a major bug earlier than they wanted?  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms   I wonder what will happen when Windows 10.1 comes out a year later.  Will they just say: "Hey Windows 10 users, you have 6 months to buy Windows 10.1 or you'll be left on an unpatched version of Windows, just like XP."  I assume they aren't *that* dumb to do that, but who knows.   Kernel Sanders.   They should call her Terri, because she's terrifying.   I think FCC or some law should require them to *guarantee* at least 1/4 of the "up to" speed. Better yet, companies should advertise *only* the guaranteed speed.   Unless it's some mid-level clerk.   So she knows what's up.   Because he's authentic and has a track record to *prove* he has already supported the promises he's making now, in Congress.  Clinton on the other hand, quite the opposite. She's worse than Obama in that regard. She'll just say whatever people want to hear now and what polls well, so she can win.    Paid troll spotted.   Unlike Obama who voted for the Patriot Act's extension in Senate *months* before the general election, Sanders actually has a long track record of being pro-civil liberties.   The very *least* he can do:  1) Kill the EO 12333 from which many of NSA's spying abuses arise  2) Pardon Snowden - sending the message that he *welcomes* such whistleblowing  3) Prosecute NSA and CIA (torture) abuses  There are many other things he could do to clean up law enforcement in general, but that's beyond of the scope of this thread.  Also remember he's the executive. Even if the Patriot Act and FISA Amendments Act are "laws", he could just make policies that make the use of such laws drastically narrower and fire anyone who doesn't respect those policies.   The NSA will definitely start helping to discredit him now. Expect lots of "facts that happened 20 years ago" about Sanders to come out in papers from "anonymous sources".   At least do it  right - make sure the police department filming stuff DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS to the videos. Only a third independent party should have access to them.   Vive la Resistance!   Tell your car to come get you from wherever you're stranded by the zombies.   More dangerous than the fossil fuel they are already using?   That's the plan with Gigafactory. My guess is the price of these will fall to about half a few years after Gigafactory goes online.  Even at this price level, it seems many are quite surprised it's this low, and they expected it to be more like $5,000-$10,000.   In other words, /u/JDGumby is NOT awesome!   Not sure I follow - you "trust" the site you visit (and from where you download the WebGL code), that's the point of HTTPS.  Through HTTP others could be sending you "alternative code" that's infected.   UFS 2.0 or BUST!   Moxie is too focused on "but we've already said it's not working with iOS!"  I don't think that was the *main* point of the article, but the fact that you can't TRUST Whatsapp to properly use TextSecure encryption  - iOS or not.  1) Whatsapp has never made it public itself that it's doing this (ok, still in "deployment" so we'll see what they do when it's "finished")  2) No privacy policy change yet, and I think there should be one - also eagerly awaiting for this  3) No fingerprint authentication or any way to ensure that the e2e encryption is working  Again this is supposedly "not done yet" - so we'll see. However, Moxie and his team have consistenly promoted Whatsapp as "secure" already *because* of that "unfinished implementation". They even had a small argument on Twitter with Telegram over it saying that Whatsapp is more secure than Telegram because of it.  I do agree Telegram encryption sucks, but I don't think they should say Whatsapp is so much more secure, because at this point Whatsapp's E2E encryption is nothing more but "vaporware". Until Whatsapp resolves the 3 issues I mentioned above, that's exactly what it is.   I'm a big fan of Moxie and I can't wait until Signal arrives on Android (and on desktop, too, hopefully) but I hate that Whatsapp is getting so much good press over this without being anywhere near ready or even officially committing to adopting this type of encryption.   The idea is the 7KWh one is a "higher quality" battery that lasts more recharges (which allows you to use it more often, during the day, too, etc). The 10KWh one is more for light night time use.  If they made a 10KWh version of the 7KWh one it would probably cost more like $4,300.   Lead acid batteries have about twice the density of Li-Ion, that's why it costs about half for the same capacity. But as others have said, they have other disadvantages, too.   If this is what Tesla can do now, imagine what they can do *after* the Gigafactory is built. The price will probably drop in half by 2020 (which is actually quite a big deal in battery progress time).   EFF's opinion on it (they don't like it in full, but they ultimately think it's a step forward and recommend Congress to vote YES on it):  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/new-usa-freedom-act-step-right-direction-more-must-be-done  My biggest worry is that we'll pass this and everyone will be like "WE DID IT REDDIT! WE DID IT!!", as if we achieved some grand thing and now NSA's mass spying is over, and then they'll have zero interest in pursuing future such bills anymore.  At best this *scales back* on the 215 section of the Patriot Act. An improvement for sure, but the NSA has dozens other spying programs, including some more major ones such as the FISA Amendments Act, section 702, the EO 12333, the new "cyber threat sharing" laws which will most likely pass because "OMG CYBERWAR IS COMING and we need this bill because...I don't know - *probably* helps?!"  Then there are stingrays which the FBI *knows* are illegal and try to hide them from Courts, and who knows how many other such things which aren't even coded into the law like stuff in the Patriot Act was.  Think of "winning against mass and abusive spying" like a "meter" we need to fill. If we pass this one, we've maybe filled the meter 5%. We still have a long way to go to fill it completely.   Android apps are native to Android. These Android apps will run on top of Windows.   Don't you mean more developers will write for Android, now that Android apps have gained yet another platform to be on?   Not to mention that everyone here used to hate "that iOS look!" on their Android apps, as apps were mostly ported over from iOS.  I wonder what they'll think now when Microsoft fans "beautiful Metro design" will be mixed with iOS and Android designs.   I completely agree. In fact, I agree so much with you that I think Microsoft should also allow its "universal apps" to be truly universal and run on *other platforms* as well, such as Linux or Android or Chrome OS, just like Google allowed Android apps to be ported to other platforms as well (Blackberry, Tizen, now Windows 10, etc).  Agreed?!   Better. Vulkan is pretty much designed from scratch as a "modern" graphics API. DirectX12 is a modified DX11 to support some of this stuff, too.  Vulkan should have much better multi-core support for one.   On the other hand, Hillary is a "loser", just like Romney, who already lost before running again. Also Hillary lost before to a passionate underdog candidate.  Hillary is the Democrat's Romney, who just like Romney also likes to flip-flop on a lot of issues where she supported the *opposite* just until a few years ago.   We've heard such big claims from Microsoft before.   Now Windows 10 will have not one, but 3 different design guidelines for apps.    "The fact that SHA-2 cant be used with older browsers and OSs means that untrusted certificate warnings are going to become commonplace," Munro explained. "And if that happens, the danger is that many users will simply ride rough-shod over such pop-ups, potentially creating the ideal opportunity for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks."  Meh. Let's face it - the people that are still on XP and Android 2.2 were going to click through that sort of stuff anyway, even if everything was nice and compatible until one day they suddenly get a MITM attack.   I'd rather not keep everyone else less vulnerable because of 1% of the market that's likely to be the the least tech-literate anyway.   "Our bill is totally not like the US one - it's *much worse*!"   Banuiesc ca cei din conducerea scolii erau pe mana cu cei care aduceau drogurile in scoala. Altfel nu imi explic de ce ar face asa ceva.   With VR you can create a whole cinema...and a cinema-like environment as well.   So people will suddenly have no problem with the fact that apps will have "iOS" look or "Android" look and nothing like Microsoft's own design guidelines now?   Before anyone says "I love that Microsoft is doing this" - don't forget this is possible in the first place because Google made Android open source. Therefore:  Microsoft can use Android apps on Windows  Google can't use Windows apps on Android or Chrome OS (remote desktop doesn't count)     I think we've heard this sort of thing from Microsoft before a few times.  "Windows store will have 100k apps within 3 months!" - had more like 50k apps 6 months later, and most crappy RSS apps and such.   This is going to make Android apps even more popular over Windows or even iOS apps. Android probably has the most to gain by this.   Games are niche now?   Don't be silly. Microsoft will not make Windows open source. Doing so would also deprive them of all those billions of dollars a year in patents, since they'd have to make them public domain, too.   Those are coming to Android, too. The days of "x86 apps" will soon be gone.   Then if Android apps will be the big attractive feature, why not just get rid of the middleman and use Android directly? More secure and higher performance (Microsoft would have to run an Android VM on top of Windows).  If only Google took Android for PCs seriously.   Last I checked Microsoft *is* the dominant player on PCs.   You forgot quantum computer and immortality.    Duh. They should've used a gold master lock.   Daca folosesti OLX sau situri de genul e posibil ca ei sa ti-l dea mai departe. Stiu ca m-am inscris o data la vreo 3 situri mari de anunturi, si apoi am inceput sa primesc SMS de la alte situri de anunturi.   Ideea ca o agentie de spionaj sa se ocupe de "securitate cibernetica" e complet conflictuala cu *misiunea principala* a agentiilor de spionaj - aceea de a spiona, ceea ce necesita sisteme slabe din punct de vedere al securitatii. Misiunea de securitate ar presupune sisteme securiate foarte bine. Dar pentru o agentie de spionaj misiunea de spionaj o sa castige intotdeauna impotriva misiunii de securitate.  De aceea UE a propus ca agentii *civile* sa se ocupe de securitate cibernetica (de ce ar fi un secret de stat ca un hacker sparge computerele unei companii?!). Plus ca acest lucru ar fi mult mai democratic.   Nu inteleg de ce trebuie amestecate legile de colectare a datelor si spionaj cu "securitatea cibernetica" - nu au nici o legatura una cu alta. Trebuie sa fie legi separate (iar din punctul meu de vedere prima trebuie limita si mai mult).   De asemenea Curtea Europeana de Justitie a zis deja ca directiva EU de a "retine datele in mod nediscriminatoriu timp de 2 ani e *invalida* (pentru ca incalca drepturile omului si poate fi abuzata prea usor)".  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/data-retention-violates-human-rights-says-eus-highest-court    How many people died in the crash of the iPads?   A couple (long) answers about why not (which will also be testimonies in tomorrow's crypto hearing):  http://www.crypto.com/papers/governmentreform-blaze2015.pdf  http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4-29-2015-IT-Subcommittee-Hearing-on-Encryption-Bankston.pdf   A strike/protest is meaningless unless it becomes somewhat inconvenient to a company/government.  If the strike or protest was only after work hours and in "free speech zones" where it bothers no one, the leadership wouldn't have to do a thing about the protesters' demands, since they wouldn't be inconvenienced in the slightest by it.  The protesters' "negotiation power" with the leadership comes from that inconvenience it causes to the leadership.   FCC should be fining the hell out of Verizon and other carriers who spout lies like this. The only way he'd need 75Mbps for Netflix is if Verizon's 50Mbps actually works at 2Mbps, and therefore "he'd need the 75Mbps one" to get to 3Mbps.   You can take that to the bank!   TTIP is a different but similar treaty. It's just that it's done with the EU instead of the Pacific countries which the TPP targets.   Obama and Cameron seem to be like bros lately. They even use each other's speeches.   Remember when they promised Gigabit fiber? Yeah, I laughed at that, too.   If you're security paranoid, then you "shouldn't trust Microsoft" because once Microsoft discovers new vulnerabilities in its operating system (including Bitlocker) it hands them over to the NSA before it releases a fix months later when it gets around to fixing the vulnerability.  http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms.html  Apple is now doing the same, starting with the new "cyber-threat sharing" executive order announced a couple of months ago, for which Apple got a very good deal from the government (integrating Apple Pay with [federal services](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/13/apple-ceo-tim-cook-cybersecurity-summit/)).  Both Microsoft and now Apple are doing this as a *choice*. They can't even use the excuse that "it's the law!" (at least until CISA and such pass - and then they'll get immunity for doing it, just like the carriers did for over-sharing data with law enforcement).   Intel still has to license AMD64 (the real "x64" architecture) from AMD, too. So unless Intel suddenly has no need for 64-bit chips anymore, I think it's going to agree to give Samsung the x86 license, too.  And even if that wasn't an issue, it seems highly unlikely Intel will just say "NO! We will be the only ones with x86...MUAHAHAHA! Come at us antitrust bodies. We double dare you!"  Worst case scenario they increase the license price in a renegotiation contract.  If Samsung is smart though, it could even *lower* the price by telling Intel "how about we agree to use your shitty  lower-end Atom chips in some of our low-cost/mass volume devices for a couple of years and you drop the x86 license cost by 20% - deal?!"  Intel would be foaming at the mouth to get that deal and "increase its market share" in mobile.  Then 2 years later Samsung uses only Exynos chip lines in its own devices with its own CPUs and GPUs.   It won't appear until S7 anyway.   Except we know squat about Kryo. It could be another dud. Let's wait and see.   Ultimul lui post se pare:  http://mihai.sucan.ro/mihai/blog/touched   NYT has been going to shit for years now.   How about - [no](http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-kept-looser-rules-for-drones-in-pakistan-1430092626)?  The killer drones have been, are and *will be* "regulated" in *secret*. And the cheaper they will become, the looser the regulations will be, too.   I wonder if Microsoft had a hand in this.  "Shit! If people start buying *these* Nokias, that means we bought their phone division for nothing!   We better pay them a little more to stay out of the market, or at the very least threaten them with a patent lawsuit."   I think he means [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en).   I don't really care about (completely) self-driving cars, but 90% of the same technology could be used to make even manual cars drastically safer. Think Super-ESP - and I can't wait until more cars get such technology. The more cars use it, the cheaper it will get, which means even bottom-of-the-market priced cars will get it eventually.   Tor isn't P2P. It has centralized relay and exit nodes. Being P2P would mean everyone is a relay/exit node, which isn't the case with Tor.   This is actually a pretty major weakness of Tor, because there aren't enough exit nodes, which means it's pretty easy for a government to run "a lot" of exit nodes itself, and then it can analyze the traffic more easily and have a better understanding of where its target might be.   Yeah, I think Asus has a couple, but they are like $300 I think. I think they charge at least $100 more just for the privilege of using OpenWRT/DD-WRT for such a modem. I think there was another company that had them.  It might be better to just look for ones that can be easily upgraded to OpenWRT/DD-WRT after you buy them.   Ever since Apple made all the new deals with China recently, I don't think they'll be too quick to fix such "bugs" (except the ones that get very public of course, but who knows how many like these they find themselves and then ignore until some 3rd party researcher finds them and then Apple is forced to act).   Apple also shares these bugs with DHS/NSA now so they have yet another incentive not to disclose them until someone else makes them public. Microsoft does the same by the way (and has been doing it for [years](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms), actually).   Hey, it was only a bad apple.   I don't think the Iranian nuclear facilities were Internet-enabled either. Yet they got Stuxnet. Scientists share data between computers , which increases the risk of getting infected.   No. Windows 7 is 4x-10x more popular, depending which stat company you believe.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows#Usage_share  Windows XP is a rich ground for malware and viruses because of its:  1) weak security (much weaker than Vista+)  2) no updates to at least keep the zero-day vulnerabilities in check  Using Windows for such safety-critical systems is BRAIN-DEAD STUPID. They shouldn't be using an OS with 90% share of the desktop market that even script-kiddies can hack (especially when not patched). And I would say the very same thing if it was Android what they were running.  Critical systems like these should be using highly custom and *security hardened* operating systems. What if North Korea reverse-engineered Stuxnet (they can probably already buy such a version from the black market by now anyway) and sends it to Japan's nuclear facilities now?! Heck, China has already been poking Japan lately over the islands issue.  Governments using Windows for safety and security critical infrastructure is STUPID (that goes for the US Department of Defense, too). I can't repeat that enough.   3G/4G still consumes quite a bit, too. Besides, he didn't say Play Services wasn't on. He said it was in airplane mode.   I wouldn't be so quick to blame the "users" for not using apps with strong encryption. Most of such apps have been ugly as hell until recently, not to mention difficult to use and figure out how to set them up properly.  I would much rather put the blame on "app developers", who *choose* to make dozens and dozens of IM applications available on app stores, yet you could count on one hand the ones who have strong encryption.  When app developers choose to use strong encryption it's also much easier to get millions and millions of people to use strong encryption than if you try to convince every user one by one.  When there will be a dozen+ such apps to choose from, *then* we can start blaming the users for being so ignorant and foolish for not using those apps instead.   What would you call the NSA? Even Obama said "he didn't know" what they were doing in many cases. Feinstein admitted to something similar, saying they had no idea about many of NSA's programs - despite the fact that they were supposed to be there to *oversee it*.  The NSA operates almost completely independent from Congress or the White House.   Reminds me of Facebook's "mistakes" to track everyone everywhere even when they aren't logged in to Facebook or even when they don't have a Facebook account.   Just a tiny itsy bitsy "error" - like Apple wiping out its competitor from the App Store.   How does that pass common sense? Are judges robots? Shouldn't they be serving "justice"? How does a house commit a crime? Shouldn't it be *only humans* who can commit crimes? Aren't crimes just rules that we establish for the humans in the society that are then broken?   Yes, his knowledge of ARM CPUs seems obsolete.   Because Atom for mobile is $35 (heavily subsidized), Celeron/Pentium Atoms are [$107-$161](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9125/intel-braswell-details-quietly-launched-cherry-trail-and-airmont-on-14nm) (heavily overpriced - same price as Haswell Celerons and Pentiums - to compensate mobile subsidies) , a high-end ARM chip is $25-$30, and Core-M is [$281](http://media.bestofmicro.com/O/T/451901/gallery/Core-M-models-1024_w_600.jpg).   In other words, for similar performance and price, you're paying 10x more for Intel. Isn't the PC monopoly great?! (especially now that Windows RT is dead, and Intel can charge as much as it wants for chips that go inside Windows devices, because they don't come with ARM anymore).   Too bad Atom's GPU is 2 generations behind the latest ARM GPU, though...   Windows 10 mobile is more like RT than desktop Windows. So it makes as much as sense to say that it's a "full PC in your pocket" as you'd say about an Android phone...in fact Android phones are far more capable than Windows phones...even Windows 10 ones.   Indeed. Only time will tell if they "learned their lesson". For all we know they have 3 other Chinese backdoors in their operating systems.   "64-bit" in x86 world is pretty *meaningless* other than support for more than 3GB of RAM.  ARMv7 vs 64-bit ARMv8: the difference is significantly bigger in features and performance.   It has a crappy Atom chip, that's why.   You're funny. Windows is much more locked down than Android. You can't even sideload apps in Windows mobile.   Of course they are. Windows 10 desktop has a *ton* of bloat in it. Why would they add all the Lenovo and Asus drivers to an HTC phone, for example?   Windows 10 for desktop and Windows 10 "for phones" are *completely different operating systems*.  It's just Microsoft the one that tries to be misleading about it, naming them the same. Remember Surface RT and Surface Pro? It's like that.   More like fewer features.   We should replace the head, too, then!  Wait...   HTC has always relied on Qualcomm more than anyone else (in many cases to its detriment).   DJB already has something better than lattice-based crypto apparently (which has been found vulnerable to a few attacks lately anyway):  http://binary.cr.yp.to/mcbits.html   Don't let Zoso know, you filthy pirates!   Which begs the question - if they could already catch these guys - why are do they need a new law then?   A one-stop shop for all of their surveillance needs.    Mr Zhang said the flaws they uncovered were likely to be widespread throughout handsets running Android 5.0 and below. Updating to the latest version of Android, version 5.1.1, should remove the vulnerabilities, he said.  Well that should be easy!  *laughing*...*then crying*   In April last year, hackers discovered a way to fool the print sensor on the S5 by taking a photograph of a print left on a smartphone screen, making a mould from the image and using that to make a replica fake finger. In 2013, a German hacker group used a similar method to bypass the fingerprint reader on Apple's iPhone 5. Hackers from the Chaos Computer Club used a picture of a person's fingerprint left on a glass surface to make a fake finger that unlocked the phone.  WTF? Why the hell are companies releasing such features with *known flaws* - especially ones so obviously bad. I think I'll wait until Qualcomm's Sense ID "3D fingerprint" reader to arrive, before I trust using them, but I bet it's only going to be a matter of time before that one gets spoofed, too.   Yes. Sony has had better sensors than Apple over the past 2-3 years, because it was giving Apple lower-end/older ones, yet somehow Apple still managed to beat them almost every single time because of software optimization.   At least at the high-end they use the most cutting edge hardware to make up for their software deficiencies for the most part, but where it's most noticeable that Sony's camera software isn't that great is on mid-range and lower-end phones where Sony's cameras are crap.  With Android 5.0, Google has also given OEMs great camera APIs with high performance processing, so now they can't use the excuse that it's Google's stock software anymore or anything like that (even though I think most of the big OEMs have been using their own custom firmware for a while, and they haven't been using Google's firmware much).   For those who don't know (it applies to the Android version, too):  https://blog.winkelmeyer.com/2015/01/warning-microsofts-outlook-app-for-ios-breaks-your-company-security/   Music ~~freedom~~ net neutrality killer.   You mean the same way it happened with the Patriot Act? 14 years later we still have it. Also, it's been quite a few years since the carriers were granted immunity for giving our data to law enforcement agencies, too, and *they still have it*. Now tech companies are going to get it, too.   Screw having sympathy for any company or any country going through a disaster in the future. It seems every time it happens, they use that sympathy of millions as an *excuse* to do exactly what they say makes them a victim.  **France** - says the terrorists are attacking their free speech! Millions rally to support that free speech - then France passes mass surveillance and censorship law, attacking the very free speech they said it was getting attacked by others.  **Sony** - gets hacked and threatened not to publish the movie - says 'Murrica's free speech is under attack. Now a new cyber-surveillance law is being passed and Sony threatens anyone who dares to publish anything about the leaked documents.  So fuck it! The next time something like this happens, they are on their on. I'm not going to let them use my sympathy again as an excuse to pass yet another draconian law in the defense of the very thing they complain about getting attacked.   Then someone should prepare the lawsuit already. Obama has been calling for it since the Sony hack, but many didn't realize that's what he was actually saying in his speech.   Unified VAT would do away with all the bureaucracy of the new VAT system, while still maintaining the benefit of distributing VAT money properly to countries, instead of only a couple of countries getting all the foreign VAT money because they happen to be where Amazon is located.  I happen to believe the idea for the new EU VAT system is a great one, because it distributes that VAT. It's just that it creates a terrible bureaucratic mess. All of that mess would be wiped clean if there was only one VAT tax across EU, and businesses wouldn't have to keep 75 (multiple countries have more than one VAT tax) different VAT values in mind when selling to EU countries.   Now sure how relevant, but Google plans to introduce the "Android Pay" API and service providers can hook into it, while the outside world/POS systems would see only the Pay API. I believe the API will also support tokenization, like Apple Pay, where the merchant doesn't actually know who's paying.   Only because the government wants to push the "debate" for that long - as in "we'll push it until you agree with us". It's the same with their idea of "balance" between privacy and national security. Balance = total surveillance of everyone.  From what I've seen, from the cryptographers' point of view, the debate is already over.  	200
 Do you love em, hate em. What's your opinion on this growing trend.      I blame peter molyneux, he just kept over-hyping his game, setting the bar too high.   As a fan of Final Fantasy, I don't think FF7 is a great as everyone says. Apart from graphical improvements and stuff like mini-games, it played just like the others. The magic system was creative but not that special and open world aspects had been in the other entries. The story wasn't bad, it was good, but not that special. I still think its a great game, I still play it to this day, but I don't think it's as game changing as others have called it.      And now I'm afraid I have somewhat of a mess on my hands.   Dude the people who look at you with disgust, fuck those guys. When i was 15 i used to have a small red-afro, people used to call me carrot-top. You just have to learn to ignore it, and then you don't hear it anymore. I used to be introverted too, I'm still afraid to order a pizza over the phone. You just need to realize your special, there's no one like you, and there never will be. Just knowing that will help you be more outgoing. I'm doing this, and the girls are starting to swoop in for me.      Buck Naked   Yeah make society your bitch, if you're into that sort of thing...   While I do think it's a shame they shutdown LucasArts, that doesn't mean the end of Star Wars games, they can still license. Some of the the best games were developed by others. Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy, Empire at War, Battlefront, and Knights of the old Republic.   While you make good points, I still think it is. The license system is deep and while it matches the sphere grid I think it takes the idea to a new level. But I don't think it's perfect, example is Vaan. You could take him out of the whole game and it wouldn't change much.   why'd you delete FF12?   holy shit you're me   I won't lie, Bioshock is a great game, so are the sequels. But I never understood all the hype.   and it doesn't just to have to be movies   Shenmue, if you don't it you really should youtube it. Final Fantasy series, even though I don't favor the new entries I do respect how amazing the graphics are. Knights of the Old republic, one of if not the best series of Sci-fi RPG's. Heavy Rain, while I liked Indigo Prophecy I actually cared about the characters in Heavy Rain with all my heart, so much so I had trouble getting a sad/"bad" ending.   "you will sit here, and you will f*cking watch this!!"   Star Wars:Jedi Knight. the old games still have the best lightsaber action so I would love to see what they can do now.   Mine is about my dad. I wanna love him, but he wasn't and isn't part of my life that much, so I have trouble loving him. I think he's trying, but i'm not the first kid he wasn't always around for.  P.S. I know the title should be "What's" not "Whats"      [dude those it just suck being you?] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeFuq5Q0OXo)   2001: A Space Odyssey. There's so many interpretations out there ranging from the minor details to the overall plot.   At first i was like, yeah! Then it asked for money and I was like, Sorry!   Topher Grace?   4, 5, 2, 3, 6. You don't need 1 because the elevator scene in 2 I think brings you up to speed and almost no plot is carried over. And with this you don't lose the shock value of the Darth Vader father reveal in 5. After that you can consider 2 and 3 a long flashback for how Anakin become evil.   What was/is your dream job? Unless you always wanted to be a security guard, I'm not saying it's a bad job.   relax bra, :)   Sequel to Office Space   Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. Solve in that order   "PC LOAD LETTER? The fuck does that mean?"   Queen - I Want to Break Free      I just wish more people would realize this.   Keep Shenmue  	35
 Wake in Fright is absolutely fantastic and everybody should see that film.   It's got one of my favourite moments of sound design, where there's nothing but the rumble of the engine as the party is driving back home after the kangaroo hunt.  Just fantastic.   I got a lot of respect for Robert Rodriguez. His work ethic and his skills across multiple areas of filmmaking are just... I mean, a guy who writes, directs, edits, produces, scores and even helps with the visual fx on his films. That's a lot of passion and love for his craft right there.  Just look at his credits on imdb for his own films. Nuts.  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/?ref_=nv_sr_1  Edit: AND lights them too. A guy who totally deserves the title of maverick.  	2

 Its a secret grandma,its a secret.   Dont you get that shit near me!   Unlike you,stuck in your own time,overrun by the new generations.   That sounds real bad man.Well trust me,you can do better than a girl that wont help you go over bad times.Youll find another one,if you didnt already :)   So its a God-Of-War-ish RPG?Also does it have any sort of decent multiplayer?    Ever tried telling the bitch the shit that was happening in your life?   Awful breakup here,i still loved the girl and she just told me its over out of clear sky.Feels bad bro.   A car that cant go forward.   What,so you can take a picture of them and say its yours?No way.   No!Halt,put your first impressions aside,I am a miracle worker!   I think they tried to stick to 'how it would look if it was all perfect' Though in real life,youd be pretty sure to get shot as soon as sighted even if you had a big red cross on your head.   Have fun   Cowboy/girl,Police officer.Things you can dress up as with normal clothes.Or spray some red paint on your clothes and face and call yourself a zombie.   The leader got arrested for public masturbation,thats where it ended i think   One random thing.When did you get that text that she wants you to call her?It might start turning strange to her that shes not getting the call.Also,does her boyfriend have a deeper voice?I know i usually get confused with my father due to having the same voice as him over the phone.Im running dry on ideas here.   You are 100% sure that her mother wouldnt let her go?The very worst thing that can happen is her mother coming over to check up on you two, realising you've been lying to her,which would most likely end up quite badly.   Blade,BLACK panther...   Only Siths deal in absolutes.   I would not recommend it,but if you end up doing it,i want the pics   Ever noticed they never shoot the medics in Saving Private Ryan?Thats due to it being 'illegal',army medics are also not allowed to carry weapons,due to that.   Well ill start....how did it feel?   You know anyone older to take the role of your dad?Or tell the woman you are having voice problems and you cant talk right now.   A bear.So I could wrestle with him every time i come back from work!   Well i remember my parents always helping me out on things like this.Well at least my dad.How 'cool' is your dad on these things?He might be able to help you out.   Youtube.Watching two turtles doing it is always funnier while under the effects of alcohol.   Spit it.   "Hell to the no"   Fear.Children always terrified me due to unknown reasons.   Original ones.But if memory serves me well,i once tried it with hot and spicy.The way the tastes crash makes your tongue have an orgasm.Have fun!   "Fail"   Payphone by Maroon 5.I just cant say how much it reminded me of myself after a sudden break up maybe 3-4 months ago.It just came out of clear sky.Well atleast for my side.   Seeing someone i know in a place i dont.   A very fun night out in my experience.Worst i remember was 600 euros,but there was more of us to pay the price   Well the ideas are either r/cosplay or r/Halloween,but im not sure for specifics  	34
          Yes, I'm sorry.   I once wrote a 15,000 page story 3 separate times, in first, second, and third person respectively. Finally I realized that I liked it best in third person, but that I needed to rewrite it AGAIN. I think in the end, I kept about 100 words of the roughly 50,000 I initially wrote.   The silver lining is that the story thrived from the endless editing, and is now a published piece of fiction.       Not to mention some of these folks aren't even alive.       I've been waiting to read this book for months. So it's worth it?   Ahhhhh   John Keats is a poet from 200 years back. He's an interesting guy, and Hyperion gets its namesake from one of his poems. This book takes a VERY interesting twist on him.   Also, the book is chronological.    Ayn Rand is a wizard with a plot, but her writing is grueling.   Ender's Shadow is brilliant, as well as the entire Hegemon series. I have a sneaking suspicion you'll be hearing a lot more about this book after November hits.    The first book is about a pilgrimage to an abandoned planet, and each of 7 chapters is told by a different pilgrim. Each subsequent book takes a different narrative approach, but all of the characters remain the same. On a side note, if you're at all a John Keats fan, this is a can't miss.    Bright Lights, Big City.    Hyperion by Dan Simmons.    Check out Hyperion by Dan Simmons. It's a 4 book series that runs through about 7 narrators, but each of them have a compelling story and they all come together flawlessly. One of the best (and most underrated) series around.       Isn't this why fan fiction exists?   I love this guy's swagger.    Never been but would love to share a meal with you.    Long live Chauncey. Mitch, have you ever eaten at his restaurant in Colorado?   Happy cake day!   I'm still rooting for the Celtics.   	23
       It's pretty easy for people to say "resign", but difficult to do.  It sounds like your boss is aware of your position on this, make sure that others are as well. Leaders in the organization need to understand the impact (potential consequences) of the strategy, and ideally know that you are not a proponent of it, though still see you as a team player since you are moving forward with it per instructions.  You may have to work around your boss to achieve the above, but the greater good is the organization and not your boss' ego. Help your boss understand that your concern is the success of the business, and it isn't anything personal.   Not Mama.   He's a dick.    ELI5   I want to see this acted out by Monty python.    *Sigh.*   I'd love a statue (specifically looking for one of Thoth) for my home, but what I've been able to find online are generally very small (a few inches) or just outrageously priced (IMHO).  Do you know of any places online where you can buy ~4' (feet) statues? Wood is fine with me, not looking for marble or anything like that.  Thanks. Endif   What's the sound quality like? Say 1 of these stuck to a cup vs portable speakers. A d how does it stick?   NSA. Just doing my job.    Isn't this common in the ONE? And, what are you doing in this thread?   You can buy my condo. The mortgage for my 2 bdrm condo would end up being about half of what you would pay in rent. Then you could rent out one of the rooms and essentially pay nothing -- that's what I did for years.  PM me if interested.   So you are saying that homeless = alcoholic?  Look, games like this can be played all day. Let it go, it's a nice day out.   What game types do you play?   Thanks everybody!   Keep that little story to yourself, mkay?   Yeah the bad part is you have to take care of the shit for 18 years.    Pween, say it ain't so! You didn't seem that way in-person!   I've searched around but not finding much that really helps explain what someone who contacted me is trying to do, at least in a way that I understand.   I am selling my condo and I got a call from an investment company (supposedly at least) saying they were interested in my property. She asked if we were to come to an agreed upon selling price if I would be willing to have them take on the mortgage payments.   I told them I didn't understand what they were trying to do and would need more information, and she said she would arrange for the investor to contact me (I got the investor's name and she works at a local university, so I'm not sure how legit this is if she still holds a "regular" job).   Any idea what this is? Sounds like bad news to me, but I'm not a mortgage expert.    Lol. By "community" I meant Burlington, not Reddit.  I'm gonna just leave this. I don't have the energy nor the desire to help you with your issues.   Wow. How do you think you come across reading your own post?  This is the Internet, even better it's Reddit. Let's not take it too seriously.   As someone who has met Pween, he's a nice guy. Many others would have told the homeless guy to F off, but Pween shared what he had with him. Let's not vilify someone we share a community with for crap on Reddit.    Freelance what?   Helping retailers advertise online? Dealer.com has some openings right now that you might be qualified for.   careers.dealer.com   That's a business plan right there!  Am I the only one old enough to remember that theatre? We called it the "cheap seats" because it was 1 dollar for a ticket, and the head lice were free.    A rotisserie chicken wrapped in a Hannaford plastic bag -- no, it wasn't still in its container.   He was a nice guy.    Damn, why all the down votes for such a nice post?   How you doin'?   #1's stomach photoshoped?   User name is Endif. What's yours?   That's enough from you.    :(  I don't understand why a company would refuse to provide the service someone is paying for. I wish I could just switch.   The answer is a bit personal for Reddit actually.   They don't serve my neighborhood :(   This morning my download speed was .05mb. Congestion, equipment, whatever. The fact that Fairpoint's DSL has been this way for years in parts of Burlington without it being addressed is the issue.   Yeah I heard all of those from the Burlington area Fairpoint "support". I wonder if it's bad in other places.    Right now they've got me. For reasons not in my control I cannot switch. Since they refuse to actually fix the problem I left with trying to call attention to their poor service.   YouTube next with a video of a speed test. Lets see if I can get some of these posts to rank in Google!   a different edit/version of the movie for the Chinese market.   For years Fairpoint DSL has been unacceptably slow, and calling Fairpoint tech support or customer service doesn't actually ever fix the issue. They say restart the modem, yadda yadda yadda, but the speeds never get better.  On one occasion someone said that it's due to equipment on the street and that it would be upgraded, but that was 3 years ago...  Speed Tests (note that the screenshots show they were completed over wifi, so you can ignore the 3g at the top, I was on 3g when taking the screenshots and uploading to imgur since the wifi is useless):  http://i.imgur.com/POTetIi.png  http://i.imgur.com/felkktP.png  http://i.imgur.com/ERw83xn.png  Fairpoint isn't providing a service that they are being paid to.

Speed Tests (note that the screenshots show they were completed over wifi, so you can ignore the 3g at the top, I was on 3g when taking the screenshots and uploading to imgur since the wifi is useless):  http://i.imgur.com/POTetIi.png  http://i.imgur.com/felkktP.png  http://i.imgur.com/ERw83xn.png  Fairpoint isn't providing a service that they are being paid to.   I think it's what allows PC players and Xbox players to play together.    An improvement to the AI would be very nice.    how about and advanced race put us in cages and treat us like sex slaves?  oh the irony that would be!   I'm interested as well!   Almost eryday.    I am anticipating selling it for more than what I paid. I've owned it for 10 years.   Thanks for the advice.   Was a rental, and I don't *think* I was doing any depreciations...guy who does my taxes didn't say anything like that at least.   Rental, no improvements.   I appreciate the attempt to make me smile! Unfortunately this has been a tough one for both of us...neither of us are happy about it but it seems the only thing left.   Thanks, that was informative, I didn't know that.  Unfortunately I haven't lived there at all the past 5 years :( I take it it's all tax then...   Hi all,  I own a condo and am going through a divorce. I have an ok amount of equity in the condo, so what I'd like to do is sell it in order to pay my ex a lump sum which would reduce the amount of alimony I pay per month.  My understanding is if I sell the condo I'll take a big tax hit unless I put that money back into a place to live. Is there some work-around where if you sell property but the money goes to alimony you don't take that hit?  I appreciate any help. train_subject4065   And proud of it.   I'm considering removing the popcorn ceiling in my condo, and it is painted (oil based paint I believe) so I'm very worried.   Can you report back on how this went? What you did? Challenges/solutions? What worked? I'm super worried about what I'm getting into as I don't know how to do shit.      One Hour Photo   That would be the bee's knees.   I feel pretty stupid posting this here, but I need some help and I know there's plenty of local expertise here.  I need help from an accountant ASAP. I am now going through a divorce and need to know the best way to go with finances/alimony. I need info asap as my soon-to-be-ex wants to move quickly. I'm not asking for a hand-out, I'll pay the person, but really need 30-60 minutes of a professionals time as early as possible. Monday or Tuesday afternoon would be ideal.  Thanks, Endif   Ok, who invited this guy?   I drove through Waterbury today. I'll add this to my list and ask for rerun84 :)   Wow thanks for all the suggestions! I have some touring to do :)  This might get down votes, but I'm not even looking for places with local beers, just want to go somewhere new and meet some cool people!  Thanks again!   Hi Vermont Redditors.   I live in burlington and am familiar enough with the bars here, but thought it would be fun to visit some small town bars for a few drinks.   So, any recommendations? Looking for bars with cool and chill people who wouldn't mind chatting with a Burlingtonian.    I remember it and commented on it. I thought it strange that I couldn't find it anymore either.    It's bad Photoshop by the seller.   No, it's Photoshoped (and not my house). The agent took a photo and covered up a bad spot in the floor by cutting/pasting a section of floor from another spot in the house.   I would watch that so hard.    LOL. You sound like one of the many many robots I spoke to. And it was a manager...      Not all the lights on planes blink.   Wish I had seen it.    Your are a gentleman. Thank you for sharing.   Google io starts Wednesday where a new tablet is expected to be announced, at least what until then.    I've been in some very competitive public games.    I wish I recorded the conversation as it was hilariously bad. I purchased a cell phone and 5 days later still no communication from the seller (I've been emailing through ebay asking for updates), so I opened a case and called their "support" department to attempt to move the escalation date up -- since the seller hasn't communicated in 5 days I don't see the point in giving him 7 more days, which the case provides.  Anyway, the conversation with the "Manager" quickly escalated to him telling me "you're new to ebay, you don't know how it works" when I've been a member since 2001. He then berated me for not having much feedback "you only have 6 feedback, you don't know how this works". His tone was very much like bad parenting.  I have to admit I was laughing on the inside, but certainly not going to be using ebay again when you call for help from a non-responsive seller (I used paypal) and they literally make fun of you on the phone.  At the end I recommended customer service training for him, he didn't seem to like that.   They look at the hours you have played, if it's low and it's a competitive game they would rather a bot or take a chance on the next guy.   I understand the frustration, but when in a competitive game someone who doesn't know the specific strategies is almost working for the opposing team.    Yeah, this happened when it was still up.

 I recently had a post that went viral where I showed my St. Bernard the day I got him and exactly two years later.  It's been fun having friends from South Africa to California message me to say they saw the picture on such and such website.  I'm definitely trying to learn lessons on it so that I can use that in the future to promote my startup.  For the time being I haven't been able to connect the dots of how to correlate the success of a post about a St. Bernard to a P2P storage website, but I am sure there is something in there that I can use.   4 to 5 cups a day.  It isn't as much as people think   6'0 225   Luke's a redditor    Or OP purposely changed shirts for this pic...   You forgot who's walking who?

 He looks a lot like [Barsad from The Dark Knight Rises](http://i.imgur.com/Opapm.jpg)      That wasn't him being offended. That was him thinking over the joke you just said. Hence the 'hmm.'  I don't think all religious people are as easily offended as you think they are.   Another person replied to you talking about how Lasers basically sounds like the studio made the album for him. It's because they did. Lupe Fiasco was in a legal battle with Atlantic for about a year or so before they would even let him release Lasers because of their disagreements over what should be on it. Lupe himself has not only admitted, but spoken out on his dislike for Lasers.   I went to a concert of his about a year before Lasers came out, and it was a concert actually promoting the then-expected album. The T-shirts for the tour had something called 'The Lasers Manifesto' written on the back. Look it up if you have the time, because it really is a nice message to see on the back of the shirt other than just the tour dates.  Basically, Lupe hated his own album, and promised his fans that the next one will be what both he and the fans wanted.   And with that, I ask you to listen to his newest album: Food and Liquor II. It'll definitely change your mind on whether he's still an amazing lyricist or not.      Folsom Prison Blues.  *I hear the train a-comin...*            How the fuck do you remember your username.

Let's have a toast for the real terrorists out there: a toast to the conservative talk radio hosts that fill the minds of idiots up with ideologies that every brown skinned turban-wearing citizen in our country is out to destroy our beautiful country. Thank you, again, for setting more people out there to act like dogs on their unjustified hatred for people who don't look, dress, or live the same way they do. They couldn't have done it without your help.   I'll post mine. [J.

I want you guys to post a video that truly hit you to the core; something that made you realize how destructive and scarred people can make the world, or themselves.   OP here. This was posted on Facebook by one of my friends in Jordan. Even he thought this was ridiculous for what he usually sees. I'm a Pakistani-American myself so I tend to see some crazy drivers over there as well.   But this.. uh.   You must be a really cheerful guy in person.  Oh, and the person that shot this picture took it in Jordan. Your shallow comments shouldn't even offend anyone because you obviously have no clue what you're talking about.

You do realize the song is over 8 minutes in length, right..?   Oh hey! Something else I had no earthly clue existed until a Redditor brought attention to it!

TL;DR.   This isn't Twitteritis. Please don't post your daily activitoses here.   www.kanyezone.com   Guys, let's focus on the game here.   This is a bit late, but I'm the guy that originally wrote this picture. The original post is in my username history. Yeah, it's Plano, Texas.   It's like DanielOnFilm said in this thread. Pixar's characters have identity. It's not sound editing, or anything being extra done by the voice cast. The characters are simply written brilliantly.   I'm the other way around because of it. I can't watch any other Tom Hanks movie without thinking about Woody in the middle of Omaha Beach or trying to capture Leonardo DiCaprio.   (Dat mean he luv her moar den 4eva)   JUST STAY OFF THE SET YOU FUCKING PRICK.   Yep, that was my intention. Somewhat of a remake of that storyline. I've given it more of a Middle-Eastern/South Asian influence to replace the Irish influence given in the Scorcese movie.  Thanks!   Thank you! Working on it.      Into the West - Howard Shore and Annie Lennox. I'm pretty sure it's the only song to ever have made me cry.   Out of all the changes that have happened in the time between the release of *Blink-182* and *Neighborhoods*, what was/still is one of the hardest things to deal with personally and professionally for you as a band member and as a friend?   And thank you for giving me the soundtrack to my youth and more than I can say.   Fuck   Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'oon. I hope her family pulls through this with as much ease as possible.

Think nothing Bear pun   I'm 19 now. I've been playing the piano for 11 years. The first couple years or so, I always told people how much I love playing the Plano.

 So saska died at 18 after you had her for years.... Ewww   	1
 We did not. It cut away before the sword lunge.   Noble 6. He's alive. Probably pulled a Randall and has a family.   They are the only ones left? I know they are operational, but really? So many of them too.   I feel like they are being neglected though; my sense of balance is off.    Well, it would help chiefs case as being labeled a traitor. Like, if you'd been through what he'd been through. You'd be more understanding of why he went AWOL and more forgiving.   Right you are. Case closed   That's absolutely incredible.    Put the link back damit   This is pretty accurate.   If this is legit. It only helps my theory that Sully is in Bens side.   He was honestly my favorite spartan. They should figure out a way for a sweet ass return. Like last minute save by mendicant bias or a resident AI. IDFK   I WANT HIM TO BE ALIVE. He will return in glory   Locke is a good guy, and not a bad person. Nightfall sucked. Chief is better though. I see where you're coming from. I'm #teamkurt.    Hey, I like Locke but I'm actually #teamKurt   Mendez even says, "those Spartans sacrificed more than you will ever know"  Double meaning? Yes   This community never ceases to amaze me   Go get the declaration of war and read it. It was a sly attempt to contain Obama's war powers, make a solid plan, and make sure it wouldn't turn into a disaster like the rest of the wars for the last 10 years.  Did you read that article? It clearly states his intentions were to repeal the 2001 Iraq legislation and LIMIT intervention in mid east. It even stated people will only see this as "Rand Paul wants to go to war". Just as you see it, but that's not the case at all.   Like him or hate him, this is Rand Paul's philosophy on war.   I genuinely want him to become a good guy.   Id vote for you.    I guarantee that it's not because of your looks. It almost never is   Igor is that you?   She'll get the letter in a couple years.    Jesus. Now you're just missing Cameron Diaz and Adam Sandler   Link to polls   That's true. There can be tyrants on all levels. But it's isolated and easier to deal with when it is on a local level and less likely to occur.   Its the 25th. Gimme some halo   I'm going to go with the second image being an extreme close up of armor. Maybe the damage on chiefs?  It's also the 25th now. I want it, whatever it is.   Very hot redhead. Not ugly   It's a smaller more localized group better at determining the wishes of its populace than a broad overreaching federal government.     Damn. This is really cool   We need some sleuths on this asap   Look at his webpage. He is states rights on basically all of those issues. He won't introduce national legislation against those things.   He is very carefully worded. www.randpaul.com   Many didn't like it because launch settings were trash. But within the game itself, there were custom tools, forge world and the best forge system yet, plus the title update. It made that game arguably the best playing halo.  Seriously, go back on your 360 and launch Reach. Then head into the MLG playlist. It's easily the best variant of halo gameplay to date. Smooth and full of skill. The game also had some of the best custom games and forge world allowed for players creativity and content to flow. If it had better launch settings, it would have been almost as popular as halo 3.    Yeah. Reach has this weird cult like following. Gets like 25k players regularly   That was really interesting   That was absolutely incredible. After reading the lines from H3 terminals, it just screams the old plan of "humans were forerunners".  So to sum this up a bit more. Humanity is facing:   - Rebellion and dissent within its military and outer colonies  - Flood's possible return. And in heavy numbers  - Jul and Halsey (whom are both hellbent on revenge) have the Janus key and every piece of forerunner tech.   - plus, a fuckton of Promethean knights at their disposal and the manipulative covie religion is on the rise.   - John is AWOL at a time that is arguably **more threatening then the human covie war**. Humanities greatest hero abandoned them when they needed him most.    Elaborating a bit, he added: I was looking back at the old Jon Pertwee/Roger Delgado ones and whats fascinating about that is that they only ever play it as friends. They never, ever play it as enemies at all. Theyre just two gentlemen having fun with each other. The Doctors best friend is a murdering psychopath, thats actually quite fun."  can someone elaborate?   That's amazing.    Fuck. No.   Wouldn't suck if there was more fucking content.   Also we have to kidnap kids and train them there so they grow up to be badass supersoldiers.   I admire your conviction. I agree with you.  How did you come to this thinking? Do you have any law education?    Faked his death so he wouldn't have any commitments to the muggle world.   The first movie ran like a children's film. The rest were sooo much better   This sub isn't for that.   Bro just give him back his brick.    Your comment made me realize that there are so many amazing stories to tell in this universe.   SPRINT YOU SAY!?   You're clearly an Amazon warrior.  I'm on to you.   You sir are a dick   Reddit is always a pretty decent place for these guys to go.    Damn. Right in the feels. Well done   Hm. It would need easy vertical takeoff, fast and maneuverable horizontal movement.   I want something so bad   The only reason I enjoyed Glasslands was because of the continuation of the absurdly stellar *Ghosts of Onyx*  I think it did that well   I'm trying to think of the science. How could it work?   Shhh.   One day. One... day   Am I the only one that likes seeing people's tattoos?   This is what they need to use spartan ops for. Seasonal storylines to explore parts of the universe that can tell amazing stories but don't warrant a game or EU media   I think he's gotten better. Especially with Mr Pokefile on his team. 343 puts little nuggets and easter eggs in trailers so him analyzing can be a good thing.  It just pisses me off when he pronounces mjolnir as "manuer".    I think they favorited it too XD   Hm. Not any of the "man" voices?   Look for speakonia. Has everything   There should be a software pack where you can download a shit load of MS voices and modify them.   Yes. Lots and lots of death   That was amazing. I love you.  Could you make Locke's voice sound a bit different then arby's though?   Is hood the official head of UNSC forces?   I TOOK A MIDNIGHT TRAIN GOIINNN ANY WHERREEE.   I wanted to punch him the whole game. I think I blew him up with a rocket launcher a few times.   9.5/10 damn.    I know. I hope the actual cutscenes look more like blur h2a cutscenes   Same. It's so nonchalant.    Yo stop posing for pictures and help push the jeep..   Overlord Bungie taught us better guys   Wasn't the assembly a bunch of AI's?   Is this described in any existing lore? Books? If so where?   He'd rather jump on everything anyways   Wow. That fit really well   I hope they make the halo 5 cutscenes and make them the way they made H2a. Not like this trailer where it looks like Locke is unnaturally running through concept art.   Whenever I preordered at GameStop. They ask for 5 bucks down and you can cancel anytime and get your money back or add more money to the preorder at anytime. You still get counted as a "preorder" and thus get cool ass bonuses. I've been doing this since I preordered Halo Reach.  Edit: you can even pick up your copy a few days after release.    The spartan IVs are identical to IIs while in armor. So Locke in armor now is the same as a spartan II in 2552.   The good thing about GameStop is that you can cancel and get your money back at any time. And still get cool bonuses.    Omg. If Jon does a new season of arby and Tyne chief. He has to get a Locke figure for the gang.    I really wanted more spartan ops. Just for the story. I hope it's redone and better in h5   Noticed that right away. I was like fuck yeah   Pawn stars was really cool because it was an entertaining way to learn nuggets of history. Whether it be pop culture or americana   That was fucking hilarious   Are you dog zone?   Bro. You forgot to label that weird space in between the phone pillow/awkward blanket, and SO. Looks like a good 1 to 2 feet gap there   I genuinely thought that was babble for a good minute in that.   So you go about your travels in a van?   Thanks Mr skeltetal   The one isn't naked that I can tell. But he has whatever garment he has on pulled down and is feeling his junk.   Yeah, bro you need to avoid the neckbeard look.    Can we get full video for lols   I honestly feel bad for them.   Anyone but EA. unless you want the left half of Hogwarts as preoder DLC.   So this is no longer a debate on the logical legitimacy of him as a GOP candidate. And is now about his political views, opinions, and philosophies. As such we'd be debating and advocating certain policies and the reasoning behind why something should or should not happen.  As much as I could debate and refute everything you're saying, I simply have no time or interest in getting into a long drawn out and useless internet debate about fiscal matters and other opposing viewpoints.    What was her reaction   You just disqualified every candidate running if you think those politifact statements, an opinion on vaccines, and a false statement about a legitimately half right figure on tax fraud to make a point that was still properly made regardless of the money figure (was still around 25%) make him unfit for any office. Then this means nearly every single person holding public office isn't fit for office, or the majority of our past presidents. That simply isn't a realistic and logical dismissal of his ability for office  You could do a quick google search on any public figure and get shit. You could even go in the opposite direction and google good things about him. The fact that you can Google has no bearing on this argument. As a result, none of what you linked can hardly qualify as being disconnected from reality; if that's the case, then most of Washington needs to be thrown in a mental hospital. Nor can you just dismiss his supporters as being simply "enamored"   I don't support some of what he says and I don't think he's the savior of murica (so I'm clearly not enamored) but he's a foot in the door toward the direction we need to go. Change won't happen over night.   Edit: Did you even read that full article you linked me on him? It praises some of his policy decisions and stand points. Specifically on states rights, marijuana, gay marriage, spying and more.    Alright elf lady. Explain    respect among his peers  Really? He specifically goes against establishment republicans for obvious reasons. His goal is to get the party back to it's roots, they aren't going to like him.   What false statements? The man wants to decriminalize MJ, end mass surveillance, stop unnecessary intervention and useless wars, impose congressional term limits and eliminate career politicians. What other candidate wants to do any of that? How is any of that "disconnected from reality"?    The best bet in this election is going to be Rand Paul. He's a foot in the door for more change, especially in the party itself.    I'll put on some more effort. I'd love to explore mexico. But it can be very dangerous down there, as I'm sure you're aware. But these people are more deadly, much more heavily funded, armed to the teeth with top grade military weapons, and smarter then ISIS terrorists, they are the government in many places. The militias are just starting to fight back.  They won't be afraid to behead you for 5 dollars and especially if you look foreign. It gets better the more south you go, but I think traveling through north will prove to be an issue. Good luck.   Marry me   Cartels are bad.    There is a difference between hunting and what she did.   Not even a small one to keep in your pack?  	107
          Damn, you're right. My sources lied.                                                Obviously that's the reason, but I think it's pretty random (if really sweet) for people to thank the drivers for stopping at the crossing. They're just following the rules after all, not doing anyone a favor.                     Hey!

 If you're up early every day, you can park in dorm staff parking lots from 6pm to 7am mon-fri. If not, at least you have weekends.   *ooooooohhhhhhhh...* ew.   Yeah, that. That pisses me off too.   nothing says "freedom" like racial segregation, eh?   Right, but why do people actively write in bold all-caps and use a bunch of weird faces? I feel like Reddit could make more visually appealing content by accident; is it just a pleasure of recognition thing?   Everything about memes, from layout to content to font, seems tailor-made to repel viewers. Do netdwellers simply lack design sense? Is it a 4channy attack on mainstream sensibilities? Why Reddit? Why do we produce and consume ugly things all day?   [pffft.](http://i.imgur.com/71cVY.png)   Huh. I was going to take same quote, but in the service of pointing out the laugh-out-load hypocrisy of this post.   [Hey Jude](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEKgYKpEJ3o) by the Beatles--hear me out now. With the band falling apart and Yoko in the picture, [John always understood the song as a message to him,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Jude#Inspiration_and_writing) and I do think that's there in the [lyrics](http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/799/), whether conscious or not. Both lyrically and musically, it's about evolution--listen closely, the texture changes with every chorus, every verse, every measure of the coda. Emotionally, there's the simple, heart-wrenching background vocals of the verses, progressing to the triumphant finish that never really ends, just keeps progressing until it's inaudible. To me, it's a beautiful expression of love between friends even as they grow apart, and more generally a quite moving appeal to always keep moving.   I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  You coulda done better but I don't mind  You just kinda wasted my precious time  But [don't think twice, it's alright.](http://grooveshark.com/#/s/Don+t+Think+Twice+It+s+Alright/3F4IGC?src=5)   This might be unique to disillusioned Catholics still reeling from built-in guilt, but I think [Mess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJFt8MC1XKo) is phenomenal.   [The Iron   Wine version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5gBt-zpb-w) is also great. The Flaming Lips are great soundsmiths, but Wayne Coyne is also a sort of strangely perfect songwriter, and it really shines though when you strip everything away.   I owned the Baha Men CD.   nice save?   Ctrl+F "dick," glad it was in here once anyway.   I'm not sure what the philosophical question is here, but here're some thoughts:  * You can be attracted or unattracted to whoever you like, but it's probably worth considering where your opinions are coming from before making generalizations. Are you comparing men or women of the same social status? If not, are you factoring non-biological factors into their attractiveness? To what extent does media representation affect your perception of a race? If you see a bunch of pretty women waking down the street together and instantly gravitate to the blonde-haired white one, then that's your attraction and it's fine. If you're simply saying that whites are pretty, then it's worth thinking about how culture has represented white and black to you.  * Economic status is a far more valuable indicator of criminality than race. Black Americans are disproportionately incarcerated because they're disproportionately born into poorer circumstances, and have been throughout American history--that's overwhelmingly how this cyclical capitalism thing shakes out. Add on a history of institutionalized racism in enforcement and sentencing, and you have a set of statistics that says far more about American politics than it does biological race.  * Intelligence is partly genetic, partly social--genetically advantaged children in poor environments are less likely to perform well on intelligence tests then their peers in more privileged environments. This is the case regardless of race, but is again more visible in black communities because of a history of cyclical socioeconomic marginalization.  * Extrapolating any of these social descriptors to make a statement about biology is at best ill-informed; to then fallaciously correlate social generalities with an individual's biology as criteria (sole or otherwise) for employment is ridiculous practically, wrong morally, and racist in every sense of the word.  Regardless, it's preposterously rare that any major decision can best be made based solely on a person's race. Let's leave the definition of racism as it is, and get to know someone before making either descriptive or prescriptive statements about them, eh?   It'd be a little more indicative of poster quality than grand totals over varying membership lengths, and would incentivize more thought for every post. What do y'all think?   Oh, the *verb* fancy. I read this as the adjective fancy like five times, and thought you were pretty weird.   ... yes, and?   this was a response to that one, actually. pushing it I know, but the last line was too enticing to leave hanging.   Read this as ex-juggalos, was thoroughly intrigued.   Yeah 4chan! Protecting the world from... uh, 4chan users...      Just finished listening to this. Nearly justifies the film's existence in itself.   I'm not even a dubstep guy at all, but that was sick.   Impossible? Oh. Well fuck it then, I guess.   Soft science maybe, but it's at least testable, falsifiable, reproducible, all that good stuff. Modern psychology is fucking physics compared to all the old Freudian shit.   Oof. This is where somebody--might as well be me--points out that psychoanalytic academia is a bunch of pseudo-scientific conjecture, and is considered pretty laughable by anyone who takes the scientific study of human thought and behavior seriously. Just something to consider.   I personally think Nietzsche's sex/gender politics were ass-backwards, and see no reason to privilege his opinions on the matter.   Good thoughts. I'd like to clarify that I don't mean abrasive as a negative term, and the fact that it is so far removed from the Top 40 sound--deliberately so, in my opinion--is kind of cool. I call the music stupid because the lyrics are stupid, and that's fine. Sleigh Bells is a dumb pop band, and it's cool because I also like dumb pop music.  I'm only responding to the assertion that hipsters are uniquely qualified to cut through all the dumb stuff and consume art of the finest caliber. No. Hipsters like dumb shit as much as anyone else, they just like anti-popular dumb shit. And that's good and it's wonderful and I love dumb shit, and I even kind of like Sleigh Bells. I'm certainly not hating on Sleigh Bells fans, I'm just saying that the group has more in common with Train than Leonard Cohen.   penis.   That's, uh, not really what the comment was about, but yeah, I'll stand by my assertion that Sleigh Bells makes some dumb music--it's kind of fun I guess, I'll sing along if I'm drunk or something, but the music is inarguably pretty stupid. The abrasive production is a fairly extreme reaction to Top 40 production, so yeah, it speaks to the anti-pop kids and gets shoved into car commercials with all the other melodic indie music, presumably because the songs are vaguely recognizable and the rights are cheaper than John Mayer.  But seriously, that's really not what the comment was about, and it's totally fine that people like Sleigh Bells, and I'm seriously not being condescending because I like a lot of stupid shit myself.  And if you're on my lawn, quit creepin.   Johnny, you wrote a wordy examination of hipsterdom and put brackets in the title. Of course you're a bloody hipster. ;)  Regardless, I'm not saying that people shouldn't listen to and enjoy Sleigh Bells any more than I would discourage someone from listening to U2 or Coldplay: whatever cynicism or commercialism goes into the songcraft, people have real emotional connections to "With or Without You" and "Viva la Vida" and, uh, "Rill Rill." My point is that whatever personal motivations you or anyone else might have, I find that hipster and non-hipster playlists tend to line up along a popularity binary moreso than a binary of authenticity.   The thing is, hipsters aren't even all that good at sniffing out bullshit: they reject massively popular artists not because of finely honed hipster anti-bullshit powers, but because the artists are massively popular. That's where the "I like the early pre-popularity stuff" mentality comes from, and it's why hipsters will latch on to some [seriously stupid shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zXTsmJU6_s) as long as it's radio unfriendly.    Right, because she's totally sane in every other sense.   childish fucks.   This is one of those things that I just try not to think about because  * it's dumb as hell and basically makes fun of itself BUT * someone out there put some effort into it * someone like my mom would probably buy it   Honestly, I see where he's coming from and sort of agree. Try talking to one of those postmodern kids for a few minutes.   Seriously, don't care if I like the group or song or whatever, I report that shit as spam.   ***I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!***   I think I'm confused--what does ownage mean again?   Not just between levels, but within levels. They'd assemble different components separately, portal them together for a sense of how the level plays, then put them in practical space for the finished product.   I nominate comic sans.   Yeah, I definitely agree that that's the in-world explanation for it, but that doesn't stop it from having meaning. Robots offer a neutral third party perspective on human life, so the fact that they see orthodox art as such a shallow thing is definitely a statement. Keep in mind that the game didn't have to engage "art" for any narrative reasons; the fact that they did and that they opened the game with it is significant, in my opinion.   Yeah, definitely. His whole world and persona is pretty out there, obviously, but I give a lot of credit to J.K. Simmons for throwing himself into it and hitting the emotion dead on. [It is a pretty harrowing arc: success, downfall, death--happens to everyone.](/spoiler)   I'm going to get a little pretentious here, but one of my favorite moments in Portal 2 comes early on, as the computerized voice presents a rote painting and classical music as "art." I love that the game opens with this--it's a great caricature of orthodox art appreciation, and it satirically portrays that sort of tradition as shallow, utilitarian nourishment rather than anything transcendent. More importantly, it's an implicit call for better art: if we believe that art *can* be something transcendent, it follows that we're being asked to look beyond the stuffy traditions parodied toward new and more inventive forms of expression. Video games, perhaps.  With that in mind, what are some of your favorite "art" moments in Portal 2? Stuff that hit you emotionally, engaged you intellectually, filled you with frustration, satisfaction, anything. Did you share that moment of harsh surprise when you accidentally destroyed the radio and cut "Exile Vilify" short? Do you take Aperture's history as a satirical depiction of capitalist progress, a mechanism far more successful at perpetuating itself than improving human life? Were you moved by the operatic ending, all the more beautiful for it's absurdity, just like everything is? I'm probably getting a little carried away here, but I do think that the game is deliberately addressing a conversation on what art is in that opening scene, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on if and how it succeeds as a work of art itself.   Yeah, that kind of ruined it.   Nosferatu!   Holy shit homeless. Ultimate confinement vs. ultimate freedom.   I look at that, and I get freaked out about the universe. Like, it's a genuinely disturbing image for me.   If a person is logical, sane and respectful, then they have my admiration. If they are otherwise, then they do not. Extenuating circumstances always exist, but you said you'd be *proud* to see this kind of thing in your child, and I'm disagreeing. If you're a dick, then at best it's understandable. If you're better than that, I applaud you. Simple as that.  Which brings me to the kid being a dick to his grandma. I'm not calling him a holistically shitty person, I'm not asking for his head, I'm just pointing out that he's introducing a little bit of pain into the world for no greater cause than the reinforcement of his own values. That's nothing more or less than self-righteous dickishness, and that's what I'm calling it. Nothing in my morality demands that I sugar-coat that.   I'm not sure that I follow, Antonivs. Are you saying that rational, respectful disagreement is a "fantasy?" Yikes. I happen to know that it happens, because it's my preferred method of engagement with the faithful--if you genuinely don't think it's possible, I encourage you to just try it some time.  As to my alleged hypocrisy, I think I'm being pretty consistent and clear: there are commendable ways of pursuing and perpetuating rational truth, and trolling Granny ain't one of 'em.   If my son or daughter came to me and logically, sanely, respectfully broke away from my beliefs, I could really only be proud of them.  But if my kid is being a self-righteous dick to my religious mom just for giggles--especially when she's just worshipping some loving inclusive God who gives her comfort and whatnot--I have no respect for that and would be sad, yes.   HA! It's funny, because there's a little more sadness in the world now!      witless   I see no evidence of intelligence in this post.   I remember thinking a few things walking out:  * This was funnier than the Hangover. * I didn't really care for the Hangover. * This wasn't very good either. * I liked the idea a lot more than the movie. * It *is* nice to see Craig Robinson getting work, he's funny. * Jesus though, when are we going to be done with the 80s.   *A Clockwork Orange*: Explores the ways in which we're bound by forces both internal and external.  *Memento*: A protagonist with no short term memory tries to make sense of his existence by finding his wife's killer--it's essentially the inner workings of the brain organized externally, and it demonstrates the way his path is set by outside forces.  *The Adjustment Bureau*: the movie has problems, but it addresses your theme pretty head on.     100% yes as a part of the curriculum, 100% no as an alternative to math. That shit's important.   True story.   It's supposedly based on an actual experience some kid in r/atheism had, but its status as a meme and the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/gru0l/to_argue_is_futile/c1pt31x) it's eliciting over there are kinda messed up.   To clarify, I love the context-free fucked up short fiction. Go ahead and skip the early comments.   At least he's just normal crazy, and not bigot crazy.   It definitely is. The wii is capable of playing DVDs through homebrew, they just didn't pay for licencing.   Upvote for the laugh, but I'd just like to point out that sometimes simple art can be the most effective.  I was raised Catholic, and a large part of having faith is pushing the possibility that you might be wrong out of mind. Though I was fond of the song as a teenager, I was afraid on some level that if I fully engaged with Lennon's message--just imagine, just *pretend* for one second that this is really it, and *feel that in earnest and then tell me what's good*--that I wouldn't be able to switch back to believing. Sure enough, that's pretty much what happened; it was a long and complex process obviously, but Imagine was certainly part of it.  I can see how it might seem trite to those who take its principles for granted, but it really is a powerful statement for those who, however intelligent they might be otherwise, really never imagined this stuff.   Hmm.  * Nothing in the definition personhood supports your implication that it is incompatible with individualism. If you're redifining personhood, I invite you to clarify your definition.  * Individuality is not sponsored by society, but is rather a necessary component of our unique individual consciousnesses. The identification with a collective presupposes individual identity, as that is where consciousness occurs. It isn't a binary, it's a spectrum: one's identity is informed by the collective and by the self in varying degrees, but it's preposterous to claim that one can exist without unique individual identity, or that the collective is made of anything other than individuals. * None of your claims support the assertion that individuality cannot be a humanism.  If you feel I misunderstand or misrepresent you, I invite your to clarify further, and to provide any context that might be necessary to support your claims.   If you feel like no one understood you, I invite you clarify your thesis. My brazen mentality can take it, I promise. :)   Nintendo has never been too progressive on pioneering new media. I expect them to use Blu-Ray without licence, call it the Nintendo High-Density Optical Drive or something, and be the last company to transition from physical media.   Every person has some attributes that are uniquely theirs, some attributes that are shared within their culture, and some attributes that are shared across humanity--it's literally impossible to be purely individualist or purely collectivist in the sense that seems to be assumed by this blog. Furthermore, consciousness only occurs in individuals--while we might imagine an outsider looking in at the void and even try to empathize with such a perspective, we do so from within our individual consciousnesses and cannot experience anything else.  I'm an individualist in the sense that I recognize these realities and in that I value difference as enjoyable and necessary for progress. I am a humanist in the sense that I believe unique individuals are capable of empathy and kindness in spite of their differences, and in that I value reason and ethics as means to a widespread public good. How are those terms mutually exclusive?      He's been without a jaw for a couple years now I think.

Use a sheath.      Eleanor Rigby is in the dorian mode. Yes, that is all I wanted to share.   Michigan resident here, and my impression is that it doesn't matter if the video is commercial or not--if it's journalism then you have some leeway, but otherwise you need consent to publish.   If you're not in public and you're publishing it, ordinary people have the right to their own image. For kids, the parents would have to approve the use of their children for the video.  It's certainly not child fucking pornography, and the rhetoric against him is fucking infuriating, and the fact that he can't be near children is fucking ridiculous, but consent should have been acquired for the published use of the children--it's no bigger or smaller a crime than that.   * The laundry in my closet while naked * The stairs to my room on her 21st * My blanket while sitting on my bed  A list of things various friends have pissed and their status while doing so.   In my opinion, the hands-down standout of an already pretty great album.      The description is fine for now, but it'd be nice to see the subreddit have its own identity rather than simply existing counter to r/philosophy. The term "chan-decay" is sort of married to the meme world in itself, and if cogitoergosum is going to have staying power it should lead with its uniquely defining features, whatever they end up being. Also, I still like r/philosophy and think it has a nice balance of humor and depth--I'd rather subscibe to both and see them compliment each other than exist against each other.   This link shows up right under the [comic](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/gmsqb/ratheism_i_will_admit_i_was_a_little_weak_last/) of some guy who really wanted to share that he got laid last night.

If that's not it, are you using two instruments at once, i.e. guitar/vox, keys/vox? if you're signed in on multiple profiles, even just a guest, then that will be one of your band mates, and you'll have to make unique customs for that profile.

I think that our greed for reward and recognition are the origins of seemingly altruistic behavior, but that we're [capable of developing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development) intellectually toward something approximating genuine selflessness.   I wasn't aware of L'Hpital's rule, thanks for introducing me!  My brief research suggests that /= an indeterminate constant, since that equation might express different rates of infinity. That said, I think that for the purposes of Zeno's paradox, we can assume that these infinities progress at a rate equal to whatever ratio we use in our other subdivisions--that doesn't necessarily equal 1, but it will match a constant speed, which speaks to the point I was trying to make. Is that a fair assessment?   I feel like Zeno only accounts for one side of the equation; if you look at it as percentage of time over percentage of distance covered, you can't halve one without halving the other, which maintains the ratio for a constant. Infinity is weird, but if you infinitize the bit on the bottom, it really does add up to a sensible number when you account for the top: /=1   Great work, that's quite professional!   The annoyed/thumbs up dynamic is way more appealing than that rage/troll face shit. Probably a lot more realistic, too.   i was being lazy and didn't bother to track it down, consider your link the authoritative version.

There are a lot of problems here. The film's mythology consists of a lot of silly and arbitrary rules, the script often oscillates between over-explanation and cheese, and the Bureau member characterizations are distractingly inconsistent.  That said, I liked the movie. Matt Damon kills it, the central romance worked for me, and most importantly, the film engages with interesting notions of choice, and ultimately delivers a smart and fairly distinct perspective (thematic spoilers): Usually, we allow our circumstances to define us and keep our choices within a predictable trajectory; "free will" in the classic sense is possible, but requires us to push back against our circumstances pretty damn hard. That's the sort of ambition that I like to see in movies like this, which is why I'm willing to be pretty charitable toward the Adjustment Bureau.  	101

 Until I get deployed it's free. I got 10k for my reenlistment too   I think it's meant to test your mettle. Some will assimilate and do exactly as expected with unrelenting discipline. Others will use lazyness and boredom as motivation to innovate and problem solve.  i think both are useful traits/habits to hone for a soldier.  The military needs disciplined rank and file to unquestioningly obey orders like a cog in a machine and they also need them to strategically adapt in unusual situations to gain a military advantage.   Suddenly my ingrained desire to beat the system comes in handy when our squad is outnumbered on the battlefield and we need a cunning plan to outmanuver an asymmetrical enemy.  I'm basically talking out of my ass as I haven't been deployed yet but I'd be lying if I said polishing my beat the system skills hasn't given me advantages elsewhere in my life   Halfway through we had a pizza party. I saw a dude pay 20 bucks for a second slice of pizza. Money loses all value in a place where you can't spend it. Its like a post apocalyptic world void of fun.    Choo choo?

I regret nothing and just re-enlisted.   9 times out of 10 dude is just going to pop their head in the room, see a bunch of people with something in the arms and moving around, bark an obligatory "hurry up" and then walk on down the hall to do the same thing to the next group.  This won't necessarily work on "clean your barracks" day but works great on "we fucked up and have nothing planned for you to do so look busy cleaning something" day. You'll have a lot more of these at AIT vs Basic.   We had tons of spare time. The schedule was packed but every class was usually 15 minutes doing a task and 6 hours waiting for everyone else to have a turn at it.   Some other tips if you're going to basic:  -1 Sleep on your made bed so you don't have to make it in the morning.  -2 Keep your clean clothes in your dirty laundry bag and put your actual dirty clothes in a sealed trash bag inside the laundry bag as well... the more clean laundry you "appear" to have, the more you have to have neatly folded in your wall locker. I kept one of every clothing article neatly folded in my locker and had the rest crammed neckbeard style in my laundry bag.   Others started doing it too and the drill sgt bitched that   *"we was all nasty asses with our big Santa bags and we needed to wash our clothes"*  they never enforced this though  -3 If you are running or moving quickly noone will ever assume you are idle and will not ask what you're doing or task you to do something.  -4. have a premediditated answer for when someone of s higher rank asks what you are doing. If you ever say "nothing" they'll give you something to do.  -5. If you're put on some bullshit polish-the-ceiling detail, take a broom and other cleaning equipment and break it into smaller pieces. Hand each piece of the broom, mop etc to other privates so everyone has a cleaning item they can instantly begin animating with if a sgt walks in the room. This way when youre just sitting around and someone walks in, you look busy.   I used to call my broom handle my "Greater staff of Sergeant warding"...  it really worked!  Most of the cleaning details you get are over after a specified time... not after its "clean" (spoiler: it never will be!)     Yes    It forced a few people into melee and tank roles but luckily they were pt studs    I'm not sure why there would be demand for it outside prison and the army (only two places i know where conventional fun is outlawed) but sure I guess    I'd have to dig through my old BCT box and see if I still have it but I don't think it was organized or balanced enough to be published.  Would be great to keep in your underground conspiracy bunker though for post apocalyptic entertainment.   I think dice are banned to prevent gambling, not to oppress m'privates   I think I took the "level 1" part of my warrior tasks a little too seriously    They wouldn't have allowed that. It was a basic solar calculator to speed up the algebra.  For example let's say that in the cave there were 20 possible monsters you could randomly encounter.  divide 100 by 20 and give each monster a range... and hit the stop watch twice at random intervals.  This gave me two 0 to 9 numbers...   00 to 04 was monster 1.... 05 to 09 was monster 2... etc  Spell example:   roll 0 to 9  If roll  (enemy evasion modifier) then attack hits and:  Base spell damage * (intellect score / 10) * (enemy resistance) * (armor bonus) * (random number to keep successive attacks adifferent amounts)  For spells there was a base power thst multiplied off your intellect and then multiplied by a random number modifier to make it unpredictable.  I used people's ASVAB test scores for their intellect modifier and had them roll for other caster stats.  I wouldn't let them roll for most of their melee stats either.. I used their actual physical fitness scores.  Pushups were strength, situps were defense and run was speed. I figured this would encourage all of us (including me) to enjoy PT more knowing it would play into our game at night.  *Come on private, 13 more pushups and you'll have enough base melee to one shot Warlock Wilson!*  BCT was a LOT of mind numbing waiting... and my mind wanders more than cockroach at a buffet so I just sat for hours while everyone else's minds rotted and came up with ideas for lore and game mechanics... then during our personal time we played    I got made fun of at first, but by week 3 about 1/3 the platoon was fighting over who won the *Braided Necklace* drop off the *Sand Dragon of Time*  The drill sgts still thought I was the biggest nerd alive but let me do my thing      http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y51z7/im_an_82year_old_lady_who_has_never_been_online/      I'm sorry for making it interesting to read.

My takeaway of the experience is that a spirit is no match for a sound, emotionless mind. They can only harm me by possessing others and I defused that... unless it decided to let me think I won... guess I'll never know   I've been doing it for quite a while in a comedy/magazine format I was thinking of taking the plunge into trying a novel.  My magazine earns about 75 cents per 250 unique visitors. But I only do affiliate marketing with it. Not sure what I'd make doing CPC but I might keep doing affiliate through Amazon.  Adam carolla supports his podcast by telling people to click his amazon link before making a purchase. Costs his fans nothing and lets them give him a cut of all their purchases to support his show.  Basically my writing already earns money in this format but in a limited, niche scope.  I wanted to try my hands at a novel and see how it fared... when people like an author they tend to be very open to supporting them... especially if all they have to do is click a button before buying on amazon at no cost to them.  	23

(inbreeding has some seriously negative effects)   I get what you're trying to say, but a remix is just something that uses the actual work but adds or changes it a little. For a parody, you would have to reproduce the music (thus, the imitation) AND change the lyrics. Neither that nor a parody are abstract concepts, they're pretty clear.  But remixes can be protected under fair use as well, as long as they meet certain government standards, unfortunately, one of the requirements is that it can't be done for profit without permission   No they cannot! That is the goddamn point! You can't sing small portions OR large portions! I'm not spamming, people like you just keep refusing to do any research!

Parody just means a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way.  If they were 'parodies of the other target' then they would be imitating THAT target. Parody doesn't mean 'make fun of' even though it is usually a requirement to achieve effect.  I can reproduce the music and melody but change the words to, for example, "I'm Coming Undone" by Korn to "I'm cumming on Jon" and it would be considered a parody, even though I'm not commenting on the song itself.   Not every parody has to be a Bart Baker video where you literally just trash the artist for the duration of their song   Why do you think they are protected legally?   They aren't 'false claims.'

It's perfectly okay to make fun of another target.   Weird Al for example, I can't think of an instance other than that Nirvana song where his work commented on the original   It should end with a T-Shirt Commerical.  The shirt being advertised says "Gone Grumps"   True, the parody solution is the only viable one they have, even if they just change the last line. (They could re-upload those episodes with the singing parts edited to parody songs, or just censor them out)  I even posted this suggestion a few weeks back and a few morons decided to comment about how evil Maker is for taking the videos down (despite just protecting the channel by doing so) and that anyone can sing covers, yadayada. I deleted it because I didn't feel like debating with a bunch of stupid fucks. (Hardly a debate if it's fact vs opinion) I feel like too often on the subs I have to correct misconceptions a lot of people have over the business side of entertainment.  But man, everything I hear about Australia makes it sound so much better than America   People who hate Suzy and people who don't know how a business functions seem to be so adamant about this.  Everyone else either doesn't care or silently disagrees with the creepy fucks (and trust me, that 'everyone else' is exponentially higher than the vocal minority)   and hopefully the Grumps will unlock him and he'll be a special guest soon (and periodically in the future)   A couple of creepy fucks did a creepy fuck thing to try to prove that Suzy is Super-Hitler or something.  Over something that doesn't even involve Game Grumps.  Seriously, this fanbase... wow...   There is an actual legal problem, it's that singing songs you don't have the rights to is copyright infringement.  http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm  A lot of people here have a misconception about this, thinking it's something covered under fair use, but that would only work if Game Grumps was a review show (and reviewing the song in question)  While youtube's automated "third-party content" detector does suck, they can repeal false claims. But if they get flagged with proof that they infringed on someone's song sitting right square in the middle of the video, it won't go over well for them.  I know it seems unfair and I know you see it everywhere on youtube, but it is illegal to perform cover songs without permission. (And, you'd be surprised to see how many covers have been flagged and now all the ad revenue goes toward the copyright holder)   no you cannot  http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm  edit: Lol, I got downvoted for posting a fact. God, this sub is stupid   You can't sing songs for 10 seconds, 5 seconds, not even 2 seconds (if you can even fit it in that short of a time)  It's copyright infringement and that has the potential to get them flagged, which puts their business in jeopardy.  Just because you see people on youtube doing cover songs does NOT mean it's legal. You also see people post clips of movies they don't own.   http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/2012/03/on-posting-cover-songs-on-youtube-music-licensing-law-explained/  edit: Lol, I got downvoted everywhere that I posted facts. God, this sub is stupid   Why would he leave Game Grumps over something that doesn't involve Game Grumps?   Weird? That's probably the creepiest thing I've ever seen a fan do   So how much is this gonna cost me?   I got pulled over for using the carpool lane...

(not your fault though, people perpetuate these myths so much that it becomes one of those things accepted as "common knowledge" even though it's completely wrong)   You don't need to "see evidence" to understand how a multichannel network functions.  Maker has access to the channel, that doesn't mean they control it.  Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) are entities that affiliate with multiple YouTube channels, often to offer assistance in areas such as product, programming, funding, cross-promotion, partner management, digital rights management, monetization/sales, and/or audience development"  They pulled the videos because those videos were infringing on copyright. If all of those videos got flagged at the same time, and Youtube accepted the claims, the channel would be shut down immediately, considering that it only takes three strikes.  Maker was not acting maliciously, they were protecting the Grumps, even if the Grumps think they should be able to sing random songs.  They still can sing songs as long as they change the words and make fun of them, therefore classifying it as a parody. They'll soon realize that and I'm sure they'll go back an re-edit those videos to include parody versions of the songs they are singing (or at least censor those parts)   Cover songs are NOT covered under fair use!  People HAVE been flagged for this before, it's just extremely rare because most record companies don't care about people just singing a song. (but why risk your business over this? Just don't sing songs)  But yes, it is copyright infringement, regardless if it's considered a cover.  http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm   That doesn't make them in control of the Grumps. It just means they have access to the channel in case of situations like these   I just shat after an hour or two of constipation.  It was like the weight of the world being lifted off my shoulders  Or, more realistically, out of my anus   Best thing I've ever read on Conspiracy Grumps   That's the most common myth people believe, but the truth is, it's infringement regardless of the amount of time.   If you are doing a video that falls under fair use (a review, a critique) then using 30 seconds is protected. Game Grumps is not a review show.  And they would also have to PROVE fair use, it's not automatically assumed.    Ah, the classic "I say something therefore it is true and I will reiterate it as often as possible" technique.  Like I've never seen that technique from a marijuana user.  Marijuana is not healthy. There is no reason it should be illegal, but it is definitely not healthy. It's not terrible, but neither is it healthy.  And science disagrees with what you say science says about weed: www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/marijuana-use-and-its-effects    It wouldn't be via Maker, it would be between themselves (Maker does not control any of the channels that sign with it. Multichannel Networks function like talent agents.) And an NDA wouldn't prevent them from talking about Jon, just behind the scenes details.  Arin explained why they didn't talk about Jon, WAAAAAY long ago and there is nothing sinister behind it:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1j21po/thank_you_all/cbae3uj   Once all that emotion died down it was okay to talk about him again   lol, no. It's not Maker's rules, Maker doesn't own Grumps. It's a simple business decision, don't do anything that might get your video flagged for copyright infringement.  And no, it isn't covered under fair use. You cannot sing or play a song that you do not have the rights to in a video that you are monetizing. Plain and simple.  Arin is smart enough to know that it's best not to risk getting his channel taken down over something as dumb as singing some song.   Though, as long as they parody the song, changing the words/making fun of it, then they have free reign.   EDIT: Lol, why the hell was this downvoted? Because people "disagree?" I'm sorry folks, but that's the sad truth. That doesn't mean you downvote something. Do a small amount of research on copyright infringement, fair use, and the way MCN's function.   lol, okay   lol "unfortunately"   Any Dan moment at all    Danny Sexbang is a character played by Arin Hanson  people forget how good a voice actor he can be   What is a... eeeeeh......

 Lets go darker: caught up in there captivating conversation he misses his flight. Later on sitting at the bar waiting for his new plane there is a news flash, plane explodes mid flight duh duh Duhhh... It was his flight. Final destination 15    That was explained very well. Thanja   Can you pinpoint one life altering decision that you have made. Lets skip the obvious ones of having children and meeting loved ones.    I did this last week. I followed a article on TNation about warming up for max's. I blew my pr for deadlift out of the water but the next day when I did bench I feel way short of what I thought I could do. My recommendation would be to wait at least 3 days between 1rm attempts even between different muscle groups and for ideal recovery only attempt kne lift a week.   After 3 months of 5/3/1 I did my fist 1 rm attempt and deadlifted 405lbs at 230. My starting 1 rm was 365. Next month ill be testing my bench max, hoping to attempt 285.   I saw a Wine-o eating grapes. I told him "you have to wait" - mitch hedberg   He looks like Gerald Ford. Sorry for your loss   This guy is a keeper if you ask me.   Avalanches- since I left you, 70 min of pure gold!   My gym doesn't have wi-fi!   Wipe boogers on the underside of chairs Im sitting on, or if I'm perticularly fitigy ill roll them around between my fingers.   No, not at all and I would know, I'm white.   9/11 conspiracy theories. Just thinking about the idiocy and blatant disregard of fact infuriates me!    Yes! That's it oh man this has plexed me for Years. Thank you. Ill update the thread to solved when i get home. You rock!   Van damme wasn't in robo jox.   I know its not much but i used to see this movie on HBO all the time. it took place in a futuristic wasteland (possibly another planet) and all i remember is this cyborg fucker with a spider body rules over these gladiator type games and the hero has to rescue his chick from them. i know its not much but this shit has driven me crazy for years.    Primer. I was blown away when I saw it and it is still relatively unknown.   Reading all this makes me feel a lot less alone.    Steakandcheese.com was the site of choice In my day.   I had a grand maul seizure during sex. When I was 24 I had a long term girlfriend and was living at home. Well at one point my doctor and I decide to go off my meds to see if its still active. Well during that time of my med me and my GF are having sex and next thing I know I'm hanging off the bed and I've puked up my dinner. Turns out mid bone I went into a full blown seizure. My GF was aware of my condition but never expected this to happen. She was a champ though. The real awkward part was telling my parents how it went down. But hey now I have a cool story.    I use "MyNetDiary" app for everything. I try to log everything best I can but don't fret if I miss something. I tend to over estimate my portions but that will only help. I've had the best results from just counting than any other diet. It just makes me more aware of what and how much I'm consuming.    Yah same here. I got a refund from GJ 2 days ago.    I heard somewhere that 1000 ius for every 25 lbs is recommended. No reference though :/  	23
 How would you handle laning against anyone with a strong all-in like Irelia or Riven? Karthus top feels like a vladimir with no sustain and no escape. And we all know how weak vlad is to all ins.   You're forgetting about the silence. If vlad walks up, he gets silenced, and drained. He will lose that trade every time, it'll just get worse the longer he stays. If he tries pushing fiddle under the tower he will be incredibly low, and with fiddles fear he'll be a sitting duck for ganks.   You haven't played this matchup before I assume? All fiddle has to do is let the wave push slightly, and sit in the wave. Vlad can't get near the wave to afk push it as he will just eat a drain. He can Q the melee minions but that is about it.   BOTRKs % health and attack speed synergizes SO well with Vaynes silver bolts. It also gives her an earlier powerspike + easier build path then infinity edge ADC's, and well as stronger sustain making up for her weaker lane.   Twitch likes BOTRK as it also makes up for his weaker lane like Vayne, but also works well with his assassinations. The movement speed slow, %health, and attack speed lets him sneak up on someone, chunk them down, and expunge for the kill. If he rushed IE he wouldn't be able to stick onto them, nor would he have the attack speed to get his expunge stacks off.   Vladimir is incredibly weak to all-ins early game. Pretty much anyone that can jump on him and stick (Irelia, Xin are good examples) can wreck him and zone him away. He'll be forced to cs with his Q instead of poking you, and if he ever gets in range to Q you, he's convienetly in range to get jumped on and eat a full rotation. On someone like Maokai it's a lot tougher, as you don't have the early damage to really break through his sustain. I'd reccomend just using the bushes the best you can so you don't eat free poke. He's also really vulnerable to ganks, and Maokai is amazing at setting them up, so let him push up a bit and get your jungler to come.  Also, possibly one of the hardest counters in the game is picking fiddlesticks against vlad. Since your drain goes through his pool, and you outsustain him, there is literally nothing he can do.   I'm sure the people who play quinn top are all sociopaths. You have to be soulless to willingly put someone through that torture.   And a lamppost.   As weird as it sounds, I go AP bruiser cho'gath mid and stomp him. Just harass him with your spikes and W whenever he tries to cs. Your passive means he will never outpoke you, and if you play it correctly he should NEVER have kill potential on you. (If he ults you just Q where he will appear, silence him,  auto once or twice then ult. You can push him into his tower so he can't roam, and if he tries anyways you can follow him fairly safely, or just freely take his towers.  In teamfights you can peel him from your carriers pretty easily.   I wouldn't reccomend trying to level 2 cheese a rengar. If he has a ward up and sees you, he can just wait in a bush and kill you as he has one of the best level 2s of all junglers.   She's near impossible to keep down. You can destroy her 0-3 in lane, but she can just roam bot, get a double kill and end the game with 20 kills. She thrives on the disorganization of solo queue.   His Q is treated like a basic attack, so it can crit and applies on hit effects. This means that with an IE, shiv and Triforce you basically have a abilty that has a base damage of 300 + (4.5AD) + 250 (assuming you crit), on a five second cooldown. You can take 90% of a squishes health with that alone.   Of course, there are downsides to this build. Its luck-reliant, you need to crit to do damage. You also have a 3-5 second downtime between Qs where you're basically useless. You also struggle to actually reach the backline if you build full damage, but if you build mostly tank you won't be able to one-shot anyone.   As someone who isn't a double lift fan at all, I hate this circlejerk about him sucking now. He's still a very good adc, just not on Sneaky/Rekkles level.   You can leave the CLG, but the CLG never leaves uou   A nerf hammer. Oh wait, Morello already gave him that. :'(   Wtf 3 halves?   If team fusion makes the LCS, he will be another person who did the same. To be fair though, it looks like he put a lot of money in to jt   Yes. They will just have to beat coast/F5 after that.   That was exactly my point. She is fairly strong early game, but from the first back (when other ADC's get their first major component) until at least two major items she is the weakest adc. Even then, she isn't really stronger then many ADC's in extended fights until around 3 items. (Due to the Q duration nerf)   Trist arguably has the worst mid game of all AD carries. Even when she was FOTM you would see teams building shiv first purely so she could farm her way out of her crap mid game.   No he won one and lost 4. Cloud 9 purposely left him up every game basically left him up every gem they played, since they were confident in countering him. And it worked   These videos are just to show funny, unorthodox builds. Watching Nautilus one-shot someone with their anchor is funny, watching crittlesticks melt people with his autos is funny. And so is seeing voidlings that look like dogs destroy people. It doesn't have to affect the 'viability' of the build.    Well to be fair, that is a fairly accurate description of him. He is a great shotcaller, you cannot deny that. His mechanical skill and individual decision making is also lacking when compared to the top players on the world stage. While it is a bit of a circlejerk, it still rings true.   This was exactly my point. She is extremely safe, is a strong laner, and has good poke, but her drawback is that she has no real steroids ( besides her passive, which is strong in lane, but inconsistent late game) and badly scaling abilities (since her only real damage abilities have long cast times, plus get outdamaged late game by her autos) and are real easy to avoid.   She is a good, safe adc, but compared to Vayne, Kog, Trist, Twitch, or even Jinx late game she just doesn't have the raw damage to be considered a hypercarry.   For nocturne, ghostblade is what I found works best. I usually don't have room for it though, as I go devourer into BOTRK, and by then I need to start building tanky so I don't get blown up.   Cait is a strong pick, but in no way a hypercarry. Basically every single adc, besides Ashe,will out DPS her past early game ( assuming equal gold, which shouldn't be the case if you play Cait correctly)   You don't want to be building too much flat health on soraka, as her heal does %health damage to her.    An item that actually synergizes extremely well with her is the new banner of command. Gives her a little tankyness, some AP, health regen, and a great active ability. It guarantees your team will always have some map pressure on the map. It works well with sieges, or if your team has a splitpusher, throw it in the other lane for extra pressure. And if your team has baron buff, it's basically GG. You get a tanky cannon with high DPS, that outranges towers and is immune to magic damage, and also is getting healed by a soraka. There is 0 counterplay to that.   I thought low priority matchmaking just made you wait longer before you start games?    I've had several games of nasus mid (usually cause of trolls/lane swaps), and it's not *that* bad. Since it's a short lane, it's hard for the enemy laner to freeze it, and if you pick it into certain champions you can pretty much have a farm lane as they can't do enough damage to you. It's not optimal, but  it's not entirely terrible   I Play irelia into him. Play passive until level 3/4, use the bushes and try not to get poked down. then all-in him whenever possible after that. He is incredibly weak to all-ins early on, especially to people with high mobility. If he goes into range to Q you, he should be in range to eat a full rotation and then just keep autoing him until he is forced to pool away. If you reset on to a minion, you can Bladesurge back on to him after he leaves his pool if you want to go for the kill. You need to be hyperaggressive, otherwise he will just keep poking you until he can dive you and you lose the lane.   So basically like Anivia?   If he bombs you, go in on him. He has no other damage at that moment besides weak autos, so you can usually trade him back fairly well. Don't just let him poke you down for free, especially pre-6   A pink ward doesn't stop her from blowing up your carries and still having more health afterwards with her bullshit sustain.   In my opinion, JaxIrelia for the jungle at the moment. He has faster clear, better sustain (due to counterstrike), more consistent ganks, and better tankyness with his ulti, making you stronger mid-game with the lower income. In lane Irelia is the stronger pick however.    Well not even full damage warwick can come close to killing a late game Mundo    When someone is running away when you're jarvan and you nail them with the Demacian flag for the kill.   One game he wasn't. I believe against UOL   Lux is outclassed, but she's not a joke. she's not like urgot, or ashe where your team will flame you for picking them.   Warwick actually wasn't 100% pick or ban at IEM. Cloud nine for example purposely left him open as they had jarvan/lee just snowball the early game while warwick is farming.   Cherrypicking at it's finest. Technically true, but still sounds like BS without context.   I agree mostly with irelia, except for you can't just fight blindly in the early levels. You can E-Auto to harass during level 1, but almost any top laner with beat you if you go aggressive at level 2-3. Level 4 on you're mostly in the clear however   There was a game once that I was a massively fed Jax, and I tried fighting a Trundle in his own jungle. He was a full item down on me in my build, and he still completely decimated me.    I personally love playing Shyvana against him. You can bully him hard  for a large part of the game due to your mixed and %health damage. While you don't scale as hard as him, you still become a monster tank that has a strong teamfight, and can stop his splitpush. (You won't 1v1 him, but you can waveclear well and he can't tank a tower with you beating on him as well)   Soraka is in a good place right now, she saw a bunch of competitive play in the last few weeks. She absolutely destroys any assassins now as she has an AOE silence that turns into a snare. Her heal is really strong, if she didn't have a health cost it would be insanely broken. Her Q is now a skillshot, that heals her, so she can sustain back most of the health costs if she can hit it consistently   I have seen literally 0 flaming for UOL. It's all been positive from what I saw.   Implying that what sneaky and lemon have isn't love   Now ddosing on the other hand...   I wouldn't say all bruisers are useless, Irelia is the textbook definition of a bruiser, and she's a contested pick. Gnar is arguably a bruiser, and he's pick/ban right now. Pantheon is also quite strong at the moment. Xin/Wukong have also had success recently in the IEMs. And these are just the competitively viable picks. Solo queue has even more viable bruisers.   Ryze is also a terrible matchup for Shyvana. There's not much you can do as he scales just as hard as you. In my opinion, just don't play Shyvana right now unless you are very good with her. She got nerfed too hard, and doesn't really have many favourable matchups that are common in the meta. Plus tanks such as Maokai both outdamage, out utility, and out tank her right now.   I actually meant to say Trundle there instead of Tryndamere. I guess the fact that they're both splitpushers that begin with Tr messed me up haha. But yes, I agree with you on both points. Whenever I personally end up splitpushing as irelia, I find that it's fairly easy to manage your ult cooldown to both push waves and still have it for duels. Especially with the CDR from frozen heart and spirit visage.   If you can manage your Q and your ult cooldown correctly, irelia actually has fairly good waveclear compared to splitpushers such as Jax or Trynd.   Learn your matchups + powerspikes. 90% of being successful at top lane is knowing when you're strong enough to fight the enemy, and knowing when you're not.    I find lux to be more of a mid game champion. Her cooldowns are just too high, ratios are comparably low, and she is too reliant on having to hit every single spell to burst a champion for late game teamfights,   I consider OP to be a champion that lacks any meaningful weaknesses, or have their strengths vastly outweigh their weaknesses. For example, Warwick truly has no real weaknesses at the moment, while post-'rework' Lucian's insane mobility made his lack of a range not matter at all.   It's also great for tower diving, especially on your roams. Quite often I'll ult over tribush to get a double kill on bot, then flash back out to escape turret aggro.   The problem with Cho right now is that he has absolutely insane damage. He has large base damages, and stupidly high ratios. If his skills were easier to hit, you could build AP bruiser and delete squishies while chunking the rest of the enemy team, while also being tanky as hell with your feast stacks. Even right now, a fed Cho'gath is terrifying.   Fucking  Evil  Annoying  Rattata  Was what I always heard it was.   Yeah, it's cold enough outside for it. Playing hockey on an outdoor rink is like 95% of all Canadians childhood.    Maknoon plays a fair amount of kass top. He's also a very entertaining streamer to watch as well.   Kassadin is now manaless   He's insanely broken at the moment, sitting on over a 60% win rate last time I checked. What happened is that they remade the jungle, and it hurts like crazy now. Warwicks sustain let's him farm much faster then the other champions as he doesn't have to go back to heal. What really pushed him over the edge though was the new jungle items. There is an item that gives him around 33 true damage + 40 magic damage on hit at level 7. With his ult proccing on-hit effects he can literally 100-0 any squishies and many tanks. What's even worse is that the true damage scales with levels and the magic damage scales with kills/assists/large monster kills. So he just gets stronger as the game goes on.   Until he gets builds 3 items and one-shots your adc with a critplank Q   They're buffing him next patch. Lowering his E cooldown and increasing his ult armor + MR scaling   Champions that can build one or two damage items, and then go tank. They have a mix of strong damage, decent CC, and natural tankyness. Irelia/Jax are considered by most to be the epitome of what a 'bruiser' is   Cassiopeia. If you can't effectively use her combos you're basically useless. Other difficult champions like Zed or Syndra might be hard to play to their full potential, but even if you can't hit a 3 shruiken ult, or stun from the fog of war, you can still usually make a decent impact on the game.   Nasus was worse   The new jungle deals tons of damage, so sustain junglers have a huge advantage. Also, a new jungle item (that you can afford by around level 6-7) gives you a large amount of true damage on hit + a feral flare like ability that starts at 40 stacks. This item literally let's warwick one-shot squishies even time his ult is up. I'm not exaggerating at all, you can walk into lane, have a full health enemy under tower, smite+ult+Q him, and walk away with a free 350 gold. You don't even need your laner to help. He's stupidly broken   No need to apologize. You did your best.   Twitch chat was absolutely hilarious this game as well.    Now watch final five upset their way to the LCS.   This just solidified it. I am 100% a fusion fan now.   Surprise Party fiddlesticks.   I'm sort of curious, what's your opinion on AP sona? (Assuming she gets a sightstone of course) The AP gives her amazing damage, plus all of her utility scales off of it. I usually hate ap nid/annie "supports", but I love a good sona. IMO she does better as that then a standard support build.   Most people don't have a problem with shot-calling mid laners. Look at Hai for an example. He isn't a super strong mid laner, (In comparison to the top ones) but his excellent shot calling makes him still shine   To be fair, a 6 item Jax shreds anything not named Nasus or Warwick.   And Bubba :(   I sincerely doubt that. On the vast majority of junglers you have to base either before or after you get the second buff.   It's incredibly powerful. I bought it on jungle jax, by late game I was doing 150+ magic damage on hit with it, an item that costs only 2250 gold, gives 50% attack speed, and gives you plenty of utility.   The main problem with Runaans as an ADC is that you should never be close enough to more then one enemy to be able to use the passive. Also, pure attack speed isn't as effective as attack speed + crit chance when it comes to DPS. It's not a terrible item, especially on ADC's such a Varus, just there are stronger options.   Same here in bronze. People are actually warding dragon and contesting it too! All you hear is people saying "get drag it's OP now"   I have played with a grand total of 1 katarina supports in all of my games of league, and she hard carried us. I have not judged strange supports since that day.   The new ohmwrecker is apparently a really good item for nasus to rush. It gives him tankyness, CDR (both of which are vital on him), and two amazing passives for his lane. Since he'll be sitting near tower for the most of lane, the movement speed near turrets is useful, especially to avoid dives. The turret disabling active lets him splitpush/backdoor/dive even better then he was able to before.   That's completely your fault for not reading the patch notes then. Even long ones like this patch can be read while you're waiting in queue/champ select.   It's actually crazy. He was 100% pick or ban at worlds, and a patch later during the expansion tournament he hasn't been picked once. All because of one auto attack on his W.   Don't get me wrong, Leona jungle is a blast to play. I was just saying that in my experience playing Leona jungle that there are better options out there. If you have had success with her, go ahead and play her. I actually enjoy seeing non-meta picks (Ive personally had success with adc ahri before. The kiting is real)   Nautilus just outclasses her in every way in the jungle. He has faster clears, an escape (which they'll need as they are both terrible duelists), and more sustain. Leona might have slightly better ganks, but Nautilus is still one of the best gankers in the game. You can still roam as Leona support and gank, while having a jungler that won't just have to end up conceding their entire jungle to the enemy Lee or Kha.   She used to have much higher base damage, and lower ratios. Riot changed them to make her more viable mid and less viable as a support. She also had a longer stun at early levels.   I just watched this a few weeks ago, and I found it really boring and not up to the hype. It was literally CLG sitting behind a turret for over 30 minutes while Moscow Five was like "I wonder if Anivia will wave clear this wave too?" They were 20K gold up, they could have easily dived them and came out ahead, or splitpushed. Anivia can only clear one turret at once. Instead they just played ARAM and let CLG get to six items, where gold leads don't matter.    That would be amazing!   Nah I was a top lane irelia against a darius. So while I didn't feed, I wasn't very fed due to the fact I had to lane against a darius, with me having 0 jungle pressure.   No. He was on my team, and had a super high amount of both kills and deaths. He would walk into a fight, delete someone, and promptly get deleted himself. I wouldn't blame him for losing the game, they had a super fed tristana which carried them.   I'm in bronze and I just recently played a with jungle udyr who rushed double infinity edges into a shiv. He was almost completed what I believe to be a bloodthirster before the game ended. He didn't even have a jungle item.   I personally prefer Teleport, as it makes tougher lanes much easier. It also gives you so much map pressure, as if they have an open inhibitor they always have to worry about the jax backdoor. Ignite does give you more kill pressure, especially at level 1/2, but I find that it's both easier and safer just to farm safely, and have a huge advantage late game with teleport.   You usually don't first pick him, as after all these nerfs he has a weak laning phase against many champions (like gnar). If you're comfortable on him you can still play him into everything, but your goal is just to survive lane and outscale. Jax works best now as a counter pick against champions like Fiora, Tryndamere, Irelia, that he can push around a bit in lane as well as outscale. Also a helpful tip is to go for a level 1-2 cheese. You activate counterstrike while your both in his minion wave and just start auto attacking him, you should be able to get 3-4 auto attacks in for free, plus another 100 damage from counter strike. This should put them dangerously low and let you take lane dominance from level 1.    I find irelia works. If he stands anywhere near a low health minion from level 4 on, you can basically blow a flash or get a kill every time. You just do too much damage for him to fight with in his squishy mini form, and if he hops away you can just Q back on to him. If you can get a kill on him, you can snowball the lane super hard against him.   To be fair, Irelia vs any squishy ranged top laner is a slaughter. The only exception is a good quinn.   Pretty much anything that isn't full AD works on cho'gath. He scales so well with basically every stat in the game. Your build seems to work, so keep with it if you're doing well.   Easy one of the most satisfying things to do in game is to Q an entire wave as irelia.   Odds are that you won't need the MR blues that much in lane. Unless your facing against a sona or karma, the majority of the poke against you will be auto attacks anyways. The extra attack speed helps you with your last hitting, gives you a very slight advantage in an all-in, and scales better into late game.   Apparently Warwick is god-tier right now. His sustain is so useful in the new jungle, and the new devourer enchantment (40 magic damage flare), plus the true damage on-hit smite literally let's him 100-0 champions at level 6. There's a few videos going around, and it is completely ridiculous. You just walk up to a champion, smite him, ult and collect your free 400 gold   Singed is her #1 counter, he's too tanky to burst and does too much damage to outduel. Jax can completely negate her ult with counterstrike, and outscales her like crazy. Kayle can bully her, kite her, ignore her ult, and outscales her too.   Critplank. The damage is insane. A 300+(4.5AD)+250 damage spell on a 5 second cooldown (before CDR)  	101

Here is the link to the edit if anyone is interested:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJJqYoMxG7o       I bought the Blu Rays and used two programs: "Make MKV" and "Handbrake"   well, according to several posters on the Originaltrilogy.com fanedit forums, this one is up there.  However, The Phantom Edit seems to be one of the more well regarded.  I think it will depend on how closely you want the edit to stick to the unedited films.       Will do.  I just want to know how some of the other full length edits on YouTube get so many views.   It may also depend on the rights holders to the music you are using. Some may be less merciful than others    I believe that you may need to make a separate plain old youtuber account. I think that YouTube will take them down if they have the possibility of being monetized by the uploader, which you can't do with a base account.  That was my thought process,at least. You should still be able to upload the long videos.  YouTube is pretty mysterious to me though.    What kind of account are you using?   	12

 it costs like 20 bucks   it's actually extremely healthy and extremely helpful for recovery/reenergizing your body   It's actually incredibly useful for recovery and energy. Have a place like that in my town, used it before and after every game last year. It's insane how much spring you get in your step   Ive said it before, I'll say it again: Mike Miller is going to be huge these first two games. He'll spread the floor offensively and he can guard Mirotic or Dunleavy. I know his shot has been off when he's played this season, but he is a playoff performer. Look out for MikeMillMadeIt come Monday   Am a white kid from Texas who didn't have the daddy money to buy a car with. Can confirm. Nobody actually cared about anything if it didnt have to do with them. The reason I listen to the kind of rap that actually says something about life is bc i have no clue what that life is like. I actually wrote a paper about it this semester, and I just basically like seeing life from different perspectives and trying to understand from a distance what people are going through bc i have no idea what that life is like.  Anyway, I'd like to apologize for the jackasses who didnt give a shit. All us white kids aren't like that, I promise.    Bless you   Thank you! :D   must be   I thought it was clever. I'm sorry, reddit :'(   http://imgur.com/33e5gfR   This brought a tear to my eye. Thanks, Kev.    *hole   I dont want this theory to hinge on Bruce pulling something Batman-ish out of his ass. I think Nolan showed Selina Kyle in that scene just to mess with the audience and make us question everything we just saw, exactly like the end of Inception. I just find it extremely hard to believe that Bruce either got the bomb out far enough from the city and somehow escaped the blast radius himself in that small amount of time, or used the auto pilot to take the bomb out which would mean that everything we see of him in the aircraft is fake. Just doesnt make sense. Makes a lot more sense for him to sacrifice himself to protect the city he has dedicated his life to protect and for Nolan to throw Bruce and Selina in that last scene just to fuck with us. For me, that was Alfred seeing what he always wished he would see every time he went there. Completely in his head.    No, the ship was not put in autopilot. It simply said the auto pilot had been fixed.    That Bruce Wayne is alive and Alfred actually saw him at the restaurant in Paris. Bruce Wayne died. He sacrificed himself for the city, as it was always intended. What Alfred saw is what he always hoped to see when he went there. That's what that scene meant. He was, once again, seeing what he wanted. But Bruce died. Period.    I just hope he has to deal with that disgustingly thin "goatee" for the rest of his life. talk about shame   Always imagine this track playing behind a video of like slow-mo phantom cam nba highlights. The beat just reminds of somethin like that. cant explain why   No. Just saying that he has the ability to defend guys like mirotic, as i said, and spread the floor offensively for Kyrie and Lebron. It's really not that hard of a concept to grasp   Ocean's 11, 12, and 13. But mostly 11   Guarantee Miles Teller will win one. He's going to develop into a phenomenal actor   YES. AGREED. THANK YOU   Iman Shumpert is expected to play well. Mike Miller isn't. Therefore, him playing well is the unexpected X factor.    I promise I'm not! Just watch. He'll come up big in this next series   Mike Miller is the X factor in our playoff run from here on out. I saw it in Miami, I see it now. If he can hit 3's like he has in playoffs of old and if he can defend like he has in the past, he's a game changer. He is a guy who has been through it all before with Lebron and knows where he needs to be at critical points in a game. He's 6 foot 8 so he can guard some 4's who tend to stay outside (mirotic, for example) and he can rebound the ball too. If Blatt actually plays him, he can genuinely affect games.    Why can I only see the To Pimp A Butterfly album cover when I look at pictures of these protests?   More optimistic about our chances in the East? Absolutely! At winning a title? Not so much. If Kevin indeed tore his labrum and has tendon damage, he might not be back at all. Especially since he would be banging that shoulder in the post all game. and ESPECIALLY since he can be a free agent. I just don't know if we can beat, say the warriors, without him. If he can play (and chooses to) i 100% think we can win it all. but he has to play   We can beat either team without Kevin. Neither team is playing well and both have weak points. Guys, I'm excited   Heat beat the post-heavy Pacers without Bosh. Cavs can win without Love. Gonna be tough and it'll take everything Lebron and Kyrie have, but it can be done   Didn't he sign like a 6 movie deal? Cap 3 would be number 5...   Mike Mill is gettin pt this series. Lebron knows who he is in the playoffs (game 5 in '12, 7 3's, shoeless 3 against the spurs) and he's is gonna make sure he plays. The only issue i see is our starting lineup. we have to match pau and noah so tt and moz have to start. cant spread the floor with that. so we have to wait for the bulls to put a smaller guy in before we can have a lineup that suits our strengths. in other words, we cant make the first move. we'll be adjusting to what they do instead of the other way around. still think we got em tho   Hopefully Leron doesn't throw up clankers for 3 quarters before he realizes he can just drive past anybody and score. But if anyone can get it done, it's Lebron and Kyrie   Yeah Kevins mad. He's playing as soon as possible. and losing JR isn't going to be huge for however many games it ends up being. I think we'll see a lot of Mike Miller next series and a lot more post up Lebron. I'm not worried about this series honestly because we have all the pieces to win. If guys like James Jones, Mike Miller, Kyrie, And Shump all hit shots, we'll be fine. Plus, I don't trust DRose to do anything   Hahahah yo that's hilarious. That's how it was for that Heat team against the Hawks too. But yeah, things are different now. Winning this next series with injuries and suspensions will just cement his legacy tho   basketball reference.com. literally showed it on screen during the game. in the NBA, when a dislocated shoulder is listed as the cause of injury to a player, the average number of games missed is 27 games. However, I am not saying Kevin will be out for 27 games. I am saying that, on average, that's how many games are missed by players during the regular season. and yes, if there's no ligament or tendon damage then of course it wont be that long.    Average games missed by NBA players with same injury: 27 games.    This is the dumbest comment in this whole thread.    this is fucking atrocious   agreed   bend him over a table   james jones is fucking terrible today. get him out of the damn game   you clearly didnt watch him the past 5 years. Especially last year in memphis. dude locked people down for long stretches of games. and again, you clearly dont know mike miller. he could shoot 0 for 500 in the regular season and come into a playoff game and go 7 for 7. he is a big game, big shot maker   MIKE MILLER AND SHAWN MARION NEED TO BE PLAYING IN THIS GAME. MIKE IS A 3 AND D GUY AND MATRIX IS A SLASHER/POST UP GUY EHO DEFENDS AND REBOUNDS. I DONT UNDERSTAND   This game is hard to watch at best. So much settling and stupid shots and isolations and bad defense and fouls and im sad now      Surgeon was like http://imgur.com/gZu0LPL   This man is wearing jeans. Walter Hartwell White wore khaki pants. I am not convinced   hahaha this is gold.    Still no. Just because they are boobs, doesn't mean the person with them is attractive.    THANK YOU. She is supposed to be the most unattainable woman on the planet for the nerdy kid. That's what makes it so awesome when he wins her over. COME ON PEOPLE.    Woah there bud. Lets take a chill pill. With a little research, you too can find the pictures of him on set actively filming a scene in his costume and make up without a big ass tattoo on his forehead! Woohoo! The internet is awesome! In the words of Walter White, "Fuck you, and your eyebrows!" ass.    Yes! I feel the same way! I loved the original ones at the time but upon comparison I thought Garfield was just more spiderman like   Let me clarify, the acting wasn't bad. But Spiderman wasn't convincing. Like somebody said farther down the comments, Tobey was a better Peter Parker but the Garfield guy was a better spiderman. I just didnt like the spiderman depicted   Exactly   Yes, she wasn't hot. Just cause she's soaked and her tits are showing doesn't make her hot. MJ is supposed to be an unattainable level of hotness. She, clearly, is not.    Jerry Maguire: Miles Teller as Jerry Emma Stone as Dorothy Anthony Mackie as Rod Margot Robbie as Avery Channing Tatum as Cushman Tom Hiddleston as Bob Sugar    Holy shit. Why is this not a movie yet   He doesnt have the tats in the movie. that was just for the promo pic   "How many.. of your friends... have I killed?" "Would you like to know.. which of them were cowards?"   Fight Club. Like, it was okay. I guess when it was released it was probably a big twist-at-the-end thing people hadnt really seen before (speculation cause i have no clue. im 19) but I just didn't get the hype.    I thought Garfields version was much more Spiderman-like than Tobey's.    Acting was bad. MJ wasn't hot. Only thing good about it was the villain.   Let the roasting commence.    Yeah thats cool, but how is that end result achieved?   HAHAHAHAH AMERICAN PSYCHO!!! PATRICK BATEMAN IN THE FLESH!! HE HACKS HIS FACE IN WITH AN AXE TO "IN THE AIR TONIGHT" SHORTLY AFTER   A Few Good Men and Jerry Maguire are his two favorite. Pretty much slips a line from each one into conversation every day. I also love those movies, probably because of him   Azizi Gibson, anybody have any good stuff? I know Claustrophobia and Backward Books, but that's it. Really feelin the beats to those two   I encourage all daughters to kiss they mothers, with those lips that all that lipstick covers, you're never too grown up to miss and hug her   Yo, this is Drakes song. Not a verse from Ross's song. He put his out way earlier and Ross asked for it   Exactly what I was thinking. Dude always looks so pissed off at those people.    Well, correct me if I'm misinformed, but I believe a clock operator is the guy who operates the damn clock so fuck you and your sarcasm, dumb idiot.   Archer voice, obviously   Selfie. bae. thats all      rekt   But how?   Confirmed.

I WANNA KNOW HOW HE GOT THE SCARS   thanks fam   Hey can somebody post the post game interviews for those of us in a college dorm with no NBA TV......   He said "I packed it" one time too haha   HAHAHAH HYPE TRAIN   Read that in Dave Francos voice from neighbors when he's doin that impression with jigsy cat   Holy fuck. That was incredible. That's gonna be an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp performance   LoL   Anybody know when some new Drake is coming out? Seems like pretty soon would be a good time since he is trying to recover from the bad reviews he got about his Coachella sets.

Been playin like hes been to 4 straight finals and is tired or something.....   I think that half showed how important JR making shots is for our offense. If he isn't hitting, our spacing is bad and we go iso and settle for stupid shots way too much.     Lead at the half.  upvotes for everybody   well fuck me. im too filled with rage to realize we said the same thing. apologies fam   he looks lost   No, he's either settling or too passive. He's driving to pass, not to score. which is infuriating.    oh god. she's younger than me. oh god oh god oh god. does this mean i have a chance?!???

                                           I know this is way out into the future, but once the Gen 3 is out and into the world, what's next on Tesla's plate? There are rumors they might revive the Roadster.. any other rumblings out there?   Yet he's still smart enough to give the finger while using the stolen phone         it would have been season 3 i believe, the one with tito and shamrock                                 All hail R/Soccer... where highlights go up faster than on ESPN   3 times a year isn't ludicrous :-p   Not Jones specifically, but as an example since he's the LHW champ. Cain Velasquez last fought 3 times back in 2009. Come on UFC!   I mean from a fan perspective. The UFC wants to build stars yet we only see the champs twice a year at the most it seems.   The UFC seems to like its champs to fight two times a year. The last time Anderson Silva fought 3 times in one year was in 2008. Frustrating that the UFC keeps its best stars "less busy" while during their prime   New meaning to the phrase "double header"         Wow, I thought that quote was Griffin being sarcastic... apparently not      Not a surprise. I put out a text post saying how "blah" the UFC 174 card was and got downvoted into oblivion. The fact is that the UFC needs more compelling stars. Old stars returning (arlovski) doesn't cut it. There are far too many UFC shows to keep track of these days and dillution is a real problem.  More problematic is that the more of these ho-hum cards we have, the more the UFC's reputation will suffer. 3 ho-hum cards in a row, hypothetically speaking, makes ordering the next UFC PPV (even if it seems great) a little bit tougher.  The UFC seems so dead set on worldwide expansion that they're losing focus of what got them to the promised land in the first place. Also, how often do we hear fighters talking about wanting to fight more? The UFC needs to get borderline top guys like Luke Rockhold more fights. I just saw him on UFC tonight the other day and he wants to fight ASAp, but he may not even get a fight lined up till September.         there's an imp difference b/n scratch and shatter resistant. With a sapphire display, it would be nearly unscratchable. How shatter resistant remains unclear                      Is it just me or the UFC starting to unravel without any clear business plan and a slew of meh' ppvs .. dilution is the anti solution!            At this point stacked/intriguing cards are the exception and not the rule. Dillution is getting ridiculous with the UFC not doing enough to build up any new star power               wasn't there a similar gif from a different"fight" that ciruclated not too long ago?         There's no photo of a menu bar without the apple.. seems like idle speculation based on alleged conversations with developers ??               Wow Greg Jackson was young once?            Meanwhile, he's making no $. Horrible businessman               yes   definitely.. can finally see which apps are the culprits                                             Hot damn, that's amazing      who would u have him fight next as a test? I mean, that's why the condit fight was gonna be a good test.. shame it got cancelled   Fair, but he's been FINISHING folks.   Josh koschek and dan hardy come to mind      Lame linkbait         Musk said the company is working hard to make sure they are useful and not just a gimmick.. Is the public ready for such a drastic change in doors?                        Will this downward trend continue tmrw?               Isn't this the same video footage and audio from the megafactories episode, only with a Wired pre-roll?      why is this being downvoted?!                        Don't think so. As more information comes to light, the worse is gets                  Jordan typically never takes a stand on anything. This is rather significant. Props to MJ for stepping up      Jones said he respects Teixeira but sure did taunt him during the last 30 seconds                              Most stacked card in UFC history, eh Dana?

    Sure thing. I've edited the post. Thanks!   Definitely agree with the second sentence. That's why most GoT fans love his character I think. Come to think of it, I don't know anyone who hates, or even dislikes, Tyrion.   Yeah. I think my friends watched it because of the ratings, too. Looking forward to your thoughts about the movie.   Great! Enjoy your trip!   Depends on the site/client.   The Blog Herald is looking for an experienced blogger.

Living in this city, the movie was quite an eye-opener. Directed by Sean Ellis, the movie won quite a number of international awards. Anyone else seen it?   P.S. Highly recommended.   Good one. I actually imagined him to look really bad as I read the book. The HBO version is nothing compared to GRRM's description.   Yup. I don't see it either.      I'm with you on Ned Stark. I still can't forget my shock when I read the part he died. Up to that point, I had always believed that his honor would keep him alive. GRRM = Santa Killer in this case. I've learned since then, of course.   LOL. Exactly. He's distracted enough with writing prefaces/endorsing other books!      Got a point there - [Facebook's algo took the number of likes into consideration](http://time.com/3647800/facebook-apologizes-year-review-post-pain/) for the year in review results, so this photo probably got tons of likes for the OP's good deed.    Maybe if you ask nicely, he'll let you ride his sky bison.   Seems like unsecure Wi-Fi; but heck, does it really matter? Just the thought of having a Sting you can wave around waiting for it to glow lightens one's mood.   That might very well be one of the factors.

And love the term flawsitively perfect (although I may be the only one who hasn't heard of it...)         Next comes SpriteGate.   Did you see that ludicrous display...?      Nailed it.   Justified for once!   Woohoo! Old is as old does!   :(   Good for you! (Says envious me.)   Can't really blame the guy, can you?   That is beyond awesome. What are you planning to drink (in it?)?      Gross. But when you gotta go, you gotta go?   Might just try the hilarious ones, then.   I have to say that it is my favorite episode. And the way the 9th just uttered that sentence - it made me feel happy that I teared up. Yeah, something the 9th probably wouldn't do, but it does show just how much the Doctor cares.   Same here. If I had it!   Awesome. Now I'll have a new set of coasters to add to my measly collection.      What is more amazing then a moment spent hugging your child?  Or watching him laugh with all his heart in a way only children can.  Or a touch and a smile from your spouse that says more than words ever could?  Or an intimate moment shared that no one else will ever know about.  There is so much beauty in each moment and there will never be another exactly like it.  Its those things that are most rare that have the most value, and there are only so many moments that we get.  Choose to believe that you cant waste time with your spouse, because no moment with them can be a waste.  There is value in every second together.  My mom passed away from gastric cancer a month ago after almost a year-long battle, which was terrible on all of us. Your story makes me sad and happy at the same time.

I actually use Waze as my default, and Apple Maps as a secondary app. But yes, it has come a long way.      Yeah because Chun Li is all about ice.   LMAO. Good one.   Now there's a thought. I hated the [MacGyver special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym65fYMu5Gs) because...MacGyver!   That bouquet is the best I've ever seen!    I know, right? I just wish...   This kind of application is what makes tech like 3D printing awesome. In other news, did you hear about this [vet who used LEGO to help a turtle with leg problems](http://geeksupply.co/vet-uses-lego-disabled-tortoise/)?      Funny.

(Probably because I have a dog named Summer)      So say we all.    this one  That cracked me up, too.   For brainstorming and research, I always have Evernote to save online resources, articles, topic ideas, and outline ideas.

 None of those reasons make it a terrorist attack.   Ok, the gun by itself is not banned or illegal just the act of the transaction between the father and son because of his previous felony charge.   It still would not matter because not only was the straw purchase done (illegal). Stealing the gun from the mother (illegal). Walking inside a Church in SC with a gun (illegal). No law or policy would have prevented the shooter to commit the act. In order for laws to work, criminals must follow them.    After all, if they don't cover something when you're asleep, then how could their coverage be "24-7 since early in the morning yesterday"?  Replay. Happens all the time.   If they can provide coverage for hours as soon as the event begins for a missing plane  The news broke during the day and so its easier and you have more time to tell people to stay in longer, make calls, cancel programming, and organize the rest of the news programming later in the day.    It has been 24/7 since early in the morning yesterday. The shooting took place at 9pm the night before. You know it sounds crazy, but people sleep at night and have scheduled hours to come in to work.  	4

 Click the tag; it saves the URL from when you tagged them and you can go back and see why.   My issue with Tasker is that I just simply do not have a normal routine.  I don't always want X to happen when I'm near Y or similar.  Right now though, paired with AutoVoice, it's giving me a bunch of amazing voice commands, so there's that.   Stormreaver and Korgath are the two servers I played on.  My mage was in Death and Taxes   TFO on Korgath during TBC.  Both of those servers were focused on high progression, and were very high population pvp servers.  I semi-quit during Cataclysm, so it's been a while since I've played seriously at any level.  Dungeon/Raid finder basically removed most of my friends because they logged in, queued for DF/RF, and logged out for the week.  All of my friends became disinterested in hard modes or even normal modes for that fucking matter, because they had already seen all the content...that's all they wanted to do after all.  So I was left on a progression server, with nobody wanting to do progression because they already saw all the content!  That's my huge gripe with ezmode raids; a large portion of the population just wants to see what's new and then not go any further.  At least when that content was locked out, they were eager to earn the rights and the ability to go into that content to prove their worth.  Did it eat a lot of time?  Yeah.  But it made those accomplishments all that more worth while.   They did take 310% away. [[Proof]](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2144/what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been#comments:id=1695700) Turns out that in 4.0.1 they just simply gave it to _everyone_ and anyone with a 310% mount immediately got the master riding skill to accompany it without having to purchase it.  Also, people _did_ give a flying rats ass, I know because I'm not so short-sighted to forget the absolute awe that I felt when someone rode up to me on an epic mount for the first time.  Most of the population of WoW did indeed care; the whispers that I got _constantly_ over my gear are a testament to that.  Just because you never reached that level (because of lack of skill, or lack of social skills, whatever) doesn't mean that there wasn't a bit of extravagance to having that gear.   It's a good thing that I actually did my research on it before commenting then, so I don't look like an idiot.  Certain species of spiders can go a year between meals.   I've had _WAY_ too many instances of running through the woods as a child, and having an orb weaver plaster itself and its web right on the center of my fucking face to hate those suckers too.  http://www.northmyrtlebeachonline.com/uploads/user_12_/2013news/bananaspider.jpg  Though, the little spiky ones are cool, they're apparently orb weavers too.     Remember ladies and gentleman: The only difference between fucking around and science, is writing it down!   Oh fuck here we go.  All aboard the "we hate jennifer lawrence because she's too popular and she's really just fake-quirky"...etc etc etc etc...   Honestly, to all the spider apologists out there: Some species of spider can live for a year or more without a meal.  So, even at frequent feeding intervals, spiders probably only eat a bug a week.  Fuck that.  Not enough to earn freaking me out all the time.  Spiders will fucking die around me.  (Except the little jumping spiders, those guys are awesome!)  Lizards, on the other hand.  Now _they_ can eat a ton of bugs!  I love me some lizards.   Nobody cares about foozball either.   I skipped Cata and MoP because of this; with the button trimming and some of the other changes they're making, I might just start playing again.  Nothing will beat the nostalgia, because I'm simply no longer impressed by the expansive worlds, but maybe I'll be happy dumping my time into it again. :D   I do have something against people liking the game in a different way than me, when the rewards look exactly like the rewards from the more difficult version that I'm doing.  When people get the same art on their gear, as I do on mine, but in a slightly different color then yeah; I feel cheated.  If you walked around with Naxx gear on a server back in Vanilla, you were hot shit.  You got to show that off.  Now?  Nope.  Everyone's got the same fucking gear, with a different color (at most)  I'm actually really glad that they took 310% riding away from players who did the holiday achievements for a year.  I got mine by doing hard mode Ulduar, and put a lot of work into it - I got to hang onto that permanently, and that feels good.   Yeah!  Some of us _LIKE_ to listen to 10 commercials in between sets of songs!   I said I told them I'd break their legs; I'd never actually do it.  You can't say "I'm gonna break your legs" and not act like you mean it.  Then it doesn't get the point across.  Stupid fuck.   That's not how this works.  That's not how _any_ of this works!   I've been harassed by these people for years and years until I told them I will break their legs with a baseball bat next time they step foot on my property.  I tried being nice.  Sometimes nice doesn't work.   That's also a garbage hot end being used, which likely resulted in much more back pressure than modern hot ends have.  It likely caused the idler to be overtentioned just to get the thing to extrude.   Any family who had a household with more than 4 kids during 1940-1970.   Even 90 isn't a problem sometimes: http://www.thingiverse.com/make:63848 -- No support material on that print.  It's not mine, but I didn't take a picture of the one I made.  PLA, with a strong fan, can occasionally do even 90 degree, flat out into the middle of nowhere.  It can't be _too_ far away, but you'd be surprised at what the plastic can accomplish occasionally.   The thing is, games do it all the time.  In fact that's exactly how they manage to get all of their controls to look good on all screens.   I've often wondered; why don't more devs use vector images, and just use the devices resolution to "compile" the raster images on first bootup?   I do a 240x240 big gear every day, and don't get curling...though I'm not printing in cold weather.   Thank you!  Someone who actually understands how heat sinks work!  You can't just put thin fins 20 inches high and get any radiative effects.  You've got to have a thick base, with enough metal to literally sink the heat into (hence the whole heatsink name!).  Then you've got to have fins that aren't so thin that they won't conduct heat away from the block.  And on passive heat sinks, you rely on convection of the air being heated up in order to generate the breeze that a fan would normally.  Additionally, for a peltier - you're going to want something with heat pipes, that rely on the phase change of a liquid inside to increase efficiency.   Maybe if you're using some weird, chinese, not-really-PLA "PLA".  But PLA normally does not curl.   get yo' booty, on the floor   I thought a PN junction was basically just a diode.  They can have current through them reversed in order to reverse the side that cools, and it doesn't harm them in any way.   What? PLA doesn't curl...    Namecoin   You're letting heat creep up the heatsink too far.  Hook the fan up that comes with it, and never run without it.   And then when all the children move out, you're known as the crazy cat lady.    asshole owners that barely care for them  Ends up turning into a neighborhood of stray cats.

And then you don't like cats anymore.    someone is trying to protect this minor child  But I don't see that at all.  "this minor child".  "missing youth".  "this child".  None of this sounds like anyone who cares about her at all.  There's a _lot_ of disconnection in the wording of this entire post.  Something about this post just rubs me the wrong way.  I'm not trying to troll...but something fishy is going on here.  None of the wording, or information posted suggests someone who is truly worried that this child is in danger.  The whole fucking thing is sketchy.     Well, honestly I've been saying "kids being kids" and also "this isn't _only_ the kids fault ya know"...  Bad parenting plays far more part in this than the kids being kids portion.   I **do** stand idly by and watch bad stuff happen to them.  You _HAVE TO_.  Maybe not so much in this instance, but this attitude is exactly what drives kids to such extremes; parents who are overprotective as the child is growing up.   I have two daughters of my own.  But I'm not so old that I forget what it's like to be that age.  Many people I know did cocaine, smoked pot, did a little acid for a bit, and we're perfectly fine members of society who didn't need a "treatment facility".  Fuck, I'd run away too if anyone had ever tried to force me into that shit.   And psychologically speaking, this is the reply of someone who knows it's the truth.  Act mad in order to deflect the subject.   She obviously isn't in danger as claimed.  She obviously doesn't want to go to a "treatment facility".  Sounds like a kid who's been sheltered from everything or not parented properly and is just lashing out.  Not to mention that it's a throwaway account, there's no information about her actually doing _anything wrong_...   I work at DeltaMaker.  We're fine.  Looking at shipping around 40 printers rather soon which I think should finish us up with domestic shipments, and have enough stock to continue building and selling.  We have enough margin to keep us afloat and I've made enough changes to the original development that it's a worthwhile machine now.   Our biggest hurdle is that our machines simply take a long time to build.  We're working on speeding up the process.    The gradient on the dress is backwards.  Her dress is actually darker at the bottom, and fades lighter towards her chest.   You don't understand.  These people usually have lawyers on retainer and get off points-free.  Rich people don't live by the same rules as us peons.   Flash controllers hide that bit.  They write randomly across the chips, but that's not reflected in what the OS knows.  The flash controller shows the OS that everything is within X and Y.  But on the other side of that controller, it could be anywhere on the chip due to wear leveling, etc.  EXT2/3/4 already leave a little bit of extra space between files as is.  I know there are some "holes" in there.  There's no reason for me to actually worry about that bit...I was being pedantic and merely included it so people reading knew I wasn't completely clueless.   Likely you're slipping on a travel move.  Ever so slightly slipping.  It's because the printrbot simple uses those spectra lines on top of hosing; probably one of the first upgrades you should make imho.  Slow down your travel moves, and see if that helps the problem.  Then look into a solid solution by switching to toothed belts.   Thanks for the help; I figured out how to do it via DD, by limiting how much data it copied beyond the end of my partitions.   Turns out, shrinking the partitions, and calculating the size of the mbr+partition table+partition1+partition2, and using bs=1M and count=[some multiple of 1 meg] was the solution.  I was able to copy 7.5gb, all the way up to the end of partition2 and that worked. :)   and then I'm only copying 1 partition out of 3.  And you'll say "well copy all 3 partitions"...then we're back _exactly_ at the problem I described in my very first post.  Like I didn't already try exactly what you're suggesting... _  Did you even read it?   That's exactly the opposite of what he did.  You should really go back and re-read the instructions he posted.  How about reading steps 3 and 4?  3.Partition the destination disk into partitions with sizes greater than copied data and should be of same format and same flags using gparted. Please google how to partition a disk.  4.Now mount the freshly formatted and partitioned disk. Mostly you need to just connect the disk to system and you can find the mounted partitions in /media folder.   I'm running Linux.  The other people helping me are simply writing the images.  They can use Win32DiskImager - but it bitches and fails to even start writing the card if the image is too big.  So yes, this was a Linux solution, for a windows problem...because I don't use Windows.   You're quite wrong.  DD was the solution; I merely needed to calculate the partition boundaries and take that into account.   In my case, I simply resized the partition down and left a bunch of unpartitioned space at the end.  May not be the best solution for you though. :/   Thank you; this looks like it's my solution.  Push all the partitions to the "front" (they already are) and then specifically set my block size to 1M, and count to 7500; which should give me a 7.5gb image.  It copies a little bit of the "blank" data but it's enough to give me the room I need.  Thanks!   _I'M_ on Linux.  They're using their personal machines with Win32DiskImager to write the image files to SD cards to help parallelize it.  I can't be installing cygwin to their machines for them to run this.  It's not happening, I cannot use it as a solution.   It is shrunk; dd still copies the entire device.   On windows?   I have 3 other users helping me flash cards (2 on windows).  They can flash an image to an SD card, but they wouldn't be able to follow those instructions for shit, and it would end up just being me doing 100+ cards.  I can't use that as a solution.   So I have the task of copying a master image of an 8gb SD card, over to hundreds of other SD cards.  The problem is that the cards vary in size (a couple mb smaller or larger than a full 8gb), and some of the windows utilities just simply refuse to write the image if the card is smaller.  I'm trying to grab an image of the card, minus anything at the "end", so that the image I'm writing is like 7.5gb, instead of the full 8gb.  I can't seem to find a straightforward way of doing this.  I've tried copying the first 512 (mbr/partition table) and then concatenating it with the partition images, but I'm guessing that doesn't work because partitions need to be aligned to the blocksize.  (After writing the image, it won't boot)  I've already got the SD card image so that the partitions are resized and there is ~750mb free at the "end" of the drive (I say this because I'm aware how flash controllers don't write data sequentially).   Is it bad, that even though they'd give me one for free, I still don't want the fucking thing?   As stated elsewhere in the thread, the blazer does the "dreaded X", which is a sign that it's too small.   @Portis403; the 3D Print Blood vessels was posted by "3DPrint.com" which the community has recently been found to be simply making shit up.  There was no research done.  No references in their article.  They are run by a set of brothers who have been knowingly spamming across the entire internet attempting to get their 3D printing "property" (domains 3Dprint.com and 3dprintboard.com) to be worth more money.  Unfortunately a bunch of places picked up the story without verifying it, but be aware that it's likely completely fabricated.   People who don't shop at wal-mart.

Not everyone sits on reddit their entire 8 hour shift, every day at work.  People who complain about reposts are huge douche-canoes.   That's because you're now into fanboy territory and just because it's got moffat's name on it (or that you THINK it's a moffat episode without checking) you're immediately disliking it.  That's not how this works!  That's not how any of this works!      If you're using slic3r or cura as well; try out the support material.  It sounds like the print is oriented in such a way that it's trying to build a piece out in mid air, and it needs something to rest on that can be peeled away later.  KISSlicer isn't beginner friendly as far as UIs go; so use what you're familiar with first and determine if that's what you need for this print to succeed.   Skull above the teeth.  See that plateauing?  That's the result of your motor jumping to a full step position on the motor due to microstepping being unable to function for whatever reason.  Usually this is due to a mis-selected motor that's "rated" for 12v, and being powered by 12v.  For microstepping to work, we actually use motors rated for 2v or so, and run them at 12v, but chop the signal up so that there's not too much power going through the motor.  That allows us to get intermediate steps between the full 200 steps.  Gives us smoother lines, better resolution, etc.   Well; depends.  What stepper motors are you using?  Ideally they should be "rated" for 2-4v   1.5-4ohm.  If the motors you're using say they are "rated" for 12v, and are 15-30ohm then simply swapping out for the correct motors will fix it.  Also, which machine is this on?  Kossel or Prusa i3?  If it's on the Delta; increasing your delta_segments_per_sec will help increase the quality of the print.

I couldn't find a subreddit that I felt comfortable asking in short of this one.  I recently got hooked on these: http://www.amazon.com/Pringles-Honey-Butter-Stix-Ounce/dp/B00BFN0EJI - and they have just a very concentrated butter/honey flavor with bits of salt.  I can't really find very many buttery flavors out there that sound like what I'm looking for.                  Seen _MANY_ of the things I've replied to go from 5 upvotes, to hundreds more, without so much as even a downvote to my reply...      I'm working on a project building a 3D printer with a 405nm 20mw laser.  However, the diode puts out an elongated beam.  When focused, it's difficult to tell, but will result in the print in UV reactive resin being less accurate in one axis.  Are there any common cylindrical lenses which I can use in the housing to help shape the elongated beam into a sphere or would I be better off using a beam-mask before the focusing lens?      I'm kinda iffy over the eVic after seeing so many harsh reviews on it.  Loose ring, shutting off when battery is 45%, etc.  Are there any other options that have VW+VV, Ohm checker, built-in charger (don't want to have to carry around a wall charger everywhere I go, but I've got USB ports everywhere)?  Also, are there any kind of open source electronics for maybe building a box mod?  If there's something like the eVic's internals, I'd love to fiddle with that.  Also, are there any reputable places which sell "eGo heads" or something similar for tinkering?  I'm very familiar with Atmel microcontrollers, board design, etc and I'm interested in creating something that has some experimental ideas or has the ability to be reprogrammed for other people to attempt their ideas.  (Coil power curves, and the like)   What properties do chemical additives need to have in order to be vaped?  Are there any other chemicals that have been tried?  Obviously pot has had the oils extracted and used.  Are there any places that sell caffeinated e-juice or experimental juices like this?   I know a lot of bitcoin enthusiasts are more interested in the profit, but I'm very deeply interested in how you find the correct hashes, etc.  Anyone know of a good video, or detailed breakdown of how a pooled system works?  (Primarily, avoiding calculation duplication, etc)  Would really like something that shows some example data.   I've been a Florida resident my whole life, but never got to go to Disney until just a couple months ago.  My 5 year old daughter _loves_ Magic Kingdom and we're finishing up our 3-day passes this Thursday.  I plan on possibly going again this year, but what is the best time to do that?  When is the park the most empty?  And is Epcot good for a kid who absolutely can't get enough of the rides?  She loved the little roller coaster @ Magic Kingdom so much that she cried when she had to get off...  Any other places that could be recommended that are focused on rides?   A while back, maybe 2 years ago, I was working on a JRPG, but got caught up with state machines.  My hangup was getting everything modular and able to be extended properly, etc.  Yes yes, I know I know...typical move...jump into programming wanting to make a big project like an RPG; I fell right into that trap.  Recently, a post that included a link to here: http://hub.tutsplus.com/categories/game-design/articles/gamedev-6676-how-to-build-a-jrpg-a-primer-for-game-developers got me re-interested.  I was also interested in Python on Android at the time, and had basically gotten this far: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKrlPS8J0fA  I had a character moving around on the screen, and was working on tilemapping.  The other thing I was working on, was a state machine, so I could break apart the game into different files (instead of one single file like I had been doing for so long).  I got as far as this: http://pastebin.com/mC5ugQcs  A year later, I'm back looking at the code, and also looking at the "How to Build a JRPG", and am noticing that it looks like I'm doing something similar to what his very first example of a state machine is doing.  A big problem also is that I used to understand the code before, but now I'm kind of flabbergasted by it.  I'm not sure how it works anymore (it was still a _little_ bit magic when I had help making it).  I understand what super() is doing, it's calling the inherited \_\_init\_\_ even though I've overridden it.  The problem I'm having is with the magic of StateManager.  I'd like to turn it into something like his second example, but the pseudo-code he's using is also throwing me for a loop, I'm not used to using map or what it does.  I like the idea of just having states that I can append to a list, and then pop off but is there a way to modify that list inside the scope of a class?  I fear using a global list is not the way to accomplish this.  I've also been kinda iffy about states returning other states...at some point wouldn't I hit a recursion limit?  I'd like to be able to pop the state off of the stack so it doesn't have to know what other point it came from or where it's going to.  Also, I would like to break this all into separate files, so a new state can be added by making a new file in a directory.  All I need to do for this is add an init.py in a subdirectory, and then import [subdirectory] right?      The file I need 2 of is here: https://raw.github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/master/single_plate/src/frame/6mm/Prusa3ALU-FREZOVANY-v4.dxf (right-click, save as)  What's the cheapest I could get something like this?  Any shops have scrap and some extra time?  It could probably be CNC routed too, but there are a bunch of small holes, and would probably require extra setup.  I believe the plate is like 20" (500mm-ish) square and needs 6mm thick aluminum (or something close to that thickness anyhow)            FamiLAB, a hackerspace in the greater orlando area, is toying around with offering a semi-annual 3D printer workshop, in which you work with a bunch of other people, get assistance assembling a kit-based printer, as well as education on how they work, how to tune them, how to use the software, etc.  If there is an interest in such a thing, would $400 be something you'd be willing to drop a couple weeks in advance of the class/workshop?  The cheapest kits out there right now are $399 (currently the printrbot jr: http://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-jr/) so you'd be getting quite a value with the help you'd receive.  The kit comes with a little bit of plastic to print with, and you'd leave with a fully working machine and a good understanding of it.  *edit:* Right now I'm unsure of how much time this would all take.  Would 4 hours for 2 days (total of 8 hours) be too long?   Looking for a suitable H-bridge (or Dual H-Bridge) driver for a remote control car project, but I don't want to spend $60 on an ESC because i'll be pairing it with a microcontroller anyways, and all of the ESCs I've run across already have an AVR built onto them.  What are my options for a  15A, 7-18v H-bridge?  I see millions of L298s floating around, and I even _have_ one of these packages, and it's not suitable for my purposes (overheats and goes into thermal shutdown).  Would an ESC still be a better option?  What chips would you recommend?           	99

The latter is worth nothing resale wise, the former I keep because I'd like to eventually do something with it.  Mainly, I switched because I didn't like that I could only buy what Apple wanted to sell me. At a premium price. With a PC, I can build/expand anything I want for less $. There's tremendous freedom in that. Also, I've never had a problem with Windoze. My first personal PC had Windows XP on it and I still think it was a decent OS. Still have that PC as well.

Many trace the cause of these tiny white spots to a wash the U.S. Mint is using. Specifically, the culprit appears to be detergent residue that isnt rinsed off before the .999-silver planchets hit the annealing furnace. As the cleaned silver planchets get heated to scorching temperatures exceeding 1,000F, any leftover detergent solution is inadvertently baked into the surface of the coin. The woeful chemical reaction between the baked-in detergent and the coins metal may take weeks, months or even years to surface.*  *As PCGS points out, milk spots indeed trace their origin back to manufacturing issues at the U.S. Mint. As much was affirmed by U.S. Mint Quality Division Chief Stacy Kelley-Scherer, who, in 2012, remarked that the white spots on American Silver Eagles are attributed to minting procedures. Unfortunately, Kelly-Scherer went on the record as saying that the U.S. Mint has not been able to find a panacea for preventing milk spots.*  *The Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) owes the milk spots on its coins to the planchet cleaning and preparation process...In short, RCM officials say they cant do anything about the spots*                        [I could swear I was looking at this yesterday where it was in the $10,600 range](http://i.imgur.com/srB9FI9.jpg).

I know this is purely speculation but I'm just curious, what do you think will be the ceiling of the GTAT stock if Apple released that the sapphire will be used on ALL iPhones and the upcoming iWatch.  Once again I know it's speculation but curious peoples responses that are much wiser then me.    Oh.... oh yes!    Well now I can sit in silence and feel like a real Einstein, thank you.  I think that this was the first episode that really made me enjoy the story as a whole. Before this episode, even though it felt like some of the story lines were coming together, they still felt mostly frayed.    I could go on for hours about the death of Gladys. My girlfriend doesn't get home for an hour, and I'm just sitting in silence mind fucked.   Why did they kill Gladys? Did they really kill Gladys? What does it say about Gladys that she was begging for her life during the stoning? Did Gladys death really do that much good? Wtf is Patti saying 99% of the time? Why was it so important for her to die? Why did Kevin have to understand THAT way?  WHY, WHY, WHY!?!   OMG.. The glass?!? The neck?!? But in the end... I still have no idea what I'm watching and I will be back next Sunday.   I definitely will update this post if anyone is interested. I put another $2,000 into GTAT on Thursday. I have 2 closings this upcoming week but hopefully after I get through the craziness I can continue studying investments and invest a few more thousand.    Purchased and received today. Not exactly what I was looking for but will definitely be a great starting place. I'll read this first.   	31
 It would be funny but it's unlikely to happen.  Google will probably end up on top when this is over.  	1
 Samurai Champloo!   Couldn't agree more with you!!   For me it's Paranoia Agent....   Technically you don't even need nx. You can buy meister cubes or master craftsman cubes but those cost A LOT of money. Theres an option to craft it yourself but you need meister level smithing which is a pain in the butt.   I always upvote /u/Poem_for_your_sprog    Try asking /r/manga or /r/anime.    I'm not really funded would it be okay if I use 70% scroll because clean slate scrolls cost a lot of money....   I don't have sympathy towards those who constantly complain about their problems and manipulate others into feeling sorry for them.   Seryu Ubuquitous from Akame Ga Kill   I know this is kind of late but is it better to scroll your CRA gear with spell traces 70% rather than spell traces 30%? I know spell traces 30% gives a higher boost but theres also a huge chance of failure...   First thing that came to mind was League of Legends.   Anime. Lots and Lots of Anime. Although like many other pleasurable activities, you are temporarily pushing the problem aside while immersing yourself in a fantasy world.    Never stick your dick in crazy!   I was suspended in 3rd grade for raising my fist at a kid who wouldn't let me play with him.       This was in the Walking Dead I think back in Season 4!   You Found Me - The Fray   "You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boist'rous expedition"  *Othello*   How do you remember Wyoming but not New Jersey, Pennsylvannia, Massachusetts or any other major states? NO ONE CARES ABOUT WYOMING.   Same for my school!   But did you try turning it off and back on?         Suicide doesn't take the pain away... it only passes it to someone else. Even though right now it may be tough, life always does get better. Tthink of all the opportunities you're missing out on life if you decide to end it? Think of all your friends, family, and colleagues that your death would affect. Good luck dude, just remember there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.   Type 8008 on your calculator.   Couldn't have said it any better.   You truly are an optimistic robot lord.         Oh I see. I would do Root Abyss but it's too hard even on Normal as my main probably can't even solo Gollux on Easy.   I'm on Scania. I'm selling some Crystal Ilbis for 70m, if anyone is interested please contact my Dark Knight, xDKnightzx1. Yes I know Crystal Ilbis are selling for ~100m but I just want to make some quick money.   All Mods  How do you guys earn your money? I know /u/icephoenix21 sells crystal ilbis and balanced furies.   I'm more of an anime person but yeah I agree.   Swap the Taj Mahal with the Eiffel Tower.   Anime. Most people assume anime is for little children but they're very *very* wrong...   I meant it as a joke....   90% of statistics here are wrong.   Most mothers are cheating cunts because apparently nearly everyone I've met while playing video games claimed to have "fucked my mom".   Camden, Bronx, Baltimore, pretty much all the ghetto uneducated and impoverished communities.    My mom asked me what the stain on my bedsheet was, I told her I drooled a lot when I sleeped. Not sure if she belives me....   Wanking off actually is a great way to fall asleep as it helps to relieve stress and to take your mind off of things. Other than that I watch anime until I get tired...       Thanks for answering! One last question, is making crystal ilbi's your main source of income or do you go on gollux runs and stuff too? At first I thought about making money off of Gollux but my damage is so bad I can't solo it even on easy so thats why I need some money to get better gear and stuff.     How long did all the prequests take? What level do you recommend someone should  be before they start making crystal ilbi's? How long does selling one take?  Sorry for all the questions but I think I might try to make crystal ilbis now when I have a chance. At first I thought it was incredibly annoying to make but looking at it now, it doesn't seem that hard.    Yeah I know, I wasn't asking specifically if you would make one for me but rather if I can accompany you while you make them or work on my own set while you're there. I'm also on Scania btw also, I used to play ms five years ago so my guild has been inactive for a long time.   Thank you! I probably won't be going on maplestory for today but whenever I have a chance I'll add you. My username is xDKnightzx1.     But if I recalled the drop rate for the badge's weren't very high and also don't you need 100 dark crystals to make one set of balanced furies? Oh and what server are you on? If it isn't too troubling for you can you help assist me in making one set :D?   How? Care to explain or perhaps teach me?   They both are quite hard to make as they require a lot of exepensive materials and a lot of time spent on the prequests.   That's like asking why does your arm hurt when it's broken or fractured.   I was placed in Bronze 5 in League of Legends and I only cried for two days.   Waking up in the morning.... I think that goes for everyone though.   Does anyone wanna do Gollux runs with me? I'm on Scania and I have a lvl 140 Dark Knight. My damage isn't that great so I can't solo it even on easy.   I'm clutching my scrotum right now, oh god, I feel really bad for you it's extremely painful for me to even think about it.   You got your priorities straight!   Or you get stabbed right when you open the curtains and you start crying like a little bitch.  	56

 His alcoholism did not save them, his skills and experience did.   Just from seeing clips and interviews on TV about Men, Women   Children and its message, I want to throw a chair at the guy's head.    I only recently watched Kill List, and what was that? Very confusing ending that leaves you disturbed and scrambling for answers.     (Btw Filth is based on a novel by the same author as Trainspotting and is not directed by Danny Boyle.)   (No spoilers, don't worry) Gone Girl. The ending went on long enough to make you think that something else might happen. Made the ending feel a bit disappointing despite the film being so thrilling up to that point.   Like Gone Girl?   I usually found Filmspotting a bit scripted and occasionally a slog with all of the segues and breaks from conversation. If you're not a fan of that, I'd suggest the /Filmcast, Schmoes Know Movies Show (explicit) and Kermode and Mayo's Film Review.      For an unconventional choice, if you don't mind some foul language, very unscripted conversations and a book club format (and the required book club dedication), The Black Dog Podcast can provide some great laughs and casual insight. Basically, you revisit/discover a movie a week and then listen to these guys recount funny events from their week, go over movie news and review the week's chosen film. One downside for *some* is that it's quite English. There are next to no reviews in the US iTunes, meanwhile the UK iTunes features hundreds of positive ratings.   SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD IS GONNA ROLL ME   *2005   Wow, thanks!   How is that even possible? :)   YAY! Fuck Alfred.   Telltale's, not Survival Instinct, right?   Totally. We need less "X WAS BETTER THAN Y" and more "X blew me away, what are your thoughts?"   The argument of this post is a running gag about the pretentious this sub can display.   True dat :)   Just a *tiny* correction, no need to be defensive.   Get ready for some hardcore UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR.   Long Walk to Freedom was pretty much completely snubbed last year, and I've heard that's for good reason. It's about Nelson bloody Mandela and it was only nominated for Best Original Song, and I hardly believe that's would be an exception if that rule held up.   By all MCU Hulk films, you mean the only one? Bana's was completely separate.   Without a PC right now, sadly :(    New Zealand, too? Wow. How offensive can such an ancient game be? The OFLC are BS. I guess I can't download this one.   It *is* going to impact the plot of the next Avengers movie, but I guess you'll spin that back at me as still unnecessary.      But if they've chosen a certain look for Mandalorians, wouldn't they stick with it? You're absolutely right, but maybe they're trying to not complicate things. I dunno...   Indonesians and Maori literally look nothing alike.   Can you imagine how breathtaking Ab Aeterno would look on a big screen? Or Ben Linus' breakdown at the end of Dr Linus? Watching the master of manipulation worn down to the smallest nub of self esteem and just letting it all out, on a big goddamn screen? For free?! How is that not awesome?   No problem!   Wikipedia. If there isn't a release date there, there isn't one anywhere.   No. If it's scheduled for this week, you'd know.   No problem! That battle, though, would look amazing in IMAX. Pretty sure there's only one IMAX theatre in all of New Zealand, and it's a 6-7 hour drive away, so even if it wasn't only in the US (anyone would bet on that) I'd be screwed either way :(      I hope anyone who has a chance to see this takes advantage of it because it sounds spectacular.   It's a general discussion point.   I've been saying for a long time that a DeGroots/Hanso Lost spin-off would be the perfect way to remedy the saltiness of the reactions to Season 6. Period piece, conspiracy-themed, pretty different genre. Alvar Hanso funds a project to find where his ancestor's lost slave ship ended up, something something DHARMA. Awesome. Doesn't even have to be advertised as a Lost spin-off.   More specifically, *The Watchers on the Wall* and *The Children* (S4 Episodes 9   10), as well as an exclusive Season 5 trailer.   They're YouTubers now. KindaFunnyGames is one of their channels, not a game dev studio.   I'd laugh my ass off if he appears on the cover of one he isn't in while he's currently dead.   Make sure Optimal is unticked if you're using Alien Blue.   I've play 3 and a half hours into the game and Daxter, during gameplay, still sounds gross. I've bought new expensive headphones and have listened successfully to high quality music through it and they're fine in those situations. In cutscenes, it's perfect but trust me: he sounds *nowhere near* as good as in Jak II, during gameplay. The sound effects being slightly less clear than previous games is honestly bearable, but in some cases it's just embarrassing. Framerate is great in some areas but in, for example, the Wastelander village, a hub world you often need to pass through, it's always nauseating.   You're probably right. It was always a show that garnered discussion, and since so many people got salty at the last season, it doesn't exactly encourage memes.   I consider Hearts and Minds a sort-of bottle episode. Boone character development doesn't affect the rest of the show and you'd already assumed he'd just given up on being a dick. And halfway through typing this, I realise it's the secondary introduction of the bloody hatch. Shit, you're right.   Take their advice, but use Adblock!   Breaking Bad was definitely great and all, but it was nowhere near as expansive. I could tell you everything about both shows and their characters' backstories, and I'd wager Breaking Bad would take up less than an eighth of the time. The world of Lost is much more vast.   /r/lost is pretty much still a discussion sub. Half the posts are one of "I'm about to start watching/I've just started season x/just finished and the ending wasn't bad at all", and the rest are mostly polls, memes, "I met this actor" and debates. For such an apparently polarising show, the sub is extremely friendly, accepting of opinions, and very much still active.   Really good ones, I swear   Therefore they listed it.   She looks like an older Mathilda from Leon: The Professional. A bit Natalie Portman.   It'd be easier to say when it's not terrible. These games could have been at least 30fps on Vita if more money and time were put into this port, because they ran at 60 on PS2.   I had just gotten out of the arena and in my headphones, Daxter sounded like I was listening to him through a telephone. Maybe it was my headphones and maybe it isn't as noticeable through the speakers.   THE AUDIO QUALITY? REALLY? In cutscenes it's fine, but in gameplay it is all kinds of ugly. Extremely disappointing.      Don't get me started on the resolution...     The first two games, though they had framerate problems, didn't suffer nearly as many downgrades as this one. Just...gross.   I was sure the Vita version only showed 2 and 3 on the cover. I'd swear.   As the question has been answered already, I'd highly suggest if you haven't seen it, to look up "lost 6x13 promo" on YouTube. Easily the coolest one they did, using a remix of a Gene Wilder/Willy Wonka quote.   It *is* too good to be true, sorry. Don't trust anything KDramaStars say. They twist quotes and hints and turn them into click bait titles. Look for reputable websites reporting the same to confirm it.   Wait, are the lesbians horse fans or are they lesbian horses?   Wizard and Glass. Only book to ever make me teary-eyed.   I'd bet on both my previous accounts starting off with Arrividerci Abstergo, from ACII, considering AC1 doesn't have trophies. On my current account, the first one was Fuel Efficent from Black Ops II. When creating a new account to replace my banned one, I was really into Zombies (hence "Richtofen").   They could call them Miichievements...I'm sorry.   You select your language upon loading the discs, don't you?   Hold circle/B (depending on console) to skip the credits.   Does anyone remember the meme his character spawned?     ***BECAUSE I WAS LOADED, OKAY?!***   Jak 1's framerate is pretty bad for the first hour or so, before you change hub worlds. It gets more bearable from then on. There are issues but I completed the majority of the game today (NZ timezone) and platinumed it just now. It's certainly playable, and a fantastic game. It just starts off far too jerky and nauseating. Gets way better.      Will begin Jak II Vita tomorrow. Hope it's the same story.   *"Hit me, Jesus, one more time!"*   Brotherhood would have been my first platinum without the terrible multiplayer trophies. I actually got all of the Revelations mp trophies quite easily...on my banned account, and now no one plays that game with its terrible matchmaking. *sigh*   The one multiplayer-only trophy didn't take long either and counted towards the strength of your war assets in SP. Pretty satisfying.   No, because Alien Blue was set to load only 200 comments.   Nooooooo! Please tell me you have a save from before the suicide mission!   Either way, it's respect for the dead. Basic common tact, you know?   Same as the other guy. Pm would be stellar.   Shameless plug! I'll make sure to check you guys out.   (Off topic)      To be honest, I (OP) mainly listen to long, funny movie podcasts - usually ranging from 1hr 40 to 3hr 30. Most of them only have a listener base of many hundred to several thousand. Pretty sure that turns most people off, so I can't be sure I can recommend any of them :)   Like Need for Speed or Stealth Inc. Nothing with an engaging story, but something with good gameplay that you can play almost mindlessly (I, for some reason, include puzzle games in that).   Don't be so cynical. I actually was one of the people who followed that big podcasting craze of people who analysed the show. I was hardly directly involved, but it *was* nice to follow.      I would absolutely agree with you that there were *sooooooo* many people that went way over the top with their theories, but I never invested my time in developing those. I observed; and when the ending came, I was one of millions of fans who were satisfied with the ending.      If you don't try too hard to make it something it's not, which both you and I have agreed that it really isn't as deep of a sci-fi thing as the 2009 fan base wanted it to be, then you'll enjoy the show for what it *actually* excels at - being 2005 Six Degrees of Separation Simulator.   You start.   No, definitely do get them chronologically. The first game is very easy to get through. I know the entire game like the back of my hand, and it's not that hard to get to that point.       Just remember to wait through the main menu without touching anything for about 15-30 seconds so that you see the one cutscene that sets up the entire game.   Literally the exact same boat as you. Only difference is the country ;)   Hell yes, it was. It's criminal that people never talk about the show almost entirely revolving around building and utilising characters, having several seasons in which every episode features character flashbacks that are exclusively thematically related. It's always "*this mystery that was clearly answered wasn't answered*".      The show is seriously not about that. It's about how that batshit crazy, awesome nonsense feeds the characters and their reactions/interactions. That's how the show should be watched.   Well, pretty much!   Not to mention you can usually shut them up within three answers.   100% confidence? Really?   I AM A GOLDEN GOD!   Okay. When I was growing up, the title card always said Thomas the Tank Engine. I think I have flicked past to see it's now Thomas   Friends.   Thomas the *Train*? Is this an American thing, because *tank engine* isn't as marketable?   I think the problem is that the game wasted too much time on some extremely pointless assassinations. That time could have been spent with the other characters. Bellec's death is spoiled in the game's own outfit menu, you acquiring the Sword of Eden is spoiled in the weapon menu etc. It's like don't even care. They've put so much effort into making the cutscenes and world look magnificent that they're missing out on making them *feel* magnificent.   I love you, penne.   Both were rather sloppy, but I feel bad for being such a dick about AC3 when Unity was far sloppier.   I never noticed! That's hilarious. Also, [**relevant**](http://youtu.be/X5hrUGFhsXo)   They only announced it for PC because they accidentally put the Uplay achievements up for the PC version. XB1 and PS4 may have been next.   Elise dying was just the worst possible thing that could have happened. It really does make me speechless. Like, why did that have to happen? Why? What kind of arc does that close off? It's just so illogical and totally unsatisfying and lame and angering.      We hardly knew her. She was a new character that we were being introduced to, and they gave her a selfish death. Why wasn't she the main character, and why didn't Arno make the stupid fucking mistake of charging at a dude with a PoE? Switching the two characters around for the entire game would have made it the best ending ever. Ezio-lite was the product of focus testing, not strong ideas. He should have been blasted.      This game makes me guilty for railing against AC3. In retrospect, *that* was far better than it could have been, i.e. this.   Plus it's a silver trophy iirc. Makes the game feel more completed.   Because the one thing that should be a side effect of anti-depressants is suicidal thoughts...wtf?   The Last of Us Remastered is in 60fps and feels *more* cinematic than it previously was.   As soon as he gets liposuction, that movie takes a massive turn towards drama. Gladly, because the movie was actually kinda lame before that.   Got the lead in a Wanted match in the last ten seconds and received that trophy, on my banned PSN account three years ago. Fuck even attempting to play it on my new account.   Just like for The Orange Box, dat shit ain't happening. Sorry :)   Are you playing Mirror's Edge without guns? Definitely try doing that for your first playthrough. You do have to shoot a sniper shot towards an object as part of the plot, but it's a great challenge. You'll want to play again on hard for a gold trophy.   In one week limited release?   True. Someone at her current age, in three years, should be cast. With her history, a younger actress would be strange.   Johansson, Hemsworth, Evans and Smulders are all 30-33. Is that really pushing 40?   This just in: a Nolan is filming something dark and subversive.      In all seriousness, this looks great.   asasins' cred relavations is mi favrite assasin's creeed gaem    She's such a badass on SHIELD. Hottest 50 year old out there.   While you can also make him bright purple. Nice to give us the option, but it makes zero sense.   Starring Ewan MacGregor and Ming-na Wen.   Even stranger since they made it easier in Infamous 2 by giving you the ability to sense where the closest one is from any point on the map.  	102

 I don't think so. I don't remember any scene like that from the movie.   Are those greenscreens outside the windows ??   And Hardline.         Yeah, it will be a huge difference in audio(compared to 2CH in torrents) as you have a surround system as the blu-rays have uncompressed sound. You may notice a mild difference in video. The color would  appear more vibrant and grainyness and blockiness would be bare minimum.   Brazil    Each camera captures footage of the fight scene from different angles. This is helps in completing the fight in a single take.    As someone who was just like you, I have recently started collecting blu-rays. I think it is really worth if you respect the art form of movies. Here is my piece of advice :  * Learn about the region coding of blu-ray discs and players. Buying a region-free blu-ray player is a great advantage if you want to import from other countries.  * Work you way through bargains and box-sets first. This really helps to start a collection.  * You might wanna wait and see if 4k blu-rays, which will be released by the end of the year are reasonably priced or not. If they are, then you could buy a 4k blu-ray player (If you have a 4k TV or if you are planning to buy so in the near future).            Clouds, you scary.       Plot Twist : It isn't a piano.

I think what you are referring to, is the Band Of Brothers [Carentan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247463/) episode.   It was a mock up. The Tiger Tank used in the movie was a converted Russian T34/85.  But, Fury (2014) featured an authentic WW2 Tiger Tank   Nope. It's a real solid movie.  Edit : I Agree that the ending was total shit.   Although i haven't watched Stalingrad yet, Das Boot (Director's Cut) is a masterpiece.

 Jeez, that's rough, I'm sorry. I didn't even think about the tier 3 into tier 4 stores. You guys don't have the ops position and the ssm is probably guaranteed the assistant unless they suck. God its messed up.   Sorry again, hopefully you get enough severance to get by for awhile.   $12.95. FT team supervisor,  been with the company two and a half years. Started as a cashier making $9.50.   I couldn't believe the message from Cross Channel "this was intentional so the customer can't use the coupon and has to pay the full price"... WHAT.  I was pissed. It's not like these morons that write the ad have to deal with the irritated customer.   I kept trying to order a desktop from the ad for a customer from the kiosk so they could use the $100 off coupon, it kept saying it was not available in my area. So I went on my phone and tried to order it and it brought me to the credit card page just fine.  LUCKILY we had one in the back that was returned from like July and it was in perfect working condition.    Of course you can, they can't tell you "no you can't quit," but don't expect a good reference or to be rehireable.    Solution Builder is the easiest thing in the world to use. I feel weird now even using the register to ring up something than a color or black and white copy. Self serve SKUs do not count against you, my store uses them all the time and we have frequently been in the 99-100% range.  Here's a tip: Don't even bother with the whole "what's your first name, last name, blah blah". It's a waste. I make up all the information, print out the payment ticket, and then ask for their rewards information at the register. If they are a regular customer, sure I'll put in their rewards number at the kiosk, but for most people I just make up the information. It's so much faster and hasn't hurt my store in any way.  I don't know what counts against us more, conversion or DPT. I think it's conversion, which is why I don't give a fuck if someone wants one black and white copy. I'll ring it out. It looks better than someone who walked in without spending any money.  The express card thing makes no sense. Because you can't give someone an express card for 12 cents without ringing it out at the register. Which counts towards your DPT... soooo. And if grandma doesn't have a debit card and wants a copy of her social security letter, she's gonna get one from me. I'm not gonna make her get a card, put a dollar on it, haul her ass over to the self-serve copier, make the copy for her, then cash out her card and give her the remaining 88 cents.   Come on. That's just shitty customer service.  If you are BLATANTLY going against company policy, like saying fuck solution builder. Then yeah that's a reason to get fired. So just use it and you'll be fine.   We usually get 6 or 7 pallets per week, occasionally 8 or 9. This used to take us maximum two days. Now usually 4-5 days.  We do about 7-10k a day, have one tech in the whole store, a tech supervisor, one copy center associate and a copy center supervisor, four or five cashiers (but most of them can only work 2 or 3 days a week so there is rarely any overlap), an IS, and a PT team supervisor. And me. No GM.  That's our whole staff. It's usually me that does most of the truck, with a little help here and there. Pretty pathetic.   Shit's hard everywhere, man.  This is retail. You're going to either bust your ass, work way harder than you should for meager pay and not enough hours or no recognition OR you're going to slack off, not give a shit, and do the bare minimum for the same pay and not enough hours and no recognition. It all depends on what kind of person you are.  I bust my ass. My store has been without a GM for close to a month. I am running my store with like, seven associates TOTAL, an IS, a copy center lead, and a tech lead. The only saving grace is my DM is allowing me and the other fulltimers overtime. But I know, that once we do get a GM, no one is going to hand me a bunch of stars points or give me a pat on the back. Even though my associates and I are working our asses off.   I'm not a GM but I do know it's fucking hard not allowing the associates to work over 25 hours. They're complaining and it's harder than hell to get every area of the store adequately covered.   Staples IS a joke. It's ridiculous. And it's only going to get worse. So, I hate to say it, but if you can't handle it then get out now. Because stores are going to start closing (more of them), kiosk sales are going to become more and more important, and hours are going to decrease further. I've been with the company two and a half years and things were really good back then -- we had like, 16 associates, an assistant manager, and all the leads. But as time has gone on... less and less associates, less and less hours allotted... now we don't even have a GM and no sight of one in the near future.  You have a job. Yeah it probably sucks but either way you're getting paid. If you don't like it, find something else.  And yeah, even as a team supervisor I have returned year-old printers, handed those coupons out like fucking crazy... because it's not my money. If the company wants to keep customers coming back, then that's what I'll help do. It's part of the job.   Nope. My store doesn't drug test and I don't think any in my district do.   They really should have made it free with any purchase or something because this shit's ridiculous.   People were trying to do like 20 cases when it clearly says one per customer. It was just stupid. And I guarantee half of them are going to be back tomorrow.   Luckily we're almost out. Tempted to hang a sign outside when we inevitably do run out so people don't fuck with our conversion rate.   Does anyone else do like, a shit ton of manual returns?  I did four today alone. Usually I do a couple a week, at least, and I'm always afraid corporate is going to be like "wtf" because I'm sure they monitor it. Because, lbr, it's super easy to rip off the company that way.   I have explanations for all of them but I'm still paranoid. Has anyone ever gotten talked to about manual returns?    Dude fuck the ink planogram. I spent a 12 hour shift and than another four hours doing that stupid thing. What a waste.   And I know. I had to set up two huge ass tables of crap and a ton of bulk stacks. Yay for upstocking it all again in a couple days!  We have these fucking 20% off bag coupons every few months, they're nothing new.    Definitely Interstellar.   Also excited for Gone Girl and Fury.   Occasionally I'll just go on Netflix and watch a random movie without every hearing anything about it. I've discovered some really great movies that way.  Last night I watched The Frozen Ground, which was pretty fantastic. Also coming to mind is Dear Zachary, It's a Disaster, The Imposter, and The Woman Who Wasn't There.   What about you guys? Any great discoveries?  	13
 No, sexuality doesn't matter to me. I just know it does matter to some people, so I put it. But I'm just chilling. Ordered some pizza. Gonna chill.    Not much. How's it hanging?   He holds a grudge against Buffy so hard through the first 3 seasons because he wasn't in the running to be her boyfriend. She danced with him one time and everyone gives him a pass to be a complete dick. In season 5, he got better. He pulled a dick move in 6, but I don't completely blame him. He was quite manageable in season 7. But early Xander pisses me off.    27 year old gay guy wanting to hang out and do something. Open to suggestions, and always interested in making friends. Want to hang?   Is it just me or did Xander become more of a pompous ass as I got older while rewatching the episodes?   Fat ass.   Semantics. Obama was passing transgendered legislation to offer them protections while Orson Scott Card joined NOM (National Organization for Marriage) who isn't JUST anti-same-sex marriage. They're against gays and believe in reparitive therapy, and HE joined as one of their board members. Also, Hillary has constantly said how much of a supporter she is of equal rights. So, sorry, you're wrong.  Edit: Further, [here's evidence](http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/) to support that he isn't JUST anti-same-sex marriage. And [here's evidence](http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/hillary-clinton-joins-fight-for-marriage-equality) to show Hillary supports equality. There's a HUGE difference between calling gays "unruly" and treating them as second-class citizens (what OSC did) and another to play the politics game and keep your views quiet (Hillary/Obama). The important thing is that Obama/Hillary have pushed to make equality happen, whereas OSC has joined institutions to stop equality.    I just won't give it time or effort, despite everyone loving it, due to the fact that the author is anti-gay and I'm a gay person. Orson Scott Card is well-known for his anti-gay thoughts, and I am not going to buy/borrow his book because that only gives him more money and/or gives him more publicity by being seen with the book. Sure, it's a popular book and my "not being seen with it" or "not reading it" won't really affect him, but I also don't want to be in the head of someone who sees me as a lesser being for my sexuality. It's unfortunate that people disregard this fact simply because "it's such a great book." It's the same thing with Chik-Fil-A: "but it's such great chicken!"    I'm circumcised and I'm fine with it. I will consider whether to circumcise my child should I ever have one, but I'll make that decision with my husband when that issue arises. It'll be our choice because we are the child's guardian and we'll make the best informed decision based on information gathered during that time. That is our right as parents.   A couple of things for me personally: cheating; overeating; gambling addiction; mental illness; and same-sex relationships.  1) Cheating. This is a different perspective, and I know a lot of people will downvote me for it or say I'm a horrible person, but I'm talking from the side of the cheater. I cheated on my ex-boyfriend. I was wrong for it. I promised myself I'd never do it again with any other person in the future. I also never did such a thing before. I was in an abusive relationship, mentally and emotionally, and my ex had secluded himself away as a means of punishment. I had moved 1500 miles away from family and friends to be with him. He refused letting me make any friends, and he always checked on me often to make sure I wasn't doing anything with anybody. Then, he told me to move out because it made his life difficult. In order for our relationship to "make it," I had to move into my own place while I worked a temp job that I wasn't sure was going to last long. I did what I had to and moved out into my own place for the first time in my life. I was alone; had no one to turn to as he had me believe my family was an enemy; and I did the only thing I could. I found someone online, talked to them for a long time, and finally decided to meet up. It ended up becoming something sexual. We had sex more than once on multiple occasions. It got to the point where we had feelings for each other and I shut it down. Then, I told my ex. We stayed together another year after that, but I knew it wasn't going to work out and ultimately ended it. But it still messes with me, the way he has me programmed to think I'm unworthy of life without him. Nobody to blame but myself.  2) Overeating often is an eating disorder. It isn't just someone who cannot control themselves. It becomes an addiction, a mental condition and it causes you to make horrible mistakes to the point where your mental and physical self becomes garbage. Can people change? Sure. But that doesn't mean it's easy and it doesn't mean everyone can do it the same way as everyone else. I'm tired of these anti-fat people thinking bullying is going to solve the problem. It doesn't. Has it helped some? Sure. But I was bullied all my life and I only got fatter.  3) Gambling addiction. It's a different kind of addiction. People look at me strange when I say I have a gambling addiction. They tell me their stories of how they just don't take enough money with them for it to matter or that they know when to stop and leave or if they're up they leave. That's great. I tried it all. I still continue to go until I'm literally broke and spent the rent/bill money, the student loan money, the taxes, other people's money. I have a problem. Thankfully, I'm seeing someone for it and I've been 1 month sober, but it isn't just a simple fix. There's some deep emotional shit in your head that keeps you going back for more to feel like you're worth something. At least, that's how it is for me.  4) I suffer from depression due to low self-esteem as well as a list of other things as you can tell from my response. It's hard when you're trying to get your life together but you have zero energy or you're not sleeping well or you become anxious when talking to strangers in order to get a job/keep a job. It's particularly more difficult when you're trying to find the right dose of drugs to help keep you on an even keel so you can be a regular person without crying every two seconds. I'm now off any drugs and I seem to be doing really well. Been off them for 4 months now. Let's hope I continue doing well. I asked to be on drugs, not prescribed them by a psychiatrist.   5) I'm gay and I've been in many same-sex relationships. Many people in my life seem to make it out that same-sex relationships aren't real relationships or that same-sex relationships aren't the same as heterosexual relationships. My mother often argued that my ex and I could never understand what it's like to be in a deep, emotional relationship because we're the same gender. My ex-friend told me that my ex and I could never understand what it's like to be married because we didn't have the right to be married and therefore could never understand the deep emotional ties you create when you say 'I do.' Meanwhile, she's now getting a divorce from said husband that she said she was so close to a year and a half ago.   I was in an abusive relationship, both emotionally and mentally.  He made it where I couldn't have friends, had me turn against my family, and he constantly made me feel bad about myself. I left him finally after 2 and a half years, and it took my best friend to come get me before I was able to get away. But I kept calling him. I kept wanting to be close to him because I felt lost without him.  I developed a gambling addiction, kept losing job after job, couldn't move out of my parents' place. I lost my old friends, separated myself from my family even more. And I still call him, text him, email him hoping he'll answer because he's the "only one who gets me." I have to keep reminding myself he programmed me that way.  My life sucks. But I can change it. And I am changing it. I'm a month sober from gambling. The job thing... I'm finally with a job under a boss who believes in me and tells me because I was honest with him and said "I don't feel good enough".  I'm a gay man by the way. I feel I should say that so you have an idea of my personal perspective. You can leave him. Should leave him. I'm here if you ever need to talk.   I'm sorry for the late response. I have an idea for this story, but I've stopped and started it multiple times. I can't seem to get the words out properly to tell it.   Imagine, if you will, a doctor named Rachel Rosen sitting in front of a panel of board members who represent her employer, NewU Cloning. She's presenting her case in hopes of showing her competence during a situation where a candidate was cloned that ultimately resulted in an unfortunate incident. Rachel wants to show they succeeded during the cloning process, and that despite the incident there weren't any unforeseen complications. In fact, it was a complete success based on the candidate's situation. The candidate, a Jillian Murphy, suffers from multiple personality disorder. While working with various leaders in the mental health field, Dr. Rosen was able to create personifications for each split personality. One of them, of course, turns out to be a murderous, rampaging psychopath who eventually realized why they're in pain. Come to find out, all these split personalities are spirits whose lives ended abruptly and have haunted and possessed Jillian until now since they have their own bodies. All of these spirits with their new bodies decide to leave in order to live the lives that were taken from them so brutally. Dr. Rosen thinks the experiment was a complete success, despite the clones all disappearing and the research destroyed. Dr. Rosen is fired and she returns home where the homicidal clone is waiting and she wants the doctor's help for vengeance against her original death.   If he's not going to agree to said action, then yes. I think inaction would be best. Obviously, the way you're approaching it (head-on) hasn't done much for you and only seems to keep spurring the other person on. Whereas, if you said nothing, he'd go away. The way I see it, you're not making a good case for yourself about "not" trolling.   Karen   David VanHorne May 6, 2015  To the owners and operators of Burton's Big Amusements:  We want to thank you from the depths of our hearts for giving our Julie the greatest day of her life on March 24, 2015. We don't often bring Julie out to such events due to her eccentric nature, but we appreciate your professionalism and enthusiasm during her once-in-a-lifetime visit.  She hasn't stopped talking about the rides, especially the carousel. She's never seen a horse up-close during her youthful seven years, so it was a fantasy come true when she was able to ride the beautiful, white stallion. We fear it may be the closest thing to an animal she'll ever be able to touch. Also, we've been in contact with the company who built the carousel and we've already discussed payment on the replacement of the wooden horse.   Of course, we want to apologize for the incident on the Ferris Wheel. She isn't used to being up so high in the air. Your attendant handled himself wonderfully and remained quite professional during the debacle. We've sent flowers to his hospital room, and we will be paying all his medical bills on his behalf.  Lastly, we wanted to talk about your clown, Mr. Puddles. It seems he really upset our Julie. We understand that clowns are meant to be funny and goofy, but she doesn't like people jumping around her or making loud noises. Further, the horn and balloon animals, especially when they popped, really shook Julie to her core. She still cries about it today. Of course, it doesn't excuse her actions, so we would like to apologize for the untimely death of Mr. Puddles the Clown. A check has been sent to his attorney to help pay for any funeral expenses his next-of-kin had to endure.  Despite everything, our Julie was impressed by your carnival and she would like to request a return within the nearest future. When would be the best time for us to rent the grounds for the day?  Sincerely, Karen   David VanHorne * * * From the Desk of: Allen Burton, Owner   Operator of Burton's Big Amusement Park May 10, 2015  Mr.   Mrs. VanHorne:  We are sending this letter, along with a protective order, against you and your daughter. Please cease and desist in sending any further correspondence to the property, my office, or any of my employees. We will be seeing you in court for repayment for damages your monster of a daughter wreaked on March 24th of this year. Damn you all to Hell!    "I can't be for certain until I run further tests," said the man in the Tulsa Coroner's Office jacket, "but I believe he died the moment he was struck by lightning."  "Wrap him up and take him out of here," said the police officer. He went to his nearest deputy. "Clear these people out."  People surrounded the scene, looking in awe at the dead man's body lying lifeless with his eyes open. A streak of his dark brown hair turned a pale shade of grey. Standing off to the side, his wife cried out in agony as she felt guilty for sending him out to return their Redbox DVDs.  "I just didn't want to get my hair wet," she told another deputy in between sobs. "What are my kids gonna say?"  The crowd dispersed within minutes after the body was bagged, tagged, and rolled out. The police left the "DO NOT CROSS" tape up around the Redbox sitting outside the Dollar General. The employees at the low-cost general store were just happy they were allowed to close early due to the incident.  Early in the spring evening, the parking lot of the establishment became barren, quiet, lonely. Deep inside the Redbox machine, inside the chips and wires that make it run, the dead man's spirit watched everyone leave.   Then, he noticed a gentleman pulling up in a truck, a set of tools in hand as he crossed the tape. He moved towards the machine and the dead man felt a sudden dread go through his being.   The man with the tool box spoke to someone on the phone. "They said it was an emergency. I guess some dumbass came out during the storm to return some DVDs, and now he's dead. Lightning strike." Setting the tool box in front of the machine, the man continued to talk as he opened up console to look at the insides.  The man's spirit felt himself being open. How? He didn't know. But it felt like someone opening his skin and reaching deep inside. If he could feel that, he wondered what else he could feel. He watched the technician pull out tools and the dead man wished he had died instead.  	15
    Motherfucking Gary Oak   Ha, me neither!   wow, did'nt know that ! That really is a legitimate reason to make those parts CGI... pretty sad.    Dain, hands down, every dwarf should have a bitching pig to ride to battle   I'm must hoping we get a bitching extended version of 3,5 hours with all of this in it    I loved it! But not all CGI was equally great, the troll baby looking thing that Bard crashed in to with the wooden car thingy looked so so bad, but on the other hand, Azog and Bolg looked amazing.

 Fair enough, but that was not reflected in your original post.   Key words: *have* and *seen*. Past tense. Also *master's degree* implying your cohort is at least older than 24 on average. Whether laptops are disrespectful or not, your experience certainly does not describe the norm for today's 18-22 year old undergrads. "We all somehow coped fine" is a poor reason to not acknowledge the present--it's what older people say in *every* time in history, and time moves on.   I really enjoy the book "They Say, I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing." It's a short book about how to improve your academic writing. The title encapsulates the main thesis of the book: start by filling your audience in on the current discourse/context of your topic (what they say), and then present what new insight or addition or commentary you have (what I say)--no piece of academic text of speech exists in a vacuum. It's also very well written and engaging with many examples, and was convincing in shaping my own views on writing. (Though I personally think effective communication in STEM is extremely important).   Heroes after season 1.   Somebody saaaaaaaaaave me  Let your warm hands break right through it  Somebody saaaaaaaaaave me  I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay  C'mon, I've been waiting for you   Is it because you have all of your income in cash?   Its not an ass its a horse.   The best people to ask are current grad students in your department.   Hell Boy 3   The manga is like ten times better than the film.   Ah, ultraporn.   Same is true between any real interval and the whole real line, there exists a bijection to [0,pi) for which there exists a bijection tan and arctan to the real line.    I don't want to pressure my professors in the middle of the semester for something that I should have been doing sooner.  Nothing to do about that. Sunken cost. Your problem is not gonna go away by waiting, you should ask ASAP. You don't have the luxury of waiting around second-guessing yourself.    but you could have three published papers under your belt and amazing letters of recommendation and still get rejected if your GPA isn't high enough.  I disagree, but this might be biased by field.   I think the most important question is how much opportunity do you have to do research and how well connected or well known your mentors who you will be doing research for and will be writing your letters of recommendations are with their field (which we have little information to make a judgement on). These are by far the most important things for your PhD application. If the difference between the quality of your current research opportunities and those at another institution are great enough, it may be worth it. However, there are other ways you can improve your research experiences. Apply to summer REU's elsewhere to broaden and strengthen your research experiences. Work as a post-bac researcher or lab-technician at another institution for a few years after undergrad. Get a MA after undergrad.    GPA, applicable standardized scores (LSAT, GRE, etc.), and undergraduate institution.  Wait what? That can't possibly be right. Research experience, rec letters, and coursework all probably more important. You don't even mention research.   http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/   do some people not meet as often? i can't imagine a faculty member meeting with 24 people for 30 minutes a week each, that's like over 2-3 hours per day.   2:2:2 (postdoc:grad:undergrad)    Everyone is always so reactionary, address the symptoms after the fact, never the root cause. Things will never change.  So true, for so many things. Justice system, medical care, environment, etc.   I would create a company called the facebook.   Because it means more karma for he OP and the top post explaining what's wrong with the OP's interpretation.   Whatever it is, you probably just need to "Let it go."   Well, at least she finally got her water.      *side*-vote   Find a paid job as a technician or a paid research internship.   Doesnotprinter.   There will always be host-pathogen co-evolution--there will always be new human pathogens (e.g. HIV resistance and lethality). There are also subtle selective forces from changing diets, metabolic, and auto-immune diseases, and relaxation in pressures from previously deleterious mutations (e.g. increase in nearisightedness due to corrective lenses). Population expansion means more rare localized mutations, so rare genetic disorders. Globalization and migration will result in gene flow across previously separated populations--human populations will become more admixed. Changing sexual mores will affect sexual selection. Conscious knowledge of our own genetics in the form of personalized medicine will change our reproductive decisions (e.g. recent decline in Down's syndrome due to prenatal testing).    Anything that affects average number of surviving offspring is subject to selection pressure.  Only if it covaries with inherited (genetic) traits. So not "anything".   "Kitty!"   That Back to the Future III did in fact happen.   Those are quite different.  Noted.  if it were rooted in social behavior then you are forced to try to explain why music extends quite deeply into the realm of solitary behavior as well:  What I said was that music is an evolutionary trait related to us being social organisms. Music originated in the context of hunter gatherer social traditions. Im not disagreeing, except that theres no reason to think that our appreciation for music would turn off just because we now enjoy it as a solitary activity--I only meant to say that the origin of such neurological response was socially driven evolutionary adaptations, which would remain active today regardless of whether the context in which we listen to music has changed in the last few thousand years. Its evolutionary and social feedbacks in our deep history.  That doesn't mean those aren't evolutionary favored behaviors.  I dont disagree. What I should have distinguished was that the ability to process music as a general is universal and evolutionary, but musical preferences are socioculturally driven.  What I wanted to say is that the ultimate evolutionary reason for music cannot be because it is cognitively beneficial, because that does not explain how we evolved those neurological pathways in the first place. Our ability to understand music as a thing must predate the evolutionary adjustments which created neurological means by which music affects our cognition. I argue that that ultimate evolutionary cause is the social bonding it promotes. Only after our brains can process this thing called music can there be dual cognitive and social evolution in music. Said another way, people have to have a reason to produce music in the first place, otherwise genes which allow music to improve cognition are not useful if there is no music in the environment. The music must come first.    So... butt floss?   Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.   But we're not talking about Master's degree stipends, so I don't see how you can say that that's even relevant to the discussion. That's also better than most fields where you pay tuition to get a master's. It's like saying, most undergrad degrees are worse than minimum wage.   Yes.   True, though we don't know they are. I don't think mourning needs religion; atheists mourn when their loved ones pass away; young children mourn lost parents or pets. I think what we see as elephants and apes mourning is behavior related to physical and mental stress from a lost social connection.  Your blog post looks interesting, I'll take a look later.   It's, out of what I see did you their of.   A 10-12k stipend for a reasonably ranked bio grad program? I've seen as low as the high teens and usually somewhere in the 20s, but your figure seems too low. No comment on starting salaries.   Google scholar some key term or topic from your class, limit search to Since 201X, and look at the top most cited papers.   Focus on the positive, and *stick to the prompt*. You're worried about things that aren't relevant to the prompt.   Who cares, it's a great mug.   Principal Investigater. Got it.   two dick guy can.   sexy primes   Ah, such small thoughts from a puny man. You must seek higher ambitions.      Wait what.   Obamamamama. *Shit*.   Wait, people don't split their home bathrooms by gender too? I thought *that* was the norm.   Reavers.   Ah, brings back fond memories of early 2000s.   Bawled my eyes out for the last two episodes. Wish they would release the tracks for Mako's last lightning bend, and Zhuli and Varrick's wedding. Also, never noticed the scene where Bolin picks at his nails with a screw turn thingie and sniffs them. All hail the... eternal off season. Can't wait for whatever universe Bryke creates next!   I can just imagine a bunch of first graders swarming an aquarium and kidnapping a manatee.   Not a paleontologist, but for more common species with many fossil sample points, presumably you could (and almost certainly have) use statistical sampling theory to infer a most likely time of extinction based on the temporal data set?   So the idea is that music promotes mental health and is therefore beneficial? This seems like a proximal cause and not an ultimate one. Why should music have promoted mental health at all? And if it does, why doesn't every mammal have music appreciation? How did we ever evolve to interpret patterned noises as music in the first place? Music promoting mental health must have evolved after whatever promoted our neurological ability to process music in the first place. It seems to me most likely that music is rooted in social behavior: communication, group bonding, oral traditions. Music is a deeply cultural aspect of human populations, and serves many sociocultural purposes, particularly in extant hunter-gatherer cultures around the world. Moreover, our appreciation of music is definitely socially constructed (hip hop, country, jazz, classical), though we have biological inclinations towards certain sound patterns (like why do we naturally associate moods to major or minor cords). Like how we have adaptations to language, it seems that our neurological responses to music must be a product of our deep human heritage of socialness and high-level pattern recognition/intelligence/abstract thinking. Other animals with "music" include other highly social and highly intelligent species, such as cetaceans, elephants, and many birds. Music itself is something that is learned from one generation to the next. A lot of other social activities promote mental health and good feeligns.   http://www.nytimes.com/images/blogs/laughlines/thehugemanatee.jpg   Allison Mack.   find a baby who's skin hasn't been recently painted.   Compared to a top 5 school, this difference in ranking is negligible in academia. They almost certainly have the same "name-recognition" within your field. And as you said, school B seems to be better if you decide to go into industry. Likewise, from your other comments in this thread, the financial situation adjusted for cost of living does not seem like a meaningful difference to sway your decision. Commute, area, activities seems a toss-up, and so should probably be given lower weight.  The big difference here is the *lab* and the *PI*. It may be true that the name recognition of the PI at school A will open more doors down the road. However, this is not necessarily the case. The new PI at school B has a lot more time and incentive to invest in your personal growth, while the PI at school A may not. You may have less independence in lab A, and more a cog in the wheel of larger on-going projects. A famous PI does not necessarily mean a good mentor, but they could be a good mentor. There are both really good and really bad famous PI's. The good thing is you have ways of figuring this out. The questions you need to ask are how have PI A's past PhD students done afterwards, and what current and recent PhD students say about the environment in the lab. Then again, PI B may be be a bad/inexperienced mentor and you have no current or past grad students to evaluate that. OTOH PI B could be a great young mentor with fresh ideas and you'd be right in the thick of it. There's more guessing involved here, but the best person to make this evaluation is not us since we have never met this person and know nothing about their personality. In terms of recommendations down the road, we can't tell. It could be that A carries a lot of weight in the field, but has less to say about you, than if you had worked for a less recognizable B who was very involved in your academic life. B also has the advantages of field work and vacation flexibility, which is not insignificant.  Personally, I would lean towards B, but there's too many ifs that I don't know that you should take that with a heavy grain of salt (particularly, that I have never met either PI as people). I would prioritize which PI, lab, and department you feel fits you better personally. Your relationship with your PI and lab is very important to your graduate school experience and down the road. Lastly, I would not let things like name-recognition sway you from what your gut tells you.   I disagree. How are you supposed to make informed decisions about which program to attend if you haven't talked to professors?   er...no?   ...with rice?   resonance frequency   The Pope.   Wait, those aren't like real people are they?   3-10=-7 year old cousin?   Do your own hw?   *growing up   Professor chaos   Yes, it is acceptable.   Mine says   "First Last  PhD Student, Advisor's Lab  Institution, Department Affiliations (just the abbreviations)"  It's short and simple compared to most I have seen. Anyone who knows me well and corresponds with me often doesn't need to see a huge signature. Anyone who knows me but not well, has enough info to remind them of who I am. Anyone who doesn't know me, I'm introducing myself in the main body of my email. No phone number, no email address. Don't make it too long.   Definitely do, having a potential advisor on your side is really important in EEB PhD admissions.   My only comment is that I don't think it's surprising that theoretical work ranks low compared to applied-motivated work, that is true of most disciplines.    In other words you would like to define "evolutionary biologists" based on self-categorization  No, I gave my definition elsewhere. I never denied that there are evolutionary biologists who wouldn't self-identify as such, and I did not define "evolutionary biologist" as a self-categorized term.   I'll concede that molecular biologist to chemist is an example that could be argued, but I think my argument still stands. I am well aware the many ecologists are also statisticians, I don't see how that's relevant or contradicts my point--likewise, I don't see how your comment about Nobel Prize winners in chemistry is relevant either. I am aware that most biologists bridge multiple disciplines. All you've asserted is that a nonempty (proper) subset of A belongs to B, that does not mean B applies to all A.  A better analogy might have been, being a scientist does not make you a statistician, even though nearly every scientist applies statistical theory to their work; likewise, being a biologist does not make you an evolutionary biologist, even though every biologist applies evolutionary theory. An evolutionary biologist is not defined as any biologist who ever uses evolution in their work, but a biologist whose *primary* or *significant* research occupation is elucidating evolutionary theory. That's clearly how the term is used by practicing biologists and how they use it when they self-identify/self-categorize themselves.   EEB is weird like that. At most universities, if you haven't engaged with a potential advisor who is a good fit with your research interests and is actually considering taking students (which many years is not the case, due to lab space, funding, etc.), the prospects of your application being seriously considered is very low.  To OP, a lot of EEB grad students I've met have taking various routes between their B.S. to their Ph.D--it's not uncommon. Seems like you have a lot of really strong points going for you.   Same. If you're going into a program where you're gonna be treated like drones and lack agency then ... well ... idk why you chose to do that in the first place.   Not necessarily. That's about the best anyone can say.   I don't think any of these other posters are addressing what it seems to you're actually asking, which is the statistical breakdown of biology into subdisciplines. The best proxy I have found for this is Academia.edu--when you search for research interests, it gives you a number for the how many other people have use the same keywords. These are self-identified research interest designations. I have no idea of the biases (for example, do they actually study what they self-identify as interested in; are shorter phrases more likely to be chosen; things like "environmental sustainability" and other interests that aren't necessarily indicative of research would be biased upwards), but I think it should be better than trying to get at the same info using Google Scholar Author search, and more representative and easier to get than the breakdown of all faculty or awarded PhD's in say the US.  Here's a sample of keywords:  Biology: 316575  Ecology: 185391  Biotechnology: 115764  Molecular Biology: 102286  Conservation Biology: 100316  Bioinformatics: 78557  Biochemistry: 75764  Environmental Science: 70252  Neuroscience: 58034  Genetics: 28931  Immunology: 23458  Epidemiology: 21650  Cancer: 20452  Evolution: 18903  Biogeography: 14544  Fish Biology: 15378  Marine Biology: 15228  Genomics: 13039  Cell Biology: 10457  Population Genetics: 7946  Behavioral Sciences: 7147  Computational Biology: 6887  Biophysics: 6331  Phylogenetics: 5272  Developmental Biology: 2337  Lumping in things like population genetics and phylogenetics with evolution, it does seem that compared to fields like ecology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics, and neuroscience, it's less commonly a central focus of people's research. But these are obviously skeptical statistics. Could it be that "evolution" is so obvious as an interest to biologists that people just don't list it--still, someone who primarily identifies as an "evolutionary biologist" would probably list it. Why is comp bio so much lower than bioinformatics, or cell bio so far behind molecular bio? Is ecology really that high? It's hard to make conclusions here, but I think this gives a good first approximation. The ratio of evolution/biology is about 6%, which is similar to your figure.  To speculate on why this might be the case, most of the big subdisciplines are very directly health related--remember that the NIH research budget is huge compared to the NSF. There's more money, and therefore more active research, in biology the relates to health and that which is profitable. Other keywords are large because they are recent buzzwords (bioinformatics, genomics). Ecology surprises me for being as large as it is--maybe it includes many who are only tangentionally interested in ecology and conservation because of the very present environmental threats, and due to environmental activism.   OP's not talking about "evolutionary biology" he's talking about "evolutionary biologists" in the sense that biologists would actually use the word to signify a sub-discipline of study. Just because someone uses evolution in the work does not make them an evolutionary biologist. Your examples are analogous to saying an ecologist is a statistician because she uses statistics in her work, or a molecular biologist is a chemist because he uses chemistry in his work. Key word being "active".   My point is this not an evolutionary advantage. Most cancers occur late in life; selection is weak towards post reproductive phenotypes, so even if its advanatge, it's not an evolutionary advantage, because natural selection cannot "see" the phenotype. The reality is that even superficial knowledge of the genetics of cancer shows that it has not been selected for at the level of individuals and above.   Well for the longest time I believed that Back to the Future Three was never made because of MJF's Parkinson's.   Well yeah, everything is spiders.   No, and by that I mean, maybe there's an advantage but it's not evolutionary. The reason why cancer persists is not because it is advantageous and being selected for, but because despite it being deleterious, there's a lack of selection against it since most cancers occur late in life. Any group-level advantages seem far too weak to be selected for (group-level positive effects are only selected for if they're stronger than the individual-level negative effects).  Also, cancer refers to many different diseases, there's no shortage of ways cells can screw up their reproduction.   Not an *evolutionary* advantage.   Well that's kinda almost tautological isn't it? All you really said is that an X that is bad (or has universally agreed upon bad traits) is bad.   Valve really should just make a Half-Life 4 and skip HL3 just to fuck with us.   The reality is that any graduate program has graduate students from a variety of academic backgrounds, from top research private universities, to small liberal arts schools, to state schools. It seems like you're doing fine.   Yes, but not to the level of being a "red flag" considering the many other factors that affect the decision to take more graduate students. E.g. the labs in my department are well funded, but the culture of the department and the institution favors small labs. The information with regards to funding is not really useful without contextual info. The information is not useless to know, but I never disagreed there.   I never disagreed with that. All I said is that conclusions about their level of funding is complete speculation.   Did you floss everyday?   Uh, if you've never done research, how do you know you want to do a PhD?   Most programs do not grant deferrals anyways.   Seems like it'd be more direct to just ask how well the office gets along.   How supportive is the department of their graduate students? The faculty? The institution?  What's the culture like among graduate students, and faculty?  What made you decide to come here? How has your experience lived up to your expectations?  Where do graduate students tend to live (and other housing/living questions you may have)?  How's cost of living compared to stipend? How's the healthcare coverage? How's the graduate student union (if there is one)?  How often/much do you interact with other grad students in your department during department events/seminars/socials?  How long do people tend to take to finish their program?  What do you not like about the program, institution, area?  What do people do outside of research and academics? What's cool about the town/city?  How are the research resources on campus? teaching resources? athletic facilities?  Rotations, TA requirements, course requirements, thesis committees, quals, time-lines.   No. My PI is not taking any students this year (has taken 1 per year the last few years) and was already aware that a submitted grant had been funded. There are too many factors (PI personality, applicant field, department culture, discipline culture, how many grad students are currently in the lab, etc). It's a roundabout and completely unreliable way of getting at a question which you can get at more directly, by asking "how are the graduate students in X's lab currently being supported" or something of the sort. Also, if you want to know a PI's grants, you can probably look it up online anyways (university press releases, government websites) (not that's necessarily easily interpretable info w/o context). Complete bs advice.    Me: this waitress just said a super salad what the hell is that  Remove line, better delivery.  ... punchline ruiner.   You don't want to go where twinkies have gone.   Sure, but it's not a useful statistic for making any kind of inference.   I mean, inbreeding also makes social groups stronger (whatever that means).  The idea that religion is a group-level adaptation makes no sense considering there's only one out of thousands of social species which has religion, and that religion clearly arose very recently in human evolution (whereas primate social behavior is very old).   And die. Like all living beings. (No, John Mccain is not a living being).   The "velocity" (rate of change) is still positive, but it the "acceleration" (rate of rate of change) is negative. World population is deaccelerating.   That's some Wizard of Oz shit right there.   Welp. That deescalated quickly.   If you have until april 1 then you can wait.   Yeah, I don't understand the use of Sigma here.   Compared to having marketable skills and work experience (summer internships), an extra degree in four years probably doesnt matter.  	109
 The main problem is the graphics card in your iMac/MacBook. There are only options for mobile graphic cards, which are in no way equivalent to desktop graphic cards.  You get an iMac with a GTX750m which is WAY weaker than a Desktop GTX750. You just cant build a MacBook that can compete with a desktop-pc when the pc's card is as large as the whole macbook.  People saying "yeah gaming is nice on my macbook" - thats because you dont play AAA games and are not a "gamer"   Edit: http://videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html    GeForce GTX 750M 1,526 points   GeForce GTX 750 3,260 points   GTX750 is about $100, for a macbook with a GTX750M you have to pay $1500+   for me its always interesting to see those commercials, because in germany its forbidden to show products of competitors or talk about them in advertisements. (leads to pretty boring ads)      this is not "post some boring information"-mallard   at least she wont recognize you in the future   one minute usa!    hahahaha this is so exciting    belgium gettin nervous   Bayern Mnchen!   "im sorry, we are out of umms"   you get pissed off easily, don't you?   insanity wolf .. also known as bad joke wolf   You're-Welcome!   nice try oreo marketing   i hate this fucking seal    and half white!   at least read the fucking contract before you sign it   how is this an awkward situation for you?   so hardcore   he wanted to brag  	20

 I honestly don't really like the pancakes.  The GF will support that statement.  I only make them for her.  I prefer waffles or french toast if I am going to have some kind of hot bready griddle treat...   Yes yes.  I forgot last night...  Pork was rubbed and cold smoked for 6 hours before roasting for 10 hours at 225.  Rub consisted of an approx ratio of chile powder, garlic, black pepper, brown sugar, salt, oregano, and cumin.  Ratio was about 6:1:1:2:2:.5:.5  Canadian (pea meal) bacon was brined with a green chile/juniper brine and smoked over pinon.  And the rest of it...  Oh man...  I know I made it...   Santa Fe, my house.   I have not clue what that is, but I'll check the link.  Thanks!   Here's a whole gallery to drool over.  I'm in a serious mode looking for start up.  So if you feel like telling anyone to check it out, they can at least find me on Reddit ;)  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe   I'm about to head out to the airport, I'll write a couple of things about it when I get back...   If you have $125K to front up and want to make a deal, there is a location in my town that is turn key available.  I just don't have the funds.  That's a serious offer. If someone ever takes me up on the investment opportunity, they'd be quite happy with their return.      Notice the beautiful home made Canadian (pea meal) bacon behind the sandwich...         There is more to it than just that...   Yes.  To season the skillet, when it is clean, throw it in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hour or so.  Pull it out, rub it down with oil and toss it back in oven for a bit.  The oil should set in 15 min or so.      Pretty much.  Hence why the album was crap.   Go back to washing dishes for a few years.   off set serrated?   Thanks.  That has been the point of all my sandwich makings for a while now.  I've been assembling a menu of easily executed and simply awesome snacks.  I've been ready to open a shop for a while, I just need to get the backing to do it...   If it wasn't already either cluttered or dirty.  Beside the fact that a cutting board doesn't give a pretty picture ;)   You better watch it.  You fuck with Paul, next thing you know Justin is going to be busting down your door.  I gar-own-t.   Yeah...  I wish I could just bust it down.  I don't use recipes any more and just go by feel and method.  I really should write more stuff down...  The pork was brined in green chile, garlic, and juniper solution.  It was then pounded thin, seasoned, and breaded.  It was then seared in brown butter.  The bacon was a green chile dry rub, then smoked over green chile husk and pinon.  The aioli was made with 1 egg, 1 T of 5% acidic liquid, 1 T mustard, salt, 1 quart of roasted garlic olive oil, and 1/2 C fine minced green chile.  This was made in a food processor.    Bread is a standard french loaf.  It was griddled and pressed.    Good good!  Hopefully you tell people your source and you turn them on.  The GC is one of the better things to happen to food in general.  Not being from NM, I never thought I'd say it.  But I'm a convert through and through.   Ya know, it's been years and I've forgotten most of it.  And even though I still keep an entire catalog of Floyd stuff (something like 165 shows, dozens of boots, etc) that I don't listen to anymore, out of all the random things I should have in there is that album.  I just didn't even think about keeping it and can't even bother to pirate a copy...   Something like that has already been done.  It's called "The Other Side of Pink: A tribute to Pink Floyd."  Mind you, I say something like it.  It has tracks by the likes of Alien Sex Fiend, Sky Cries Mary, Pressurehead, Electric Hellfire Club, etc.  The whole of it, for the most part, was total crap.   Well maybe if were all lucky, I'll get a shop opened up one of these days and you can eat such delicious things.   Yes.   Hatch Brined Pork Cutlet Rocket, tomato, Hatch Cured lardon, and roasted Hatch salad with fresh Hatch aioli Fingerlings tossed with smoked Hatch salt            You are correct.  That is *a* definition of a lardon.    It's also the name of a knife cut.   I like it.  I also like my double burner sized lodge cast iron double sided grill/griddle pan to make pizza on as well.  Now I should look up structural integrity and heat retention between the two different metals...   I said don't before and I didn't explain myself, as I don't feel the need to so much anymore.  I'm trying to be more of a positive person.  But fuck this town.  I mean seriously.  So here is a good reason for you to not move here.  Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles is playing at the Lensic (restored vaudville/stage/movie theater) this month.  Awesome, right!  I mean, that is one of the greatest comedy movies ever made.  Mel Brooks is amazing.  More people need to see that film.  However, tickets are $50.  WTF Santa Fe?   I'm jealous of the tacos that scrap would make...   Hatch Green Chile cured and smoked.  It went on a pizza.        I just threw in a while loin of pea meal bacon, half a belly of regular bacon, 2 dozen chicken legs, and a small picnic.  I wish I could say something like the neighbors are hungry, but all of this is for me :)   don't.     I wish I knew enough to contribute to something like that :(   Well alright then, I stand corrected a little.  I honestly don't know anything about the place other than all the media.   Given the cost, exclusivity, and product I say yes.     Yep.  Which is why I say places like that are not for me...   Don't know what it would be like to work at that level or caliber or if I'd want to.  I also don't know if it's common to find a job posted in one of those shops.  But I know a lot of you shoot for this kind of shit.  Fine dining is over rated in my book, but if you're going to do it, do it right...   I'm not in NYC, but browsing online and curious, I noticed a couple of line and a Sous position on the momofuku website.  Thought a couple of you might be interested in knowing that.  http://momofuku.com/careers/      Thanks.  Now I know someone else to stay away from...   Very nice!  I'm intrigued.  From scratch?   No shit.  I mean, I was gunna say at least Douchey McDoucheington doesn't have a hipster neck tattoo.  And then I looked at the pic and sure enough, on the back of the neck.  My god OP, WHO IN THE FUCK IS THAT.   Rellena or arancini anything.  Empanadas.  Buy a case of puff pastry and have someone bust out a shit ton and freeze the leftovers.  I love em simply for that.  Bitchy low blood sugar line cook needs 4 fingers across the face?  Toss an empanada in the fryer!   Does the individual in the middle know what they look like?   adverb that participle!   And I've made many more like it.  This was the bacon in question.    http://i.imgur.com/qsKVsKZ.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/s2VQu9N.jpg   Bread is simply a quick rise round loaf, proofed in a dehydrator.   poorly.   Well, I make all of my stuff from scratch.  So which part?  The chile itself you can pick up anywhere in NM.  Since the season just got over up here, I'm almost back to using frozen and canned :(               I am just that awesome of a sandwich maker.  The link below is my 99% from scratch work.  I should be running my own shop.  I'm actively looking for someone to front me the money if you know anyone.  Straight up legit and can put everything needed to back up an investment in front of me.  I could make someone a fortune up here in Santa Fe.  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe   Yeah, I'm thinking in need another one of those as well.  But I'm lazy :(   Hatch Cured and Smoked Bacon  Roasted Hatch, tomato, parm, and rocket salad  Triple cooked chips with Smoked Hatch Salt and fresh Hatch aioli       Cast iron grill pan and oil brushed bread.   Ya know, it's the stuff that 95% of all the restaurants in NM use anymore.  It's the standard.  And keep that tip to yourself, we don't want a run on the chile!  Or if it is leaving the state, we want to charge the premium for it :)  Seriously though.  I've been turning people all over the country to it as it is CHEAP.  The thing that cracks me up is that on the grocery shelf here in NM, chopped chile is $3/lb minimum.  Out of state it is $5/lb and up.  If you go to the restaurant supply and buy a 5# frozen of hot Hatch, it is $6.50.  I love it.   Something to keep in mind...  If you know anyone who gets Sysco/Shamrock/FSA or any other national chain delivery service (restaurants, bars, etc) and can get them to pull a favor for you, ask them to order a case of Bueno Mild Frozen Chopped Green Chile.  Should be a 20# frozen case and run about $30.  Just fyi ;)   I used powdered green chile in the salt cure.  It was also smoked using the dried trimmings and husks.      Not in the ABQ, but if you're ever interested in coming up to Santa Fe on a monday evening, come to The Game Thing at the comic shop in town.  There is a lot of magic that gets played then.  Plus a whole catalog of board games to choose from...   Yes yes, I'm in Santa Fe.  I'm not originally from here and didn't get the whole chile thing when I moved here.  Thankfully, I'm a convert.  But fuck that red chile noise, that shit is weak yo!  Edit to add...  I'm happy to ship jars or seeds.  Just ask ;)   Not British, my family is from the Isles though.  And the best "fries" in the world are British chips!   Triple cooked chips, basic russets.  Nothing special in my book, just run of the mill chips to me...   You can kick it in Tiny's probably.  Try Del Charo.  Your friend can always get a drink in one of the hotel lounges and walk it out into the lobby as well.  Just gotta check if it's cool.  Usually is.  Loretto and St Francis are two I know of.      Smoked Hatch Green Chile Cured Bacon  Dressed tomato, arugula, and Roasted Hatch Green Chile salad  Parm  Garlic Grilled Sourdough  Smoked Green Chile Salted fries with Fresh Hatch Green Chile aioli.        And make a profit?  No.  And break even with product left over, yes.   Yes yes!  Sorry.  Will do so shortly...   Honestly, I don't really do recipes.  I just dump and pour.  Sorry.  I really should write more down.   Formed, but then baked out of the pan.     Second the Auto Angel.  Also Lou at Abet Moters off of Silar is legit.   Hatch Green Chile meatloaf  Roasted grarlic parm mashers with mushroom gravy  Brown butter peas and carrots  Garlic toast      Water.  Yeah yeah, you carry water.  But double what you think you should carry at this altitude.  Seriously.  The thing you should worry about the most hiking in the area (and that is depending on where you go and what time of year) are rattlesnakes.  The cats here are scarce, black bears are wussies, and the elk herds run before you see them.  The scariest critters you can come across in the woods are humans, sadly enough.  The real danger we have here is snapping an ankle.  So many 4' rocks or 10' faces that "are easy enough to get up" and we never think about it because they are so easy to get up.  But the landscape here can be tricky footing...  But if you want to run at night in town (as long as you have a decent enough headlamp as the trial isn't fully lit), you can get a 10 mile loop in easy enough, mainly staying off of the road ways.   Grill is seasoned fine.  I don't have a blower in my kitchen, hence the smoke...   Margs are delicious, one of my personal favorites.  I actually pull my own mozz as well, but basil is out of season and i won't pay $30/lb for it at the grocery.   Fried.   Oh I know.  I just got a new pan and was playing with it.  Pan in question is a 2 double burner cast iron griddle/grill combo stove top pan.  Still don't know how to effectively grill meat with it and not smoke my house out.  I don't care, but the GF complains loudly...   Yep.  It took me a few tries to get the temp dialed down.  And for the crust to set with a little bit of a crisp, I've had to let them rest on the pan after taking them out of the oven.  I can crack off perfect pie all day long in a 700 degree oven.  Doing this in a home setting is a little bit different...   Sadly I have to say yes.      Some good, some bad, but all edible!      Man, I used to agree.  I live in SF and ate at the old location many times.  And at the new one.  I was there just the other day.  It's not the same.  It's not as good.  It doesn't have the funk or the legend.  I mean, it's a good burger.  Messy, large, expensive.  It is good.  But not the legendary shop it was.  If you've not been to the current location, you should make a trip up this way and check it out.  It is worth it.  But only if you're in the hood.   It was a Hatch Green and smoked cheddar roll.  And yes, my work from scratch.   I've been playing around with a couple of techniques and recipes, getting something dialed down to make the kind of pie I like. I've simply been working on the tools I have on hand at home and seeing what I can do and easily replicate in other ovens. My goal was yeast risen crust in an hour (Suzi Q homemaker style) and I've got it about down to that.   Right now the method is   mix dough (10 min)  proof it in the dehydrator (30 min)   rest (15 min)  bake at 500 on/in cast iron 12-15 min   Since you liked that, here's a couple more for you to wish you had.  I should really open up a jammer joint somewhere...  http://i.imgur.com/k7E9I5j.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/0Hjrk6z.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/ZNflyDE.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Nk4tMOv.jpg    something like this?  http://i.imgur.com/zDUqULA.jpg   I believe this is the point where the sub is supposed to say "tits or you lie!"   I'm just curious about what his ties to SpaceX and Elon Musk are.  This is straight up tinfoil hat stuff here, but what exactly was this guy working on?  I find it highly suspicious that someone tied to that program, who would have direct access to the money behind it, would bother with such a thing.  Just thinking out loud.  This guy could be "guilty" in the eyes of our current judicial system.  I'm not agreeing with those laws/opinions, but just saying.  However, I doubt it is to the degree in which he is being charged.   It's almost a deal.  However, if that was to happen, I'd rather just call in an order and have you bring me bread for me to make my own.  Their bread is the reason I head in there, it really is top notch.  Well, and then there is the $5 sandwich...   Fried yucca tossed with smoked green chile salt.  Only a third made it onto the plate as they were being eaten out of the bowl...   Sure.  But I don't just make sandwiches for strangers.  It's sort of like that whole taking candy from the police rule.  So that will have to be figured out.  In the mean time, I will tell you that you should go acquire a tasty snack from Bhan Mi Coda.  That place is awesome.   You are correct.  It was chopped.  After it was pulled.  And technically, pulled pork means that it was cooked long enough for the meat to "pull" away from the bone.  Pulled does not mean hand shredded.   I'm in Santa Fe.  Drop a line if you're ever in the area.  If I'm available, I will be happy to make you a snack.   My house.   It was delicious.           Yeah.  I moved down here from the SW WA and NW OR Columbia Basin.  Grew up around/in PDX.  What part of OR are you in?  I only ask simply because out of all the transplants I've met, the cross between NM and the NW is staggering.  All these people down here from Seattle, PDX, Spokane, Bend, etc.  And up there?  Folks from NM and AZ...   Oh those guys!  I've met them before, but haven't been to their shop.  Has it been that long?  I guess I don't make it down that way nearly as often as I should :(   Are they a new shop?  I'm up in SF, but a fairly active gamer who hasn't heard of them.  Just curious, I thought I knew of most of the shops in the area...   Friday Night Magic can be found at Active Imagination.  Also, if you ever want to come up to Santa Fe, every Monday evening (like tonight!)  is an open to the public board game night at our only comic shop in town.   with a carbonara style egg binder of course...         Smoked red chile pulled pork with green chile and arugula   cilantro/onion/lime mix  browned cojitia  fresh tortilla  sour cream      Roasted Green Chile  Hand pulled mozz  House red sauce  Smoked Green Chile Sourdough    I just question if she can actually cook if she was on that show...   Appetite for Destruction was 1987.    	122
 I get Advanced Screenings all the time in my area and get emails every time they are announced. This one I jumped on right away   I saw an Advanced Screening last week. If you are a fan of the series, you will like it, as I did. It's not a perfect movie but is a very fun return of the characters with a solid story, great cameos, and the return of my favorite part of Entourage, the behind the scenes of making movies. I loved seasons 1-5 and the rest were alright mainly for the characters. But go see the movie. It's good   Baconreader   Absolutely!   Well, considering a lot of shows had their season finales and others have yet to begin, we are in a slow period.    Kick Ass. It's by the same director and based off a comic by the same writer as the Kingsman comics   Absolutely not. If I see a movie and like it or dislike it, the only way I'll change my opinion is on a second viewing maybe. But no one should be able to change your opinion otherwise you were lying to yourself in the first place   I was 9 when it came out, so I was right in the wheel house for this movie. I received the OT for my 7th birthday and loved Star Wars. I loved the first movie when it came out.   Now, as I grew up, I started to understand the flaws and people's gripes but overall, it's still an enjoyable film. It's the worst of the series but still a good flick.    Anybody interested in the topic of voice overs in trailers, should check out the movie "In a World". It's a great comedy movie that came out a couple years ago   Simply styles changed. I think it'll come back. It still exists from TV spots usually.    Well said, and I respect that. Thanks   I think that's entirely possible. That would make for a very interesting storyline   It's more drama oriented and has a lot of slower parts but it is well done and well acted. Sometimes you will find it to be boring, sometimes you will find it funny, sometimes you will find it to be great. It is consistent in that the whole way through. Every season has each of those moments   No one knows that Stark and Banner created Ultron besides The Avengers. Shield is not an open organization yet so they wouldn't explain that to anyone. The only thing the world knows is that another bad guy was beat by the Avengers so they look like heroes again.   In the battle between the Hulkbuster and Hulk, again, no one knows Banner has had mind control. The only thing they see is Iron Man trying to stop him.   The internal struggle was shown and that will grow exponentially in Captain America: Civil War.    Please name a role that he acted poorly recently. Not a bad movie (which he has done), a poor acting job. Everything I've seen him in he is great. Kick Ass, Nowhere Boy, Godzilla, Savages, Avengers 2. Not all of those are good movies, but he was good in even the ones that sucked in my opinion   Moffat has specifically stated that there is a reason (that as an audience, we don't know yet) for Peter Capaldi's face showing up multiple times. He said that Davies had a plan for Peter Capaldi and that he spoke to Davies who said that his plan still works.   When asked again about that, Moffat said it would be referenced first in the first episode of Series 8, which it was, but then never brought up again   That's your opinion. But either way, it was only mentioned a couple times in passing this season, it was completely set aside/forgotten.   Nothing missing. That's Steve's mom's name   I really like the Twelfth Doctor and it had some really good episodes but overall it was a weak season for me. It had too many episodic storylines, almost no series arcs, and got away from the 2 best storylines set up. 1. Finding Gallifrey 2. Why the Doctor's face has popped up multiple times before.    /r/MadMax   I don't think there is anything behind it. I just think it's funny because he is a badass little kid with a cool name   I'm cautiously optimistic about it. It's got a great cast, the writers wrote a really funny movie in Horrible Bosses. I've been wanting another Vacation movie for years, but it is yet to be seen if it can stand on its own without Clark as the lead (even though Chevy and Beverly are in it). The trailer looks pretty funny but the connection seems loose to the original series, that could be a good thing though too. We'll see. I'll definitely be there opening weekend though   Aaron Taylor Johnson. He is getting some good roles right now but doesn't get the credit he deserves.    Arrested Development (Netflix), Party Down (Hulu), Broad City (Hulu), Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix), Workaholics (Hulu), Chuck (Netflix), It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (Netflix)   I hate trailers that start with a low "BWAAAMP" and the some footage a for a few seconds. And then another "BWAAAMP". Some more footage for a few seconds. Then quick flashes of footage with a "BWAMP" for each one. It's a terrible trend and tons of trailers do it   he is not a human. That's like asking why we have 2 eyes.    Too late...   His last movie Get Hard was actually really funny   /r/MadMax   I was coerced into seeing it opening weekend due to hype on here and reviews and thought it was just okay. I honestly think everyone who wants to see it, saw it.    Party Down (Hulu), Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix), House of Cards (Netflix), Orange is the New Black (Netflix), Game of Thrones (HBO), Parks and Recreation (Netflix), It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (Netflix), Broad City (Hulu), Friday Night Lights (Netflix), Sherlock (Netflix), Breaking Bad (Netflix), Sons of Anarchy (Netflix), Arrested Development (Netflix), Community (Hulu), Chuck (Netflix), Tyrant (Hulu), The Goldbergs (Hulu), Brooklyn Nine-Nine (Hulu), etc.   Sorry for the long list but there are just so many good shows out there. If you need help picking one out of this list, give me a little bit more of your style to go off of and I can narrow it down.    Easily the best of the year so far for me   Kingsman: The Secret Service   I don't have sling. The point is, it's not open on all platforms yet and it's exclusive to a few. As soon as it's available on Android, I'm getting it.    The way i would watch would be from my Android phone using chromecast to my tv. None of that is supported   At this time, it does not. The film rights to Fantastic Four are owned by Fox rather than Marvel. It is, however, possible that a situation like Sony with Spider-Man where a deal could be made to have it, or at least the characters, included eventually. But right now it is separate   Honestly a lot of them, unless they were adapted to modern techniques and styles. But the styles have changed so much that they wouldn't work. Same thing for a lot of movies today if they came out in the 90's. They would seem too dark, depressing, etc.    Ha, yea   I would definitely see another one. I loved those movies   I saw both during their respective opening weekends. I am not comparing because they are totally different movies that only share action as a subset of style. Avengers:Age of Ultron, although not as good as the first movie, was still really good to me. Mad Max:Fury Road was okay. I had no prior knowledge of the movies but it didn't blow me away.    Kumail Nanjiani's character. He uses his last two silver bullets on Abed and Annie. They show him try to shoot but he is out of Bullets and has to reload. Not super clear but it's him   The marketing title is just "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" but it is still referred to as Episode VII by both fans and Disney/Lucasfilm   I can't because I don't use an Apple device. Having said that, as soon as they open up to all users, I'm paying for a year up front, done deal   You must be Streets Behind if you think I'm not   Maybe I'll pick it up again sometime. I've never seen New Girl but you are right about Community (wasn't the same without Dan Harmon at the helm). But I disagree about Parks, I don't think that show was ever stale (besides season 1)   He's nobody's 4th Ghostbuster   Kimmy Schmidt is a great show. 30 Rock was good for the first few seasons but then it kind of grew stale. I gave it up after that   It was intendeaned   Times chang, and so did the show. They adapted to being renewed without expecting a renewal or having a plan. They have done their best to create an overall reason for them to still be at Greendale and it has worked out well. It's just different but I still love the show for putting out the quality they still do.    Hi Doug,  I had a chance to see the movie on Wednesday for an Advanced Screening and loved it! I'll be seeing it again opening weekend.   Without giving anything away, do you plan on continuing the story in any way? The movie felt like a rejuvenation.    This is going to be awesome!    You are in for a wild ride of which you have yet to truly begin. Welcome and enjoy! Also, join us over at /r/community    the gang gets extreme home makeover edition.   To me, Davies had good standalone stories but a lot of it was still pretty cheesy. Moffat brought the cheesy down a notch and brought a seriousness to some of the stories and had series arcs which I much prefer to episodic work.  I came into Doctor Who after the first two series of Sherlock (for which Moffat won multiple Emmys for writing). So I enjoyed his way of telling a story coming into Doctor Who   When I started to watch the show, I started with 9, couldn't get into it so I moved on to 10, same thing so I tried 11, from the first episode I was hooked. After I finished all of 11's stories (at the time), I went back and was able to enjoy 9 and 10 but 11 is my favorite so far. I also believe that Moffat's stories, for the most part, have been better than Davies. But that's just my opinion.    Charlie Work is up there for me but my favorite has got to be Chardee Macdennis. I just absolutely love that episode.    I love Superbad, I was just pointing out the irony of your post. Anyway, check out the trailer for Chef, I think you'll like it   Harry Potter (and every name in that series)   Jack Ryan  Luke Skywalker  Ethan Hunt  Tony Stark     Sort of comedic but it's just a really good movie I think you both would like. Chef. It's on Netflix and it's great. It's written, directed, and stars Jon Favreau about a well known Chef trying to re-find his groove as a top Chef. Check out a trailer.   Also, just had to say, you mentioned you like Superbad buy don't like Seth Rogen type Stupid comedies. Superbad was written by Seth Rogen and he is in most of the movie.    [Spoilers](#s "John Ellis has put Ari as Studio Head, along with Dana, for one year just as a grooming period to take over for Ellis")    Yea, there is a joke about it this season. When the WiFi is not working, Frankie says "I've been emailing the IT lady and everytime it gets bounced back to me". Which makes sense because she IS the IT lady haha.    [Spoilers](#s "Maybe")    The movie doesn't start with it   Didn't see it, but, you do know that Michael Bay doesn't write the score to a movie?    Yes I did! Haha.    I agree, but they give us a glimpse like they always did in the earlier seasons of the show.    He most certainly is   It's open for a sequel but doesn't really hint for it.    I don't want to ruin the ending [Spoilerish](#s "It's still a comedy so there is a happy ending but I liked how they ended the movie")    Ha, I think you will be   For the last few seasons of the show, I definitely saw people turn on the show and start giving it a lot of shit. But maybe that's gone now   The focus is a lot on Ari in the movie so you will be satisfied   Sometimes it felt like an extended episode but it was very much in a movie format. It worked. It never felt long and was very pleasing to a fan.   I never saw Sex in the City but Entourage on the surface has the similarities (group of people getting  laid) but also, there was some really good story in the early seasons. Anyone who gives this analogy I like to point out season 5 because Vince's career took a dump and he had to be brought back to life and then truly fought for his career.    Those were great times but I have to say, season 5's storyline, although at a low point in his career, really brought the best out of the cast   I could see that. People will just miss out on the a lot of the inter-workings of the characters. It's like trying to be part of a group of friends that have been together for years and you just joined, you'll get most of it but the inside stuff will go over your head   For me, seasons 6-8 got away from what made the show great. The behind the scenes of making movies in Hollywood. We didn't see Vince make any of the movies and barely got any of the promo afterwards, it was all of the dramatic side stories that took over. Still fun to watch but not as engaging as the first 5 seasons   Billy is in a few scenes but more as their friend then part of the story   [spoilers](#s "A few new actresses and randoms on a boat")   [spoilers](#s "They called it quits on their honeymoon and are getting it annulled")   Jeremy Piven is truly great in that role. He again crushes it. It's really a lot of Ari's POV in this movie which is great   Probably yea. I think it can stand on its own for some but you will miss out on a lot of the side storylines, relationships, and inside jokes. As I said, the first 5 seasons were really good   I think you'll be ok, but it wouldn't hurt to watch at least the last couple episodes. The last few seasons definitely lacked in quality compared to the first 5 but they are still fine to watch.   If anything, just look up descriptions of the episodes to get the overall storylines   I just got out of an Advanced Screening of Entourage and it was really good. I know it's been cool to hate on Entourage lately and some people just don't like it, but Seasons 1-5 for me were really good.   Anyway, the movie was well done. It had its cheesy moments and skipped over a couple storylines from the end of the show but mostly it brought back what I loved about the show, the comical but sometimes real portrayal of the behind the scenes of making movies in Hollywood.   It's not a perfect movie, but hell if I wasn't entertained and really loved seeing the characters again.  If you genuinely didn't like the show, no need to comment here, just move on.    Very much disagree. One of the better seasons in recent years. It's one of the most consistently funny shows on the air and Season 10 was great. But to each their own   If you are talking about the American version, I disagree. I really liked this season, one of the best in my opinion.    I preferred the one with the explosion   /r/MadMax   /r/MadMax   It was entertaining but an okay movie for me all together. I had never seen the originals but was told that I didn't need to. It had some good acting and action but it just didn't blow me away.   And I agree with the others, way too many posts on here about Mad Max. Either head over to /r/moviescirclejerk or /r/MadMax   This is a subreddit for the show Community on Yahoo Screen   Absolutely amazing. Should have won awards. I was really disappointed when it didn't even receive nominations. Great acting, great story, incredible direction.    Most movies with a subtitle are very ambiguous but you understand once you see it. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.    I'd like to see a Season 7 or a Movie. Basically, if we are lucky enough to get any sort of more Community, I'll be very happy!   Also, I don't think anyone has given up on Community, It's more so that we won! We were on the brink of cancellation so many times until we finally did get canceled, then brought back to life for a very well received and reviewed season 6. We beat the system, anything now is extra which I'm sure we are all thankful for   [I don't know what I expected...](http://i.imgur.com/q86myk6.gif)   Absolutely. That's why I said they did their best to emulate the tone. It was hit and miss. Still Community but not quite top tier   Guillermo Del Toro   Today's episode was awesome!    I'm loving season 6! Not as good as last season but still really good   Season 4 of Community. Dan Harmon and Chris McKenna were fired. New showrunners were brought in and did the best they could to emulate the tone, humor, and quality of the show but it just fell flat most of the time.    Yea, I only added myself as a tester for Excel and only am trying to download excel   I read that it said it could take up to 4 hours yet it's still unavailable.    Ok, thanks! I'll wait a few and try again.   	102
 Oh I'm definitely going to watch this movie. Thank you so much for sharing!   I spent a lot of time thinking about how to lable/describe myself, or where I fit/could fit. I'm 21 now (so still pretty young) and I always hated it when someone asked me "Who are you?",  because I didn't have an answer! Do you already need to know, when you're still so young? Is it really that necessary to now know where your place in this society is? Doesn't that come with time, patience and experience? And does someone really want you to describe yourself in one sentence, since you're so much more than just one quick answer?   Once I started thinking about this society with its values and morals, about people describing themselves with their job, about how everyone expects you to fit into this society, because otherwise you would not be a part of it, **that's** where I stopped trying to fit into something:  We are **not** just a sentence or just a part of a category, or simply our job. We have a story, we are what we feel, we are our actions, we are what we like and what we dislike and **so**  ridiculously much more!  I don't strongly refuse to fit, it's (to me) simply not possible, since we humans can be so complex and so much more versatile. As you said it, we would limit ourselves down to a category and that would be a waste of a humans potential.    To me, you are definitely not crazy and first and foremost definitely not alone! I'm sending you lots of love, patience and hugs and I really hope you'll find yourself some day! 3   PS: I am still figuring out who I am and I am pretty sure, that this is going to be a long process. I'm just sharing some of my thoughts in the hope that someone could find them somehow useful, in which way ever.   I think same can go for arrogance. Now I'm not a psychologist, but I'm still pretty sure that behind that arrogant mask, an insecurity is hidden.   this is a cool idea! Would be interesting to see how the communication between only introverts goes.   	4
 Israel and Hamas would both be removed from the area in a perfect world   In what part did he call "Hamas the victim". see when Israeli supporters like you use Hamas to tar and feather all the Palestinian peoples, who maybe want their own state and self determination, and then go ahead and turn a blind eye when these people are murdered.  So yes, maybe you do begin to get a little pissed when the Middle Eastern bastion of democracy is acting on the same level as the terrorist group being blamed for the whole thing!    While I do agree that the trail of tears was much larger, I just felt like being literal   [Here you go!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots)   better than Philadelphia, thats not saying much (seriously I have had some shitty experiences there)   But combine that with the massive amount of artillery fire from behind the DMZ, Cyberwarfare, and the possibility of chemical weapons, the chaos within the streets would be immense   and one of the worst humanitarian disasters ever.  so NK is a lose lose situation.  	7
 Still need help?  I'll be around tonite US Pacific time   And you bought all the transients from the undead female merchant?  Jagged ghost blade and cursed greatsword (made from Soul of Sif) kills ghosts.  If you can get one transient and you have the gold serpent ring I would highly suggest doing some transient farming on the ghosts.  Also you don't HAVE to go here right away....   Sounds good!  I'll be on tonite like 8? pacific time   Got dragon scales?  I've got 10+ eye of deaths...   You can buy skme from undead female merchant in tunnel before burg or serpent ring farm some from the ghosts.     I'm on PS3 and have been in the Burg recently.  last nite I lose my first two rounds, get summoned for a third and as soon as I arrive the 'Target Destroyed' and bam 660k souls!  This seems to happen once or twice for me every time I fight for a couple hours. The worst part of PvP for me is the lag.  lately I've been getting backstabbed from the side or even front!   rock and roll!  message me back here later where you're at...   My friend Sarah Sitkin made the video for [Little Red Lung - 50 Fingers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-xE8GOoxk) !    the "Four" Kings...when I finally beat this boss, there were three other Kings waiting in the Abyss for their turn.  Definitely a race against the clock.  I ended up two handing a Dragon's Tooth and using a +15 Pyromancy.  Also, I spent a lot of time PvP-ing and co-oping to level up a lot, so I recommend that as well   yea relax, go to where you killed the bell gargoyles and talk to ol' ozzy.  He'll set you straight.     But wait!  Smough and Ornstein!   Pam and Jim's wedding on the Office.  It was cool until the dance thing at the wedding.  Threw my hands up and said I'm out of here, but came back later....to the cold open where they do that little music video thing at the beginning starting with Andy in the elevator.  Terrible.    [Confirmed](http://imgur.com/GnyYGNg.jpg)   Nice to see Samuel L Jackson getting some work....   ^yesthislagistheworst!   Holy smokes, this is exactly what I needed in an amazingly timely manner!  [Thank you!](http://iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/gifs/80s-kid-thumbs-up-computer-yospos-13643498000.gif)   Just some quick questions/rant....Sorry in advance if these are 'basic' questions... Never took the covenants too seriously mainly because I think of Dark Souls as a game vs man (singular)....Anyways, got all the way to Smough and Ornstein in Way of White without summoning another player besides the two Knights for Gaping Dragon who I ended up beating without their help anyways....Was having some 'difficulties' with Smough and Ornstein and decided to upgrade my weapons with Andre/Giant Blacksmith and then figured I'd stay around Andre and join the Forest Hunter and see what happens, mainly because I want ALL the rings....  Little drunk during the whole joining process with Alvina, but all of a sudden bam I'm invading and fighting and at 99k souls when my max ever had been like 30k!!  The past two days haven't been as awesome and here's my questions....  1. Is forest hunter all 2v1 ???   2. Anyone that's human running through this area has a chance of being invaded by me regardless if they want to, right?   3. Is it random who I invade?   4. Are people waiting to be invading/summoning me, and if so how? 5. When I get close to someone so our shields can touch they're all of a sudden backstabbing me.  How do I do this?  I thought I was good at it.... 6. Can I summon another Forest Hunter member to fight people?   7.  Is there a better covenant for someone like me who likes a more 1v1 approach?  I just don't like getting ready to fight someone then all of a sudden another summon is behind me blasting me in the ass. 8. Where the hell do I farm Humanity??? 9. And finally, is Dark Souls online experience just another example of online gaming these days?  Where's the humanity!?!?! Thanks again, I'm on a PS3 and want to keep PvP-ing........

 Days.    Well no one even knows for sure that happened in the Mike Brown situation, but it is fairly possible it was justified and at least we know Mike Brown had just committed a violent crime. Also, the officer in question is no longer a cop. In this case a cop admits to improperly handling a firearm and shooting a completely innocent man, and he is still a cop working in mass.   There's simply nothing the US Military likes more than fighting conventional.   Everyone is rallying for Mike Brown when we have a way worse story in our own back yard http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/raid-of-the-day-eurie-sta_n_3273127.html   Say hi to ISIS for me   maybe to you, wierdo   You actually can get limited nutrients rectally. From what I've read it seems like the rectal feedings may have initially been inspired by hunger strikes but were also used to demoralize the prisoners.   Yea deployment can suck because it isn't uncommon to literally work 12-16 hours a day for months on end with no days off. At least you get combat pay and are tax exempt.   Supposedly the rectal feedings conducted by the CIA torture program included hummus.   Still butthurt about the hummus Abdul?   I'll take the "ok with moderately abusing terrorists" vs "ok with murdering people for the wrong religion" stereotype any day.   Yea, I don't think we should be torturing anyone (even terrorists). However, when people say things like "All americans have blood on their hands" or "Now america has no credibility" and in the same breath say we shouldn't be judging muslims based on the actions of a few...I have to laugh.   See the thing is....purposely killing thousands of civilians vs mistreating several dozen terrorists is about ten orders of magnitude separate on the evil scale. Millions upon millions of muslims support terrorism against civilians in the name of islam. Our culture, while not perfect, is objectively superior. http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/pg-2014-07-01-islamic-extremism-10/   No you are right. What I'm saying is western culture is objectively superior to middle-eastern/west-asian muslim culture.   Where'd you get that number? The senate report said the CIA held 119 detainees.   lol   Thats fine, I stigmatize middle-eastern and west-asian muslims all day long.   Thats nice, however I left the military long ago and the only one here with a mental illness is you. :)   LOL. Don't worry, if you kick the drugs one day you might get a real job with real responsibility and have to make tough choices.    No, it sounds more like they were just watching it happen. You generally aren't supposed to interfere with the actions of the local security forces because technically you are just there to "assist" them. Government forces would frequently just execute taliban after we turned them over to their custody. Their country, their rules. Colonialism isn't cool anymore.   That was allegedly by Iraqi guards. This is common in their culture. In Afghanistan I saw plenty of pedos up to no good.   Hey, the torture program was wrong. I'm not defending it. But how many people did we torture over a decade or so? A couple dozen? This moment, literally as I type this, Islamic Extremists are torturing more people than that. Not water boarding. Not sleep deprivation. Not rectal feeding. Not slapping and kicking. No, rather power tools and cut your dick off kind of torture.   You're saying we couldn't do it because we'd be hypocrites? Fuck, people do that shit all the time. We tell Iran they can't have nukes....we INVENTED nukes and we're the only people who have ever used them.   Why isn't ISIS a government? Because they don't hold elections? Because they acquire territory through application of force? How is it that the USA come to be? They are the sole source of authority in an area larger than many countries. They administer the areas the control. They may be an autocratic state but they are certainly a state. Literally hundreds of millions of muslims support the actions of ISIL/Al Nusra/Hamas/Al Quada/Taliban etc. You can judge the group that allows such things to happen or you can judge just those individuals personally responsible but you don't get to pick and choose when to do so. I don't support torture, by anyone, however the evils committed in recent years in the name of Islam and in the name of American foreign policy aren't even in the same galaxy.    Yea. And we would. Whatabousism isn't a valid defense when you are in the custody of your former enemies. Ask the Germans at Nuremberg.   just a small point, your first source has norway and switzerland listed as higher   If there were physicians overseeing interrogations and they are identified I wouldn't be at all surprised if they lose their license.   Hey, don't stigmatize a whole religion for the actions of a few hundred thousand people. Thats reserved for the USA because a few douchebags shoved hummus up a guys ass.   Yea...I bet they'll destroy their economies over some rectal feeding   oh the homoeroticism is strong in macho cultures http://terminallance.com/2010/04/30/terminal-lance-34-its-already-gay/ http://terminallance.com/2012/09/04/terminal-lance-223-what-happens-in-the-field-stays-in-the-field/   If we go to war with China I fully expect American service members to be tortured (as they were during the Korean War). I'm not defending torture, just objecting to the notion that following the rules of war in someway protect our people from torture.    I really, really, doubt it. I dunno about you but my experience with this has been in the infantry which is a very macho culture.   rape or beheading...I'll take the rape please...but seriously captured Americans will likely get both.   Do you really think anyone in the American Military that is captured by an Islamic extremist organization is going to be treated as a POW?   Totally true. Seen this happen to a kid that was faking heat stroke.   Do they have medical licenses? Did they take the Hippocratic oath? They are not medical doctors.      why, you wanna hire them to violate you?   It is common knowledge in America.    The jacked guy in the foreground is Tom Miller, Switzer's boyfriend who proceeded to deck Semple.   c'mon guys, coalition forces are the bad guys, right? right?   Lol "in a trailerpark"    It is possible that more than one media organization should be driven by profit motives to sensationalize the news.   I love how you got downvoted for pointing out the obvious holes in the assumption that this had to be a lynching. People want this to be a lynching so its gonna be a lynching, facts notwithstanding.   They also love Subaru wagons. I remember a terp asking me about cars in america. He was like, "If you want to buy 10 year old carolla, how much would it be? I said "I'm not sure, maybe around four thousand dollars." He was very sad and was like, "Oh, I could never pay for this." I then explained that this might be about 1/10th of a yearly salary for a middle class person and he cheered up.   Not really, plenty of white americans have been lynched. It just means an extrajudicial killing, typically by hanging.   http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/09/-sp-north-carolina-teenager-suspicious-death-lennon-lacy  This is a picture of the crossbar.....it seems pretty easy to imagine how he could have got up on the beam.   They are false flag initiated by cops to increase their own salaries. ALWAYS  FOLLOW THE MONEY!!!!!!  --- What the protesters would say about any other topic.   "Protest against police pays for christmas shopping by police officers"   Just send Paulie and Furio over   Hey! I was there sept 2010 to march 2011. When I was there the area around Himmel was very quiet regarding small arms fire (only one incident) but there were still constant IED strikes in the western wadi where trucks had to cross from FOB Eddy.  Rasheed Gardens had a reputation based on what it was like when you were there, but we went through many times and never had a problem (even spent a few nights in their on ambush). The Taliban mostly stuck to the North, South, and East of the DC. If you went more then about 1-2KM in any of those directions you would get shot at. Within that perimeter there were still IED strikes, but like you said, they left coalition alone. They did hit patrols of ANA and ANP pretty close in a few times. We always thought it was kind of funny.....like we'd walk down a road 500 times and never have a problem...then you send some ANA down and all hell breaks loose. We heard you guys used to have a 105mm howitzer up on Roshan Tower for direct fire. There were still lots of holes in compounds along the eastern side of the eastern wadi as a reminder of this.   If the HBS guy hits a protester obstructing traffic on a bicycle with his BMW and then parks in front of a hydrant this city will burn.    Well I've seen it happen. Most ieds in afghanistan are HME consisting of powdered metals and fertilizer (not to go into too much detail) which is bullet sensitive. People in the USA market a similar produce for recreational target shooting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUyQqJi1_DY   Points are goals+assists   If a bunch of anti-abortion protesters sat down in the middle of the road and blocked your bike race, would you be more or less likely to support their cause?   The idea that America destroyed Afghanistan's infrastructure in 2001 is literally the stupidest thing I have ever heard on reddit.   Depends on the type. Many IEDs will trigger via a gunshot. Sometimes they are rigged up in trees to rain shrapnel down. These are known as directional fragmentation charge IEDs.   Sometimes they do. We were watching some dude dig a hole outside our cop. Suddenly there is an explosion and a guy missing both hands shows up at our place looking for medical attention.....oops   No. They are using the term "land mine" loosely. Most of these are IEDs laid in my Taliban. There ARE tons of landmines left over from the Russian war but they are generally in unpopulated areas that people have largely abandoned or surface laid because there were air/artillery dropped. The real danger is the ieds laid in populated areas to target the coalition.   Because if you lay in mines you don't want anyone removing them.   That's offensive to real stupid people and their families. End the S word.   Cried like a bitch at the gun range over a girl....how much more unfit can you get?   US Marine here. Between 2010 and 2011 my battalion was conducting counter insurgency operations in and around Musa Qala in Helmand Province. I stayed at OP Himmel for a few weeks and it has always stuck in my mind because it was a really pretty position built in the "motte-and-bailey" tradition and it very neatly commanded a narrow pass between two wadis. At the time it was pretty quiet other then some IEDs but we were told it was wild back when it was a british position. Anyone pass some time there?   A very significant part of training these days is focused on winning hearts and minds and minimizing force even when under hostile fire. Wouldn't it be nice if cops had been shot at a bunch before by real bad guys with PKMs and RPGs so they don't panic and open up at the slightest provocation?   Well if they keep the cops happy with a legal bribe maybe the cops will be less likely to ticket them for violating hackney carriage laws.    Yea, or maybe it was the 3000 people Bin Laden killed and the Taliban refusing to hand him over. On second thought, no, a 12 year old article that quotes other news sources and an israeli peace activist probably holds the truth. How could we all be so blind?     That is how it is done in many other nations (with regard to federal training). I would suggest moving the officers whenever promoted to avoid familiarity. I don't think forcing cops to get a BS in math or science is doing anything other than contributing to our student debt crisis and degree value deflation.   Between 18,000-20,000 since 2001. Between 75%-80% killed by the Taliban according to Brown university and the UN. That would leave the coalition responsible for a max of 5000 civilian deaths over 13 years. The level of evidence is probably pretty similar to what you see in many american swat raids.   Didn't see one oil well in Afghanistan.   Yea, who wouldn't want a fairly well paying union job with good benefits vs Walmart....   Don't you love it when civilians tell you how you are trained?   In the last decade or so soldiers have done A LOT of "protecting and serving"   The police is hardly a combative lifestyle. It's 99.9 percent giving tickets, driving around, and directing traffic. Most cops never fire their gun. Most combat vets realize this and the reason some become cops is because they know it is an easy job they are qualified for that pays fairly well. I'd be most worried about non vets that join the police and "want to go swat" from the beginning.   PAID OFF   Well that sounds better than "MW paid me 2 million dollars to say this."   I also think ex-soldiers, that where in combat, shouldn't be police officers.  Why? They probably have a better idea of what a reasonable use of force is than someone who signed up to carry a gun but was too afraid to go overseas. You might be surprised to know that the level of force to effect arrests in Afghanistan in the last 5 years is probably less than a swat raid in the USA.   I think they just shoot you   Their facebook is mostly fat old white dudes playing golf. https://www.facebook.com/pages/NEMLEC-Police-Foundation-Inc/337163706326925   Were the machine guns made before 1986? NO. Are suppressors, "assault weapons" or "high-capacity magazines" made post 1994 legal in MA? NO. Did they pay for a $200.00 tax stamp for the SBSs, SBRs, and flashbangs? NO.   How about 5 years in federal prison for every one of those illegal machine-guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns, and flashbangs? Then 5 years in state prison for each one of those "assault-weapons and "high-capacity magazines."   Right over your head.   It's "let's pretend it's 2007 again" week for the democrats.   Don't forget, BAH for the GI bill is getting CUT 1%.   Hipster Fight!   I nominate you. See you on the beach.   Follow the advice of the other posters regarding meeting with your career councilor, getting your resume set, and applying NOW. As I said before, the UMass system in worcester may be an option for employment, and the cost of living is cheap (my friend pays 650 for a 1 bedroom). Alternatively living in JP with some roommates could cost about the same, give you easy T access (no car needed) to A LOT of jobs, and be a real way to get out of the rut it sort of sounds like you are in. I suppose the place probably wouldn't be as nice as your house, but living in a crappy apartment with roommates is kind of THE way a lot of people have the most fun in their youth. You'll meet a bunch of new people and maybe find some direction.   I suppose everyone would have been better off if we just let the USSR do what they wanted.   At this point I would say so.   Thanks, it is a critical skill for functional people people.    Don't you know...the USA is responsible for everything bad that ever happened. In fact, did you know that violence and racism were invented by republicans in 1945? Fuck, we live in the most peaceful time in history...which is pretty much exactly concurrent with the level of American dominance on the world stage.    Most of the world can't handle democracy.   I lot of teenagers think the USSR and the Cold War were just something made up by mean old republicans to abuse brown people.   Do you feel guilty? Funny...I don't.   Do you have the check from the bank/can you access it online?   Did he deposit the check? If he didn't, cancel payment, if he did you should be able to find out who he is. This is fraud, report it to the police.   It means fuuuuckkk you (spits tobacco).... 'Murica   NO, you get their natural resources, plus you still need arms to defend against incursions from surrounding areas.    Yea, or you could just limit it to men over 14.   If we had just executed all detainees in Iraq there wouldn't be ISIS either...Seriously, why give this guy a mouthpiece? True or not, everything he says publicly is specifically designed to hurt the west and boost his cause.   Watch your cornhole bud (I mean seriously they will force corn up your ass)   Harvard member as well. Too busy to do much shooting these days.   Have you looked into getting a full time job? Based on your posting history you live near Boston which has a pretty good job market. The cost of living is high but if you have roommates it wouldn't be too bad. You could enjoy "the prime of your life," build a resume, pay down your loans, and decide if going back to school is right for you. EDIT. Worcester may be a good option as well, with lower rent. The Umass Medical system has a lot of jobs that may fit your degree.   "condemn" the action, begin an independent investigation, ask to send UN representatives to US detention facilities, anything that could at least spark a reasoned debate....not proclaim things you have no ability to enforce and will never happen.   LETS DO THIS-LEEEEERROOY JENKINS!!! *flexes and shoots gun in the air  	104
 What software did you use to remove malware and the like? and then to keep it off the machine? I usually just go for malwarebytes/adwcleaner and an installation of nod32   And extremely edgy.   yIlaD-qa'!   This is why people are afraid to come to EvE as a new player. The community is absolutely horrendous, and because of it I don't blame them.   I seriously doubt these teens follow their culture or subculture, but you never know I guess.   I imagine it's like choking yourself, you'd pass out before you'd actually die.   people actually upvoting this... no wonder people in /r/realsocialengineering are calling this sub a shithole.   If you're joking, you should have put a /s tag... just in case you're not: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_smashing   When would you do this?   The scandi hotdogs are good. *Really* good.   Conan did a hilarious remote on them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-BkKCUBGwQ   "She took the wireless adapter.. i've got another one." Best line. This isn't cringey, its actually pretty funny.   you're either a really bad troll or really stupid   he did get paid, just 5 months late. and still no travel expenses either ($600)   someones salty, just because he cant cast dosent mean his life is 'worthless' rofl. what an asshole.   Just switch this one, with this one... Take these two out- disable the prolinear reactor aaand i've got you control of the bridge cap'n.      I'd be so fucking mad if they brought it back to the Abrams Universe.   I like how you take a hypothetical, turn it into the worst possible situation, and then apply that to 100% of cases. Impressive, really.   Someone's a bit defensive. I don't think the person you replied too was being too serious mate...   It's amazing how relatable this is. If you've ever made something, you'll see someone say it's shit, but know that you've just done something wrong, and that the concept is still strong. You'll know that next time you can do it again, but better.   Considering a modder came out with those files not even one month later, I doubt it. They didn't trust us enough to make the decision for ourselves, now we have to not trust them anymore.   They just didn't trust us. Now instead of us *possibly* being mad over them not finishing it, we have no choice but not to trust them anymore. It's a much higher price IMO.   Not only this, but ubisoft didn't trust us to make the decision for ourselves. Okay, so the new graphics are a tad glitchy. Why not include them anyway and let people turn them on/off if they wanted to? I doubt the community would have reacted as badly to them saying 'were not finished but we're still giving you the option' as they are to them just straight up lying to us.   I gave them a call, probably expedited [this process.](http://i.imgur.com/lDBZX3t.jpg)   Isn't that a.. double positive? So they actually can't? Damnit man they've outsmarted us again!   Welcome to the world of customer service. "Now repeat after me Johnny, the customer is *always* right."   There's plenty of people on Ebay with 98%+ positive feedback and they don't have to bully their customers. Pray tell  how they can do it and this person can't?   I called them and reported it.    Making ISK in eve isn't about what makes you the most 'isk/hour', it's about finding the most isk/fun/hour.   [obligatory picture](http://puu.sh/9xC73/376c5918f6.png)   Thank fuck.   Excellent. I really liked the description in the last paragraph.   [Amazing.](http://i.imgur.com/EZsNgly.gif)   Cheers   Yeah I noticed that too after posting it here. It dosen't seem like theres many up to date free recourses like this one. If anything the theory probably still holds, but the practical side of things probably dosen't (99% of the links are broken, but the software is still out there).      Travel here for the city, not for the convention.   Really? If you use something like Airbnb you can get some pretty good accommodation for 45~ pounds a night, and if you pick the right place, a good host who is kind, and will answer any questions.   If you eat out every day then, yes, like any other country it will be expensive, although granted it's still not 'cheap' if your making your own meals.  Not sure what you mean by a nightmare traffic system? If you mean in terms of road congestion then you're going to find that in any large city you go to, not just London.  With the mass transit you just need to use the replacement bus' services on weekends, otherwise AFAIK they're usually pretty good about keeping everything open in the week days. It's not like you won't be able to get somewhere just because they've blocked off a few tube stations.  The people are welcoming when you get to know them. The stranger culture, on the other hand, is different than most American states, you won't find strangers being quite as cuddly towards each other. For the most part however, 99% of strangers i've encountered are kind and helpful. Just like any other large city.  In terms of things 'to do', as well, there's pretty much an endless list of museums, places to visit, clubs to go to, beautiful architecture, etc etc etc.    Obligatory 404 not found joke.   Currently using the ten keyless CM Storm Quickfire keyboard, am extremely happy with it. One thing I don't like though is how unless you have numock on, the arrow keys are always lit up. I'd like to have an option to just turn off all backlights.   I'm sure there's plenty of people that would watch this, and not just die hard fans of the series either. I for one am interested in being a DM and Koibu's style of DM'ing with the adaptation of 2e is really attractive to me. Thoughts?   Trust me when I say this, 90% of things said on this and the eve forums is speculation. Someone told someone something that CCP actually ghost patched two patches ago, and they still think is the truth. You're better off testing most things rather than asking them on these forums.  Citation: myself.   I don't have a link for you, just what i've been told.   Yes, warm them... warm them till they burn!   Qapla'!   They were testing it to see what the numbers were like.   If you jump through a gate and there's an EXCESSIVE ammount of cans/drones/ all around 12km~ off the gate then that's an exploit. They're actively trying to disable the cloaking mechanism for all people jumping through. Petition the GM's and they'll give you your ship back and warm the exploiters, and get rid of the items.   I'm curious, how long did it take you to get comfortable with malware analysis? Do you have a degree related to computer science? Cheers.   Tweeter them this link. There's no point of a boycott if they don't know it's happening, or why for that matter.  Here's a copy paste tweet for the lazy:  @PNY_Tech @kingstontech http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/284k11/kingston_and_pny_have_been_caught_in_a_bait_and/   The title and it's bias fits this subreddits circlejerk perfectly.   Really nice overview I found, if anyone has anything like this which isn't too long but provides a nice bit of information i'd be glad if you could post it here.       Just wanted to point out your description of airstone, made me laugh because it reads like one of those infomercials (/r/hailcorporate?).  We used airstone for the patio.  It's great because it is 75% less weight than real stone, so you don't need to build any footers, yet it still looks and feels like real stone.  It's cheaper than real stone, you can only get it at Lowe's.  It's best to cut it with a hack saw, but you could also use a band saw if needed.  No need for any mortar or mess, you simply apply it with any outdoor construction adhesive (we used locktite) and you're good to go!    [mirror here](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/images/products/grundtal-mirror__26202_PE093307_S4.JPG)   Good thing we didn't ask for your opinion.   Three points:  1.This post reeks of insecurity. No one that's remotely successful in real life feels the need to defend themselves in a 1500 word essay to a bunch of internet strangers, unless of course they're, in some way, invested in that community. Why take the time?  I really have no interest in this game or community anymore  Seriously? See my above point.    2.You still haven't apologized for when you did flame him. No 'sorry', no 'I guess I did something bad'. In fact, you completely avoid the matter of reconciliation and just say that the fact that you've stopped is enough. Seriously, WTF? Anyone with basic reasoning skills can see the absurdity of this.  3.The fact that you just deleted the comment you got called out on (http://i.imgur.com/rnYE344.png) means we can't trust your comment history, or your claims of not flaming him in 6 months.You even reply to that comment not with a humble or an apologetic tone, but with the words "Haha I forgot about that". Seriously? Is this how a person who works "full time in a STEM field" acts? Although TBH doing tech support is working in a STEM field too, I guess.   awesome, thank you for all your input.   Thanks for the detailed answer, it's interesting hearing your perspective on it. On the thing about C/C++ i've made some pretty long programs in Java, will that come in useful? I assume people have made malware embedded in java programs before? Also, should I just randomly choose whether to go with C or C++ or perhaps go for C++ because thats closest to what I know?   Another question, what do you mean by 'learn the PE'? Do you mean just getting an overview of it through somewhere like this website: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx or is there a book that you could recommend? Cheers again.   So I should learn Assembly - Python - C - C++? Cheers for the info about the calling codes, will read up on that.   Cheers for the detailed reply. I'll definately look into that python book. What's your take on C/C++ in terms of priority to learn for analysis? I've heard that Java and C++ are quite similar so the leap wouldn't be that hard for me.   I already know a bit of java, from what i've heard it's useful to know C/C++ (both?), Assembly, and Python(?), which one should I learn first?   For books, i've read on this subreddit that Malware Analyst's Cookbook and Practical Malware Analysis are the best? Any other books you'd recommend? I have a basic background in CS, nothing graduate level however.   Would you recommend I read up on other, broader, fields before Malware Analysis, perhaps something like forensic analysis for windows?  Cheers.    There are still plenty of bad extensions in the chrome webstore, many of which i've reported and have not been taken down.   Kill mails?   He just said it on Unfiltered. ChanmanV's vods will be up soon.   For those wondering what happened with the Sapinda article -  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/22pe3w/a_look_at_the_major_players_behind_the_sapinda/ Richard Lewis received a libel lawsuit for that article and thus decided to take it down.   Any tips for flying ECM?   Title. I'm also interested in pentesting, both digital and physical so any recommendations there would be great (already saw this awesome post: http://www.reddit.com/r/realsocialengineering/comments/1z3qzn/looking_for_information_getting_started_in_the/)  Edit: forgot to search before, apologies for the repost.   Tutorial will not restart. If you want to go through them again, however, you could just make a new character for the sake of it.  Edit: To expand on the corp thing, someone like Brave Newbies or E-Uni is good for new players. E-Uni especially because one of their 'selling points' is holding classes for free.   My god you perfectly captured the ambient sound. My sides.   This is the most well put and logical sentence i've ever seen on reddit. are you a Vulcan?   If your electronic device shorts out do not turn it on. Turning it on will only make it short out again and thus further damage the electronics.   I wish youtube would have something like twitch.tv where if you want to support a specific person you just unblock their domain, e.g. twitch.tv/taketv.*  I'd be more than willing to turn off adblock for the people that I want to support on youtube. Unfortunately Google seems to be the ones behind the times this time.   That private chat about sandwiches sure looks Opsec, hhhehhehe. ontopic: that happens sometimes. its annoying.   dear god my sides, someone give this man gold.   I'd like in on this too, please. Any against the notion of polygamy?   Did you get to hug a sloth? Were they soft and cuddly?    You're not meant to get it.   People downvoting you just because they don't get the reference, lol, how salty of them.   OMG /r/ladybonersgonecuddly now!!!   they were just ratting? im pretty new to this game so i wouldnt know that just by the kb, i was just genuinely interested in what the term carebear was used for   uwotm8? my question was about the term carebear because i thought that was just for highsec gankers. ive seen plenty of other people too ask simply questions and get negative scores for some odd reason.   lol. love how this subreddit downvotes legitimate questions, its pretty mindboggling   i'm confused, who in eve is a carebear?   I'm surprised I didn't notice it earlier.    [I know what im doing to make my isk tonight.](http://i.imgur.com/dzDsW.jpg)   [This is the only thing I could think of while reading your post.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n9-5hkWRXps/U0Epu8vIIqI/AAAAAAAAQIg/RzUGmQ6SEoo/s320/fingerless-gloves-fedora.png)   Johan Liebert, anyone?   This should be possible, but only with every titan in EvE doing it within a 10 minute window.   I'm re watching the second half of ENT (can't stop loving that xindi story arc) and i've noticed that when one of the crew wakes up from being unconscious, they'll often say something like "It feels like a shuttlecraft just hit my head" or "it feels like I just ran into a brick wall". Anyone else notice this or am I just crazy?   Before you go around calling someone shit at something you better be less shit than they are.    Cheers   That's a very beautiful picture.   so basically like every other eve corp but just with fun coms?   are you tishu? plz no slave set pullerino.   Kinky.   Especially if you can coordinate your EWAR with your DPS alpha, it can be amazing.   To get all the EWAR frigates to III and their EWAR skill counterparts to III required takes about 15 days. To IV takes about 42 days. This is not including required support skills like CPU Manag. IV.  This is also assuming you get base EWAR skills like Target Painting and Sensor Linking to IV to train Signal Suppression and Signature Focusing to III. Not exactly a few hours.   Hate to break it to you but what the other people in this thread said was true. Apart from there being discreet similarities the games are really nothing alike. I guess if you ran a guild the managment skills would be comparable but even then it's pushing it.  If you're completely new to the game: do the tutorials, do the sisters of eve quest line. Look at this website: http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ and find out what you want to do. Join a corp for it. Get better at it, and above all have fun.   You won't find any other syndicate corp of that size accepting people one month old, that's for sure.   wait, accurate? as in god actually does this shit? what an asshole.   I usually get my cables within one week. Usually about 4 days later.    I thought you were talking about your ui being all blurred out....   CHEERS   can i see your blackbird fit?   Assault frigates are good for solo pvp afaik   You...you mean drop bears are real!??!   We even have our own water boarding center right in the depths of the MI5 building! Just insult the queen to g   There's a biiig difference between trying to be a good troll and trying to get negative karma. One requires subtlety, and the people you're talking to not really sure if they're being trolled. The other requires stating one of the dozens of opinions that the hivemind will downvote, and it's a lot easier than the former.    They told me they had been watching me the entire time  are you sure they were the *real* police and not the panty police?   I'm laughing my ass off trying to imagine someone chuckling slyly while smuggling this fish into the bathroom.   Was it 11 minutes long? Was it aimed to shock the viewer, possibly lowering the viewers enjoyment of the website because of it? Since you didn't counter with that i'll assume not.   Dosen't matter how true you think it is. It just has no place being that long or being placed on a website completely unrelated to the subject content, or being 11 minutes long, or having a shock advertisement when people just want to relax and watch video games.  Please don't try and hijack the thread to talk about your personal opinions on education. This isn't /r/education or /r/vegan.   Pretty much, that was nothing but a legitimate question and yet you get downvoted for it. What a bad way to represent a community.   Lol at the people downvoting you. I was actually wondering the same thing as your question, people are really salty and take this game way too seriously in this subreddit. You only downvote someone if they don't add anything to the conversation, not if you think they're a filthy casual.   I see, thanks.   Can someone that knows what they're talking about ELI5 the conclusions of this document?   Cat.   Not just newbie friendly, stupid friendly!

                You're right  People who eat meat are worse than Satan.  What right to they have to eat something besides rice and beans and the McDonalds dollar menu?  Scum.   Why are they all lying and out to get you???  I want to help so came up with a resource that will help you in the future.  Bon apetit!  http://www.theinspiredbudget.com/index.php/the-cost-of-beans-and-rice-for-one/   Yeah, you're right.  Everybody is lying to you about food prices.  I mean, there's no way you could possibly check it for yourself, right?   I mean, there's a dollar value menu, right? *cough dunce*   Let them eat rice and beans!  (Price of rice and beans may vary depending on the strength of the dollar.)   http://www.cnbc.com/id/101588110  http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-food-prices-rise-fed-keeps-a-wary-eye-1404672384  http://thefederalist.com/2014/07/08/food-prices-are-soaring-and-washington-doesnt-care/  It's called inflation and it's what happens when your money becomes worth much less.

I spent lots of time outside too. Tell your doctor that you want to get blood tests done for vitamin d. It's easy. Our go straight to an endo.   By my next appointment I was in normal levels. I have to get blood drawn after my script runs out because it can become toxic. Always been fine for me though.    Newsflash: Anything that contradicts you and your subreddit's cult-like opinions on the subject of global warming are going to be rejected.   That is called breathing your own fumes, or, as I like to call it greenhousing yourself.   The mods on this subreddit couldn't paint themselves in a more cartoonish way if they were trying to parody themselves.    Racism, sexism, etc.    I toured that prison back in 2002. Was it the San Pedro prison in downtown Rio? Read the book "Marching Powder" for more info.    My endocrinologist prescribed me 50,000 ius of Vitamin D to take weekly and now my levels are in the normal range.    HA! That's great! Apparently the ONLY articles that are acceptable about global warming on this about are the ones that fall into lockstep with your Nazi-like beliefs on the subject and all other views are to be shouted down. Tell me, are Republicans not going to investigate the what they believe are the fudging of the numbers from NASA? If not show me where that is proven false. Whether or not NASA has done so or not is beside the point. The Republicans ARE in fact going to investigate those claims. And this sure as Hell relates to global warming.   So fuck off and ban me if you can't rationally deal with opposing points of view.    I guess you're new here. Here's how Reddit works. Sometimes people post articles written by other people. It's fairly simple really. Glad I could help.    Oh, so we have to have PhD's do post articles here now? Surely replies require a PhD also. Where is yours?    $18 Trillion in debt.

So uh... the lady stepped into the road.    Specist.    So I interviewed for a sales job I really want and they wanted me to go meet with four of their sales people. I thought the interview went great. After meeting with them they all had high praise for the company making me want to work there all the more. The sales people I talked to said that I needed to keep following up and that the mgrs I interviewed with would assume that anyone that didn't follow up didn't really want the job. I mailed two hand-written thank you notes two days after the interview and sent email follow-ups after each two sales people I met with. The problem is that I have since left several voicemails with no return and when I did get ahold of one of them he said he was on his way to a meeting and would call me back. (He didn't).

"the NBC anchor was nowhere near that aircraft or two other Chinooks flying in the formation that took fire." The report cited interviews with "crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire."

Why produce a show that's going to be a ratings failure when you can run a rerun for with no production cost that will also be a ratings failure?   Leno was a ratings machine.

Part of me wants Ward to feel bad at what he did to Fitz and part of me just wants him to continue down his path of evil and openly mock Fitz's current state. Long live evil!Ward.    I think Fitz knows deep down because he's still a very intelligent young man, but he hasn't come to terms with that reality because he's trying to lie to himself (think Shutter Island style). I think we'll get a really heartbreaking scene when he "lets go" of dream!Simmons.    They keep showing Skye's creepy (and possibly alien) dad with blood on his hands. I MUST KNOW MORE.    I really want to know more about Coulson's episodes. Does he blackout during these? Does he just feel an unnaturally compelled to draw these symbols and lines he sees in his head? Will it become a serious impairment as his new job as the director of SHIELD?   And more importantly - how does this tie into the 084 and the overall season plot?    "And that's just tip of the iceberg!"   "... now let's get out of here before the iceberg runs of out of fuel."    Great episode for developing Lance's character - I'm still not quite sure I believe Lucy Lawless's character is gone for good though. I feel like she might get resurrected somehow and crawl out of her grave they made a big point of showing this episode.     I still cannot get over Nathan Petrelli's molestache and European footballer hair. Dear make up department, there is a way to do too much. You have succeeded.    Fitz and Mack did have some great bonding moments this episode though. Though I'm afraid of liking this guy... we know what happens when the audience starts to like someone in Whedon land.    Though it would be an interesting twist if Simmons actually did leave Fitz because he's slightly brain damaged now and she just wants to work with the best and brightest to advance science.   More likely, she's trying to use Hydra's better resources and equipment to help fix Fitz.    Who's in charge of Skye's wardrobe this season? They are clearly obsessed with black shirts with cutouts/random strappy lines.   Poor Fitz - you could literally feel his frustrations coming through in the is episode. Also, it's going to be a heartbreaking scene when he realizes/comes to terms with the fact that Simmons left him.    And the biggest OMG moment was the preview of the next episode. I really hope Simmons is just infiltrating Hydra because she needs the resources to fix Fitz. Though it would be a nice angle if she just gave up on Fitz because he's slow now and she just wants to work with the brightest and best in pursuit of science.    Miller's Crossing, The Godfather, and Hot Fuzz.    Aw you'll be missed Brad. And good luck again with all your future endeavors.   I'll forever cherish your throne - so much squishier than my current computer chair. Now if only I could figure out how to make it tilt back like it's supposed to...    Hey, I'm interested in the black and white Anthro tunic. How long is it?    And humans won!    Great link - I wasn't in that uber cab so I can't comment. We took one 30 mins prior and it was $45. I'm just saying as a psa everyone should be warned. I had no idea they had policies like that.   My roommate just paid $190 for a ride from downtown Raleigh to Morrisville. A regular cab would have cost right around $40. Watch out - they didn't know the fare until they were getting off.    Aww... I'll totally play as Cally and use my move to shoot you in the face.    Read an article on how Ted Melfi got Bill Murray to star in his movie. Trailer looks good - would be interested if anyone has the script that interested Bill Murray enough to reach out to this first time writer/director (for a feature film).    Noo you said you were coming last week!    Would anyone be interested in playing Munchkin Quest this Sunday...? :D    Asara? Or something fantasy-ish.    The Awesome Covers collection.    Board gaming is moving to Morrisville starting this week. As usual, use this place to discuss what games and food you are bringing.   Don't forget this week is long game day - so we'll be starting at 2 PM.   If you're new - PM me for the address.    And the best so far.    There are two scenarios I would accept: 1. Ward is a broken man all season, then gets broken out by Hydra, reasserts his evilness 2. Ward plays their sympathies, finally convinces them he's had a change of heart and then betrays them all mwhahaha   Milk that sympathy and then betray them all Ward!! Evil!Ward forever!   I know... it was so much worse than it was first presented. :'(    LOL - the joys of watching live.     Is she really dead though??    OMG and it got worse. SO MUCH WORSE.    Is she really dead though? She did just grab some weird alien tech thing right before she "died".    Jed proving himself to be a true Whedon :(    OMG IT WAS WORSE THAN I INITIALLY THOUGHT. NOOOOooooo   OH SHIT OH SHIT. THAT ENDING.    Coulson is too cute.    Aw Coulson trying to act tough. Too cute.    Milk that sympathy and then betray them all Ward!! Evil!Ward forever!    Poor Fitz :( This is probably the most real fallout/consequence of all of the events that happened at the end of last season.    Oh no Fitz!!   Robin Taylor is doing an awesome job. Penguin was the highlight of the pilot for me.    It seems like the kid who plays Bruce is not half bad though, judging from that last scene so I'll reserve judgement on the whether or not having Bruce in the main plotline will be good or bad.    I think cinematography really sells the grittiness of Gotham well.    Ditto. I was not expecting to see him in pilot so I definitely had a ! moment when he showed up.   Really all the casting is spot on. Ben McKenzie is doing a great Gordon and Robin Taylor is a great Penguin.     Yup completely agree. I wish they had paced the show a little better (especially with the villains) but this is just a problem that network pilots run into. You basically have to use the first episode to hook your viewers so you need to throw every single crazy plot twist/characters into it. All the character introductions were solid though a little rushed. We should have had a couple of episodes to establish Mooney   Penguin's relationship and also a couple to establish Gordon and Harvey's relationship - that way the last scene would have been more powerful. Like Penguin realizing he's on the brink of loosing everything from his attempt at betraying Mooney and Gordon realizing the true extent of his partner's corruption would have made for a way more powerful scene.   On a side note, everyone is wonderfully cast and I look forward to this season. This was a solid pilot and solid way of introducing all the characters very quickly.     Ooo... is this going to be a new service? I like. :)    I'm running a little late - will be there around 5:30.    Ops sorry for the confusion, I am bringing sour cream!   Won't be necessary. EDIT: I'm doing a mango salsa and a corn side and bring sour cream.    Remind me if I forget about those stools.   I'll be there with some spinach and artichoke dip as well as fish tacos!

Surely no show is worth that much... for $2M/episode you could easily produce 22 solid episodes of new content.    Companies NEED competition, otherwise they turn into monopolies. And we need constant the innovation and improvement, otherwise we pay up the ass for subpar service.    I have to say, it improved a lot towards the latter half of the season and I actually started to get invested. I do have to agree that the pilot was one of the worst I've seen in recent memory. SO many stereotypes.    Hey I'm interested in the BR red skirt and blue Gap shorts. Will you take $25 for the both of them including shipping (I live in NC)?

The Godfather! I've been watching that movie at least once a year for the last 15 years.    I'm baaaaack!   No I did not but I had just applied to two different credit cards that were giving me 50,000 AA miles and 40,000 UA miles if I spent 5k in the first 3 months so worked out perfectly.    I used cardpool when I was buying a set of new appliances for my house (washer, dryer, fridge, stove, dishwasher) which winded up being around $5k worth of gift cards. No problems whatsoever.

I'm taking a road trip with my SO and we're doing a bunch of (casual) hiking and will probably be walking around outdoors for most of the day. I know it's going to be insanely hot and I've never done much hiking before - what types of clothes should I be wearing? I've heard people say looser cotton/natural fabric items or even cotton sundresses. I was originally planning on just wearing tanks/tees with gym shorts (or something similar to that) - what do you guys think? Should I throw some loose cotton sundresses in there? (Or will I look like a fool traipsing around the parks in a dress?)   Also, any recommendations on a reasonably fashionable hat to wear?   Thanks in advance!   EDIT: Thanks for all the great tips. And don't worry I will definitely plan on bringing enough water and sunscreen.   Going to be making dinner for my parents tonight so I'm out this week.

Holy crap Chris Pratt as a undercover agent posing as a hardcore biker? 10/10 would be SO awesome.    This one of those great song in movie scenes that will always be with me.    This must have been incredibly difficult to shoot for both the director/crew and the actors. Practically *everything* is green screen.    RIP the flip cam.    I'll be there. Bringing my friend Richard again.    You know you can turn that off under settings by setting notifications off.    Thanks for offering to do this! I sent over a very short story!    I think it's a good tool for for highlighting adverbs and passive voice. Thanks for sharing.   I'm now 100% on board for an Uncharted movie with Chris Pratt as Nathan Drake.    **"Unspoken"**  Two characters talk about an event without ever referring to the actual event itself, but the details and repercussions are made clear through their dialogue.

This is beautiful - are you a native writer of either arabic or chinese scripts?    Yes! I am absolutely committing line to memory. My favorite super villain comparing his role to my favorite action movie villain. My day was made.    Came here to say this.    Availability heuristic in the US. I'd say Bebop probably deserves the spot for legacy, but personally I'd vote for Baccano.    You should really give it another shot. There's a reason why it's a plot point that both fans and writers pretend never happened. My personal recommendation is just to skip the entire second half of season 6 starting from when it happens.    I feel like this just gets more and more ridiculous every year.    This comment needs to be higher.    This is an absolutely beautiful album. Great images of daily life and fashion in Tehran and Iran in general. (Women really rock those scarves!) I had no idea the city was this modern and pretty! Thanks so much for sharing.    SO good. I've seen this movie like 3 more times this year.    I bet - usually happened right before all the pre-frosh and their parents start touring the campus.    LOL - this just makes me think of all the times they were returfing the grass near the West Campus bus stop and then you were forced to walk along those stupid diagonals to get to the bus stop instead of being able to cut across the grass.    There was a kid in my 7th grade class who was a little weird, but one day he showed up to class one morning and he had stitched thread into his cheek (at least 3 or 4 stitches). The needle was still hanging off the end of the thread and was just grinning like crazy when people saw it.   The teacher called for security real quick.     I'll be there!    Check your spam folder.

 It could have stayed there.  She escalated the situation.   Thanks.   You're the best!   Wow, you look SO much better.  7.5/10.  You're thin now, so you can tuck in your shirt and look good.  Thin people privilege.     Facially; you are marginally attractive but you'd do well to update your facial hair and haircut.  Body wise; get in shape.  You're like a 6 but you could work that up to maybe an 8.   What % of the world population is willing to give up driving their petrol cars?   A bit off topic, but when I was in the Navy, just getting out of boot camp - SO MANY people got tattoos of inspirational words in other languages (Asian languages).  Later on, when I was in Asia, I learned from snickering locals that many of my shipmates' tattoos did not actually say what they thought they said.   Adjustable dumbbell set, a bench, and a pull up bar.   I use mine for a seat when meditating as well.  And to prop up my window.  And a pillow.  It basically does everything.   Nice ass.  9/10   Is this....it's mating call?   Seriously.  Like, they know they're not going to get any positive attention out at a bar so they have to bully people into acknowledging them by being boisterous and larger than life.   Brilliant.   ha, thanks.  Yes, I forget about this sub sometimes.  Good call.   Seriously.  It's like they're wearing their character, or the lack there of, on their sleeve; not *really* knowing what things like integrity and discipline are, just insisting that at their core, under their fat exterior, those traits exist.   You've made the right call.   Thanks!    I'm a fan of BSN Syntha - 6.  It's whey better than others I've tried.   This happened last night.  I'm at a bar for a happy hour after work with some coworkers.  It's getting later, most people I work with have funneled out, leaving just some good friends.  There is an attractive girl standing at the bar, looking bored, so  I walked up to her and struck up a conversation.  This is where the story starts.  I did not notice that she had a friend with her.  Her friend (let's call her Fatty for short) had a pretty face but was probably 70-85 lbs overweight. Fatty kept on interjecting into the conversation I was trying to continue with attractive girl (Fit Girl for short).  It was *really* annoying.  She'd respond to questions I'd pose to Fit Girl. She'd interrupt Fit Girls responses and even answer questions that Fit Girl asked me. Fit Girl was annoyed, you could tell, but you could also tell that she was probably used to this kind of treatment from her friend.   As I grew increasingly annoyed with the situation, my frustration became visible through my tone and body language.  Fatty challenged me with, "Oh, so you don't want to talk to me?"    "No," I said, "I was really trying to talk to [Fit Girl]."  Fatty asked "Why?"  Fatty asked if it was because I didn't like "nice girls with good personalities."  I said I didn't like her personality.  She retorted with, "You don't even know me!"  This is where I became a blunt shitlord.    I explained to Fatty that I did know her and I knew that her personality did not meet my standards.  I knew she lacked discipline, self control, and fore site. I knew we couldn't participate in certain activities that I enjoyed. And then she asked, "why? because I'm a big girl."  "A big girl."  I said, "Yes, it's because you're FAT."  Fatty was SHOCKED.  Like it's some secret that everyone knows but can't talk about and I broke that golden rule to speak that unspoken truth and the sound of it just blew her mind.   I left.  I didn't get to finish talking to Fit Girl. Fatty was butthurt.   TL:DR - I explained to an obnoxious fat girl at a bar why I could tell from her being fat that our personalities would not align.       Can we consolidate?     Nice beer choice.   Love it.   You are BEAUTIFUL.  9/10.   When you're about to make that decision, reach under your shirt, grab your fat, and tell it that it does not make the decisions.   Can you please teach them to harmonize and post a video?   FINALLY!!!   They know.  They know when it's quiet time.  Furry little rebels.     Please stop doing duckface.  6/10.   I love it when they chirp.   Might I suggest peanut butter.     This seems like a problem that kitten mittens won't fix.   Wow.   And eventually, you'll feel like shit if you don't exercise and feel amazing during.       	34
  Like most people who vote for Republicans, you aren't making even a little bit of an effort to engage with reality.   Condescending tone noted.   Public financing of higher education might not address plummeting admissions standards, but piling huge debt loads on the shoulders of young people is also not a solution to that problem.  Did I say that adding more debt is a solution? The debt is a symptom. That's what I said. Did you read?  Whatever else you might be referring to as a "root cause" is probably something that isn't even real  So you are making assumptions that I must be a hallucinating Republican. I just make s*** up. That must be it.   Or maybe you can ask me like a normal person what I mean, instead of being so condescending and pretentious.   As far as tax reform goes, it sounds like you've got some sort of trickle-down sickness. Wealth definitely does not flow from billionaires to normal folks, no matter how much more favoritism our economy shows to the billionaires.   Your second [straw-man](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman) argument. Did I say anything of the such? Basically you have categorized me as a Republican, therefor you slap random talking points on me, and then argue against those.   Fortunately, no one (except apparently /u/train_subject5136 ) believes taxation trickles down.  Really not sure how you got that from what I said. Same straw-man argument. Instead of making stupid assumptions, ask me what I mean    You really should be upset at whoever put such a foolishly toxic idea into your mind.  I guess I should be mad at Santa or the tooth fairy.    You mean like Germany? Who has a higher barrier for entry to get into college, and doesn't let everyone go to college?   And I really hate the comparisons to European countries that are 1/20th our size. Netherlands has a **significantly** less diverse population. I'm not sure what this fascination is about taking these small European countries that are *nothing* like the USA, and trying to apply their policies here. Also don't forget their taxes are significantly higher, *for everyone, not just the rich*.  People also like to site Denmark, but they too will have issues with their job market in the future. See [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/free-universities-and-no-student-loan-debt-is-hurting-denmarks-economy-2014-6). Not the best or most detailed source, but this is sort of what happens when you throw around free tuition for all.  I'm all for lowering the cost of education - but just subsidizing it is absolutely the wrong approach. We need to be selective of how many people get free tuition, as well as what majors they can take. We can't subsidize 1,000,000 people getting sociology majors. We would be setting them all up to fail.  The issue is with universities raising their tuition, and the government continually subsidizing this inflated tuition. There are many other issues as well, such as the cultural mindset of the necessity of going to college and drowning ourselves in debt for worthless degrees.   Making tuition free across the board solves absolutely nothing. Not to mention institutions will just raise their tuition accordingly. I would like to see less students going to college, and more students getting work that does not require an official 4 year degree. See Mike Rowe.    I find Liberal arguments tend to be watered-down, over simplified, and shortened. I see liberal memes all the time that illicit the kind of, "F*** those damn Republicans/banks/rich ppl" etc, with out going into any detail of why something is the way it is.  Liberals are often not interested in deep discussion, but pointing at a few numbers and screaming "they hate the poor, rich people are evil" etc. It's really repetitive, and appeals to the lowest common denominator.  I'm not saying Republicans/conservatives don't this - but to say *"it deals with nuance and how far to go in one direction or the other. It doesn't lend itself to bumper stickers or Facebook memes very well. "* I think is very untrue.  The other problem is that Liberals are intent on fixing symptoms instead of the root cause of a problem. Bernie Sanders for example wants to make tuition free - this is a perfect example of patching up a symptom, instead of taking the (more difficult to do, and more difficult to sell to the masses) approach of fixing the root cause.  /u/tommyrp says below:   The problem with Liberalism is that it dosen't actually solve any of the problems. The solution is always the same, lets take money from one group of people and hand it to another group of people. Healthcare too expensive? Let someone else pay for it, can't afford food? Let someone else pay for it. Education too expensive, lets subsidies student loans with someone elses money. I've never see any Liberal actually talk about actually fixing the real issues of cost in healthcare, education or poverty.  Liberalism nowaday just seems to mostly be a finger pointing game, riling up emotions of people who aren't doing well, using their pain and directing at political opponents. Liberals by and large appear to be *petty*, and operate on the theme "It's conservatives/rich folk/wall street's fault". It might be partially true, but when that is your only message, it's hard to take you seriously.       /r/politics is a liberal fest. I assume you're joking, or stupid.   I sort of agree with you, except for the socialist-like stances he takes on some things would be detrimental to the country as a whole. One example, the "free tuition for all" is a short-sighted 'solution' that covers up a symptom instead of fixing the root cause. Also his ideas about tax reform are downright insane, and would increase the tax burden of **all** Americans. Those kind of stances would still force me to vote for a Republican over Bernie.   Missing x-axis labels, missing y-axis units, arbitrary shapes in the line graphs...    "How not to make graphs and charts"   BUT I THOUGHT JAVA WAS A DYING LANGUAGE?!   I think people also forget that it has always been much harder to beat Nadal in Grand Slams (where you need to win 3 sets, not 2). Nadal has always done historically much better at grand slams. Although I question his physical capacity. He could mentally and physically wear down opponents in the past. I don't think he can do that now.   It should be illegal to put police sirens in a radio commercial.   Most likely final:  Djokavic vs Federer  I'm down with that.   It's possible Nadal will need to beat Djok, Murray, and then Federer to win the title.  Damn that's gonna be hard. But if he pulls it off... #greatestever   Umm that's only .25%. What about the other 9.75%?   For another comparison, an Olympic pool is 660,000 gallons.   Just for comparison, an Olympic size swimming pool is 660,000 gallons. So this oil spill is about 1/6th of that.   Not saying it's OK. Just stating facts. It's still bad when so close to the shoreline. If this spill was in the middle of the ocean, it would have little effect.   Actually to be fair I'm not sure how to make the phone numbers line up. My text looks like yours except the phone numbers are uneven. There is probably an easy way to fix it. not sure how though   Nice. I did something similar very quickly using Sublime Text. No regex required   Lol thanks for the advice... I wouldn't have put it in there if I couldn't afford to lose it.    How did I not know about Odin?   Yup. They are walking away from this thinking: "Worth it".   Ok I'm kind of new to webdev (like really new). Is Dreamweaver for 'developers', or is it actually for developers? Not clear what it does.   I've been holding this since I bought it about 3 months ago. Down around 50%. I'm tempted to cut my losses. I only put in about $100. Thoughts?   holy cow it's up 98%. Hope you bought some.    using the emotional charged "anti vaxxer"  what you should have said is:   using the emotionally charged "anti vaxxer"   Hence why Bernie Sander's proposal for 'free tuition' does absolutely nothing to solve the problem.   Sadly it happens anyway on Reddit to a lot of conservatives. I see comments downvoted solely due to difference of opinion.   You said you are conservative. He won't bother answering you.   He accidentally aggroed an entire mob. We tried to AoE but to no avail.      This one guy was doing fine, and then he 12(b)(6)ed all over the place. The judge was having none of it.   5 years from now, there will be a few options to purchase a car that drives autonomously in select cities. But you will still be required to grab the wheel occasionally.   That is a very big step away from having cars drive around on their own   Well I have that stupid Tmobile warranty, but the deductible is stupid high.    So it's OK to treat non-minimum wage workers like beaten dogs?   Yes   I should have specified that this wasn't this way to begin with. Are you saying this is something that happens often to you?   So every time I turn on my camera, it is completely out of focus. It doesn't focus properly until I point the camera at something really far away ( 15 feet). I noticed that it's actually setting the focus to be very short - about 3 inches - every time I turn on the camera.  Any workarounds?   Lol no I haven't seen the girl since my senior year in high school. I'm very happy with my wife   Hell no.  It took me almost 10 years to realize there was this girl who liked me.  We were on an exchange trip in France, and we split off from the group and went into a plush garden and laid down next to each other.   She slept on my shoulder on the bus.  She danced with my best friend to make me jealous.  10 years after it happened, when telling the story to my wife, I realized she had tried pretty hard to get me to make a move. I was just totally clueless.  EDIT: For typo   I know a lot of Jews over 6 feet.   Oh, my wife's a 10/10 for you, too? Ha Ha Ha!   Thanks - I'm not so great with PL/SQL so any help is appreciated.   I want to drop a table, but there are other tables that depend on it (foreign key). Is there a way I can programatically find all such tables, and disable the constraints (temporarily) so I can drop the table?   EDIT: I did notice there is a table called "USER_CONSTRAINTS". A query like:      select TABLE_NAME from USER_CONSTRAINTS        where R_CONSTRAINT_NAME like 'my_table%'; --'%' for trailing space  Returns the 5 tables that have a FK constraint on my table. Not sure what to do with it though.   Please do - I made the website. I might at some point add some contact info for kashrus agencies or chabad or something   www.askyourlor.com   www.askyourlor.com   I'm not sure what you mean   My great-grandfather has a lifetime business of owning taxis in New York. I wonder how much money he's lost because of Uber. Not complaining. Just wondering.   Great there goes the traffic on Touhy and Mccormick   EDIT: Shoot I had the bot do 12 years initially.  I'd say there is a 50/50 change more than 5% of cars are self driving in 13 years. Maybe 15 is a bit much. What would the bet be? We'd both have to be on Reddit 15 years from now. There is a Remindme Reddit bot we can use.  RemindMe! 13 years "5% of cars are self driving within 13 years"     Yea good point. No excuses for being this stupid   Why do you think it's probably true?   Well that's just mean   He clearly does not speak English as a first language. Maybe that's where the breakdown is?   There is a difference than finishing their product, and actually getting it used around the world. Obvious problem is cost - not everyone will be able to afford it. Second problem is testing. They only test in 1 or two cities. It would have to be tested ALOT more to be approved for global usage. It will be 15 years before we see more than 5% of cars on the road being self-driving   We will be lucky if self driving cars can be purchased and used in more than 1 city 5 years from now   This reminds me of when people freaked about us running out of whale oil.   We will find a substitute. We'll be just fine without helium   Forget about it passing. The idea simply doesn't work. What would prevent colleges from raising rates if the government is paying for it all? Do you force colleges to freeze tuition? How do colleges compete if they are all free? How do we afford to pay for all of this?   I disagree that we are even close to the point of no return.  And even if that's true - then why would we do anything about it? The point is alarmism does NOT get your point across correctly to those that don't agree with you. Sensationalism works to stir up people who already agree with you, but alienates those that don't. If the end goal is to get things done, then sensationalism is the wrong approach. That's all.   This seems to be the theme of US politics, sadly.   Yea except that's not what the graph shows, and it's been well over 30 years since our astronomical increase in CO2 usage. We should have seen an exponential increase in temperature - but we haven't. The temperature increase has been linear at best.   I don't think they will figure it out, and it is more or less inconsequential to me or them. Not having headlights on is dangerous. Having a blinker on? Slightly annoying   So then say that. The, "They pay **more** than their fair share" statement is very misleading.   Where did all those people talking about how biased Moody's is? Hmmm... [These people](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/35r73k/chicagos_debt_rating_was_just_cut_to_junk_at/)   How can someone who pays general taxes **AND** gas taxes, tollways, permits, stickers, etc - compare to someone who **ONLY** pays general taxes? By definition the drivers pay more.     Gas taxes and other fees cover less than half of road maintenance and construction costs. The rest is covered by general taxpayers at all levels of government, so people walking, biking and and riding transit are paying more than their fair share.  Um so that means that those who drive pay gas taxes, AND general taxes. Wtf is this logic? It states exactly the opposite. They pay less. I'm not saying I care, I'm just saying this doesn't prove their point.   RemindMe! 5 years "An Antartic Ice Shelf should collapse"   People that are passionate about something they think they understand (but don't), while thinking other passionate people also don't understand that thing - scare me.   That falls into, "Just go"    I also do it if someone has changed lanes and haven't cancelled their signal  Someone that clueless will never figure that out. I would not do that.   They can't, but they still will... they won't say anything about it.   Also, why do we need to chose between 'downplaying' and 'alarming'? Why can't we just be realistic and say, "Ok, you're right. If we do nothing, we won't see anything bad happen for 25 years (instead of 5). But we can't wait 24 years to fix things. We need to start now". If that was the attitude, I think people would respond better. But I think we also need to be honest and say that the changes that happen don't have to be overwhelming.   Take for example how we forced US car manufacturers to increase their average MPG in their cars. It has had a strong effect on the demand for gas, and of course the consumption of it. Steps like these should be made. Small, yet significant changes. Republicans would be more willing to listen and actually take some sort of action if Democrats weren't so alarmist doomsday-like.   My biggest problem with inconveinent truth (and I noticed it right away was [this](http://imgur.com/dJlYBgm) graph of CO2 vs. Temperature]. My question was, shouldn't then the temperature be 5x higher than it is now? There is a clear disconnect in correlation as soon as CO2 begins to skyrocket.   My follow up question is always, What is the relationship between CO2 and temperature? It can't be linear, because if it was, we would all be dead. It is likely logarthmic, or sub-logarithmic. In which that case, the temperature increase due to CO2 increase, actually decreases over time.  Which means over time, CO2 has less and less of a negative effect on the temperature over time. Not to mention the earth's population growth is slowing, and consumption of fossil fuel per person is decreasing (more efficient cars, alternative fuel sources). I think that over the next 15 years we will see a very small (if at all) increase in temperature, possibly many years of no change.   Not to mention CO2 is one of the 5 million factors that contributes to the Earth's global temperature.   When I tell people I am skeptical of climate change - I am not saying I am skeptical that fossil fuels do not effect the environment - what I am saying is that I am skeptical of *how much* you claim fossil fuels are making on temperature/environment.    omg how could I forget.  Edit 2: No really, how could I forget? I once was flashing my headlights to indicate there was a cop behind me. a 1/4 mile later, was another cop. He saw me flashing my lights, and immediately pulled me over.   He asked me, "Is there something wrong with your headlights sir?". I said no. He ended up giving me a ticket for not having proof of insurance or something. It was a legit ticket, but I wouldn't have gotten pulled over if I hadn't flashed my lights.   **Get out of the lane, you are too slow**  You are going too slow for traffic (or maybe you are doing fine), but someone behind you thinks you are going too slow. Speed up, or get out of the lane. However, *if you want confrontation, and you want to put yourself in a dangerous situation, stay in your lane and maintain your speed*.  **Your headlights are off**  Obvious, but it means it is night time, and you forgot to turn on your headlights. Just flip them on, and give a courteous wave/thank you.  **Please go, I'm giving you the right of way**  This could happen at a stop sign. You both came at the same time, and both of you are waiting for the other one to go. If they flip their lights on and off, then they are telling you to go.   This can also happen when someone has stopped, and is has no intention of going - and just wants you to go.  Either way, it means *just go*  EDIT: How could I forget? I feel this is not used as often anymore, as if cops know you do this, they will pull you over.  **There is a cop ahead**  Someone heading towards you in the opposite direction is indicating there is a cop behind them. Proceed with caution, slow your roll.   You're right. 2013 - Al Gore said it, and a lot of people bought it, and perpetuated it.    In rare cases where there are bad batches and children become sick. (http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/11/mexico-suspends-infant-vaccines-after-two-babies-die-and-29-fall-ill)[This] just happened recently in Mexico. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I'm just making a comparison.     The Antarctic Ice Shelf is going to collapse within 5 years.  Is part of the 2nd highest comment here. ONE arctic shelf (of dozens) will melt in 5 years. But the notion is that 5 years from now, everything will go to hell. That's not concern - that is alarmist. Concern is important, but it doesn't help when you over exaggerate   That de-escalated quickly...   The point is - it is alarmist. And I think that's why many people are skeptical of climate change. Not skeptical as in "I don't think it happens". More like, "I know climate change exists, but they are exaggerating it a lot". If I only read the top 3 comments and their replies, I would think 5 years from now the world will end. It couldn't be further from the truth.   Remember how Al Gore said the Polar ice cap would melt by 2014 (or 2015? I don't know, but exactly, but that time has passed). Back then most climate change supporters would repeat the same claim. It turned out not to even be remotely true.  If climate change supporters were more *realistic* and less *alarmist* then I think we could have legitimate discussions. Instead what we get is:  "THE WORLD IS ENDING IN 5 YEARS"  "YOU SAID THAT ALREADY 5 YEARS AGO, SO I KNOW YOU ARE LYING, AND WILL IGNORE EVERYTHING YOU SAY, EVEN IF MOST OF IT IS TRUE"   Weren't we told the ice caps would melt by 2014?    Statistically you are better off having a Rabbi do it compared to having it done at a hospital. Lower botch rates. Not to mention the health benefits.   Immunizations can be harmful too, but we do them anyway. I'd say the rates of failures are similar.   This does not look like a good thing...   You don't agree about what?   Omg why is every word (including 'The' and 'To' and 'Of') in the title capitalized?????? AHHHHHHH   As others have pointed out, this is .008% of the total water. It's a drop in the bucket, figuratively.     But hey, what kept a politician in officer over the past 10-20 years? Proposing a tax increase for new water infrastructure or tax cuts?  I'm a bit confused, because Cali is run by Democrats who LOVE tax increases    It's not your money so no one really cares what you think they should do with it  But if I told you we should tax the rich more, I bet you agree. Funny how that works.       I don't want someone to enrich my life, I want someone to reassure me that my shitty life is adequate   That's the best part right there.   Catholic + Jew = Cashew   In my sophomore year of high school, my friends and I played poker for real money (no chips, we just remember what we owed each other). The next year the school banned playing cards for the entire school.  There were over 4000 students in my high school at the time.   Restaurant employees hands down.    Glad to see some recruiters are reasonable. I've heard most of them are slimeballs.   You seem to discount that MANY poor/middle/lower-middle class people rent apartments. Increasing property tax will easily increase someone's rent from $900 to $950 or even $1000. This can be a really big hit that will effect those who really can't afford much more.  This also has a side effect of people having less money, which means they spend less - and the government collects less. Not significantly, but you can't discount that it slightly diminishes the return.    Both Fitch and S P have Chicago on negative outlook. Are they also extreme right-wing operations?  @_Guiness It would be nice if you edited your top comment to be less misleading - and less politically charged.   Do you buy your car online? I know dozens of people who use their parents' addresses in the suburbs in order to avoid paying chicago taxes on their car.   ^^ A much more objective answer than OPs "They're just right-wingers so ignore them"    I would rather these wealthy people donate money to a homeless shelters, or food for poor/homeless than these museums...   This seems to be a false notion perpetuated by uninformed young people. My guess is this mostly comes from the webdev crowd and Python lovers.   AMA's are great, but only if they are infrequent (1 per week).    What if it's really that S   P and Fitch have an extreme left-wing agenda, and Moody's is actually the only one reporting objectively?  Not saying I believe that, but why is that not a possible conclusion we could make?      I like d rose. Relax.   Yea except anti semitism overwhelmingly comes from liberals, not conservatives.   I felt similarly with High Line Coffee. Not better, and didn't fit very well into my machine.    1. Faster switching to camera, and to gallery. It is WAY to slow. 2. Better lens that captures more light, and has a faster shutter. I get way too many blurry pictures when the subject is moving 3. Usb 3.0 4. Increased battery capacity (keep it swappable!) 5. No ridiculous bloatware   Everything else is 'nice', but not essential.    Lol someone is touchy...   NYT  1 mistress...   It also depends on how far you live from where you work. For example your cost of living will be MUCH lower if you live in the Southwest suburbs of Chicago, instead of living in the loop. Long commutes can offset higher costs of living in some cases. But Austin does seem the place to be   I didn't know mechanical engineers could afford Maseratis.    Girls cant be in the same house as husband during period  Wtf where did you grow up? No such law exists.    the rest of the world will basically be damned.   Huh? Not sure where that comes from   It seems the UK model allows for significantly worse disproportional electing. The problem in the US pales in comparison.   	113
 Word.   Tribalism then?   Republicans seem to have a lack of empathy that prevents them from understanding or wanting to support a cause unless it affects them personally.                                                                                    Actually it's Sen. John Cornyn of Texas who dismisses gun trafficking as not a problem. Grassley was the only Republican on the Judiciary Committee to vote to advance the anti-trafficking bill.   So this headline is exactly wrong.                                                                           Agreed. And the fact that he went running to Hannity shows how far he's fallen as an "objective" journalist.            WHy Jennifer Rubin may be a pundit, but she's no journalist.                                                            Great read. It's so satisfying to see the ever-intellectually dishonest Republican shill Brooks get taken down for lying.                                                                                                   "The federal deficit has never fallen as fast as its falling now without a coincident recession.    "What makes Joe Scarborough such an enjoyable figure is his combination of affability, good intentions, high self-regard, low self-awareness, and total lack of analytical reasoning skills. He is not remotely dislikable. He is Ron Burgundy come to life."                                       I'm not sure parents will forget all that soon.                             	136
    I will watch some foreign movies, but i 'm worrying about the understanding of the words without the subtitle.    Harry Potter has always been my brother's favorite movie. The spinoff film obviously will make him excited.    Hope they can create an excellent movie for us. Looking forward to this movie.    So you guys are interested in horror films? I have to say that I won't watch horror films alone. I would ask my friends or my brother to watch them with me.    Some believe that this green color seems to be used to describe where their powers came from. However, I am still a little bit confused that this is the volcano so that the green color may be unreasonable.    Jackie Chan is one of my favorite Chinese actors. His action movies are really excited and excellent!    It's so cute and lovely. BTW, I think it looks more like a dinosaur than a dragon.       Well, i think some animals may cry, too. but just not in front of human beings, or not as a baby but the adult. such as lions, apes, tigers and so on. Baby born with the human nature and since they were first brought to the world, they need to cry to announce he/she was alive and healthy. therefore, i think baby's crying is forgivable.    I won't mind talking about salary with my friends. I think by talking about our salary, we can know the welfare in different workplaces so that we may have the chance to choose a better job for ourselves.       As a girl, now I know all these movies. next time if I were asked to watched one of these movies, i think i would think twice to figure out whether i would agree or not.    what's the differences between 8mm, 70mm and other size?    Two men kissing? Did you cut it down?   	15
 Remember, This is supposed to be a joke. Don't Take it seriously    That is what it's supposed to be :D  	2
 Yes they do! Marty and Dee in the morning is the most asinine of all the morning talk shows.   a lot of public libraries in Ireland were funded by Carnegie.  Locally they're called the Carnegie library, usually to distinguish them from ones built since. http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/carnegie-libraries-in-ireland/  	2
 I'm proud of you too, bro.   Detroit ATC here, this is actually quite common. I'd say it happens at least once or twice a month from sept to may. Has no one ever seen the pictures? I know some guy submitted a bunch last winter.   I admitted to stealing government supplies, lying, cheating, and taking drugs to the special agent and psychologist interviewing me.   I got my clearance no problem.   I mean he could have never even fought any of these guys, I mean it is an autobiography, but I like to believe he was the Shaft of his generation.   From his narrative, Frederick Douglass went around chesting up to slave owners, learning to read and write through perseverance and deceit, and then became a free man who worked to tear down the institutions of slavery.  Why hasnt an action movie of this been made yet?       Come on Africa, get your shit together...   Fuck it, might as well skip the abuse phase and go right to the snitching   RHODE ISLAND! RHODE ISLAND!   Someone must have called him the Dane Cook of his generation   Pure Envy   I always have pipe cleaners, duct tape, super glue, and silicon on hand.       I mean sorry I dont know all the big words behind it, but I dont hear you coming up with anything Mr. Sarcastic Smartguy   Pou-Pou-Pou-nanny! Can't get it out your head now   I have a theory on this...  Our cells, know how to survive this environment. Come in contact with closely related cells from 5,000 years ago (that dont know how to survive these elements). And Bam, Science. Bam. You die.  	16
 player tensions are what make dayz, dayz. people are willing to kill entire squads to get one vehicle, making, repairing one, and keeping it hidden a very high priority, as it should be.   http://imgur.com/VtkPz0y  So i made this in like 45 mins because it seems like fun to make maps for people to play.

 Thank you. :)   Thank you. :)               Thanks! this is awesome! :)   ah yeah I was watching the Sanjay Gupta documentary on CNN: Weed about charlotte's web... thanks :)   Hey guys,  So today I've received the unfortunate information that my cat could possibly have lymphoma. I've done a little research pertaining to animals being treated for terminal cancers and being given marijuana and also done a little research on the effects of CDB (Cannabidiol) and treatment with various cancers in humans. Does anyone know or have a recommendation about any venders selling a strain of marijuana high in CBD and low in THC? Any marketplace is fine... Thanks guys. :)  TL:DR cat might have lymphoma, need recommendation on vendors selling marijuana with a high percentage in CBD.                             	18
 Maybe the McRib; I mean, just look at it:  http://grub.gunaxin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mcrib1.jpg     Stewie Griffin from Family Guy?  After all, he was initially a matricidal-minded evil genius because he became a flaming gay drama queen. ;)   Because Xerkule previously used the word "men" rather than "male."   Either Jackass: The Movie or American Pie.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8iqEfje7Aw    It *doesn't* detract from the point.   Good points. :)   Well, come on! After all, I *must* know this information! ;) You see, I'm an NSA agent and we're compiling a database of this information, so yeah. ;)   Yes; correct!    The quick and dirty way is to see who has a bigger, newer air force. modern jet fighters are imported and expensive and thus are a good barometer of how seriously the country in question is taking its defense spending. It is far from a perfect metric, and the thai airforce is a bit longer in the tooth than I would have expected, but on the whole it's very much superior.  Thanks for this info.  why would they want to?  Because Mongolia has a lot of natural resources?  Also, what about Russia conquering the Russian-majority parts of northern Kazakhstan in the event that Kazakhstan ever tries to, say, withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union?   Just curious; after all, I want to compare your size to my own. :) #notcreepy   *All* the stupid people? Is Donald Trump from Florida?   So what *is* a statically relevant number?   Are you sure about that, though?   Israel doesn't commit terrorism, though.   South Carolina ... figures--those rednecks! :(   Why exactly were you worried about Florida, though?    You could arguably just call it american colonialism?  Why, though?  The situation just seems so bizarre that i doubt it could or would happen anywhere else. If anything, i would expect to see the proliferation of more national movements like, flanders, catalonia, kurdistan, than wanting to join another state.  Are there any other national movements which you have in mind which could be successful in the future, though?   Some women *do* give birth after age 40, though. Heck, even my own mom previously did this!   That might be due to cis-men's lack of an extra X chromosome and/or due to cis-men's greater level of testosterone in their bodies, though.   Because when one commits terrorism, one is not taking anything which belongs to another country for one's own use.  (P.S.: I myself obviously and certainly *don't* support terrorism, including by Iran.)   So toofine is being sarcastic? OK, that makes sense. However, it is worth noting that, as far as I know, more men smoke and get heart disease than women do.   How exactly do you know that Thailand is better armed than Malaysia, though?  Also, what about, say, China trying to reconquer Mongolia?   So are they making Russian food right now? After all, Vladimir Putin appears to be making a lot of effort to portray himself as a boogeyman in Western eyes over the last 1.5 years.   No, it isn't.   Fat exchanges, anyone? ;)   OK; understood.   What are you talking about, though? After all, women can certainly smoke and get heart disease, no?   Yes, because legalizing gay marriage is certainly going to encourage Australian cattle to have more gay sex and thus to breed less, correct? ;)   Understood. Also, out of pure curiosity--what exactly is your penis length when it is flaccid?   Funding terrorist groups certainly isn't the same as annexing a part of another country's territory, though.   Out of curiosity--if the "Little Ice Age" helped result in a shorter average height for Northern European men, then could this mean that global warming will help result in a taller average height for Northern European men?  Any thoughts on this?   That, and maybe poorer nutrition as well.   What about the Malay-majority parts of southern Thailand being annexed by Malaysia, though?   Agreed; however, for the record, ethnic Persians in Afghanistan are Sunnis, not Shiites. In contrast, ethnic Persians in Iran are overwhelmingly Shiite.   There! I fixed it! Is it better now?    Maybe, but they already do,  This won't be the case if sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program are lifted, though.   Yeah, I guess. English isn't my first language, so yeah.    6-7.5" seems about perfect for most girls.  Is that flaccid or erect, though? Serious question, for the record.   Yeah, a longer penis can be advantageous for more difficult terrain. ;)   10.5''? Is that when his cock is flaccid or when his cock is erect? Serious question, for the record.   Well, at least he can try getting a penectomy. ;)    and he can't understand why his business never got off the ground  His business might have never got *off* the ground, but at least his penis got *onto* the ground pretty quickly. ;) After all, after a certain amount of penis growth, one's penis *literally* reaches the ground. ;)   Porn ads are lies?   Completely agreed.  Indeed, I have recently heard a Persian refer to the people in southern Iraq as being just "a bunch of Arabs." Seriously.   I wasn't only talking about Russia making such a move, though. After all, other countries can likewise make such a move.   Agreed. ;)   You appear to have forgotten the fact that a *much* smaller number of women currently die as a result of childbirth than was previously the case (throughout the overwhelming majority of history).   End the war on drugs. Period.  Enough said.   OK; anything else, though?    Iran. Sorry, forgot to put that in there. Iran is a Shiite religion and so is Southern Iraq. I think Arab implies Sunni.  And yet many Arabs themselves would disagree with you that Arab implies Sunni.   Iran doesn't care about the International community.  It appears to care enough about the international community to engage in serious negotiations with them over its nuclear program.  If it took Southern Iraq it would take control of the Mesopotamian river delta and control the oil flowing out of Iraq.  True; however, Iran would probably have to endure *massive* sanctions as a result of this annexation as well.    Well, it's important to remember that Crimea isn't really the first "Crimea".  Actually, it *is* the first "Crimea" in the 21st century.  Russia pulled almost the exact same stunt with Abkhazia and South Ossetia against Georgia,  By "almost," do you mean that Russia wanted to outright annex these two territories and then changed its mind at the last minute?  If so, then I would please like a source for this.  and Transnistria against Moldova.  Russia doesn't even recognize Transnistria's independence, though.  One could also argue that this is similar to what Israel is doing to Palestine.  If one compares it to Israel's 1980 annexation of East Jerusalem, then Yes, certainly.   Well, you can't blame me for being lazy. ;)   What else would China want other than Taiwan, though?   Seriously?      Who exactly will annex southern Iraq, though? After all, I don't think that Iran wants to significantly increase the number of Arabs under its rule. Plus, Iran already got in enough trouble with its nuclear program; thus, why exactly should Iran anger the international community even more by annexing southern Iraq?   Incestuous marriage and polygamy, of course. ;)      LOL cumbox! ;)   Uh ... religious Muslim conservatism. :(   Fuck Singapore. :(   The two atomic bombs weren't enough revenge for us, though. ;)   By "future Crimeas," I mean cases where a country sends some of its troops (or some of its "volunteers") to occupy a territory, quickly hold a referendum there, and then annex this territory. In fact, this is what Russia previously did (or appears to have done) in Crimea in early 2014.  Anyway, any thoughts on this? Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question.   Much more women also historically died during childbirth; in turn, this also made women's life expectancy lower than it would have otherwise been.         *Much* bigger problems, in fact.   That Bush Jr. overthrew Saddam Hussein at least in part as a result of daddy issues.   You might be able to thank the Second Intifada for that, though.   OK; that said, though--wouldn't it have been more productive *not* to make jockstraps assless if they were only meant to be used for this purpose?    My apologies. I must have blinked and missed its moment in the sunshine.  Apology accepted. :)   Sprang from nowhere and practically vanished to the same place, am I right?  Yes, you are correct in regards to this. However, Kadima only appears to have vanished after Mofaz brought Kadima into Netanyahu's coalition in 2012 and then accomplished nothing inside of this coalition. Had Mofaz not done that, then Kadima might still exist today.   Kadima was actually the *largest* party in the Knesset back in 2008, though.   You're welcome! :)   I guess so. ;)   Apparently these are the three songs in this video:  Keep Quiet (Original Mix) by Simon Patterson Feat. Lucy Pullin, 1998 (TyDi   Dennis Sheperd Remix) by Binary Finary and Silent Tears (Orjan Nilsen Remix) by Mark Sherry Feat. Sharone.   Convince my parents to invest *a lot* of money on various Intrade betting options, such as betting on an Obama victory in 2008.      Well, now you know the importance of time. ;)  On a more compassionate note, though, I'm sorry for your loss. :(   If a sushi chef is offended by this, then he or she shouldn't probably be making sushi in restaurants for a living in the first place. ;)      2 what?   Yes, I think so.   Any thoughts on this?   I don't smoke weed *at all*, though. Seriously.   Here you go:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner      It's the current mentality of many Israeli *people*, though.   For the record, though, I will say this--it appears that Libya was a larger threat to Israel back in 2002-2003 than Iran is today. After all, unlike Iran, Libya actually *did* want to build nuclear weapons in 2002-2003 (and earlier as well). In this regard, I am certainly extremely happy that the U.S. and U.K. got Libya to give up its WMDs and its nuclear weapons program in December 2003. In addition to making Israel more secure, it also allowed NATO to help overthrow Gaddafi eight years later (in 2011) without the fear of WMDs or nuclear weapons being used against NATO member countries.   Can't he try having Israel bomb Iran if he really wanted to do this, though?   Well, you could have researched it more. ;)    You keep harping about Israel being "threatened"  Actually, I am simply saying what the current Israeli mentality in regards to this is. Personally, though, I agree with you that Iranian nukes almost certainly not mean that Israel is going to be nuked.  when in fact it is Israel that is threatening everyone else with their real, actual, existing nukes,  Who exactly is Israel threatening with their nukes, though?  and furthmore the people who are actually being wiped out are the Palestinians, at the hands of the Israels.  I don't think that the Palestinians are being "wiped out," as you claim. However, I myself certainly support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict approximately based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps. Frankly, it might actually be a good idea for the international community (including the U.S.) to pressure Israel more in regards to this (of course, the Palestinians also have some issues of their own that they will need to deal with before Israeli-Palestinian peace can be made).  The Israeli politicians themselves admitted that the "Iranian threat" is domestically exaggerated for their own purposes.  Yes, and this certainly does not surprise me.  Israel is not the victim.  Agreed, but many Israelis disagree with your view on this.   Yes, it did, because it shows that you didn't give enough of a damn to research how exactly her name is spelled. :(   Why, though?   Actually, the Israel-Lebanon border has been pretty quiet over the last nine years.    What a load of crap.  Israel prefers to be safe rather than sorry. I have to admit that it is idiotic for Iran's leadership and/or military to threaten Israel, though. After all, this only feeds the paranoia that many Israelis have in regards to this.  First of all, 40 nations can make nukes quickly right now if they wanted to, so there's nothing special about Iran joining the same club as about 1 out of 4 nations on the planet. http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html Unlike them, Iran has repeatedly offered to play additional restrictions on its nuclear program, well in excess of what it legally required of Iran but these offers were ignored by the US. IAEA Director ElBaradei noted this himself:  Yes, you are correct in regards to this. However, Iran's threats to Israel is what Israel makes especially concerned about Iran. After all, Israel appears to be cool with Muslim-majority Pakistan having nuclear weapons due to the fact that Pakistan isn't threatening Israel.  Why? Because the US was always using the "Iranian nuclear threat" as simply a pretext to topple the govt there, just like "WMDs in Iraq" had nothing to do with any actual WMDs. Again, IAEA Director ElBaradei:  Actually, I agree with you that Iran might *not* be interested in building actual nuclear weapons right now. Indeed, if our assumption here is accurate, then it would probably be *counterproductive* for Israel to bomb Iran considering that this might actually make Iran determined to build actual nuclear weapons.  Second, Iran is not out to nuke Israel, never was.  I certainly agree with you in regards to this. After all, the Iranian regime's main priority appears to be its own long-term survival. However, Israel wants to reduce this risk to exactly zero.  That was bullshit cooked up by the Israelis because a potential improvement in US-Iran ties risks leaving them out in the cold, so they've been pushing for YEARS to get the US and Iran into a war, just as they did with Iraq.  Maybe, but the statements of Iranian leaders in regards to this certainly haven't been helpful in reducing Israeli paranoia in regards to this:  https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei#2000  "Iran's stance has always been clear on this ugly phenomenon (Israel). We have repeatedly said that this cancerous tumor of a state should be removed from the region No one will allow a bunch of thugs, lechers and outcasts from London, America and Moscow to rule over the Palestinians."  In fact, Iran accepted over 100,000 casualities from chemical weapons warfare by US-backed Saddam, and refused to reply in kind on moral grounds though it could have done so legally. So when they say they oppose WMDs, they've proven it with blood. http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm  Yes, I agree with you that the Iranian regime probably does have some moral aversion to chemical and nuclear weapons for the reason that you pointed out above. However, as far as I know, the Iranian regime *can* be flexible in regards to this; for instance, I think that then-Iranian President Rafsanjani wanted to build chemical weapons in 1989-1990 in the event that a new Iran-Iraq war would have broken out.  Meanwhile, the only country in the Mideast that actually has nukes is Israel,  Correct (if one does not consider Pakistan to be a part of the Middle East, that is)!  and the only country that is known to have tried to sell nukes to others is Israel.  Yes, Israel tried to sell nukes to the racist Apartheid regime in S Africa  Well, Israel certainly appears to have screwed up in that regard. After all, *no* nuclear weapons-state should sell or give its nuclear weapons to other countries (and Yes, this certainly includes Pakistan, especially in the event that Pakistan tries giving or selling actual nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia).  This was back when Iran was supporting Nelson Mandela, who had been labelled a "terrorist" by the US -- Mandela later came to Iran and personally thanked them for their staunch support, and refused to join Clinton's sanctions against Iran.  First of all, please let me say that I certainly oppose the Apartheid government which existed in South Africa back then and am glad that it was eventually gotten rid of. However, wasn't Nelson Mandela actually involved in terrorism back then?   Bonjour to you, my good man! :)   He said that their names are Bruce and Kaitlyn [Caitlyn].   Actually, I myself am currently childless and nevertheless still like the Teletubbies. :)   Dude ... that's just fucking awful! :( Please--no awful jokes like that. :(   Because I wasn't talking about a personality change here; rather, I was only talking about a species change here.   Wouldn't this allow Iran to build nuclear weapons very quickly if it decided to do this, though?  After all, I know that countries such as Japan already have a nuclear weapons capability.   Maybe ... maybe.   So two of the Teletubbies are transgender?   Well, Netanyahu also doesn't want a second Holocaust. After all, many Jews were unfortunately previously caught off-guard when they didn't take Adolf Hitler's 1939 prophecy that European Jewry will be annihilated in the event of another World War seriously. :(   So two of the Teletubbies got sex changes?   Any thoughts on this?   Aren't Po and Laa-Laa females while Dipsy and Tinky-Winky are males, though? If so, then one male and one female have a "stick" on the top of their heads while one other male and one other female have a hole on the top of their heads.   What exactly is that supposed to mean, though?   Very true.   Something which involves me having a vagina, I suppose.  Since I myself have no intention to get a vagina indefinitely, I will never attempt this in reality indefinitely.   Any thoughts on this?   Oh! OK; understood.   If Netanyahu genuinely wants to sabotage this nuclear deal, then he would probably be *much* better off by vehemently arguing in favor of this nuclear deal and frequently saying that this nuclear deal will subdue Iran and put Iran in its place.  If Netanyahu will actually do this, then it might very well make it *much* harder for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to get the necessary support for this nuclear deal back home in Iran.      Actually, I think that he might ironically be *helping to stabilize* U.S.-Iran relations by making it easier for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to "sell" this nuclear deal back home in Iran. After all, they can claim that this nuclear deal is great for Iran due to the fact that Netanyahu (Iran's enemy) strongly opposes it.   Redditors can be *extremely* insightful at certain times. This is indeed one of those times. :)   On the bright side, though, comments such as these might ironically make it easier for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to "sell" this nuclear deal back home in Iran.   Well, Yes--Netanyahu is paranoid about Iran. Thus, what exactly would you have expected?   Except the hawks, that is.                  Yep, and in this regard, legalized gay marriage is technically an expansion of rights for *everyone*.  (P.S.: I myself certainly support legalized gay marriage worldwide.)   Grover Cleveland is close behind FDR in regards to his total number of vetoes, though (if one combines Cleveland's first and second non-consecutive terms, that is): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes   Yep. :)            Also, again, *any* risk of an unplanned pregnancy which is unacceptable for at least some pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban (even if one takes rape out of the equation, though for the record, male-bodied people *can* be victims of rape by female-bodied people) likewise isn't good enough for me either. It really is that simple (even if one ignores all of my gender identity issues). Thus, the choice for me is either castration in a safe, medical setting (after some therapy, obviously) or a "back-alley" castration, and I am pretty sure that any decent person would prefer the former over the latter if these were the only two acceptable options for someone (such as for myself).  Also, Yes, I am certainly well-aware of the difference between pregnancy and child support. However, this only strengthens my own point about risk here considering that a low enough risk should make this difference irrelevant; thus, if this difference is relevant, then the risk of an unplanned pregnancy certainly isn't low enough for me to stop worrying about it.    I'm not sure, is it rape if two nine year old kids have sex?  Or what if it's two 13 year olds? Same issue.  I would say Yes to both of these questions.   By that rationale, though, would forcing males whose contraception failed to pay child support for 18/21 years (or possibly even longer than that if it's a severely disabled child) be a punishment for these males?   You *are* aware that my proposal here is similar to what Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf previously proposed, correct?   I think that you made a double-post here.   Understood; that said, though, I still felt compelled to ask this question anyway due to the fact that it is something which has strongly interested me ever since late 2008.  Also, would asking about Shimon Peres winning in 1996 be a better question (in your opinion)?   He appears to look *a lot* like Mulan in this self-portrait. ;)    Mufaz is not Bibi or Peres, so no.  What exactly makes them meaningfully different from Mofaz, though?   The fact that you are asking there and not in r/technology for example means you think there will be a difference from their point of view.  This doesn't seem like an appropriate question for r/technology, though.   To the point, Nobody cares about him or remembers who he is.  Maybe; of course, I still find it interesting that Mofaz almost defeated Livni for the leadership of Kadima back in 2008.    My life in Israel TM  OK. ;)   Mufaz had no supporters outside some Kadima members he brought into the party.  Well, he must have brought a lot of supporters into the party considering that he almost won the 2008 Kadima leadership election.  Under his leadership in 2013 Kadima barely entered the Keneset when before it was the ruling party. That's what happens when the public votes, not just your buddies.  I think that this occurred due to the fact that Mofaz had Kadima enter Netanyahu's coalition in 2012 and then failed to accomplish anything when Kadima was in this coalition, though. If not for that mistake, then Kadima might have done *much* better in the 2013 Knesset elections.   I've got a question, though--would it really be in the interest of the Kashmiri Muslims to have Kashmir become a Hindu-majority, non-autonomous part of India rather than to have Kashmir remain a Muslim-majority, autonomous part of India? After all, these would probably be the only two options which I would accept if I myself was an Indian.   What exactly are the source and basis for your assertion here, though?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaul_Mofaz    I don't, it's just not important.  Are you sure about that, though? Also, by that logic, would Netanyahu's victory over Peres in 1996 likewise be unimportant?  and why are you asking the same question at r/"Palestine" (and everywhere actually)?  Because I want as many people as possible to answer this question.  what is the answer you're looking for?  I am not looking for any specific answer. Rather, I simply want to hear people's thoughts on and responses to this question, whatever these thoughts and responses might be.   You forgot about Israel, though.    Are those all equally comparable?  Yes, I would think so.  If Palestinians are more easily identifiable and able to return, but poles aren't, does that mean the Palestinians also shouldn't be?  Yes, it does, at least for the time being.   As well, since you've essentially said it's impossible to do and not going to happen, and therefore shouldn't happen in Palestine, do you then still oppose a referendum in Kashmir? Seeing as the refugees aren't going to return, why shouldn't they just have a referendum with people who are there?  Ah ... I see where exactly you are going with this. Anyway, I will say this--your position on this is certainly not an invalid one. In fact, I am no longer going to outright argue against it. However, if I was an Indian, then I would refuse to agree to a referendum in Kashmir until all of the areas in Kashmir will become Hindu-majority (this might be accomplished by allowing Hindus from other parts of India to buy land in Kashmir, et cetera). However, in such a case, the outcome of this referendum will probably simply be a reconfirmation of the Line of Control as the border between India and Pakistan.    Pakistan fought 3 wars with India before they hooked onto the Kashmir issue around 1990.  Weren't two of those three wars about Kashmir, though?  So Kashmir is not the real issue but a symptom of a violent Islamic expansionism that has been going on for more than a millennium.  Actually, I think that it is a bit of both. Both the 1947 Partition itself and the forced migration which resulted from it probably strained Indo-Pakistani relations, as did India's military intervention to ensure Bangladesh's secession from Pakistan in 1971 after Pakistan committed genocide there. However, I *do* think that the Kashmir dispute is a part of the reason for India's and Pakistan's hatred of each other.   Legally speaking, the entire Kashmir state belongs to India and if that legality is called into question then the existence of Pakistan can also be questioned since both have come into existence from the same Instrument of Accession, which is why Pakistan occupied Kashmir is not included in Pakistan's Constitution and people living in those territories are not Pakistani citizens.  Yes, this appears to be accurate. However, from that perspective, why exactly did India take the Kashmir issue to the United Nations in the first place instead of simply finishing the job militarily in 1949 and kicking Pakistan out of all of Kashmir? (Heck, I think that India even agreed to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir in the late 1940s before changing its mind on this later on).   The only excuse that Pakistan   other Muslim countries have for Kashmir and Israel is of human rights, democracy   plebiscite etc. but then that can be easily busted by the fact that there is hardly any human rights   democracy in most Muslim majority countries.  Agreed; also, if Pakistan wanted a plebiscite in Kashmir, then it could have already held such a plebiscite on the parts of Kashmir which it already currently controls.   Plebiscite cannot be conducted in Kashmir because Pakistan has not only changed the original demography of Pak occupied Kashmir but they have also driven out 500,000 Hindus from India's side of Kashmir using state sponsored terrorists.  Agreed.   Which is why in November 2010, United Nations has excluded Jammu and Kashmir from its annual list of unresolved international disputes under the observation of the United Nations Security Council.  Yes, I think that I have previously heard about that. However, Kashmir is still currently de facto disputed between India and Pakistan.   So the matter ends there as of now, with the Line of Control being the temporary solution.  Yes; also, though, it is worth noting that my own solution to the Kashmir dispute advocates eventually converting the Line of Control into the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.   Yes, I would ideally support a Palestinian right of return along with things such as the right of ethnic Germans and their descendants to return to areas such as Kaliningrad Oblast and the right of ethnic Poles and their descendants to return to the parts of the former Soviet Union from where they or their ancestors were previously expelled.    Do you recognize Palestine?  Do I think that there should be an independent Palestinian state approximately based on the 1967 lines? Yes, I do (but with some mutually agreed land swaps).  Just curious.  OK.  And the Palestinian right of return?  As of right now, No, considering that the application of this principle isn't universal. For instance, Russia certainly won't allow the ethnic Germans who were expelled from Kaliningrad or their descendants to move back to Kaliningrad right now.  However, Yes, I do *ideally* support the right of return both in Israel and everywhere else.  Hoping for some consistency.  OK.    Actually, you appear to be forgetting the fact that Mofaz came within several hundred votes of defeating Livni in that 2008 election:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadima_leadership_election,_2008     What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?  Any thoughts on this?   What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?  Any thoughts on this?  	152
 It's certainly a cool and interesting premise   This is baffling    The Lovely Bone   She should have saluted the flag instead   Wasn't it thermite? They've used that on Mythbusters a couple times.   There are not enough videos of these sorts of cuckolding threesomes around    I'd be super bummed if this movie had an anti-nuclear power message      Neonomicon was pretty terrible   The expression on the skeleton makes me laugh every time. It looks like it someone surprised him with an engagement ring.   Doesnt look like it, but that's based on that bit of blurry dark low quality footage.   The planet isn't rising. The apes are. Also having "of the" appear twice in a title makes it super long and awkward.    Will he have time to be in Fast 7?    He's clearly not wearing a mask until he gets picked up and he's wearing the very same clown make up they talk about seconds later. Unless they were all wearing blindfolds while driving or didn't even glance out the window for a split second to see the guy they're supposed to be picking up, there's no way they wouldn't have seen him as they drive up and stop next to him.   How did no one, including the dudes who picked him up, notice that he was the Joker?   My two dream Godzilla games would be a fighting game like Destroy All Monsters, but with next gen graphics and physics and all that jazz,  or  A Battlefield style game where a group of people play as soldiers in a destructible city, and one player plays as Godzilla trying to cause as much destruction as possible.   The movie is still almost a year away. I really think they should have released that first teaser by now, even if it was just a mood piece made before filming began, but I would expect the proper trailer to drop towards the end of the year.   This looks perfect. It moves and is shaped like a classic man in a suit. But bigger and scarier and more animalistic. Plus the design looks like the awesome 80s/90s design, with a bit more of a scaly dangerous dinosaur look like the 2000 design.    It's actually the largest Godzilla on film ever    It really looks like a suit   Sounds more like Ted to me    Final Wars was part of the Millenium series, even though it was mostly a love letter to the Showa series. People are already referring to the new Godzilla as "Legendary" Godzilla so chances are that name will stick.  Also it's not a suit anymore   That's actually pretty cool   Final Wars would have been so much better if the fight scenes lasted more than a minute or two   What about the reveal of the new Bandai figurine?    That's because this movie has been in and out of production for like ten years   This picture is very old   I agree. I know we all just want to see Godzilla fight monsters, but everyone knows that the best Godzilla movies are for the most part just about humans vs Godzilla. Except the 1998 American version of course but that's for a whole bunch of other reasons.  Plus we already saw massive monster fights in Pacific Rim. Seeing people getting reports of Godzilla encounters out in the ocean or on islands, slowly discovering that this mind blowing beast somehow exists and the ramifications of such a thing, and then seeing it destroy human civilization while soldiers try hopelessly to hold him back would be awesome and scary and intense and something we've never seen done properly before. Once he gets to fighting other monsters it gets a bit more fun and silly. I kinda wish they had saved the other monsters for the sequels.   Well it's produced by Seth MacFarlane, who is very very much an atheist, so I think we'll be fine   I remember being addicted to this movie as a teenager. Me and all my friends were getting our first cars and driving together out in the country, so this was like super intense at the time. It probably doesn't hold up nearly as well now but I thought it was funny and creepy and creative and scary and awesome back then. Plus Steve Zahn is always great.   360, but only because all my friends have Xbox. I'm switching to PS4 this Christmas and hopefully we'll get a PS4 version in the near future.    Way to show everyone how big and tough you are by almost getting all your friends killed   Does cringe count when it's intentional?  I mean it's 5sf. Also, Comic Sans.   The Rock. He looks like a strong sassy Latino woman.   Again, this is just one of many concept designs. The actual design to be used in the film has not been revealed.   That's the Godzilla 2000 design. The new one hasn't been revealed yet.   That would be pretty awesome    I hate the Transformers films so very very much, but the third film has a falling skyscraper sequence and a wing suit sequence that both blew me away.  Also towards the start of Dreamcatcher where they find the sick dude in the woods and he gets worse and worse and eventually dies and some mysterious creature is birthed into the toilet was super creepy and atmospheric and made me think the rest of the movie might be great. It wasn't.    That's just a concept design. The final hasn't been revealed yet.    No it isn't. This is a concept design at the Godzilla experience at Comic Con. The real design hasn't been revealed yet.     It's sorta tricky since the specifics of both the scale, and the actual stats of most Kaiju are sorta pulled out of nowhere most of the time. Plus Godzilla Kaiju are all usually a lot smaller than Pacific Rim Kaiju, and yet they're all way way tougher.    Neil Patrick Harris was in Saints Row 2. Seems like they're trying to bring back all the characters from previous games, like Ben King, old school Shaundi and whatever Keith David's character's name was   Just for comparison with other similar and recent destruction filled disaster/monster movies;   Pacific Rim's budget was $190M (A lot more than I had thought)  King Kong (2005) was $207M  Transformers 1 was $150M  Transformers 2 was $200M  Transformers 3 was $190M  Man of Steel was $225M  2012 was $200M  Cloverfield was $25M  Battle: Los Angeles was $75M  Battleship was $209M  GI Joe: Rise of Cobra was $175M  Armageddon was $140M  D-War was $75M (Most expensive Korean film of all time)   Godzilla (1998) was $130M  Final Wars was $19M (The biggest budget ever for a Japanese Godzilla movie)  And Gareth Edward's Monsters was half a million bucks; $500,000    I'm not sure what the exact budget for this movie will end up being, nor do I know if Gareth Edwards is experienced enough to truly create a disaster movie of this scale, but this movie really needs to turn entire cities into radioactive wastelands. So far the poster, interviews with the creators, and the Comic-Con teaser (which I haven't actually seen) seem to be hinting at exactly this, but I'm still not convinced. The problem is, again, I think the budget for this movie is a lot smaller than most disaster films, and Gareth isn't exactly experienced in epic large scale apocalyptic disaster films. Although he is talented and certainly knows how to stretch a budget  Pacific Rim was okay for what it was, but didn't deliver as much as I had hoped in the destruction department. After how disappointingly careful and harmless the 1998 Zilla was, bafflingly so for a Roland Emmerich film, and after seeing all the destruction based marketing so far, we really need a movie that makes Man of Steel and Transformers look tame in comparison.  If they want to set themselves apart, and deliver a truly terrifying and realistic and worthwhile reimagining of Godzilla, then they need to blow people's minds by showing off what a giant angry living nuclear battleship loose in a major city can do in a way no one has ever seen before.  I mean, surely if something as large as Godzilla were to actually exist, he'd do a lot more damage just walking around than just cracking the cement and smacking down buildings. He'd be a moving earthquake generator, and each footstep would permanently destroy the earth beneath him.   Gareth and the writers/producers certainly seem to have a deep love for the original film, and the cast is absolutely superb, I just really hope they can use CG and modern Hollywood effects to take the wanton destruction and carnage of the Japanese films, and crank it up to 11.   Not bad. Bit too much background noise going on for me though. I really hope they do a new version of the classic theme for this movie. Big and orchestral and epic. Based on how many references to the original there have already been already I'm sure they will.  I'm pretty disappointed that Michael Giacchino isn't doing the score. If you listen to the theme he made for Cloverfield you'll see that he would have been perfect.   Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Ken Watanabe   Looks kinda like a mix of the original Godzilla, Godzilla 2000, and GMK designs. Which is awesome and perfect in my opinion.    The severed hand was hanging from the steering wheel. The hand holding the button was attached to an arm that is shown coming from around a corner thing. We never see what condition the rest of the body is in.   Looks real pretty and potentially fun, and I'm still looking forward to seeing more, but they didn't really show anywhere near as much as I wanted. Especially for a trailer that's been hyped up for the last week as a 'gameplay' trailer.  Also I really don't like the look of his face. I get that they don't want him to look like Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy and are going for their own take on the character, but he just looks strange.  But hey, Just Cause 2 was stupid and weird and poorly acted and that was still some of the most fun I've had in a video game in a long long time.   The T-Rex wasn't in the cargo hold. It was in the big giant cage on the back of the boat that was all ripped open when the boat hit the dock. It went into the cargo hold after killing most of the crew and that dying crew member closed it.   Whoa, Kevin Bacon is in this movie?    Nope. I'm sure Rockstar will announce a PC/Next Gen version once everyone has already bought the current console versions   That would be a much much better idea   Vegas    SON   Have they confirmed that there will be gang hideouts?   I don't think military would come after you at all. These new GTA games are trying to be a little more realistic and having tanks chasing chasing a single criminal in an urban environment is pretty silly. (But very fun) I would imagine the military won't come after you at all unless you break into the base and steal a tank or a jet.   Sharknado  Sharkacane  Sharkageddon  This epic trilogy must come to fruition   Well kiss my grits this is fantastic!   For me, Vice City had a better story and cast of characters, plus an awesome 80s setting that still feels incredible to step back into, but San Andreas is way more fun to play   I kinda really hope it stays tropical   Do you have a source? I really want this to be true    One of my favorite new features in BOGT was that after every story mission you were graded on your performance, and given stats about your accuracy, time, headshots, things like that, and then you could replay any story mission you wanted at any time to try to get better.  Imagine how much it would suck to play through an amazing mind blowing heist sequence, and then not be able to do it again. Especially now that you can upgrade your weapons and gear and personal stats, or replay it again but switching to different characters at different times.   I don't remember for sure, but I'm pretty sure while replaying a mission in BOGT you don't earn any extra money or anything, so no need to worry about people replaying heists for bonus cash or stat upgrades.  Sure, replaying the whole game can be fun, but if you just want to replay a specific mission or show off a cool sequence to a friend, or replay a certain heist to try to get better at it, you don't want to replay the whole game and lose all your progress in the story and side missions, as well as your money and weapons and possessions. There's already a pretty much perfect mission replaying system in BOGT that they could hopefully use in GTA 5. It only adds tonnes more replay value to an already jam packed game.   They're not    Garth Ennis can be pretty hit and miss for me, and he can really write some stupid over the top schlocky juvenile bullshit sometimes, but goddamn, that line, "You gotta be one of the good guys, son. Cause there's way too many of the bad." has always stuck with me.   Preacher is definitely my favorite comic of his. It might still have some of his typical goofy 'edgy' crap in it sometimes, but it has a hell of a lot of talent and heart behind it.     It's not one of the optional tattoos available in the store, so it's obviously a permanent part of the character.   I'm assuming it's maybe referring to Saint Michael, plus it looks to be on a cross. But that's obviously an intentional choice, and more than just a coincidence. I just thought it was interesting.      I love weapon wheels, and GTA has been needing one for a while. Saints Row and RDR had it, and I'm really glad it's in.  However I kinda think the actual wheel itself looks a bit ugly and messy.   Doubt it.   Huh, I noticed the different colours during the switching in the trailer, but I didn't notice that their stats and mission markers on the map were also colour coded. Awesome.   He's flying the jet   The fact that it's an online only game makes me slightly less interested   The first one is a brilliant and fun and hilarious cheesy old school action adventure movie. Honestly, I think reinventing a classic Universal horror icon in the style of a classic pulp adventure serial was a perfect idea. It felt like Doc Savage Meets The Mummy. It was going for the same tone and tongue in cheek reference-filled style as Indiana Jones, and I think it nailed it. It was purposely campy and self aware, but without being too goofy or jokey. I'm not the biggest fan of Brendan Fraser, but he was great, the movie was fun, great special effects, and some genuinely creepy moments. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but I absolutely loved it, and still do. Very much an under appreciated movie.   The second one sucked though. It's a shame that Stephen Sommers seemingly lost his self-aware campy style after this movie and went all ridiculous and terrible.   Hey Malkovich, think fast!    I don't want characters that control like big slow trucks driving through molasses and take a couple seconds to perform simple actions like in GTA 4.   Everything about the characters looks perfect so far. All really likable and interesting and not complete cliches. Hell everything about the game seems perfect, aside from the whole no PC or next gen thing.   ...Also that jab about an unfit guy being dead before 35 is pretty ill timed...   When it comes to just Godzilla movies, my personal favourites are  Godzilla (1954)  Destroy All Monsters (1968)  Godzilla - or Return of Godzilla (1984)  Godzilla vs Biollante (1989)  Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 (1993)  Godzilla vs Desotroyah (1995)  Godzilla 2000 (2000)  Godzilla: Giant Monsters All Out Attack (2001)  Godzila Final Wars (2004)  I think these have the most action, most interesting Kaiju, and are just the most fun to watch. Some Godzilla movies can be super cheap and light on the Kaiju action, or just plain strange. These are all fairly simple and accessible.    This is so much better than the usual Pixar specific ones that keep getting posted here. Some of these I've never seen before. Super cool.   This is actually one of my favorite action movies. No cgi or shaky cam, just ridiculously over the top action and stunts and really funny characters. Tragically underrated.    That's really cool. Here in Australia movie tickets cost like 16 dollars and we don't get anything extra. This could be a really interesting new trend.   I feel like the gameplay trailer that's coming soon will probably be a part of the multiplayer reveal. I can't imagine Rockstar showing gameplay of the campaign before release, and since they're doing this new GTA Online thing, I think it makes sense that they'd release a gameplay video of how it all works. Maybe in the style of those RDR and Max Payne videos.   The weirdest for me was his family all becoming successful super rich yuppies at the end and yet they still live in the same house    Oh it'll be cheesy, but it won't be garbage. The cheesiness and camp is totally deliberate.    Even if they were planning on releasing a PC/next gen version of the game, I feel like it'd be in their best interest to act like they weren't. Then after the game has sold a bajillion copies, they'll announce the GOTY edition coming out on PC/next gen in April or something so that everyone buys it again.   Ah, great, thanks. That's pretty much what I figured but I'm not nearly educated enough on the subject. Thanks!    Was the middle east still mostly Muslim back then? I know nothing about this subject so I was just wondering if these countries were still all pretty much Islamic throughout history, and it's just a new more fundamentalist and extreme type of Islam that has taken over more recently.   I seem to remember this movie being announced years ago with Ryan Reynolds and The Rock, or something like that, and then it never happened   Yes    The missed punches don't show how overmatched Batman is when Bane is still reacting to the hit. Not once during the fight did I think "wow Batman is out of his league!" or "whoa Batman is finally outmatched!" I could only think "Yikes this is poorly done."  There's a big difference between being deliberately choreographed in a sloppy messy fashion to portray the characters in a certain way, and plain bad choreography where punches miss clearly by inches and the other fighter acts like he got hit,  unrealistic moves, people swing their arms nowhere near an opponent just so the other fighter can block it, obviously awkward positioning, and Bane doing a sloppy little jump spin in the middle of a fight and Batman just sort of waits to get hit.  The negative things I said about that fight weren't the point of the fight, they weren't choices by Nolan or the choreographer. They were mistakes and sloppy filmmaking and poor stunt work.      I hope the final episode of that show ends with his kids getting sick of his rambling self important narcissistic stories about what a great guy he is and they get up off the couch and beat him to death.    Everyone was talking about how epic and brutal the first Bane vs Batman fight was. I heard 'amazing' and 'breathtaking' a few times before seeing the movie. The lead up was basically Batman saying,  "Take me to this movie's villain so we can have a fight scene." Then there's a weird awkwardly paced build up, before Bane and Batman finally clash in a pretty averagely choreographed slow fight with lots of missed punches and cheesy moments. I usually really like Nolan movies but his fight scenes are always terrible, and DKR was one of his weakest films by far.   This looks pretty lame. But hopefully now Ben Schwartz might do a cameo in Always Sunny   This would have made this movie so much better   Seriously, why is this one of the top posts for this subreddit?    The uploader posted this in the comments section four times  "AWWWWW WTF LITTLE BITCH HACKED MY YOUTUBE AND BUT HER SHITTY PROJECT UP!!!!!!! HOW DID I DONT SEE THIS SORRY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BLINDED BY THIS BACK STABBIN EX FRIEND OF MINE!"  ...what?   Totally agree. Also, Chronicle was pretty average.    It's funny because this post clearly proves that whoever made it has never had sex with a woman     Roland's last movie 2012 was like that as well. It was so tonally inconsistent that it really drove me crazy.   There's a scene where a man tries to make up with his son over the phone after not speaking to him for years. Right as the son picks up the phone a huge earthquake hits and the father listens to his son die. Then, as the old man cries, a giant tidal wave comes and kills him and like a thousand other people. Then there's a giraffe hanging from a helicopter and John Cusack's daughter says she doesn't pee her pants anymore.   Also, a scene where a chihuahua walks across a tightrope while a wife angrily gives her husband the finger, all to goofy cartoony music, and then the husband falls to his death while his children watch and scream.  That movie was fucking weird     Very very common normal word here in Australia too    The whole point of Die Hard was supposed to be that it wasn't a typical action hero guy like Arnie or Sly. That's why they casted a romantic comedy tv actor. Bruce only became known as an action star afterwards. If Die Hard was made today it'd be more likely to be someone like... Jeez I actually have no idea... Maybe Joe Manganiello or Gabriel Macht or Jon Hamm   God, yes, he totally sold me on Monster Hunter. I'd always been interested in the franchise but I'd never been able to get into it. Patrick convinced me to dive in.   It's not so much him not being on the podcast that I'm gonna miss. It's the attention he gives to weird crazy indie games that most other sites ignore. I'm gonna miss QuickLooks where he and Vinny explore really strange niche games that we would usually never see.   Yeah because throwing the grenade and then taking cover in the hole would just be silly    That's the most interesting thing about this. Instead of trying to think of stupid ways for people to go back to this truly doomed dinosaur island, just rewrite history so instead of going to shit on the first day of Jurassic Park, everything goes to shit after 20 years of success.   It's weird that you approve this   We could all use some more EverythingIsTerrible   Every time this film has been mentioned in the last two years there's always tonnes of comments from people mentioning how similar it is to Evangelion. We get it.   Both consoles have 8GB of RAM, but the Xbox One OS takes up 3 GB, and the PS4's OS takes up 1. So PS4 has 7GB of Ram devoted to games and Xbox One only has 5. Also PS4 uses GDDR 5 and Xbox One uses GDDR 3. Plus, PS4 is cheaper, has better exclusives, support for indie developers, no online passes, and PS Plus gives you free games every month. It's still all around a cheaper and more powerful machine.  EDIT: And a 50% more powerful GPU   The director Colin Trevorrow already confirmed no feathers on Twitter  	109
    Thanks    * **1. Be open for discussion with your child** The beginning phase of school is very challenging for every child. Therefore, being a parent, it is your prime responsibility to be open for every discussion with your kids. Always try to counsel them and try to understand their point of view, which helps them to form a positive attitude towards schooling.   * **2. Share interesting things with your kids about schools** Often kids go through a phase of dilemma when they start schooling for the first time. They are apprehensive and kind of resistant towards the idea of going to school daily. It is a battle for them to stay away from their home and parents for a long period of time. Hence, you need to make sure that your kids are informed about all the interesting things and fun activities they can explore during their school life to transform their belief towards positivity.   * **3. Try to make their school homework interesting with your help** Most of the kids feel negative about school because they need to deal with the burden of school homework every day. It has been proven by studies that parents, who spend time with their kids in daily homework activities, contribute towards development of childrens interest in getting regular with school.  * **4. Celebrate even smallest of the achievements of your kids** These days, schools organize several types of activities, events and competition in order to offer platform to the students, where they can learn effectively. During these competitions, you should always stand as motivating pillar by your childs side and help them to achieve remarkably. Also, when you celebrate their smallest of achievements, it helps them to build faith in their abilities.   * **5. Meet frequently with teachers of your child** Your meeting with the teachers of your child helps you to keep a track of growth and improvement in your son or daughters performance. It also creates a positive impression your kids and encourages them to perform better in routine activities during the school.   * **6. Motivate your child to read more books** Motivation is the key for humankind to achieve wonderful results in their endeavors. You should be focused to provide a strong motivation support to your kids since childhood. If they are successful in building the habit of staying self-motivated since school days, then nothing can stop them to achieve big in their lives.   * **7. Dont put performance pressure on your child** Mostly, parents make this mistake of putting performance pressure on their children. It is quite obvious for every mother or father to expect excellent performance from their son or daughter but patience is the key to witness ground breaking results. Therefore, child psychologists suggest the parents to stay patient and calm to improve performance level of their kids.   * **8. Encourage your child to be balanced students** Balance is virtue for every student. Therefore, parents should not only be inclined towards one particular aspect of schooling. You should encourage your kids to take part in extracurricular activities, sports and co-curricular activities apart from academic performance. This will build up their entire performance in advanced manner.   * **9. Understand child psychology** The most common mistake made by elder people is that they consider children psychology same as theirs. But, this is not the truth because children are tend to think in different ways that grown-ups. They are more creative and their brains are fertile. Therefore, they should be treated smartly to ensure a systematic growth.   * **10. Be patient** The Chairman Mr. Radhesh Chander Pal of [Rishi Public School](http://www.rishischool.com) tells- Being a responsible parent, your key task is to interact with your children on daily basis and put your efforts to build positive image for schooling in their mind. You should focus on achieving the situation, where your kids start loving school and understand its importance. But, it is important that you stay patient throughout the process.                   NO, now mean after !!!     	10

A big issue with the rat (Seralini) study was the very small sample size, it was small enough that they were unable to do any statistical analysis on tumor prevalence and mortality.    Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they've sued over willful and intentional isolation of their seed and growing without a license.    and that their conclusions were predetermined (e.g., pseudoscience).    [Citation Needed]   Just to point out that the study that WTCMolybdenum4753 is citing was originally retracted for being of fundamentally flawed study design and conclusion.    That's because most GMOs such as corn are hybrids and don't bread true, [you get a similar effect with non GMO hybrids.](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/41560478_TRANSGRESSIVE_SEGREGATION_IN_F2_GENERATION_OF_MAIZE_HYBRIDS_GROWN_FOR_GRAIN_AND_SILAGE)   Yes, while there was a time in which sterile seeds/GURT was being developed they have never been brought to market.    This is due to them being hybrid varieties, not to being genetically engineered.    I stopped caring about Goodall when it came out that she plagiarized her book.    Seralini's study was retracted for being fundamentally flawed and down right worthless.    The WHO and Lancet studies should be honestly looked at and considered without prejudiced.

What developed nations actively ban the use of glyphosate?     There have been issues with farmers dying from direct contact with it since it came into use.    The only real cases of farmers dying from glyphosate exposure are easily suicide related when the farmer consumes large amounts of a concentrated solution.

Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.     Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

Also several reviews have also documented slight performance issues with the base GPU. The performance of the base might not be too big of an issue to you, but that is heavily dependent on the kind of work/programs you will be using.    The McLaren F1 is also a lot more expensive and rare then the LaFerrari.    There are a handful on the open market, and while Ferrari claims to make "x" amount of their hyper cars they rarely do. The Enzo sold a good 60+ beyond their official figure.    Stig's problem was due to the car not being set up properly in terms of its suspension.

Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops.     About the Schmeiser case.     I'll quote the actual court case.    [In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)         His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.     I'll quote the actual court case.    [In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2.

The plan, undertaken in 1976 following years of church-initiated lawsuits and covert harassment, was meant to eliminate the perceived threat that Cooper posed to the church and obtain revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, The Scandal of Scientology. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered documentary evidence of the plot and the preceding campaign of harassment during an investigation into the Church of Scientology in 1977, eventually leading to the church compensating Cooper in an out-of-court settlement.    most advance sound studio that only mix in 5.1 surround. what is this, the 80s?  also the credibility of the video instantly collapse when they mention the father. they must have fail to dig up more juicy dirt on the guy if that is the only this they have to attack him   he better call Saul   no, they have almost univeral literacy rate and most arab countries have not been fighting major war since the 70s. several of the arab countries are the richest in the world.

At this resolution the machine can scan 18 frames a second, meaning the film moves through the scanner at about two thirds of the true speed. Every single frame can generate 13MB of data.  Increasingly, the studios are scanning at 4,000 and even 6,000 pixels across, in order to prepare the films for even higher resolution.   Scanning at these resolutions generates immense amounts of data - a typical 4,000 pixel film will take up at least 12TB, before any work is done on it.   Luckily, Warner Bros has a rack of machines which provide one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of storage.

 Is that sticky? Just curious for preparations sake lol   Spit = no bueno. Got that.   Why am I getting downvotes for legitimate questions? I'm not pushing an agenda I'm genuinely curious about opinions and suggestions... I'd be happy to have my girlfriend join in on the discussion.   Noted.   It was the heat of the moment, we didn't think about google. Haha   Good point. I thought about that too.   I went really really slow and let her decide what was what. I thought about lube but I've had issues with lube before because I have generally sensitive skin and I'm uncircumcised.   I was thinking this, the lube part.   Here's the problem. I'm uncircumcised and I've had issues with sensitive skin all over my body and particular issues with lube on my member. Luckily I know how to get things going with her so for vaginal sex lube is completely unnecessary.  Suggestions?   I feel you. I still feel the same way about Wisconsin winters.... 100 degrees 7 months out of the year isn't fun but I deal with it better than I do 20 below with a wind chill. I guess it's all about what you're used to.   Good question.   TBH, I don't care either way. I just want it to be viewed equally.   Similar to me not caring how many partners my SO has had in the past, why should her partners be calculated differently than mine?   That yes, and if you work outside that alone is a calorie burner. I worked outside for 3 years doing construction. It was awful.   The ocean breeze in Galveston actually helps significantly.   The road you're referring to is Seawall BLVD and yeah it's nice as long as you don't have to park lol.   You know when it's 80 degrees outside and sunny, and your black car has been sitting in the direct sunlight for hours windows up and you sit down in it and you instantly become damp with sweat, and it feels like the heat is crushing? That's what it's like to just walk outside on a typical summers day in Houston.   That you're not allowed to say anything negative about a minority if you're not one yourself or you're considered a racist/homophobe/transphobe etc no matter the context or situation or how you word it.   That its okay for a woman to fly off the handle and verbally abuse a man, sometimes even physically. Call names, shout, throw things, push or even punch. But if the guy retaliates at all suddenly he's the fucking spawn of Satan and deserves to be carted off to jail.   That its okay for women to ogle men and drool over his stunning manly features, but if a guy gets caught sheepishly glancing at a nice ass or chest he's a pig objectifying women.   That its okay for women to call people "sweetie" or "dear" or "baby" (that last one is definitely regional, more common in the south) or other such things in a perceived to be endearing motherly way, but a man would be written up, suspended or even fired from work if he tried to do that. *To clarify I have no desire to do this, but I find it uncomfortable when females do this to me and wish it was the same universally.*  That it's okay to publicly "show concern" for someone who appears to be too thin, or joke about it and ask if they ever eat anything, or say a strong gust of wind would blow them away. Try the same thing with someone who's overweight. "Haha, do you ever stop eating? JK LMAO!". "You're so heavy it might take a forklift to move you! Haha!".   Slightly relevant, I somewhat recently moved to Appleton from Houston and I find it hilarious when people whine and stress about "traffic" here being horrendous. Obviously the picture linked here is a joke, but coming from Houston I find the lack of traffic here to be rather refreshing.   Also the "heat". As soon as it hits like 73 degrees people are acting like we're in an inferno. 9 months out of the year in Houston 73 is a rather cool night, temps hitting 95-110 by 10am every day for the majority of the year. I don't go into that much detail with the average complainer of heat but I do laugh and say I think it's nice out, but then again I'm from Houston. So they respond with "YEAH BUT THAT'S *DRY* HEAT!". Funny, cause Houston is only an hour (with traffic) from the Gulf, prone to tropical storms, hurricanes and very high humidity.   Anywho, I got a kick outta the pic.   The article won't load on my mobile can someone summarize it for me real quick?   Have you ever tried to become addicted to a carrot? They're awful.   First of all, that's an opinion. Some people rather enjoy carrots.   I don't subscribe nor do I think the scientific community subscribes to the idea that you can become addicted to anything.   Well, your carrot example was sort of a reduced and exaggerated one. Is a person likely to become addicted to carrots specifically even if they like them? No. But they could easily become addicted to the idea of eating healthy, for example, and overdo it to an unhealthy point. Things aren't black and white usually.    I agree, most addiction comes from reinforcing behavior through reward systems. Let me rephrase.   Anything a person can do multiple times over an extended period of time, that *that particular individual finds to be satisfying* yet not satisfying enough to ever be completely satisfied, can become psychologically addictive. Video games, working out, biting nails, smoking weed, masturbation, cleaning their living space, throwing a ball into a cup, *throwing up* etc. You get the picture. There are obvious exceptions, such as suicide for example. Not much chance of becoming addicted to committing suicide.   Are you familiar with OCD? I have OCD. I also have a generally addictive personality. I've become psychologically dependant on numerous things throughout my life, and some make more sense than others, but they're all similar in one aspect: I find it to be satisfying, but never satisfied enough to call it quits, and I am able to repeat it over a lengthy period of time. An obsessive behavior or thought process associated with OCD is remarkably similar to becoming addicted to say, playing WoW.   I think this question is oddly right up my alley at this moment in time...   I actually just had ana sex for the first time with my girlfriend last night *very briefly I might add* it was her first time too.   It was easier than I think we both thought it'd be to get it started, but by no means could I have "accidentally" fully penetrated her anus. I have drunkenly fumbled in the dark before and accidentally pressed up against the back door but nowhere near actual penetration.   I don't think it's even a myth, I think it's just a saying referencing how nimble cats are and how to a far less nimble human they seem to scrape dangerously close to serious injury/and walk away unscathed.  	19
 hmmm seems like he overslept and didn't get a chance to read his script before the show    GO BERNIE!!!    Point taken.  You are right.    I'm serious...I wish people would stop judging other people by their skin color, religious beliefs, orientation etc.  I am not proud to be a white american.   I cannot understand why this seems to be a partisan issue at all.  Sexual abuse is the same regardless of your political or religious beliefs.  Why would these politicians speak out in support of sexual abuse?   who knows? Probably millions, those sneaky bastards! /s   awesome!!! It's going to Bernie!!!   I wish I could upvote this more than once.  PERFECT!!!!   *You ask for it.*  So you think she should be a beggar?    Do you give money to homeless people with signs?     I never looked at her as a "charity case"  She was a kind, loving woman who did the right thing, as did her husband and healthcare costs made her a charity case   wouldn't you consider a sick person with say cancer needing treatment or someone who needs insulin to treat diabetes as someone who might be desperate?  And where I live anyways if that person does not have a college degree they are probably making $15/hour or less...now if you add health problems, or mental health issues, caring for aging parents, addiction or any other stress, don't ya think we need to help them out?  and collectively we can make sure that those basic needs are met.  I think you are assuming people just don't want to work or pay, they just want a free ride, and sure those people are out there, but they are in the minority For example we had a family friend when I was young who was 58 and her husband died of brain cancer.  She had health issues herself don't remember what I was young, but I do know she had metal rods in her for something. She had been a stay at home mom and her husband had worked for a place that built big bulldozers and equipment.  Well they weren't rich, but had a nice home and had saved for retirement.  When her husband died they had drained most of the savings on his medical bills then when she got sick and had to have surgery and therapy etc. she had nothing left.  She applied for aid and was denied because she owned a house, so she sold her house and moved into low income housing, had to get rid of her dog because he couldn't be there it was just such a sad story and she was such a nice sweet lady.  And all this time she was so sick too.  I guess that has made an impact on me and I don't want to see that happen to anyone.   I think you see taxes as robbery, and I don't so that is where we disagree...I am all for universal healthcare, because I don't want people whether they are family or strangers to die without healthcare so that I can have a little more money in my 401k   I would hope that my life is more important than anyones money, and if  i was starving, I can't say I wouldn't steal out of someones garden or something to stay alive....do you think that is bad?    I am outraged. I'm outraged that people are insured who should be paying out of pocket or going without treatment. I'm outraged that, to pay for it, the government has to either tax (meaning I lose money), borrow (keeping the interest rate low which means since I'm an investor rather than a borrower I lose money), or inflate the currency (which, again, since I have investments makes them worth less and I lose money  You believe some people who can't afford to pay should go without treatment?  Not everyone can afford it, but everyone is somebody's   son, daughter, mother, father, brother, sister, or grandparent...if poor people get sick, do you believe that we should leave them to die? Is money more important that a persons life?   Well, I'd be super suspicious of a hello kitty wallet too /s    Very well said.  I don't agree with you  about the size of government or that it is evil, it is the politics you cannot trust, but your position on vaccines makes sense to me.  I think government should be bigger with lots more us citizens working in and for the government, so that more people benefit and are better represented.  I am pro choice, and completely agree that the government has no business telling you what to do with your body    hear here    A race between Sanders and Paul would make me proud to be an American again    Go home Arizona...you're drunk       cheeseheads    The Republicans have a message??  I thought they just hated on the liberals...what exactly IS their message???   	21
 There is a lot of work going in the area of inorganic light absorbers for solar cells, particularly those that are non-toxic and earth-abundant (i.e., lots of the element in the earth's crust, such as iron, copper, nickel, etc).  Good old fool's gold (iron pyrite), a staple in every kid's rock collection, is making a comeback as it has great light absorption characteristics, but has problems related to annoying surface defects that wreck the output of the cell.  Another area is catalysis - catalysts that can make water splitting (into hydrogen and oxygen gases) efficient, and people have shown that iron and nickel oxides are effective.  That's neat.     Agreed that if you are still using fossil fuels to generate electricity, then the savings with respect to CO2 emissions are not great.  Automotive people do say, however, that electric cars are more efficient with respect to energy usage as the pesky heat problems in a combustion engine are basically non-existent.  So, there are some savings with respect to energy usage/CO2 emissions if you use an electric car. But, as for your question about the Powerwall, as a stand-alone battery, it's not ideal.    But, others see the Powerwall as a baby step towards the long range goal, which is renewable electricity generation interfaced with a home energy storage system.  Here is a Toyota home prototype "Smart House".  Of course this is a demo, but people are thinking, and trying things out.    http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/environmental_technology/plugin_hybrid/magazine05.htmlglo  I love this idea - having these concepts on the shelf are important.    It is fascinating to watch the trends moving through science, particularly through the energy fields.  Over the past two decades, the big thing was dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the really neat architecture first published by Graetzel at EPFL in 1991.  Then along came organic photovoltaics (plastic solar cells), which have enormous potential, but also have lifetime issues (it is obviously bad if your solar cell degrades in the sun!).  For the past few years, perovskites, of the composition CH3NH3PbX3 (where X is a halide = Cl, Br, I) have been the darling of the research field.  These materials have been sitting under our noses for decades, and perhaps even a century, and it was only in 2009, and then 2012, that the right combinations of materials were assembled to produce high efficiency solar cells.  Very large numbers of experimental papers are being published.  For lead references, have a look at the following websites of these (mostly) experimental groups:  Website of Henry Snaith (Oxford): https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/photovoltaic-and-optoelectronic-device-group  Website of Prashant Kamat (Notre Dame): http://www3.nd.edu/~kamatlab/  Website of Michael Graetzel (EPFL): http://lpi.epfl.ch  All of the research areas I mentioned above have enormous potential, and many smart people are working on them, around the world.  Good to see.    Both! Depends. How terrible an answer is that?  Let me give you a few scenarios - in northern Canada, we have thousands of isolated communities that generate electricity locally using diesel-powered generators; the diesel is driven up on ice roads in the winter, and the cost per kWh is ridiculous - $ 0.35 kWh to $1 kWh.  Even if they can only use solar for 6 months of the year during their very long summer days and the tails on either end, it would save a lot of money, not to mention the associated CO2 emissions.    The Sahara has been considered many, many times, as an enormous solar farm to generate power for Africa and Europe, but political instability and inefficiencies have stood in the way. In this piece by Nate Lewis in the Materials Research Society Bulletin, called "Powering the Planet", he quotes the Sutton Principle: True or not, the story goes that when the clean-cut, polite bank robber, Willy Sutton was caught, he was asked by a reporter why he robbed banks. His response: "Because that is where the money is".  The Sahara and other desert areas are huge sources of energy; our planet is small, and the population continues to grow and industrialize, so eventually we will get our ducks in a row and use it.  We will have to.    nsl.caltech.edu/_media/energy:ptp-mrs-bulletin-oct-2007.pdf  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertec http://www.voanews.com/content/solar-power-plant-in-africa-to-supply-europe/2500171.html  	4
 This may sound weird, but pay them off. Just say here's a billion dollars pull whatever you have in your pocket and give it to them! Regardless of what's actually in your pocket!   That sounds fantastic   What is your inner sanctuary?   You can do it! I suggest crazyinsanes wild technique for sure    Story building is always fun! Do you ever just have a start for the story and let the dream do the rest?   That's usually what I end up doing in most lucid dreams, just being in awe of what I am doing in that moment.    Had one with my grandpa at one point, it was really nice.    How long have you been lucid dreaming for? I've never done that. Sounds awesome!    Getting to know yourself in a Lucid Dream, I think it is one of the greatest things to do in a lucid dream! I do it on occasion!   	9
 I wouldn't apologize for this.   ditto :)   That's pretty shit, bro. I'm sorry you are dealing with that, I do hope you avoided the trap of debt. o.o   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq3PpZGTGQ8   Lol. I feel that way...   Anyone know where they are hiring around here? I've been looking for a bit now and been turned down for every place I've looked. I know it shouldn't be this hard to find a job...  Any ideas or insights would be fantastic and greatly appreciated. I'm great with marketing and I know how to do receptionist/secretarial work.   This is one article that made me go YAY!   I know right, that photographer was a wimp   Sometimes I wish there were a hell, so the men that did this would go there. For taking the life of a child in this manner is definitely go-to-hell worthy. I guess we should just take it upon ourselves to find the perps and be on the upside of fucking the rest of their every day up.   In a radio interview they said they had issues with the waves for the first object while photographing it. They said that for the second object that the disturbances were much stronger. It was harder to photograph. While this doesn't mean it necessarily was magnetic interference, it was something they noted. There is a bit of discrepancy there, tho.    Those kids looked like any little kids. Small, fragile, innocent, full of life...and it was taken away because some old men can't talk out their problems like ADULTS. I'll never understand that. Ever. If I murdered people because I was angry, or appointed others to kill b/c I was angry, I'd be jailed. But you give me a title of "leader" or the ilk, and suddenly all this red-tape shows up and people get all scared. Grow up, assholes, they are murdering your children for fuck's sake.   i don't get why asking a fellow redditor that question would bother them so much, unless they were a dick.   I'd be highly skeptical of a meteorite, simply due to lack of evidence of any devastation that an impact of that size might bring to the surrounding land.  I fully agree there needs to be real-time video of this event, with multiple cameras on multiple live feeds. If aliens come out of there, I want to see! If it's a meteor, I want to see! If it's something man-made from Atlantis or what have you, I want to see that too! Truth is, it's not unheard of for governments to see something like this and close it off to the public due to "safety" or something. If that does happen, and there is censorship and a media-blackout occurs, pay very special attention to the terminology used, and people that live near there should be watching, too. They need to take pictures of the event, they need to ensure that the rest of the world knows what is down there. I don't think it's something we've ever seen before, but it could be an Oopart. I really feel like if that were the case, it'll be covered up, too. But if people are watching, and paying attention, then we will have info trickle out in the ways of videos, pictures, interviews, etc.   LoooooL   Not just the skeptics! There are people who are just blindly believing, they have a head nodding disease, they just agree with anything put forth on the subject. You have to approach this subject with a hefty level of skepticism. There are lots of liars out there, people that will say they had an experience just to write a book and make money off a popular topic. (This happens not just with UFO's and paranormal things, but women lie about being raped, but I digress...) If you are going to put forth an argument, have the common sense to be able to back it up, if you put forth information that you don't know is true, say you aren't sure. So many people aren't doing this on here. I find myself shaking my head at a lot of comments. It's really hard to see that. The discussions here could be epic and well thought out, but we are left with fluff and lots of lies and half-truths. :(   That water is very very murky. This is one thing that bothers me, if they find it, and it's not natural and either an Oopart -or- is Alien, then the probability of them actually releasing the findings are slim. I doubt it's a meteorite, simply because there would be more pieces of it, there would be evidence of an impact of water/debris on land. I doubt it's a 'lost civilization' because of the track marks, and that there are two of these. Heck, it could be some old Atlantian airship, but we won't know until they find out.   Godspeed to tomorrow, June 1st, 2012. May they NOT raise Cthulhu. :P    Well, I like Toast, so we're in agreement. :)   Honestly, I wouldn't have said anything, but the more I am on this subreddit, the more upset I get with the spewing out of info by people who have obviously no idea what they are talking. I've studied the phenomena of UFO's (and other paranormal things), and I really hone in on the facts that can be derived. This case is so chock full of facts that it's hard to see people say "it's been debunked", or some silly uneducated, almost trollish, response. I realize being a jerk won't win friends, but there is a reason lots of people do leave this subreddit. I'd like to see it flourish, the way it truly should. I didn't mean to offend.   Wow. The level of ignorance in this thread hurts me. I guess I'll have to actually spell it out. There were 2 objects found at the bottom of The Baltic Sea. The first one, is the one that is usually shown in pictures. There is a second, smaller object, as well. They have long drag marks that are still at the bottom of the sea, b/c the Baltic actually is quite still and there isn't much to change damage done to the bottom, even after long long periods of time. Now, it looks like these two objects may have been together at one point, may have hit something and broke off into two trajectories. (this is conjecture, but there is some evidence to back it up). Now, the first object, while huge, to me isn't as interesting as the less-known second object. This one is interesting. When they  tried to take photographs of it, they had a difficult time due to magnetic disturbances.  Something is down there, I highly doubt it's volcanic due to this info.  For further reading: http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1963   :) *The More You Know!*   Explain the drag marks, from BOTH objects. Yes, there are two. Oh you didn't know, then sit the fuck down, child, you got some learning to do.   Hey! Where is the guy on Bath Salts! He needs to be represented!!   As an atheist, I am all for women standing up for themselves. No matter how trite the situation may be. Honestly, this woman had a right to do what she did. Fuck the religious police. They can choke on a donkey dick.   I was going to say the same thing. There are a lot of other benefits in the other chemicals in Marijuana. Not just soley with the THC. Also, the combination of THC with those other compounds actually have been proven to create effects than just those singular compounds isolated out. This study, while interesting, proves nothing.   I noticed that too.   This is one of those instances where the word "gore" is underrepresented.   ditto   It's just a really terrible place.      Good For Her. She is a hero for her sisters.   I am really glad I'm not the only one that feels this way. I miss Art, but Knapp is the true successor to that seat. It's really unfortunate about Noory, he really almost seems like he dislikes his job. :(   not real, move along :)   I have enough people watching me, I'd be found out .  Having said that, I would take a piece and run. No doubt.   Thanks. I didn't know about the bdsm community. I subscribe to r/bdsm and r/bdsmgonewild already, but I didn't know where else to post this. I didn't know the responses to pain were that different. But then, I never really had a great partner. ^.^ I'm glad I do now tho!   It was definitely a new thing for me. I've been paddled before but not like that, and it was just so incredible. Hard to walk, hard to see...but incredible :) I cannot wait to do it again!!   I was being paddled lol   This happened to me a few days ago. I'm no slouch when it comes to sex, or so I thought. The guy used a lot of foreplay and in the middle of it I had to walk a bit. I couldn't see straight, I couldn't walk, it was like I was so drunk. It was a bit strange and the guy was great, helping me walk and keeping me from falling.  Has anyone else experienced this? Is that normal??   grats :)   Oh man. That was hard to read. .   Some countries are actually taking the issue of UFOs and Aliens much more seriously than the USA. Especially South American countries. Check it out   time to move.   She sounds like a bitch. I dealt with some of those at BYU myself. Stay strong!!    " This just seems like her and my dad's passive aggressive way of telling me im wrong."  I'd call it that too. Good luck Salaczar!  I can't believe she sent you to FAIRS...   Yes, I've seen the Santorum fanatics, too.   You realize 72% of Americans believe in U.F.O.'s right?  And, with all the recent revelations of creatures being found in the depths of the oceans exhibiting behaviors and abilities previously unknown to mankind, the public is becoming more accepting to the notion of U.F.O.'s is much easier to accept. It really seems that the only people who do not believe are either highly religious or people who dismiss the data for whatever reason. :)    I'm not going to do it. It's too risky, tempting tho. :) Maybe during the apocalypse, look me up?   You are right, you are meat while alive too. And yeah, I would eat my animals or my family if it was socially acceptable and they were dead :)  It's not being disrespectful, I just really really enjoy meat.    Once you are dead, you are meat. Period.   My best case against Prions is this: You have to consume the body while it is still living. Want a thigh? You gotta chop it while the person is still alive. This is the best theory I have come up with to prevent the disease.   Humans are meat. I see no difference between an animal eating it's young, the cannibalism of one animal to another of the same species. Humans are animals, we have meat, time to eat! Om nom nom   People are meat. I'd have no issue with this, however, you should be aware, I don't find it sexual. I just really love meat and would love me some long pork. Mmmm yes ;)   more stories like this please. credible witness is credible :)   Now I know why she set fire to the rain.   Anyone else LOOOL at the pics of the Ancient Aliens guy and WoooT at Goldblum?   Cool Story Bro!   I think some of the "ufo's" are alive...or are so completely advanced they appear to be alive.   Well put :)   I had this song in my head randomly today...so after reading this I HAD to listen to it :)   I questioned my sanity, too. But I don't think your crazy one bit, because I saw one of those blinking red lights. Get this: Some of them change shape. So it's no wonder they were all different shapes :)   I only saw one picture online...and I did a gis...maybe you can link where I can see some? (and also find out more info)  Thanks :)   Yes  http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1942 category=Environment  It looks like a hoax.   I've noticed a bit of the same in Raleigh...   I'm glad you shared this story :)   I REALLY like this idea. I think there is some tweaking going to be involved but it's actually not a difficult concept to make reality. We just have to get people interested in wanting closer contact. Your idea of hotspots is just the place to start marketing to!   I want to send them paint and paintbrushes so they can create positive artwork on the gate. Kind of a "fuck you, stay the fuck out, this is a Happy Environment" to all those assholes who want to machete good people.   Hey, it's how my TBM Mom recounted it. She may have sugar-coated thru the years :)   They were bringing in a piano into a very small room and told us to push our chairs back. When I did this my chair collapsed in my hands. I was very very little and it's a vague memory. I do remember there was one other part of the 'miracle'. The dr said b/c  of the way my pinkies tendons were cut and stuff that I would 1. have no use of my pinkies ever in life and 2. They would never grow past a three year old size! Neither of those things happened.  The human body is an amazing vessel :)   PLEASE PLEASE RAGE FACE THIS!! I BEG YOU!!   I broke my two pinkies in church. This guy who drove me to the hospital also gave me a blessing in the hospital where they kept the prisoners (I have no idea why). As soon as the blessing was over I stopped crying, started to laugh and act like my fingers were fine.  Cue the oohs and aahhhs...   I went to BYU-Idaho. I laughed so freaking hard :)   Where are you? I'd be happy to help you in this venture :)   Actually, the government has done a terrible job of covering up the UFO/Alien matter. If anybody cares to look for it, the Press Club meetings are online for all to see.  I know, you don't want to find it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk  There is a whole lot more than just this. The truth, so to speak, is out there.   I was looking at the picture when something was in my eye. Holy shit, that, that is touching. Go Reddit. :)   15,000 songs myself,... know how ya feel   those aren't your friends. fuck em   Thanx :)   Not sure if your really dumb or if your just trolling, especially when you are using Reddit (which won't exist after SOPA) to put forth your angst at the "circle-jerkers".   Do it guys :)   You are right, it was jarring. It completely shattered my view of the world and everything in it. I realized I knew absolutely nothing about the world and space in which I lived. I now knew something was out there, but as I have stated before, I would have expected some religious insight along with it, but..nothing. This lack of evidence in one manner and a strong opposition that is right in front of me(I was taught that there is NO thing out there, that this universe is void of all living things, even tho, in my deepest heart I thought it to be full of shit). To me, for some reason, there can't be a God if there is more. There can't be. And, even if there is, it's not for me to worry about. What I saw was much more interesting and definitely has a stronger possibility of reality (ufos/aliens) than an invisible sky daddy.   Where can I sign up to be the girl?   It was told to me to not do it, that it isn't worth the "five minutes of pleasure"  ...about that ;)   *nods* we shall see :)   While you do have a point, I would prefer to leave that portion out as I have not delved into it at all :)  I would only like to give information that I feel is pertinent. I have never thought of my dreams to be pertinent, so.. I feel it would be in bad taste.   I still think it is just me coming to terms with the event, but if you really want to know...pm me?   That is very interesting. :)  I did have strange nightmares, really strange and spooky stuff, after the event. I don't know if that means anything, I always thought it was my brains own way of coming to terms with the event. I wouldn't be adverse to learning more. I am curious now.   I really didn't think to, other than just me knowing what time it was because I would drive this route a lot :)   Nom :)   Yes, I am a 'she'. :)   I do not know what it was or where it came from. But the event, whatever happened, changed my life. Forever. I don't expect many people would come out the same if face to face with such an unknown.  *(also, ufo does not mean extraterrestrial. Taken as what it is Unidentified Flying Object is just that. Unidentified. Therefore, Unknown. But, maybe, not unknowable?) :)   Like I said, I was sober for this. And, truthfully, I'm glad I was. I had my faculties about me and instead of freaking out I just tried really hard to remember exactly what I was witnessing, so I could write it down later. (and I did)   I have wondered about that myself. I don't know it it will be of any help, and I would want to go to a reputable hypnotherapist as well. Preferably one who doesn't just shut me out upon hearing I saw something and I don't know what it was.   No. More like a red blood cell, however that is a neat pic :)   ahh gotcha :)  Thank you for clarifying. And, yes, I realize with no physical proof it would be truly impossible to explain, and, honestly, I can't blame people who wouldn't believe my assertion without it.   Interesting theory. I get what you are saying, however, I do not fit this description, as I openly admit I have no idea what it was. (and even that it might all be in my mind, even tho I am of pretty sound mind)   It happened so long ago, but it's not impossible as I did write down the date, time and highway (down to the exits) in my journal when I got home that night.   I have never heard of this syndrome, and I think many people suffer from this. Have you ever met someone who watches and believes everything Fox News spews?  And, if you had read my previous responses, I do concede that I do not know for certain what it is I saw. I can't. I'd never seen anything like that before. It truly should be called an "unknown" but saying UFO is slightly easier to express to people who do not know what to make of it when you say "I saw an unknown". To say I believe-in what I saw, would be untrue as well.   Because it wasn't a space wizard as you put it. I saw an unknown. And, maybe to you there is no connection, but you are not me. To me, as I have stated, this event seemed to me, like what one would say was religious, but what I experienced was not religious in any nature. I just witnessed something I could not explain and it clicked in my mind that events like this do not a god make.   Only smoke the ganga. But I was sober that night.   I was absolutely sober for this event. I was driving home from Massage Therapy class. I do not believe I was even working on anyone that night, just basic studies.  It looked like a red blood cell, until it shifted it's shape. Like I said, I can call it a UFO but, in reality, what I saw was an "unknown". And it definitely seemed alive in some manner. Of course, I have to concede that even some of our technology to date would seem almost "alive" to someone living in the middle ages. (Especially if that object is remote controlled in some manner)   I have considered the possibility that it was all in my head. However I do not believe the event to be as such. The officer almost hitting me definitely alerted me to the strong possibility that s/he was seeing this too.  	98

Shazam by Jeff Smith.  Runaways by Brian K Vaughn.     Agreed. He looks huge.    'Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal' by Christopher Moore.  A wonderful story about friendship, love and forgiveness.  It is also one of the funniest books I've ever read.  I was raised a catholic but no longer follow any religion but after reading this book I think Catholicism would be better served following Joshua, Biff   Mary.  The book certainly gave me reason to pause and think about certain things.  Highly recommend the book.     Sorry don't know why it's doing that worked on my end the first time.

Maybe 2016 will be my lucky year.   Brave and Bold was good for it's team-up characters. Brought out a lot of DC characters and stories that may have otherwise never been utilized in an animated show.  The JLU was by far and away my favorite batman.   Will do. Thanks for the heads up   That's funny as hell   I just felt Grant Morrison's run on Batman with Williams, Quitely and Kubert was one of the most influential Batman arcs in recent memory.  Whether people like it or not can be debated but the artist were top notch.  I read the introduction and qualification but Bruce Timm defined Batman for a generation with BAS.   Loved the original Pikmin. Now my kids play it. Very generous of you.    Dark Tower series by Stephen King (7 long books) made me very sad when it ended. Invested a lot of time and emotion into those books. Each and every character became a member of my family. I've read the series twice. The second read was just as emotional and heartfelt as the first.     100 Bullets by Brian Azzarello The Exterminators by Simon Oliver Stephen King's the Dark Tower by Peter David The Boys by Garth Ennis   Seems like it would be a cleaning nightmare.

Thought it was interesting.   No reason to get nasty.     he reminds of this guy! http://goo.gl/mFc2bb    i agree with you on the utility bill.  He has only one child.  Lot of space for three people (really 2 people because he's on the road 40+ weeks a year).  He seems like a nice guy.  Stopped and talked to my 12 year old boy during a practice round of a tournament for a few minutes and gave him a signed golf ball.     Great picture.

I will give it read later today.  I've been wanting to pick up this book so happy to read a review prior to making the plunge.     Actually read somewhere they're making a Popeye CGI movie.   Where did you get those cases?  I really like them.    Batman   My son got this backpack for a Christmas present. It's bada$$.    Wtf did I just watch?    You can't have sex with raw meat on AMC?   i want one as well.  beautifully done.   She does look a lot like her.     Bob should play Batman in the new Superman/Batman movie.   They're all beautifully drawn and colored. The Batman Beyond is my favorite.     Sorry, I don't but will look to see if I can find it.

Thank you.  I will add to the itinerary.     Have not played the course.  Just saw it for the first time.  After seeing it, I am going to try to make time this summer to travel there and play the course.  It looks amazing.   I miss Fairly Odd Parents.  Funny show.   Beastie Boys "Girls" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6otiLxT34DQ   and steamy   Yes, that is what I gathered from the video.

Amazing how many of those $60 a dozen balls you can find on a golf course   I understand that.  I have a backlog of books waiting to be read.

 "You can't have your cake and eat it too" If I have cake, you can bet your booty I'm gonna eat it. I get what it's trying to say, but it really doesn't make that much sense.   It is a minimally invasive surgery which, thanks to modern medicine, is safe, and a newborn will have 0 memory of it ever happening.

                   I have a good friend I have been gaming with for some time. He is an Iraq War Vet who did 6 tours. He cannot work now and lives in a very tiny town. He very much relies on his friendships in Warcraft for companionship and to provide 'something to do every day' in his life.   His old laptop completely quit a few days ago and he has a HP Pavilion DV6 2057 cl - that he has been trying to get the game downloaded to ever since. He says it just needs a hard drive, but I think it is too old. It keeps giving him an error that states the Javascript cannot be found and another message about the graphics card being out of date.  I desperately want to do something but am in an extremely tight spot, financially. I don't even have a tree this year.   I am heartsick that he will be spending the holidays 'alone' more or less. I thought about requesting assistance from his online friends- but he is very proud and would be upset if I did so. He needs a hard drive for the HP or even a cheap laptop that is just good enough to run the game.   Any assistance or advice would be highly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance.                        Doing your job, I see.

Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. [According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/m/moon_kristie.html)   In 2001, Sherrif Ron Wyatt and his partner stopped Michael Pearcy.  ["Wyatt and his partner stopped a car driven by Michael Pearcy who was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation."](http://www.bpnews.net/4392/bivocational-pastor-recovers-from-roadside-shooting)  Michael Pearcy shot Sherrif Ron Wyatt and Wyatts partner then shot Michael Pearcy to death.

It doesn't look like there were serious searches or investigations held. It's as if no one even wanted to acknowledge her disappearance. This is the exact opposite from the Holly Bobo kidnapping where hundreds of people turned out to search and the police held numerous press conferences.  Here is where it gets strange. Sheriff Wyatt, in three different interviews over the years (all before the Bobo kidnapping), has given three different explanations as to why he pulled over Michael Pearcy. Once for 'bad tail light' and once because Pearcy had been "doing something illegal earlier in the day." The original article states that Wyatt pulled Michael Pearcy over because he was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Which I presumed was over the disappearance of Kristie Moon.   Now from the Associated press - a statement by Sheriff Wyatt thats a jaw dropper:  ["Rita Foley with The Associate Press said that Sheriff Wyatt never expected something like this to happen in the small tight-knit community. He was visibly shaken by the news of Holly's disappearance."](http://www.examiner.com/article/holly-bobo-big-city-crime-comes-to-small-tight-knit-community-safety-tips)  Excuse me? This sheriff was shot by Michael Pearcy, the suspect in the disappearance of Kristie Moon and son of one of the guys busted in the Bobo kidnapping.   And Sheriff Wyatt acts all surprised, like nothing like this had ever happened in Parsons, Tennessee?  Why did Wyatt give several reasons why he pulled over Michael Pearcy in the first place? Was the TBI investigating Pearcy in Kristies disappearance? It's very hard to dig up any information on this.   We can't ask Sheriff Wyatts partner- he was killed a few weeks later while investigating a car wreck.  I just know that something stinks to high heaven in Parsons, TN.

 The troops are there because the corrupt Baltimore police force have been killing people for years and couldn't get their shit in order. The riot was inevitable.

Cover your identity carefully. Only send e-mail if you can secure it. Stay anonymous. Use VPNs. Wipe traces of what you do. Organize yourselves but be smart. Be careful who you trust, you WILL be infiltrated. Never openly advocate violence or let anyone trick you into advocating that.

Martial law has many layers, and we've been living under it since WW1. There have been decades long programs to keep people under control.

No, there are fun sized candy bars in my real world.   You got it.   You're right on points one and two that a lot of stuff has been happening that is just criminal. However I totally disagree on point three, I know people in Baltimore and the activism during the Ferguson protests and since has been widespread. The organized protests against the Freddie Gray killing were big and peaceful. I think there has to be a distinction between people who engage in criminality and the majority who do not.  Many of those involved in organizing protests against the police have been on the front line attempting to stop the violence.   Or he'll be in some blockbuster starring a journalist as the hero who saves everyone. Hollywood is predictably twisted that way.   Mark Passio's really good.

It's how they're covering the riots. They always cover riots because they can whip people up and scare them and that sells papers.   [You break the law every day without knowing it](http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2013-10-22/you-break-law-every-day-without-even-knowing-it)   So many of the stories about police abuse follow a narrative of "the bad cop" deviating from all the good cops, but this case in South LA really shows how systemic the problem is when it comes to how the police view and deal with the public.      You mean the cops should behave themselves better? I agree. As for doing an illegal U-turn every now and then, we've all been there. People do what people have got to do. If you're white you get a ticket when they catch you, if you're a person of color, you get arrested and/or beaten.   The final episode of the Almighty Johnsons.   Media bias that regularly paints ordinary citizens as violent animals is a conspiracy. Maybe it's an intentional one by power elites or maybe it's a systemic one caused by the financial bottom line of the media companies who need to sensationalize everything in order to sell copy, but it's still a conspiracy because in the end the media distorts reality and people get harmed because of that distortion.   Just like all those rich neighborhoods where no one does drugs? Or the middle class or blue collar ones that are so drug free? Drugs are everywhere, so why is it only poor people get locked up for them?    What's great about this is that after Morgan Freeman offers a nuanced perspective about how maybe just maybe some elements of the media are starting to listen to protestors after their shameful misrepresentation of them in Ferguson, the reporter then sensationalizes Freeman's message by focusing on his throwaway line at the end thus proving that the media really does suck.            Great quote.   Fuck the law.   If people want to do drugs, let them. Who gives a shit? What kind of moralistic assholes give a shit about people doing drugs? I mean, I don't personally do drugs, but listening to assholes telling me how evil drugs are makes me want to get high as fuck.   We have 5% of the world's population and 25% of the world's prison population. We have far more prisoners than China including Chinese political prisoners. We also have legalized slave labor as enshrined under the Constitution which exempts prisoners from the prohibition on forced labor. And trust me, what's happening in Baltimore has a lot to do with African American men being removed from society for prolonged periods of time to serve sentences for non-violent drug crimes. How can communities function let alone grow and thrive when all the men are taken from them? And at least Stalin's gulags weren't for profit.    Pretty intense, I'd want to know more about the video before judging it. As an aside, why are the comments in /r/news always so stupid? I mean, no one can say anything that isn't jokey. Can't they ever say their opinion without trying to make it seem cute or ironic? I hate leaving this sub for other subs.   Another dimension of this is that Weld comes from one of the most powerful and wealthy families in American history. William Weld was governor of Massachusetts for example.    It's kind of nuts, that's why it's hard to follow.  The theory says that Tuesday Weld, sixties actress, was at the center of a satanic underground. She does pop up in a lot of places including the Stones song Ruby Tuesday. She had connections to the Sharon Tate murder and to a ton of esoteric goings on during the 60s and 70s. The guy who is talking about this theory is named Jeff Turner and there was an amazing documentary about him called I Think We're Alone Now. This is one of the weirder conspiracies to come out of the sixties.      I guess what I'm saying is Bernays taught the black magic and Hoover acted on it.   So - if I've got this straight - if they get caught it's a conspiracy, but if they don't get caught, we're tinfoil wearing loonies.   No other single human being is so responsible for brainwashing the masses as he was. People point to Bernays, but he was just trying to dupe us into buying shit we don't need. Hoover set groups against one another and turned this into a spiteful, paranoid country. It's like we're living inside the guy's twisted head.   Or better yet, sit your five year old in front of this: [COINTELPRO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDbVIDJnPzA)   I'll give it a stab: Hoover... bad man... FBI program to frame and disrupt political activities by blacks, Latinos, lefties, and college kids... highly illegal... Fred Hampton and other Panthers murdered... Vietnam protesters harassed, John Lennon followed, mass infiltration of activist groups that continues to this day. I'm assuming I'm talking to a really smart five year old.

Could be a Reddit glitch for all I know.   Kaczynski drew much of his philosophy from Ellul and in particular the book I posted called Technological Society. In fact they had a long correspondence where the one thing they disagreed about was the use of violence. Check it out, you might find it interesting even though it was originally written in the 50's!   Cool. I think you essentially have the idea. It's about human beings becoming more purposeful with their use of technology, taking the reigns back and not just having blind faith in technological systems. Technology certainly can save us, but we have to cultivate the wisdom to use it better than we do at present. Hope you find it interesting.   I'm for non-violence but not necessarily peace. Creative non-violence was a powerful movement in the 70s and 80s. Collective civil disobedience can work wonders. Maybe one could argue that what we're seeing in Baltimore fits in with that. But when movements target the police or military, they're falling into a trap because those violent entities feed off of attempts at violence used against them. They love violence. Their budgets balloon, they get to seize control, they get to fear monger the public. Any act of violence - as opposed to destruction of property that results in no harming of human beings - any attempt at violent resistance will be fuel to the fire of these authoritarian forces. Resistance needs to be smart and sustainable, but it probably shouldn't obsess over being peaceful.   If anyone is interested, here's a link to Ellul's masterpiece [Technological Society](http://monoskop.org/images/5/55/Ellul_Jacques_The_Technological_Society.pdf).   No other book has had more of an influence on me.  Ellul is criminally forgotten, but his ideas are more relevant than ever.   I've watched this a bunch of times, but never straight through.

Sorry about that.  I won't do the same.  I'm not in software but the general principles are the same.  Perform well at every level and go outside your required duties.  Take extra tasking on that would not typically be expected of you.  Let people know you're interested in new and different opportunities, even if they may seem outside your area of expertise.  Maintain networks of folks you've done work for - you never know when you might need or benefit from a reference.  Take training opportunities that come your way.  Make yourself invaluable.  Learn things that are new and exciting, or old and fading away.  Things that are out there in the world need to be maintained, just as much as the new things need to be created.  Strive to do better on every assignment then you did on the last.  If something's due on a particular date, get it done early.  Anyway, that's what I have for now.

Though not as many gut busters in this as the few eps immediately prior.   Was watching with my girlfriend aboard NAS Pax River...Saw a bright red flash that lasted about 10 seconds then nothing.  Caught up with the live stream on UStream.tv to find out what happened and saw about the explosion.  One of my coworkers watched from a boat out on the Bay and forwarded some pictures as well.  Pretty crazy; an unfortunate setback for commercial spaceflight.   What the heck is a "sort of kind of relationship"?  I don't understand this attempting to be with other people when you're in a relationship.  If you're not in it to win it then in my opinion you shouldn't be in it at all...If you feel the need to explore then get it if the relationship.  Sounds like it's not meeting your needs...

There is a fix and it's called the Open Flash Tablet.  You're welcome.   You don't need xposed or greenify. Everything carrier and most LG stuff can be disabled without even needing root.   It is not a "manumatic".  It is a traditional torque converter automatic transmission.  Just because it has paddles doesn't make it a multiple clutch transmission.  It's no different than what's in your mom's Camry.   Um...why was ANY of that "funny?"   Well obviously in some cases that will work, because it has, but there's always a risk that in a particular update they change something that causes you to lose root or prevents the update from working.  Then again, those of us on Verizon have no experience with this process since we've never had an update yet.  And now that there's an unlock, I never will.   Currently you have to flash it back to stock.  Wiping everything in the process.   You ignore them.   You are indeed mistaken.  Unroot still requires LG Flash Tool.  It's not a Nexus.   Even if you are just rooted you should not install ANY update until its confirmed it doesn't cause any issues.   It has a .26" larger screen and it's just about the same distance taller and wider which makes perfect sense.   4.5 mm...0.18 inches...I don't think that qualifies as "a lot".

The shitty thing about coming out is that it's something you do for your whole life, again and again.   A non gender specific pronoun would be something like "they"...not partner.

A backdoor pilot is when you have the folks on NCIS travel down to New Orleans and then the week after NCIS: New Orleans starts.  Or when the guys on JAG go talk to NCIS and the hour after JAG is when NCIS has its first episode.  Or when the Originals of TVD travel down to New Orleans to get into fisticuffs and then next week "The Originals" starts...It's when a show uses another show's setting and varies the circumstances slightly to spin off another show.

 (singing) "suicide is painless...."   reminds me of a terry gilliam movie   im sorryv that was a little harsh, but im just saying theres records for breaking stuff with peoples heads in there, so if THOSE can get into record books, THIS can get into record books (or SHOULD) anyway   hmmm i must've missed that one, but still in the yearly edition that'd be cool   dude, ANYTHING GOES in record books,so stfu  EDIT: ok that might have come out a little harsh   well technically i knew it for a while i just slowly got around to starting a discussion. but anyway, i think Guinness world records should have it in their next edition. like i can imagine that paragraph as follows:  pocket monsters (or pokemon depending on where youre from) is an anime based on the videogame series of the same name (also known as pokemon in english speaking markets) has ran for 17 seasons as of (insert date here) for over 800 episodes. pocket monsters also has been made into 16 feature films as of (insert6 date here and yes im aware theres a 17th movie coming out) making that the longest running film franchise based on a videogame.  wouldnt that be awesome? i say make this happen!! put that in the next guinness world records book!   Hey! He is not z-list! He's listless! You however just made my list!   http://imgur.com/h8A09QY   ah poopie!   ah poopie!   well what i wrote here i wouldnt write in english class. so in other words im not in school i can write whatever. even if it might offend some which i probably did   no but im quite a fan   i found similarities between the anime and doctor who, and they are as follows  . both ash ketchum and the doctor travel to weird and wonderful places  . both always happen to go somewhere where something bad is happening  . both ash ketchum and the doctor change their looks    1. ash ketchum changes his outfit from time to time    2. the doctor changes his whole damn body  . both ash ketchum and the doctor have an ever changing array of traveling companions   i dont know about you guys but im on to something here, if i missed any other similarities let me know      In what way did you enjoy it?      Infect or repulse, I'm having a hard time determining which is being used as the negative term   patrick star lost his shit    just in case you don't know who he is here's a link explaining who Doug Jones is:  http://imgur.com/h8A09QY  anyway who would he be good to play?   just in case you don't know who he is here's a link explaining who Doug Jones is:   http://imgur.com/h8A09QY  anyway who would he be good to play?   before i watched the aforementioned episode i waited a 24 hour period so i could prepare myself for watching it, and i didnt have a seizure. but the flashing lights kinda gave me a little headache which went away. as for the episode itself its kinda interesting showing them go inside the machine kinda like TRON. and porygon was well represented. but all things considered the quality of the episode feels irrelevent, for its more (in)famous for the incident it caused, in fact most people dont even know what the episode is even about. and it brings me to the question, Should 'electric soldier porygon' be considered a 'fan favorite'? yes or no and explain why in the comments   oh man i hope i end up disagreeing with you, ive been waiting MONTHS to watch this movie.   i hope so, i could barely hold back tears at the end of movie 6: jirachi wish maker AND they top it off with a song to boot. i mean cmon man that wasnt fair   can someone get me in the right mindset to get ready to cry or be sad (or both)   i thought itd be a nickelodeon logo at first   My alternative titles are 'live and let BI', 'the living GAYlights', 'closet of solace', 'the BI who loved me', 'goldenBI', 'you only come out twice', 'come out another day', 'COONraker', 'BIamonds are forever' or 'closet royale' what do you guys think?

I mean does 95% and 87% mean ANYTHING TO YOU PEOPLE!? anyway I would like to see what bob orci has in store and sorry if I offended some people but youre still ungrateful.   you know like the part where the team rocket soldiers in the black shirts reveal like those wind blowing devices on the ship? and then like they show some trainers whose pokeballs are flying off their belts and then they cut to the main three who are surrounded by said team rocket soldiers demanding them to hand over their pokemon and misty is like saying "no way!" in that same scene they have those same air blowing devices and somehow the main characters just get asked to give up their pokemon while all thes trainers pokemon are literally flying away!? this is a troubling question from an otherwise great story arc. and i mean GREAT story arc. i get like a doctor who vibe from this episode . hell i often compare the anime to doctor who anyway. anyway i just thought it was weird that these team rocket grunts who had this high tech pokemon theft equipment just ask them for pokemon. any thoughts on that?   how about 'from seattle with love' 'live and let BI' or 'the living GAYlights'   i thought they are fun and action packed. i mean ive heard some people say like "it doesnt have the heart of star trek" "i hate the new actor for spock and hes gay" "i hate the actors" "i hate the new enterprise" the list goes on. meanwhile here i am not having too high standards wanting to be entertained and agreeing with the rave reviews (a movie doesnt get 95% or 87% on rotten tomatoes magically people!) its like one moment its like "critics and audiences agree the new star trek is awesome" and then its like "PSYCHE! heres some asshole mean spirited,ungrateful and hateful purists to keep it interesting" im literally afraid to have discussions of the new star treks on this site fearing ill get a hate message of some kind. because some trekkers are very royal. i swear to god if i hear ONE MORE TIME about it not having genes vision i will slip into a stress induced coma. if anyone has a good reason why i should or shouldnt like the jj abrams star trek movies dont hesitate to explain why. thank you   ive seen tblt MANY times and its great   Just so you know this kind of an edit of another post I did because someone pointed out the bad grammar and punctuation and this is an improvement over it. So anyway about 'a goofy movie' Man, I watched the HELL out of that movie as a kid, I havnt seen it in a while but I'm sure I still do today. I mean imagine for a moment you're a producer for Disney and you're waiting for an idea for a 'goof troop' spinoff film and you want it to appeal to the current generation (when the 1990's WAS the current generation) and make it as trendy and hip as possible. And just when you thought all hope was lost, someone comes into your office and is like (spoilers)   guy: I have an idea for that gestating goof troop spinoff film.   Producer: alright let's hear it   guy: ok so max is in high school now and gets in trouble.   Producer: hmmmmmm that's interesting tell me more   guy: ok so after the principal calls goofy and Tells him if max keeps this up hell get in trouble in life.  Producer: ohhhhhhh yessssss keep going   guy: ok so goofy arranges to go on a cross country road trip to get their relationship back to normal but max wanted to watch this concert on tv with his girlfriend. But now can't. And now that max and goofy are on said road trip they come across many strange characters and obstacles including Bigfoot. And they learn a little something about each other in the process.   Producer: I love it!!! It's a sure fire winner! Let's make it a musical and yo got yourself a deal.  If I ever met the guy who wrote the screenplay to 'a goofy movie' I would thank the HELL out of him for such an amazing childhood film. Know what I mean?      Man, I watched the HELL out of that movie as a kid, I havnt seen it in a while but I'm sure I still do today. I mean imagine for a moment you're a producer for Disney and you're waiting for an idea for a 'goof troop' spinoff film and someone comes into your office and is like (spoilers)   guy: I have an idea for that gestating goof troop spinoff film.   Producer: alright let's hear it   guy: ok so max is in high school now and gets in trouble.

Know what I mean?   i want him to like turtles   yes, and if they arent do any pretend to regenerate   do any characters regenerate? if so whom? and if not, does anybody at least pretend to regenerate?   Oh I see, but still saying that synopsis must taste pretty damn good.   I mean pretty much any kid who grew up in the 1990's knows what 'space jam' is I mean I'm jealous of the guy who was able to walk into a studio and tell a producer: (spoilers) Guy: ok here's the idea, the owner of this intergalactic theme park which is panned by its customers, wants to improve the park by having the looney toons work there . So he sens his henchmen to kidnap the looney toons. Producer:hmmmmmm that's interesting, tell me more. Guy: so then when the henchmen attempt to kidnap the looney toons, the looney toons challenge the henchman to a no holds barred basketball game with the aid of a soon to be retiring nba superstar Michael Jordan. Producer: I LOVE IT!!! We'll get started immediately! I mean that takes some balls to have that plot just pass your lips like that. You know you'd have a ball pitching it. That guy must've had the best day of his life then. I mean (the late) siskel and ebert both gave it a thumbs up.    I said stuff like "wash the c*m out of your mouth" "good luck losing your virginity" "fag" stuff like that. I mean, is it wrong that I liked into darkness? I mean all I'm saying is that I want to feel safe saying something and not have anybody push me around. I mean do those rotten tomatoes scores mean anything to Trekkers? Anyway I'm sorry for all the mean stuff I said.   Oh I get it! You're checking both the man and woman out whose skating   Do any characters regenerate?   i think of the war doctor as 'the 8th doctor mark II' because it was eights decision to take the form while still alive with that face, and even after eight changed into john hurt he still bore a slight resemblance to eight, just throwing that out there      I see a beautiful kissable ass but no tatoo   uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah, that's gross  	49

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) is designed to protect you from any discrimination or ageism down the road. Unfortunately, the ADEA doesnt offer the same protection for those under 40, but Michelle Cash at Experience explains that you should still check in with your states laws. Some states have similar laws in place for people of all ages.  Keep an eye out for questions that can reveal your age indirectly too. They might ask how long have you been working? or when did you graduate high school? These questions might seem like harmless inquiries, but they are designed to figure out your age. In the same vein, they cant ask when you plan to retire. Its just another roundabout way of determining how old you might be and how many years they might get out of you.  **Have You Ever Been Arrested?**  If youre interviewing for a sensitive position where criminal history can be used to determine your trustworthiness, employers are allowed to ask if youve ever been convicted of a crime. What they cant ask, however, is if youve ever been arrested in general. That being said, Peter Studner, author of Super Job Search IV: The Complete Manual for Job Seekers and Career Changers, suggests it might be information worth volunteering in some circumstances. Especially if know theyll doing a thorough background check:  In these kinds of cases where a future employer might uncover prior arrests, it is important to discuss the incident up front and point out that it was a thing of the past, never to be repeated. The more serious the offense, the more convincing you have to be. So while its illegal for them to ask if youve been arrested, you might still have an opportunity to demonstrate integrity and show that you can learn from your mistakes. It all depends on the situation, so make sure youre prepared beforehand.  **How Is Your Health?**  Questions relating to your general health and physical ability can be a very tricky subject. Its illegal for employers to ask you if youre in good health, how tall you are, how much you weigh, if youve had any past illness or operations, or how many sick days you took at your last job. However, employers are allowed to ask you about specific physical abilities related to tasks youd be required to perform. For example, they can ask if youre capable of lifting up to 50 pounds, if you can stand on your feet for certain lengths of time, or if you are capable of reaching items on a shelf thats so-and-so feet tall.  Its also illegal for them to directly ask if you have any disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifically states that employers cant ask you about the existence, nature, or severity of any pre-existing disability. They may ask if you can perform the basic functions of the position without accommodation, however, so in most instances, its to everyones benefit to be honest. It never hurts to ask questions yourself and see what they expect from you.  **Are You Married?**  This is one of the most loaded questions you can be asked, so it makes sense why its illegal. Answering a question like this can disclose a lot more information than you realize, and that information can easily be used to discriminate. Hannah Keyser at Mental Floss explains how sneaky this question can be:  Anything that fishes for information about a candidates family plans (marriage, engagement, and child planning) is technically illegal because it falls under pregnancy discrimination. It can often seem like a hiring manager is just making pleasant conversation and trying to get to know you better, but job applicants are not obligated to disclose any personal information. This could also be a subtle way to question someone about their sexual orientationanother protected class. If you do choose to talk about the kids you haveor plan on havingdo so at your own risk, and watch out for more digging for information. Questions like who will take care of your children while youre at work? or could you get a babysitter on short notice? are illegal. Remember, anything regarding your personal relationships, marital status, family, or sexual orientation are all protected.  **What Is Your Religion?**  This question is a major no-no, but employers will ask it to try and determine work scheduling for weekends and holidays. HR attorney Charles A. Krugel suggests, however, that Employers may try to skirt the issue by using simple tricks to get the information a different way. They might show you a required work schedule and ask if you can work with their schedule, or flat out ask you what days you are available or unavailable to work.  Neither of those questions are illegal and could potentially reveal that information whether you tell them or not. Still, the religion you practice, the holidays you observe, and anything related to those things are personal information you never have to disclose yourself. This also includes if you are a member of any general organizations that arent related to job or company youre interviewing for.  **What Is Your Nationality?**  An employer has every right to check that you can legally work for them, but they cant ask any questions regarding your race or place of birth. Employers are not allowed to ask if you are a U.S. citizen, but they can ask if youre authorized to work in the U.S. Anything in the realm of what country are you from? or what country are you from originally? is illegal.  Employers arent allowed to ask you what your native tongue is, or if English is your first language, either. The editors at HR World explain that employers may ask this question with good intentions to learn about your fluency, but it can still be offensive or used to discriminate. What they may ask instead, is what languages you red, speak, or write fluently, which is completely legal.  **Do You Like to Drink Socially?**  Some employers like to ask questions that may pertain to how well you might fit in with the companys culture. This can lead to personal questions about hobbies, likes, dislikes, and even if you like to drink socially. It might seem harmless, but as Vivian Giang at Business Insider points out, its actually illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):  For example, if youre a recovering alcoholic, treatment of alcoholism is protected under this act and you dont have to disclose any disability information before landing an official job offer. Whether youre a recovering alcoholic or not, they arent supposed to ask. And if you choose to answer and say no, they cant discriminate against you. Any questions regarding whether you drink or even smoke cigarettes are off limits.  **Have You Ever Used Drugs In the Past?**  This is another example of a loaded question that can mean a lot of things. First off, drugs can mean anything from illegal narcotics to prescription drugs, so its not clear to begin with. Secondly, ADA Policy Director Chris Kuczynski explains that an employer cant ask about your past use unless it was perhaps tied into a crime you were convicted of (forcing you to mention it). And even then, its a sketchy subject to bring up without a good reason.  What they can ask you is if you are using any illegal drugs currently. You may even have to take a drug test at some point, so if you are, it may not matter how you answer this question. Just remember, your past is not information you usually have to disclose unless youre interviewing for a government job or a job that requires some kind of thorough background check.  **How to React to Illegal Questions and Discrimination**  If you do encounter illegal questions like these it can be a bit awkward. If the question doesnt seem to have any malicious intent, Michelle Cash at Experience suggests you try to determine what information theyre really after:  For example, if an interviewer asks if you have children, you may deduce that she wants to know if youd be missing work often to care for them. You might simply answer that you have no problem meeting the positions attendance requirements. They may just not be very good at interviews, or maybe theyre new to it entirely. Try to give them what they want without giving up the information you know is yours to keep.  If it does feel like they are being discriminatory, however, or if you think you were denied a job because you refused to answer an illegal question, check with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. There you can file a charge of employment discrimination and learn more about the laws that protect you while you continue your job search. Dont let your interviews turn into a horror story if you can help it, and always go in prepared and knowing your rights.

 When I finished Brave New World, I had to stop reading for a month. I was 16 at the time and it was the most impressed and ethically challenged that I had felt with any book. Trying to read other books after that experience was a little unfair so I just had to stop for a while.   "One bird said to Billy Pilgrim, 'Poo-tee-weet?'"   This has made my day.   I wish "Bad Motherfucker" was written on his lightsaber.    The library near where I live received a donation of about 10 dark horse star wars omnibuses, when I was in high school. I still get them out and read them a couple of times a year.    	5

 You are correct in that it's not English... I think it's Swedish.    I wish I didn't listen to the recording. I don't know what nar could be, but mummel is a word to describe quiet, low-level speaking. There's gotta be a meaning behind the name narmummel...   #IDARB is an indie game on Xbox One :)   Seriously...   Vagina.   Button up and dress pants with slip on shoes.

I was actually planning on that next week lol   We were statistically the worst tackling team in 2014. That's not good.   Shit, forgot about him.   I really, really like this idea. I used to write stupid little short stories when I was about 13-16 and I just kinda stopped. Looks like I found my restarting point!   They were traded to the Raiders and forgot. I was pretty excited to see them in black and silver too.   Present, past, or both?   I could've added him to the exception list, but for what he was, it was sub-par.

 shady shade      I'd rather see him do a harder role sincd he's such a great fucking actor. BC for Riddler.   WTF right?   That's some day after tomorrow shit.   Yeah but on the show on Wednesday they said they were doing a show on Friday from CC San Diego which is where I am.   Anybody know where the Comic Con stuff is gonna be going on? I'm here and wanted to check it out.   Jinkx looks gor gor.   thanks for actually depressing me   You have brought me great joy.    Omg Luna looks adorable!!!   Please write something. You are a great writer.    He's still a genius.   Are you trolling?   That is the question. So... I don't know what it is but when I go on NoFap streaks, around the second or third week (at least this has been true the 2 times I've made it this far), I find myself having women very attracted to me. It's weird, when I fap, I can't get shit, and right now, I have several women who are very into me. The only thing I'm afraid of is that if I have sex and ejaculate I'm going to lose this thing that's so attractive... My mojo per se. If it were with a single partner I might not be as afraid, but it's several women that want to meet me and I want to fool around with all of them (not all at once, but like, screw one in the early evening and one later that night), I'm just afraid I won't have the mojo I have right now after I have sex. Thoughts? Advice?   I just brought a sausage egg mcmuffin home. which side am i on?   Damn... she's sadistic.    This is awesome.    LMAO   Best part by far.    Nice.   That's definitely not a cake.   5 more to go.    Thanks! And yes, I laughed really hard at your comment.    You're not going to hell if you bang a broad before marriage. Hell, there is no hell.    I feel like he needs the grapple hook.    Yeah, I'm in enlighten.    Probably the best comment that will take place in this thread. Yet so few will fail to recognize.    I cringed more that you've never cringed so hard.    This photo gave me extreme joy.    She's trolling.   Where's that video of the indian guy who has like a huge as cricket and cockaroach living in his ear? Having them taken out was so satisfying... I felt so good for him.    That's incest.   I thought he was a tool but now he's a total douche.    Poor cow :(   I like.    I assumed a real foot.    Yeah... like they're going to do that.    Lucky as fuck   That's really sad. I used to be very pro-choice.. And I still am pro-choicem just not nearly as much... I don't go around saying yes, go abortion, because I think it's so sad. I remember a debate I saw once where somebody said, if abortion is murder, masterbation is genocide, but then somebody rebuttled with, the difference between the sperm in a sock and a fertilized egg, is that the sperm will never grow up to be a person like you or I. And that really got to me... I hate abortion... I wish the government would pay people not to have them or something.          Did I just see Elizabeth's period?    I think somebody thought Problem Child was a documentary.    What is it? A Douche?   I declare war on Japan.    is that shit true about the 10 weeks and the fully formed feet n shit?    How could he not know?      So here's my dilemma. I'm about 10 days into my current nofap streak, and I feel amazing. I really think this not ejaculating business really helps keep me sharp. I've been feeling amazing. But one of my biggest motivators to do nofap is because when I am fapping I never get laid... But now, tonight, I have 3 different girls who are literally asking me to come have sex with them within the next 24 hours. I would give these girls 7+ (almost 8s)... But it's more than I ever get.... But... I... I just don't want to. But I do. But I don't. But I do. But I don't.... I told one of them already, I'm more interested in a relationship than a hook up, so I'm very confused. I think I'd rather not have the sex. But yeah... I don't really know how to say that. That I want to date and not hook up.... It's weird / hard....   On a somewhat related note, I saw a music video tonight of a girl that was so gorgeous, like a 9.9/10 physically, and it made me want to fap so fucking bad but I didn't because I know it would take me further from my goal of being with a girl like that, and it made me feel almost hopeless. Currently, I hate my body so much. I'm about 20 pounds overweight. I used to be about 70 pounds overweight, but i've been working at this diet shit so long that it just kind of hurts. I want to be stunning. I want to look like those guys on the cover of magazines. It's just... It's mother fucking hard, and I'm super fucking jealous of those guys who are there and I don't know when I'll be there. I love shitty foods so much, that I need a pleasure release somewhere. It used to be weed, then sleeping, then masterbation, now food. It's hard to change your diet completely because even if I'm eating healthy, I want to eat a lot of what I'm eating. Like i'll have 3 fucking pineapples, not just half of one... Or the whole box of whole wheat pasta, not just a single serving... Anyway... What do you guys think of hard mode vs. easy mode? I feel like easy mode doesn't give you half the benefits... In fact, I know it won't... I'm not gonna have sex with any of these girls.  Thoughts? Advice? Help?    Wasn't this ad post Arrested? Or did he do another? I really thought I knew that was Buster when I saw those ads and felt sad Arrested was dead :(   Ellen Page was amazing in The Last of Us.    Sell this. I would buy.    Pizza and fries.    To me it's different. It's a different way of life, not a goal.    Come on man. Don't stress what could have been. What do they say about falling off the horse? You'll get there. Stop whining, start winning.    one of the best posts i've read on here. had some total withness today. withness is the shit. (can i get a witness?... teehee. i'm lame.)   This is one of the best games ever. EVER.    Speed Racer is a masterpiece.    wOw   WOOHOO!!!!!!!!!   Nice mang!   Those books make absolutely no sense. Portions do. But overall nah.    can we see before n after plastic pics of sharon please   I LOVE EPIPHANY. GORGEOUS.    I'm pretty sure that was Trey Parker singing.    Mind = Blown.    I found this amazing.    I cringed. COME OUT OF THE CLOSET.    "You have an ugly heart." GOLD.    How old ya be?   His name.... was John.    go to some conspiracy subreddit. that wasn't funny.    Can't wait to be king of trolls.       I kind of felt this way about the last of us... i was like... seriously... this much circle jerk over thaaaat? i on the other hand adored bioshock infinite.    Literally what I was going to ask.    Hey guys! Fellow Fapstronaut here. I wanted to make you guys aware of a 100% NoFapping forum (I know of other forums with NoFap threads, but not a forum dedicated strictly to NoFap). It's not my site and I don't know any of the owners or anything so I'm not trying to pimp out my own site or anything. The reason I'm telling you guys about it is because after having been here on this subreddit for almost 5 months, I feel like this is a great tool and resource but it lacks a community and user familiarity aspect which a forum can bring. I joined last night and was hoping some of you awesome fapstronauts could come join so we can get some good discussions going and get to know each other so we can push each other and help each other really achieve our NoFap goals. I'm user Water2Funk, so feel free to message me and stuff. I really hope some of you guys join because, as great as this place is, the forum will really help us get to know each other and help us support each other with this journey and struggle. God speed Fapstronauts!   link to forum: http://www.nofappers.org/forums/forum.php  edit: there's also yourbrainrebalanced.com which somebody just messaged me about... but why not join both...? the nice thing about nofappers is there is an off topic forum too. :)    i was with you until the cold showers.....    LOVE IT.    FUCK THIS.    I was disappointed. Definitely wanted to see one of them explode.    SO COOL! I WANT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS MOMMY!   Let me tell you once again who was bad. Him.    PLEASE GOD JESUS   That was terribly awkward.    eh... cheer leaders.    When will Pokemon look good? Saphire / Ruby was kinda nice... The DS games are so ugly. Decide 3d or 2d..... Not both. So ugly.    I'm thinking of back in the SNES days when you could play Donkey Kong Country against a friend by seeing who could beat the game first. First you would play the level, then your friend would have different colored clothing and play the same level. I know New Super Mario Bros. allows you all to play on one team, but I don't really enjoy it. Thanks for the input.    Bioshock Infinite rapes The Last of Us... Sorry, but The Last of Us is nothing compared to BI. BI WAS INCREDIBLEEEEE.    That's Hoggle.    You need to be in a 1990's Tim Burton movie ASAP.   That was one of the first comics to ever make me laugh out loud. "He ate my dreams!"   Also, is he a dwarf?   K....   Jiffy! 02:16-02:19  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Hzrbbga8c feature=youtu.be t=1m45s     Hit those notes girl.    That was like the acting in every other porno ever.    That was the gayest walk I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty gay walks.    This gif has made my day.    Jiffy! 02:16-02:19   I downvoted cause I found what he was talking about actually interesting.    Hehe.... Filthy Assholes.   How can you hide even a small dildo under a bible?   I thought you were going to say Veggie Tales.    U just have bad taste.   Whatever Sharon did... She looks a lot more... Masculine... And stuff..... Before she was kinda ugly... Now she's definitely attractive.... Don't hate me but I can see Sharon leaving Alaska..... UGH WHY AM I SAYING THIS I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON. I BELIEVE IN LOVE!!!! But seriously.... Sharon looks WAY different.    So... What was that secret drink? Also, this shit about only having abs after starving yourself and such has to be BS right?    You are high.    This actually made me laugh a little.    I love Ru... But.... WTF.    having seen this several times.... i still love it.... i always wish it was longer. i love the little fetus calling daddy kfed.    Damn 602 days. What's your secret?   i'm 23. and yeah. ledger's performance will go down in history as one of the greatest performances of all time.    dark knight's a classic. timeless   douche   NO I AM SOOO STOKEDDDD   helll yes, spider-man! you rock!   let's dooo it. add me on skype or something so we can keep each other motivated.    I'm gonna do it. My longest streak was 35 days. On easy-hard mode (hooked up and had sex without ejaculating).... I'm ready for this shittt.    Maybe. Oh is an Asian last name I've heard before.

 This comment will probably get lost in here but I wanted to tell you that your stories are AMAZING! I'm fairly new to Reddit and happened to stumble upon this thread. I've read others stories here in NoSleep that've been good but none of them compare to yours, none of them have made me feel like yours. I just read them and I'm fascinated as to the way the made me feel. I hope the Penpal movie does come out soon and that you post more stories. You have a new fan.    Waiting for an update!   Finally! I check everyday for an update.    I've been voting 3rd party, even when people tell me I'm wasting my vote, I tell them that people need to stop voting for the lesser of two evils. We have to vote smart. Vote for a candidate that talks the talk, study the person. Look up on the issues that he/she has voted for and who backs them up. Please stop voting by parties, race or gender. Make history in a good and correct way!    Update please  	5
 Thanks for adding that! I can see how my title could be misconstrued.               Before clicking, I thought this was going to be one of those "that's terrible but kinda funny" posts but this is actually heart-wrenching. You have to feel for Vin Diesel.         That's one fiiiiiiiiiiine piece of [forced perspective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective)   For a laugh, go to the video section and watch the spokesperson try to talk up the machine while on it -- you can barely understand him because his voice is shaking in and out.  I'd wager this might impart small boosts to bone density, but as far as increasing aerobic capacity or losing weight, the effects will most likely be negligible.   Source: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/whole-body-vibration/AN01598   I want one!      Found a terrific study in PubMed:  **Lifetime exercise and disk degeneration: an MRI study of monozygotic twins.**  Study: "...the effects of power sports were investigated in 12 discordant [twin] pairs (2,300 vs 200 h of weightlifting). The age range of the twins was from 35 to 69 yr.  Finding: Increased power sport participation was associated with slightly greater disk degeneration in the lower thoracic spine, but not in the lumbar spine.  Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9346167         This press release is terribly written.  Something to remember: Not all fat is created equal. Visceral fat, which coats internal organs in the abdominal cavity, is far more dangerous than subcutaneous fat, which is stored just underneath the skin. It doesn't look like the study made any effort to differentiate the two.  Addition: Yowzers. Nobody seems to like this comment. Here's information to back up what I'm saying. From the Harvard Medical School:  "Abdominal, or visceral, fat is of particular concern because its a key player in a variety of health problems  much more so than subcutaneous fat, the kind you can grasp with your hand. Visceral fat, on the other hand, lies out of reach, deep within the abdominal cavity, where it pads the spaces between our abdominal organs."

(Browser = Firefox)  Update: Looks like somebody else did. Thanks!         My girlfriend lost about twenty hair ties to my roommate's orange tabby.       TL;DR  http://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2013/10/16/why_do_we_elect_attractive_politicians_106724.html   Exactly. We've always known that muscles atrophy after disuse -- muscle is physiologically expensive for the body to maintain. What's incredible is how fast the body does away with them.   Precisely. I don't think people have to worry about wasting away from just days off at the gym.   Here's an interesting new study:  "Substantial skeletal muscle loss occurs during only 5 days of disuse." http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168489  What did the researchers do?  "Twenty-four healthy, young (231 y) males were subjected to either 5 (n=12) or 14 (n=12) days of one-legged knee immobilization using a full leg cast."  What did they find?  "Quadriceps muscle CSA declined from baseline by 3.50.5 (P0.0001) and 8.42.8% (P0.0001), leg lean mass was reduced by 1.40.7 (P=0.07) and 3.10.7% (P0.01), and strength decreased by 9.02.3 (P0.0001) and 22.92.6% (P0.0001) following 5 and 14 days of immobilization, respectively."  The takeaway: It's amazing how fast muscles atrophy after only five days of total disuse!            58% approval is nothing to scoff at, though. Polls never reached anywhere near that in the 60s, as far as I know.            RealClearScience actually interviewed the author of the paper. (Link: http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/10/40-years-of-government-nutrition-data-may-be-flawed.html)  Here's what he said about the Coca-Cola funding: "Archer explained that it's an unrestricted research grant. In other words, the soft drink maker contractually has no input or say in what he researches or publishes."  I actually think that Coca-Cola wouldn't like the findings of the paper, because it's actually saying that people eat MORE calories than they think. Hmm now I wonder where those calories come from... soda maybe?       For all those people eating paleo diets thinking to themselves that calories in vs. calories out doesn't matter, this study reported that obese people UNDERESTIMATED their intake by about 800 calories a day. So the largest individuals in society are actually eating a lot more. Thus -- if true -- the results of this study seem to further reinforce the USDA's general stance on obesity, that we just need to eat less and exercise more.  Study is here, btw: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0076632   Glitch Gaming, an organization at the University of Minnesota, did this at the local BWWs on campus for the LCS Championship.

 You are not insane. Get out. Now. I know several people who went through this and it never ends well.   This is probably rude, but that's actually so bad I'm impressed. You've got every right to be upset. Remember, narcissists specialize in blaming YOU.  I agree with /u/blizaardvark's advice.   Not all therapists are helpful, unfortunately. A lot of them stay in business because N-parents being their kids in then praise them for "helping" when all they do is try to validate the narcissism.  This is stereotypical, but I have found every religious therapist I went to like this. Not a ton of data, but enough for me to avoid them like the plague.   My mother gifted my father a new vacuum, and a new smoke alarm. He gifted her a new set of golf clubs for himself later that year.  Im sitting here like wtf.  I was 8 or 9.  	4
 I'm up for it.   The concept of plane blowing that is.   It's a great concept, however i heard that Valve's policy is highly against such maps due to 911 stuff. I would love to see this idea realized.   READ: Before you go and say this is the wrong sub-reddit - I am not asking about mapping questions, i am asking about CS:GO maps in general. The user database here is larger, thus i can get more feedback on my projects. This IS related to CS:GO. ----  Hello! I'm a relatively new map maker. You might remember me from my crappy little teasers such as.. de_russka port, de_oasis, de_nuke remake and so on back and forth. I come down to be very nit-picky and specific when it comes to how players accept new maps and how maps accept new players, and i find it important for the experience to be enjoyable. Here's a few questions to all of you dear CS:GO pros/players/noobs.  1. When players talk about "new" maps, they wan't to see something "new". If so, could you point out specifically what new mechanics/dynamics would you like to see in maps besides boost spots, mid control ETC? Maybe buttons to turn off lights? Anything.  2. Do you find new maps less attractive gameplay wise than the old 1.6/Source maps? Do you think the map should stand a test of time to become acceptable?  3. What feature do you think makes the new CS:GO maps different from 1.6/Source maps gameplay wise?  4. What does CS:GO maps lack gameplay wise in comparison to 1.6/Source?  5. Do you think that mid makes the map more acceptable to new players, or not?  6. What do you think would make a new maps different from each other more?  I will be very thankful for any feedback, i do not necessarily need the answers to ALL of these questions, but i would like some/any feedback to collect data and make new maps more enjoyable. Thank you!    Your neighbors sitting under your desk using a wireless keyboard :P   Do you have in any-case installed Teamviewer? Teamviewer allows to control computer remotely. Also, i would suggest to possibly use VPN. (I'm not tech-savvy too so don't blame me D:)   With some rough chin.   In 1.6 you were able to kill someone with HE grenade through thin walls/doors (R.I.P de_dust2 wooden doors), i think having explosion properties through certain materials would be pretty nice.   That means don't buy anything at all. That's the only way to ECO. If you are spending money, that is not economical. Especially on later rounds when enemies buy kevlar/armor, SMG's become practically useless.   On Source, if you kill someone you die the next round. I wonder how it would fit into CS:GO scene.   There are several clip textures, the basic "clip" for everything, "player clip" so that grenades and stuff can pass but the player can't and the "prop clip" is the one that does not allow props / grenades to pass. Sorry for misleading a bit! :P  Good luck.   I guess the weirdest way would be to add prop clipping brush at water level, so grenades bounce off water? :P   Did i say anything about useful appliance in matchmaking? Nope. For fun.   Fixed. :P   In my language Guma - Bubble gum, apparently in Polish it also means condom.   Great findings! I hope this is true.   When i saw the demo and looked at some frags they looked pretty weird, but that's just because the demo is glitchy, thus why i wrote "I was unsure". I never said he was walling or anything like that, the phrase "Overwatch pls" is just a joke about silly players reporting for skillful shots.    Cause he's got swag.   So i checked it out, pretty interesting. It seems like you had a good layout and theme idea, but still lack a few elements. As good as it looks at the moment, it lacks visibility, which is a very important aspect in CS:GO. Here's a few things you could do - Slightly turn up light_environment brightness. (For non-mappers - visual brightness) Add lamps/lights at entrances to highlight important parts of the map. Valve used this lighting method to lead players where they have to go in Half-Life 2. Add tarps and planks to cover ground-level elements, such as crates barrels ETC.  A little minor thing... Increase the texture size on skybox displacements... It looks very repetitive.  Other than that i found no problems, seems like a potential map!   Let's add building size tarps so we can see enemies clear! :P   On CSS de_nuke you were able to shoot fire extinguishers. After bomb exploded there was alarm too.   Please, don't. Don't monetize it. Unless the money goes to Volvo 128 tick server hosting i doubt anyone is going to pay for it. I'll leave this here: aim_training_csgo (Workshop map) nuke_silojump (Workshop map) And there's plenty more! This is not a way to start a discussion.    Yes, it is totally possible! I would love to see something like that being utilized in competitive scene.  I will try whipping up a map.   This, is what still drives 1.6 without tournaments. Amazing way to relief yourself from matchmaking.   These commands aren't new, however, backdoors in CS:GO are new.    Well, that's new. Kind of reminds me of 1.6 viruses through MOTD.   Well that's a good comeback, no problem. And i do have a lot of free time.    And what makes you think I'm 13 years old? (By the way, spaces) I didn't post either my photos or age, so your argument is invalid.   Valve did a wrong move by making floor impossible to wallbang on A, so that's going away...   Your comment makes no sense.   Heat may not be very competitive suited, but it looks fuc**** amazing!    You didn't even bother putting the L at the end. I guess that shows how much brain effort you put into discussions.   I will extend it.   Go back to 1.6, troll.    Pay a bit attention to the floor. The screenshot has bad angle i guess, but simplicity is not a bad thing in Counter Strike.   It's a normal reaction and i fully understand you, CS scene needs some new competitive maps. This is not the only project on my list, so don't worry, good stuff is comming! :)   Unoriginal top comment wannabe No2. It was a funny joke, but you're not even trying.   Unoriginal top comment wannabe No1   You must be fun at parties.   Russka was scraped, as i was unable to go well with Brutes "fans". Torn was delayed to future, as i still have no idea what layout direction i should go for. Oasis is on its way, its nearly finished i just have to give clipping, quality and bug pass. I'm glad someones interested though, thanks for asking.      Yeah. :(         Guys name is HipScripts. Yeaaa.. Right... I still don't get it.   Gonna be that asshat. Rank-up depends how well you have done during the match. Surrendering allows you to end the game faster without hurting your K/D, but it counts as a loss. If you surrender 2-3 times it's a derank anyways.  Source : Experience.   I'ts not easy to make a layout, but it's pretty basic from the ground up. Don't do the same mistake as i do, start detailing and then shifting the layout.  Take some paper and pencils and start drawing your layout, try to see where choke points meet. Check out Valves Clover-Loaf layout, it's basically how Dust2 works. In hammer try to see the rotation, bombsite times.  Good luck, don't go for an easy grab.   Not that hard, I'd use mirage textures and mainly rely on brush-work. I've seen one mapper do that style, good idea.   xXxDoritosxXx :D   To be serious, i eat before or after the match. Having my stomatch work at the same time while i'm in intense situations can feel uneasy. I just have some water and prefferably chewing gum.   Think about what market means, is it urban market? Or is it country-side market?  I usually love to take references from real life, especially locations which you often visit. It makes it a lot easier to convey realism and achieve a good style!  I suggest you trying to do Iran based market place, of course there is a lot of dusty maps! But if you properly worked out as it was in BF3 you would get a stunning looking map.   Cubemaps in Source engine are not parallax corrected, which means that when you move they will move along you since they have no stationary information stored. In this VRAY demonstration it seems like either the reflections are parallax corrected or he is using different rendering methods. Either way, take a look at this video to see what i mean - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH6s1hbwoQQ   You must be pretty out of place for this game then.   It looks more swag. Especially before that flashbang kill.   Can you tell us how you found this model/screenshot, if it existed in beta? P.S - Does it have animations?   Not all Russians are bad, but oh god would this help so much. Especially when you get the retard ones.   That could be the case, i was sure i was far away from the wall tho! :P  One thing i could tell is that they all had min; 1 VAC bans on their accounts, and less than 60 hours on CS:GO. (They were from Russia too) Isn't that suspicious?   I actually tried stutter-stepping/fake peeking when one of them had AWP, i heard him miss the shot even though i didn't peek at all, that was a dead giveaway. Thanks for letting me know.   We did reported them, now I'm hoping for the best. I just wish there was an live Overwatch, where players who have free time can check an on-going match and when at least 2-3 overwatchers verdict the same thing after the match it applies an instant ban. I guess it would work like spectating.   Does that benefit in any way?      This is the same bug as in De_Dust2, apparently it's not as common (Garage Bug). I think it happens because of how the Source engine works, the player spawns at 0,0,0 coordinates and gets assigned to a team and spawn, if you disconnect and join at unfortunate time i guess the spawn information is missing and you get a small chance of spawning at T spawn, as if you were assigned to Terrorist team.  Don't ask me i don't know, I'm just guessing.   wat   That's correct, for casual it's fun. At least they are free, that's what's good about them.    Overgrown is pretty good.   I'm not to sound like a hater, but what happened? Remember when we got these quality maps on Operations like Cache, Seaside? It seems like more and more map makers are focused on getting their maps on operation rather than gaining map longevity by making them more competitively viable? For example, Black Gold - It would make a good map, but i tried playing it and even after 10 matches I'm still unable to navigate no matter what, all those pipes and railings, huge vertical changes made it impossible to play it competitively for me. Any time i peek a spot i always get shot from somewhere i didn't expect, just cause a player was able to climb up on a railing where it shouldn't have been, or was able to see my feet below the pipes. Also, did i mention a single problem that all the new maps have? Z-Fighting, almost anywhere on a map i can find two props inside each-other causing weird glitches and lag. There is a ton of maps to choose from that could have made it to operation - Tuscan, Crown, Sparity ETC... Let's just hope they delayed the maps for a better operation. There are some good maps in the operation too, but we could have gotten a lot more.  Anyways, i wish map makers will take consideration into this, and firstly sort out map layout and then focus on details. I can recommend good communities to get feedback on layout and get the map tested on servers, such as Mapcore.  (P.S - I know the maps are free to play, that doesn't mean they are supposed to be designed for casual only play)   Whiskey is my backup plan after a match if i get rekt.   Operation Insight - Introducing the new Inferno collection, choose from 20 new scopes for your AUG/SG.  Added ability to have StatTrack modules on your scope!   Take breaks between matches, always have some water near when playing. (Helps me a lot after intense round.)   - Haha, you have Howl for m4a4. Better save your money for that one. - Ali? I didn't find the same experiences on Ali as on Cache, as you can see Cache is so good it stood the time test and became official. - Few good maps, please, but ten? :/ - I felt like Crown was too spacious, i don't know what others think. It's a lovely map though. Tuscan would have been a better option.    I just love how badass Mp5 looks, i would feel like spec-ops troop with that gun.  	70

But if a man bites a dog, that is news."   --  Alfred Harmsworth (18651922) a British newspaper magnate   If you are only married 6 years, I believe there *usually* is not alimony (depends on which state). If you were married 10+ years then absolutely.   If you have a child then absolutely to child support regardless of length of relationship (or even if you were married or not).

The purpose of the student loan is to provide future benefit (the fruits of the education). Since the ex-spouse will not be able to participate in the future benefit, both statues and court rulings state that, in general, student loans within a marriage are individual debts, not joint debts. There are exceptions, but that is the rule.  Example: If my wife puts me through medical school with $250,000 in student loans, then after 6 years of marriage I divorce her, she does NOT have to pay any of the loans since they will only benefit me - - via future income.   I feel a little guilty saying this, but in the grand scheme of things, the loss of our planet's cultural heritage, history, and sites such is this makes me at least as angry as the loss of life.  **Destruction of cultural heritege should be a war crime**.   If you watch it in reverse, it's a snail blowing a bubble.    THAT - that I have to try!   If you are married almost all debts are joint - regardless if the spouse co-signed.  Student loans are one of the few debts that aren't joint within a marriage.    Without my knowledge my wife (now Ex) took out $75k in student loans, then filed for divorce.  She honestly thought I would have to pay them.  She took out another $25K+ during the separation and tried to get me to pay that as well.  Oh yah . . . her "degree" is in Children's Literature. Good luck paying of that $100K loan!   It sure beats being "torn apart by ravenous dogs".  Death by missile would be quick and painless.   Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around Oct. 7, 2014.

If that were the case, you would commit a crime if:  I email you child porn as an attachment (the image would be on your PC)  I sneak onto your PC and download the file "train_subject5937 Child Porn" that contains illegal images.  In both cases, the illegal child porn is on your PC, but you have no intent and have not committed a crime - - but I would have.   The intent and the individual's actions are very different in the two cases.  1. If Googling "impact of child porn on society" resulted in images being cached, it would be hard to prove intent to download the illegal porn.  2. If in addition, you right click on the child porn and "save image as", then you have clear intent.    if you search for it and you see the image hosted on a website   The Google Search would be within your browser (not actually going to another website). Now, if the browser caches the images to your hard drive, and they remain there, that might be a gray area if a search of your PC was done and they were found. I think you could beat the charges since, by doing a Google search with your browser, you did not intend to, and did not actively download the pictures.   Source: I'm not a lawyer, but I play one on the Internets.     only if you find some  I don't think finding child porn would be illegal. DOWNLOADING it would be illegal.

I think there is a distinction between being a crime, and supporting criminal charges.  1. Clearly a search could be evidence in support of criminal charges (e.g. "how to dissolve a body with lye")  2. Under the Patriot Act, repeated searches on the President's travel plans, combined with searches to hire an assassin, etc. might be prosecutable.    Other than the Patriot Act or threats on the President, I have a hard time seeing when a search, or even a pattern of searches would be a crime.   U.S. News and the Internet site Beliefnet funded a poll to learn more about why, how, where and when people pray.

A little over 38% say that the most important purpose of prayer is intimacy with God.   41% say that their prayers are answered often.   1.5% say that their prayers are never answered.   Over 73% say when their prayers are not answered, the most important reason is because they did not fit Gods plan.   5% say that they pray most often in a house of worship.   79% say that they pray most often at home.   67% say that in the past six months, their prayers have related to continually giving thanks to God.

When catching the train everyday, I would spend $55 per week. Thats $110 against the $90 for fuel. So even with maintenance costs of my car, I'm still ahead per week to drive.

I hope you're happy Reddit.   I hope they keep him vegetarian haha  I want to see him munch on lettuce heads like they're grapes.   I was totally thinking this! I don't think I've heard him swear in the show before.   And the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch always gets the best wine and food. Jon Snow, you 1% bastard.   #occupywall   And because you start to morph into Rob Schneider.   Oh right. Well I mean you could just not sing the anthem I guess? I don't recall anyone getting detention or anything for not doing it.  We were not told that 'opting out' was an option    I wish those shows would put more emphasis on the most important part - diet.  But the show would be boring if you showed each person quietly eating a well portioned meal.  Showing the brutal exertions of exercise isn't going to help anyone.   Ahhh the ol' Taylor Swift conundrum.   Im getting confused are you talking about scouts? If so, I dont think so? It is a private club so they can make what ever rules they want.  You don't really get that many atheistic conscientious objecting 12 year olds, we'll just say the pledge so we can play with our friends.   Not saying 'scouts honour', I mean the mandate we recite. It's similar to the pledge of allegiance actually.  More specifically, the mandate ends with the generic "under god" thing too. As an atheistic teen, I didn't care enough about the words to bother omitted the god line lol   I literally did it when reading the title of this thread. I read it and thought "Do I do this?"  Without realising it, I'd just raised both of my eyebrows quizzically.   I'm wondering if the legends of Ice Dragons were exaggerated stories of reanimated dragons though. It's an interesting idea I think and fits how GRRM goes about writing 'when myth meets reality'.  Of course, the concept of 'ice dragon' could just be an allegory of Jon Snow (half Stark half Targ = Ice Dragon)   I've seen girls do the same thing though, I can't tell you what the intent is from everyone who calls you cute, but I wouldn't shrug it off instantly.   I mean, I get patriotism. For a public primary school in Australia, we had a weekly school assembly where we finished it by singing the national anthem, but that's hardly as intense as what the U.S does.  I was in the scouts for most of my childhood and none of us really cares what the scouts honour meant, we just recited it because we were told to.   Does anyone know if we're aware of any dragons dying north of the wall?  I know the concept of an ice dragon will probably show up in the series and I'm wondering if that means a specific species of dragon which thrives in the north or an undead dragon which is reanimated.  After this weeks episode, I'm starting to think that if the Others reanimated the old corpse of a dragon, it would be kind of awesome.     My clothes are really starting to look ridiculous on me. I still don't want to buy new ones just yet, I know that in a months time ill be down a size.   I get it, we do have to draw a line in the sand however and while that study I mentioned asked an interesting question about the ethics, the current setup is probably what's best.  I think making abortion illegal just ends up hurting society, just like all prohibition does.   Now that I'm in the latter half of my 20s, I'm start to appreciate the earlier start times for weekends. I used to sleep in past noon every saturday/sunday. But now sleeping in till 9-10am is plenty.  I've actually started adding a rule where I wont sleep past 10am on Sundays because otherwise I can't get to sleep before midnight Sunday night which fucks my sleep before work on Monday.    Hey guys,  As I said in the title [there is a thread on /r/AskMen about weight loss](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/383czs/gentlemen_of_reddit_who_used_to_be_overweight_and/) and I think it's a good idea for everyone to go post a personal story. We all know how hard it was logging that first calorie, so I hope we can inspire those who're stuck in a rut, health wise.  Thanks   Ok, so I'll preface this by saying - I'm by no means no longer overweight or no longer unfit. But for the first time in my life, I'm on my way there. Sorry for the wall of text.  So I've been a fatty fatty boombalatty for my entire adult life. Lots of cognitive dissonance and ignorance towards health caused my situation. At the start of this year, I was 285 lbs as a 5"10 27 yo male.  3 months ago I decided enough was enough. So I did something about it, I did my research and came to realise that **WEIGHT LOSS IS EASY**.  It's so simple, I was wondering why I ever convinced myself otherwise. **Calories in vs calories out**.  That's it. No fads, no pills and believe it or not; no exercise required. (definitely recommended though. Diet is for weight loss; exercise is for health).  I did my calculations, I saw what my daily calorie expenditure was and I started eating under that magic number every day. I quit drinking and started being a little bit more active. Wouldn't you know it, after 1 week of this I lose almost 4 pounds. Fucking magic right?  I think where most people fail is by seeing this as a *diet*. Diet implies a temporary change to allow you to go back to your original lifestyle - **this is why diets fail**. Your lifestyle needs to change **forever**.   Another fairly common assumption is that you can no longer enjoy the foods you currently enjoy and you have to eat nothing but 'healthy foods'. **This is total and complete bullshit**. My diet has not change all that much, I just eat less. Now saying all of that, you do want to add more balance to your diet. So definitely eat more fruit and vegetables - but don't think you need to have a dinner which consists of a plate of lettuce. That's just silly. You know what my favourite dinner is?  A nice juicy porter house steak with a side of pasta salad and salad/veges. For me that's around a 800-1000 calorie meal and christ is it tasty.  Once you get your food intake undercontroll, you'd be surprised at how this affects your life. A better diet means better sleep which means better energy, which actually makes you **want** to exercise. Crazy right?  As I said, it's been 3 months and I've lost 33 pounds. If I can do it, you can do it. Don't be like me and make excuses. You know what you're doing is unhealthy and you're never going to change unless you do the work.  Please also check out /r/fitness, /r/progresspics and /r/loseit. These subreddits are **fucking incredible**, who says the internet has to be a support-less and judgmental hellhole.  Edit: it looks like someone is auto downvoting people who're saying diet is more important than exercise. Some people like being in their ignorance bubbles.   Pretty good, a few weeks ago I decided to fully shave my head. It looks good, but I ended up shaving the beard off too. Bad move, I look like I'm a teenager. I'm growing my beard back now :)   How to make people laugh, seriously - I use this more than anything.   You say the pledge of allegiance **every morning** at school?  Do 6 year olds even understand what they're reciting and it's  implications?   Truth   See this depends on context. I (a man) will refer to hot girls as *cute*. It's just my go to word to indicate beauty.     Ill never forget how that conversation happened, it was kinda hilarious.  I'd just started doing it with my GF at the time, but I'd obviously never told my parents (why would I? It's personal). So after we had broken up, she called me up and told me that she was pregnant (turned out to be BS, she was crazy - another story for another day).  I freaked the fuck out, I was panicking. I couldn't be a dad, she wanted to me drop out of school and be the father and support her, blah blah it was a pregnancy trap, 17 year old me didn't know that though.  So I did the walk of shame to talk to my parents, I sat down with them and through my shame explained the situation. Not shame of having sex, my parents allowed for a healthy attitude towards young relationships, shame towards getting her knocked up.  Anyway, the conversation went like this:  "She's pregnant"  "Oh? Didn't you use protection?"  "Yeah we always used condoms but a few times they've broken"  My dad's retort:  *"How do you break a condom? Doesn't the smell of burning rubber indicate you should slow down?"*  Fucking hell dad, you can't help yourself. That bad joke made us all laugh and I calmed down immediately. I was able to deal with the situation thanks to the coolness of my parents. It turned a stressful situation into a great memory of my upbringing.  Edit: words   I'm more worried about your feet than your shoes haha  What a *callous* suggestion    One could argue that flip flops are the corner stone of the simple life haha  Nothing says "simple life" quite like walking around with no socks.   Crappy beat up shoes for yard work.  I'm the same, I wrote 'work boots' when in reality they're just a old pair of steel toe boots which I couldn't care less about destroying in the yard.   You don't own flip flops? But how do you show off your rock'n toes to the ladies.    When we combine the two factors, we have a net reduction of violence by 40%.  Yeah, I see where you're going with that. It's about a contribution as opposed to a single reason.  I'm curious to further read studies into that, mainly because I play and watch lots of violent games/movies and so do all of my friends and we all have the same attitude towards actual violence.  I guess the main point is about ones upbringing at the end of the day. My parents taught me to treat everyone as you would want to be treated and no amount of fictitious violence will ever reverse that.   I'm more on the practical side, I only own 1 pair of 1 type of shoe:  - Flip flops - Runners - Dress shoes - Casual attire shoes (skate shoes) - Slippers - Work boots   I'm wondering how many men actually buy shoes solely (pun intended) for practicality.  So how many pairs of shoes do you own? Do you have multiple of the same type? If so, why?  Edit: added clarification   I'm not going to try to sway you one way or the other, but a study was put together which caused some stir in the scientific community (can't find the source, sorry)  The experiment was to determine the moment of a newborn's life where they became self aware and conscious beings. Interestingly, they found that children up to 6 months after birth were found to be without self awareness and self consciousness. Here comes the controversial part:  They concluded that (ethically) aborting a 6 month old is no different than aborting 4 weeks into a pregnancy.  Kinda fucked up right?    PROHIBITION DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.   How haven't any countries figured this out yet?   The problem is that the second you make the distinction of 'pedophilia is a disease', then you would have to also think 'homosexuality is a disease'. How well has conversion therapy worked for them? Fucking horribly.  Study it all you want, but I don't think it's helpful to stigmatise people on something they can't control or probably don't want.   Also pedophilia =/= child molester.   It brings up the question - If you could get a test 4 weeks into a pregnancy which could determine if the child will be severely autistic, what would you do with that information if it returned positive?  It's a fucking hard question to answer, I couldn't even imagine what I would decide if it were non-hypothetical   If that were true, then wouldn't the rate of violent crimes be getting higher while the film/gaming industry is getting larger?  It's true that the rate of violent crimes in first world countries has been on the decline since the 80s   I do the same thing, but I **do** make sexual stories. It helps with immersion. Obviously this technique is about distracting your mind from thoughts of "GET TO SLEEP" and having sexy thoughts about who ever is a good way to do that. You would think this keeps you up at night, it surprisingly doesnt lol  Also, turn off all electrical devices in your room. Since I've started doing that, my fitbit tells me that I have nearly zero interruptions to my sleep. I feel so much better with 4 **solid and uninterrupted** hours of sleep over 10 hours of restless sleep.   Make a throw away called /u/START_ENJOYING_THINGS.   You need to get out of your own head man. You can't think of why someone would want to talk to you? Clearly that's not correct, or the girl wouldn't have said yes :)     [Sauce](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2cz2rx/do_you_prefer_sex_with_or_without_a_condor/)   They had no TV   I like that its a fresh snack which keeps for quite a long time and is very portable.    and .*   your*    roaring crowds  [Spoilers ADWD](/s "We all know what the noise of the roaring crowd is going to do in that episode :D")    Poor OP, you're reminding us all about that time someone asked reddit "Do you prefer sex with or without a condor".   It's name is false advertisement.   I'm 33 lbs down myself and I can totally see where you're coming from. Although I didn't 'hope it would go away', I was fully aware that *some day* ill  have to do something about my healthy.   But that *something* was always "next year" or "the year after". Excuses after excuses. It wasn't a good cycle to be stuck in.  Edit: Also, 1987 really was the best year to be born wasn't it ;P   Yesterday was 3 months since my first weigh in. I'm 33 lbs down and going strong.  All of my lifestyle changes are now in full affect and a part of my life. I had a house warming party on Saturday and I didn't even have the urge to drink. I was perfectly happy socialising with all of the drunk people and having a good time.  I also was far too excited for my liking about the apple I treated myself to last night lol    /thread   I'm sure you're a lovely person, who has a wealth of knowledge.  But I'm afraid you're wrong and you should be eliminated from the gene pool. Granny smith master race.  I just wish it had a more manly name, like Shotgun Ninja.   Edit: Looks like I forgot to add the **/s**, I thought it was implied.   I have literally zero drive to do so. I have a normal career drive, social drive and I most certainly have the drive to find a girl and settle down with her.  But I have no want, whatsoever to raise children. Not even my 2 year old niece has changed my opinion. I'm not going to point out the problems with children, that's done alot in this thread. Suffice to say that I would rather spend my days and nights with my friends and loved ones than to raise children.  I'm 27, so there may be time for my mind to change - I can't say for sure.   Beer and tequila till the early hours of the morning.  I just so happened to do this the night before the hottest day of the summer. So there I am, 12pm, zero minutes sleep. Sprawled in my boxers in a hotbox of a house, unable to move or do anything but writhe in agony. While my girlfriend is in the bed with me, horny as hell trying to proposition me, but I can't do it.  Not only was this the worst hangover I've ever had to this day. I also had my first experience with saying no to sex. That was an unpleasant afternoon.   I (and most of reddit) are there with you, the thing is that we **all** should experience this sense of existentialism. We need the perspective of our own mortality to be able to live our lives well.  Knowing what we know, being dead won't be a problem. What was 1902 like for you?  It's the dying part which will be hard I think, perhaps this fear will change once we get older. But I can't even fathom what being on a death bed must be like.  My larger point is - don't fear death, celebrate life and enjoy your short stay here to the best of your ability!   Alot of it is about matching intensity. What the other poster said is right. Go for a closed lipped kiss and work your way to the deeper kiss, its not about shoving your tongue in, its about syncronising a massage between both persons tongues.  I was terrified during my teens of doing it, but it just kind of 'happened' and it felt natural. Been told im quite the kisser by many :)   We still don't know for sure how or why Rome fell.  I was shocked to find that out, this massive empire which existed only 1500 years ago - and we don't know what happened to it. There are some big theories. Which vary from rebellion to pestilence, but historians can't seem to agree.  I mean, I read this a few years ago and haven't checked since - perhaps there is new evidence?   I'm totally addicted to bass.   The answer is garlic. Come on, how good is taking a big wiff of a jar of minced garlic when you stop by the fridge :)   I hope you're talking about the books, because that's truly the best redemption arc I've ever seen. By the end of ADWD, you just want to snuggle up with Jaime and watch Netflix. For context, I'm a straight male.   So had you have asked me 4 months ago "train_subject5967, how often do you eat fruit  or vegetables?" I wouldn't be able to answer. I just didn't do it, in fact, I always felt kind of ill when I would try.  That seems to have changed. I currently eat twice a day for lunch and dinner and that's normally enough for me. But sometimes if I've had a good workout or if I'm feeling a bit more hungry I would just munch down on an apple or perhaps some carrots in hummus. At first, this didn't really help all that much. But nowadays, I **love** me some fresh granny smith apples (its the best type of apple, don't argue).  It's like my own little desert if I've been a good boy. You know that feeling that we all have had, the feeling of pure delight when you're chowing down on a piece of food which tastes so good that you wish it were never ending? That feeling (for me at least), used to just be reserved for a fatty piece of steak or an ice cold beer.   Oh how the times have changed :)   I had that conversation recently actually, I mentioned that I was trying to lose weight and I got told "The only diet which works is a low carb one."  Tell that to the 34 pounds I've lost. I love my pasta salad and mash potatoes.   I cut out most of the beer.  It saddens me how much this makes a difference, I love my beer :(  Nice work though man, I bet you're going through belt buckles like it's going out of style :)   I have the same issues man, while the loose skin **will not** stop me from doing what I'm doing, I'm trying to actively prevent that situation from occuring.  There was an AMA last week done by an obesity doctor and I asked about loose skin. [This is what they](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/37l7tf/iama_board_certified_obesity_doctor_who_has/cro665m?context=3) had to say, there is apparently a procedure which can be done outside of surgery.   I hope you direct them towards this subreddit, could use some of that support to spill over :D   She just has to follow the 2 rules of dating for that to work:  1) Be attractive.  2) Don't be unattractive.   Legally required in Australia :)   Nice, that's amazing validation for your efforts. Ill just add - make sure you manage your expectations. You will lose weight most weeks, some weeks you'll lose nothing and other weeks it may **look** like you actually gained weight. You need to keep with it, you know it's working, keep at it!   From Australia - Animal Kingdom. Go fucking see it, it's one of the best gangster films. Plus, its based on a true story :)   My diet is currently 1800-2000 and I'm losing around 2lbs a week. 5'10 253lbs atm.  You'd be surprised how much someones BMR can be when they've let themselves go.   I like to ask people who say that why they think anyone would choose to be homosexual.  I would've thought the answer to that would be because "sin". It's fucked up      I think there are a couple of factors. Gilly has had a fucked up life and has dealt with rape that entire time, not saying it makes her immune to the threat, but there is probably some sort of conditioning. Also, she knows Sam. Knows him well. Tysha slept with Tyrion - a complete stranger. It's different.  I appreciate the parallel, but I don't think it's the same    A fucking frightening hitman   It sucks man, but you have to do it if you want to lose weight :(  I was in the same boat, I was drinking **so** much beer before I started losing. I've been sober for the past 3 months (minus 2 parties), the way I see it, I keep telling myself "You did this to yourself, you've had enough beer, it's time to let time catch up".  The reason why my friends can drink like they do is because they didn't have all those years of gluttony that I've had. I see it similar to spending years racking up massive credit card debts, it's time to start paying off that debt - sacrifices have to be made.    To give you context on how much I'm in the same boat as you, my stats are 27M/5'10/285220 haha  It's not a deal breaking for losing weight, but I'm curious as to if it's going to be a warzone when I take my shirt off at a normal weight.    Nice work man, I have nearly the same stats :)  Hows the loose skin situation?   I'm sorry, I know that was a joke, but I had to write that.   It's ok, we all need to hyper-vent sometimes.   There is no shame in slowing down exercise and focusing on your diet, in fact if you're experincing discomfort, that's exactly what I would do.   When I first started i was walking *everyday* and while it felt great, after a month I started to get pains in my shins because I was trying to ramp up my efforts. I dialed back the exercise to 3 days a week and I felt so much better. And guess what? My weight loss has stayed the same.   If you do want to keep going, try some lower impact exercises until you lose more weight and gain more muscle. Swiming, boxing, cycling, eliptical, etc. These will all help with your pain issues :)  Also fucking stretch before AND after lol   I wish I had done this when I first started, tracking weight is all well and good but it can be deceptive! A pair of calipers won't lie :)   Thanks for your response! I've never heard of that procedure before, it sounds promising, especially since I'm not sure I'm vein enough to surgically remove any excess skin :)   Hi Doctor,  I'm 3 months into my weight loss regime. I started as a 27 yo male, 5'11 285 pounds. I'm currently 32 pounds down after 11 weeks and I feel great. I do however have some concerns about loose skin, I'm most likely going to have quite a bit of it.  Are there any legitimate methods to reduce loose skin while I'm working towards a normal weight?  Edit: phrasing   I'm kinda the same, I only told my close friends. But that's mainly because they already knew. It was such a drastic change in lifestyle that they noticed.   "Its 1pm on a Saturday, why don't you have a beer in your hand train_subject5967? OMG, are you dying?"   #notallcunts   They've also never lost the Ashes! Good job Pakistan!   I have to say, Lena's *nailed* that smug half smile that Cersei would totally do in all her scenes last episode (Except for the last :D). When she was talking to the sparrow, that shit eating grin was so telling.   "We're all aware of the struggles with writing ADWD and the Meereenese Knot. Do you feel that TWOW has had a less obstructive progress by comparison?"   I'm so confused, what did you write? I must be an idiot, because I cant extrapolate context from those screenshots   But it does all the normal stuff, HR tracking, pedometer, etc   Hey guys,  I've had my FitBit Charge HR for 2 months now and it's great! My mum's birthday is coming up soon and she wants one just like it. The thing is that her main source of exercise is a swimming class she does several times a week, and the Charge HR is not water proof. Can you guys think of a good FitBit like device which is water proof?  Thanks.   I can juggle, I assume many don't know how to do that.  A few youtube videos and a boring afternoon and you can juggle just like me :)      I just don't want to share my "special" moment with another over-emotional infant.  I would recommend not serving alcohol then.  Source: I have loud drunk friends   That resolution... So hard to read the words :(   I bit my finger nailed my entire life until a few years ago, one day I had enough and just stopped. They look so much healthier now. Sadly due to the years of abuse, the nail is a little bit lower than it should be. Im actually kind of envious of guys with good hands now.  I also quit smoking almost 2 years ago, I'm one of those fuckers who can quit at the drop of a hate no problem though. This time its for good.  I also now brush twice a day and floss/rinse every day.     You have very similar starting stats to me, but I'm 27. So what I'm going to say will be more impacting for you than me.  **Start right now, not tomorrow, not in 2 months. NOW**.  I'm so fucking frustrated with myself for not dealing with this shit years ago, I feel like I wasted my 20s. I posted a quote the other day which sums up this sense of urgency  *"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now"*    You can burn 500 calories doing a lot of things  (   )    I think you'll find hes not being sarcastic and he means that he has 'never thought about it that way before' instead of 'never thought of this before'   Nice job man, hows the loose skin situation?   SHITS WEAK!   It's currently my second favourite sitcom at the moment, it's only **just** behind Silicon Valley in quality. I love that show, I introduced it to several of my mates and they all fell in love with it   At first it's indescribable. That mix of butterflies in the stomach and yearning is hard to replicate.  The only other thing that has done anything close to this, is ecstasy. I have done it a few times in my younger days and the most prolific sensation of that drug is the surges of euphoria and happiness. That feeling is what I've felt for a girl I love.   It's funny when you experience it, because I had fallen for a girl before my first experience with the drug and the second the drug kicked in, I was like "Oh god, I know this feeling... I had this on our 1 year anniversary night". Knowing that I get the same high from a girl that I get from a drug which is designed to release pleasurable hormones in your body is the ultimate  validation for your feelings.   Twerking is such a ridiculous fad, please stop.  Working out on the other hand... Yeah, do that ;)   ITT: Irony   The **correct** way to handle that situation was to suddenly stop making out, look down at your groin and in your best Peter Griffin voice yell ["Uh ohhhh!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44dTHoZk-QQ)   I was actually suprised to hear how inexpensive it is. Apparently a 2000 calorie per day weekly pack is $90 AUD. That's actually cheaper than what I currently pay for my weekly food budget.    I totally agree, my diet isn't a diet, it's a change of life style. All my dinners are home cooked, I'm playing the long game.   	120

Fingers crossed for a Steen intermission interview. He has no time for bullshit when hes in game mode.   STAG   "1) Are all American war dead heroic because, if nothing else, they had the courage to volunteer for service knowing they might ultimately give their life for their country? That seems heroic to me. But if they're all heroes, does it follow that everyone in the military is a hero? Why is dying necessary? And if everyone who volunteers is a hero, what about the guys who would go AWOL if sent to fight, or who assault their commanding officer, or who run away in combat? What about the ones who are dishonorably discharged? Was Bradley Manning a hero? Had Lynndie England died in Iraq, would she have been a hero?   2) What about people who volunteer for foreign armed forces? Are they all heroic? Or does it depend upon their country? If an American helping to liberate Libya would've been a hero had he died in action, shouldn't the Germans from NATO engaged in the same conflict be heroes too? What about the Islamic fundamentalists fighting alongside NATO? Heroes?    3) What about the morality of the cause? Does anyone think brave Nazi soldiers during the World War II era were heroes? How about the soldiers in Stalin's army? Does the nature of the mission matter, so that a Soviet soldier who died liberating a death camp was a hero, whereas another who died while ravaging German civilians he was ordered to take revenge upon isn't? There's this reality to confront: if bestowing the title hero has nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness of the cause or mission, we'll have to grant the honorific to individuals who took part in deeply immoral acts... and yet, if the mission does matter, do we really want to deny the heroism of a GI who jumped on a grenade to save his platoon, even if we think the platoon's presence in country X was immoral? It's a confounding choice.   4) Speaking of jumping on grenades, isn't "hero" often invoked in common parlance as if it means even more than serving and dying? For example, when we hear someone described as "a World War II hero," don't we expect that he did more than fall overboard and drown en route to the D-Day invasion? Don't we assume from that adjective that he undertook some dangerous mission, or distinguished himself in combat, like the younger Bailey brother in It's a Wonderful Life? Were the average American to watch From Here to Eternity, would he or she call Robert E. Lee Prewitt a hero?  5) And say, for the sake of argument, that all American war dead are heroes, strictly defined, but that the word and its emotional resonance is being manipulated by advocates of an imprudent war. Is it better to give soldiers an honorific they deserve, consequences be damned, or to withhold an honorific they deserve to prevent future soldiers from needlessly dying?"

 That's what it looked like to me.   [A former NYPD officer told a story along these lines at The Moth a few years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbhvjeTmF1Q)         This RadioLab podcast takes a look at how the US has treated foreign prisoners of war and the controversy caused by that treatment, especially in light of the treatment of US citizens in internment camps and the treatment of US prisoners of war by enemy powers.      Typical Ted.      Article has an interesting sampling of how easy it is to get sucked into the NYC Criminal Justice System/Machine.      Are you sure it wasn't Grant Wahl? /s                                                   Whenever police are reluctant about removing a seemingly abandoned car, my first thought is: "Bait car?" Probably not in this case.                           This sting has more to do with marketing related bribes and kickbacks involving CONCACAF officials and marketing companies, such as Traffic. Much of this seems to be connected to tv and radio rights for matches and tournaments, including the 2014 World Cup.  Since CONCACAF is headquartered in Miami, the US has jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the law enforcement authorities of different countries to work together. The fact that the Swiss authorities were willing to assist the US indicates just how fed up they are with FIFA in general.  As to why now - my understanding is that certain statutes of limitations were on the verge of expiring.  FIFA doesn't like governmental interference into its secret lairs. I've seen speculation that if Blatter wanted, he could suspend all of CONCACAF and take away the World Cup slots. Not sure how accurate this is, and not sure that FIFA would want to grab the bull by the horns like that.  I think DOJ's endgame is to root out corruption in CONCACAF and hold the sleazy folks that have been in charge accountable for their misdeeds.  What happened today isn't about the 2018   2022 World Cup bidding processes; however, the Swiss government has launched its own criminal proceedings into those matters.                                       Haven't seen any dead birds in my area yet, but during my run this morning I did see a dead cat that looked like it got caught in the flooding.      As noted by others, the US investigation concerns CONCACAF. [Meanwhile, the Swiss authorities have opened an investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup Bids.](http://news.yahoo.com/swiss-police-detain-soccer-officials-ahead-fifa-congress-053453976--spt.html)               Which is a reminder of why it's not a good idea to drive into high water, doesn't take much to make a car float.

The afternoon of September 11th and the day everyone left because of Hurricane Rita are the two weekdays I saw Downtown that dead.

Surprised that Charlie Leduff's Detroit: An American Autopsy was not on that list.   If I could predict the future like that, well, I'd be a rich man. Look, revisit the issue down the road, after the situation has settled down, after that asshole Putin is gone.   Well played, I applaud you.   East End area is on the rise.   In reality, the issue should be revisited down the road, after Putin is gone. But right now, doing this would be a spineless capitulation by UEFA to appease a thug and bully. But hey, the governing boards of FIFA, UEFA, CONCACAF, etc. do consist of a bunch of immoral bastards looking to line their own pockets.   Sadly, here in Texas the criminal justice system excels at criminalizing poverty.   The people who live in Crimea.   This happens all the time. Police and DA's office won't waste their time on you once you explain the situation.   Makes me miss The Axiom.   Well, they should of thought about that before jumping into bed with Putin.

If you have taken more than three consecutive sips of beer while standing, you've broken a law in Texas. When I was at Baylor a student got a ticket for farting.

This past December I drove up to Marshall for a wedding, hadn't driven up 59 through East Texas in almost 10 years, damn what a much improved drive that is now.   Now I'm hungry for tripe Pho, thankfully I live in Houston where Pho is a staple.   Grandpa was a sly fox.

I respect that he made an effort to help his fellow veterans who were suffering PTSD, something Congress (or the Texas legislature) seems to have no interest in doing.   The Interstate 69 signs here in Houston have seemed to last, wonder if they've found a way to make it harder to steal those signs.   This isn't just a problem in the realm of truancy, it is a problem for a lot of low income people who get cited for various minor "quality of life" misdemeanors - loitering, public intoxication, being in a park after it has closed, etc. They get caught in a vicious circle of missing work due to arrest and court, already living paycheck to paycheck so can't pay fine, more court, maybe more jail, more work missed, there goes the job, etc. etc. etc. One of the big reasons that the federal judge shot down "stop and frisk" in the NYC public housing scenario was partly due to this happening to people who had no weapon and ended up getting summonses related to "quality of life" issues. The lead plaintiff in that case was arrested for trespassing at a public housing unit - he was waiting for his girlfriend who lived there and gave him permission to be there. The guy is a licensed security guard and the flimsy arrest, even without a conviction, could have seriously ruined his career.   I thought I read that only one of the dead was a Bandido, the other eight were Cossacks.

There were several of these incidents in my neighborhood at the time, indicative of organized burglary and probably answered to someone higher up the chain who already has a fence.   A few years back when my house got robbed, a dog in the backyard did not prevent them from jumping the fence and kicking down the backdoor. And she wasn't a small dog, sadly she was super friendly. When I had a new door installed, they guy installed it in such a way that it will be extremely difficult to kick in.   I did that when I was robbed. Never heard from HPD again after the initial report.   You forgot to ad - Get Renters Insurance if you rent.   That might actually be a fun conversation to eavesdrop on.   The only professional league in the US that does this is Major League Soccer, since it's the only league with organized Supporter Groups (often called in Ultras in other countries).

[This is my favorite one that happened in Houston.](http://www.fbi.gov/houston/press-releases/2013/woodlands-man-convicted-of-using-fake-cia-credentials) I will say one thing that can be annoying here in Houston is how all the private security companies now have fleets of cars that look like police cars. Additionally, there are at least three communities (two very wealthy neighborhoods and one a commercial district) that hire off-duty LEO to patrol in vehicles those communities have furnished - and they seem to replace the cars more often than HPD.   I have seen Houston Police use pick-up trucks, but were always marked, and the decals indicated that their primary duty was related to dealing with Tractor-Trailer enforcement.   One of the reasons I hated the idea of the Astros moving to the American League, might not always beat the Cardinals, but we did get to beat them at least a few times every season.   Not all government vehicles in Texas say "EXEMPT" on their plates, I've seen marked Constable vehicles with normal Texas plates. Pursuant to Texas Transportation Code 721.003 it is possible to obtain regular plates for exempt vehicles. While said section lists a bunch of specific entities, I assume that No. 18 is a pretty broad coverall for all other agencies.   Plus the way I heard it on the news this morning, he was found in a city owned vehicle.   Totally forget that I had that Space Invader game when I was a kid. I also had the football game that Henry was playing on The Americans this past season.   Sadly, it's getting harder and harder. A lot of unmarked vehicles will have officers with armor and polos or t-shirts, but it's easy for civilians to buy that stuff too. Hell, lots of police departments, especially in tourist areas, sell the t-shirts. I know the NOPD precinct office in the French Quarter has a t-shirt vending machine.   I'm thinking more nefarious than that, sexual assault.   I believe that those episodes in the 500s are repeats, which won't necessarily be replayed in order.   Sorry, was on my phone last night and fat figured the date - it's 1994, not 1993, obviously.   Yep, that's him. I found this posted on his Facebook page yesterday.   Probably use them to find cars that need boots due to unpaid tickets = revenue.   So, we essentially got a glimpse of what Cooper Sterling was like in the 1920s.   A friend of mine in HS, her brother was the night manger at the Two Pesos on Montrose and we'd stop by there for freebies after leaving Decadance (now El Real).   So that's why it's called The Hoodlands.   That's a private subreddit.   And yet, unfortunately, I see so many lawn water systems going off in the middle of the day when they are least efficient.   I think they're just trying to keep stupid people from watering in the day when most of that water will evaporate instead of going into the soil.  	199
 A lot of questions in that article, but what I'd really like to know is: how much of this ends up in the Toronto mayor's office?   Yes, his death penalty was applied proactively.   Looking it up because I was curious, [there have been 37 Federal executions](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/federal-executions-1927-2003), and only three since 1963, one of those being for Timothy McVeigh.

Kids used to drink [small beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer) all the time, before public sanitation. It's probably no worse than Ritalin.      It's a good point, perhaps the phrase "transcription factor *recognition* site" should have been used, as is done in the abstract of the article, instead of "binding site". However I am not familiar with the distinction between the two.   That abstract is from an accompanying perspective article. The abstract of the actual paper in question is here:   Exonic Transcription Factor Binding Directs Codon Choice and Affects Protein Evolution   Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15% of human codons are dual-use codons (duons) that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution.    It does. The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full) and says that [codons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code), the three-letter codes in our DNA that stand for an amino acid in protein synthesis, can **simultaneously** code for an amino acid **and** a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) control the expression of genes, i.e. turning them on or off. These dual-use codons, or "duons" as they have called them, represent the "second code" that OP's article is talking about. Even though I only just read it, it looks like a big deal.   Yes, and it seems that codon bias - the observed preference of some redundant codons over others - may be explained by these "duons", which would be one of the major findings of this paper from a molecular evolution angle. From the abstract:   Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias.    The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full). As mentioned in OP's link, it seems that some codons (of which there are 64 in the standard [genetic code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code)), can simultaneously encode an amino acid and a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor), put very crudely, control how genes are turned on or off. The discovery of these codons with dual use, hence the term "duons", is very interesting. (edit: spelling)      For those looking to emigrate to Liechtenstein, bad news, you actually have to live there for **30 years** before you can apply for citizenship. If you want to apply before the 30 years is up, a vote can be taken by the community of residence, however:    Final acceptance also requires consent from the Liechtenstein parliament and granting of citizenship by the Prince  which sounds cool.

A lot of time would be spent in the bathroom, that's for sure.   Why block the hospital? I guess there could be radioactive material still on the people's clothes, pockets, so it's probably a precautionary measure.   I was skeptical, but here is an archived report from 1979 about these twins:  http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073583,00.html      Thanks. Good to have confirmation.      OP tells a good story, but nowhere in the link does it go exactly as described. Maybe there's a video somewhere where it does, would be fun to see.

Survival mode is the most fun. Story mode can be challenging, especially the final boss.   A google image search for "Roman sling bullets" reveals [this](http://homepages.gac.edu/~panciera/roman_sling_bullets2.jpg). I can't translate the Latin, but the one on the lower right is understandable in anyone's language.   The same thing happened with the Food Network. It used to be about recipes and cooking, now it's mostly game shows. (edit: and Guy Fieri).   There's a split second where you can tell he's thinking "Why dont I just eat it?".      Apparently they have been taking guns to space for decades (e.g. [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TP-82)). The idea was for self protection in the wilderness after re-entry.         The movie must have made an impression. From Reagan's 1986 State of the Union address:  "Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film Back to the Future, 'Where we're going, we don't need roads'."  ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future#Legacy))   There are some pretty impressive pictures of them [in this thread](http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/european-international-sites/5921-diy-guide-your-own-supervillain-hideout-aka-tailrace-tunnel-niagara.html).       Yes DNA is still fragmented and assembled with PacBio's own proprietary assembly software HGAP. The advantage of SMRT is much longer read lengths (thousands of bases) compared to Illumina for example (50-150 bases). Despite the lower base calling accuracy of SMRT (although I hear the accuracy is getting better all the time) the longer read length helps with assembly greatly, and I can say from personal experience that this gives some *very* promising preliminary results for genome sequencing.   For clarity, it should be also noted that these technologies are just different ways of sequencing sequence fragments. No matter how long they are, especially for SMRT, they still need to be computationally assembled to recover an entire chromosome, for instance. Until someone can rapidly sequence an entire chromosome linearly from start to end, it is still "shotgun sequencing".   OK, perhaps in the future, but there's no way these technologies are routinely used for genome sequencing now, especially novel genomes, which was my initial point.   Huh? All next generation sequencing technologies sequence short random fragments of a larger DNA (or RNA, now) molecule, which are then assembled in silico to recover the larger sequence they came from. This is the essence of shotgun sequencing.   OP's link is explicitly about the project resulting in the first draft human genome, which finished in 2000. The X prize didn't start until 2006.   This is partly due to competition from Celera Genomics, Craig Venter's private company, whose improved method, shotgun sequencing, is now routinely used for genome sequencing. This article doesn't seem to mention this at all.         St Patrick's Day on a Sunday every year? Sold!  	77
 You should look into Systems Level programming. Personally I find it incredibly interesting and fun.   http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/  This is a pretty legit textbook to get you started, it also has like 7 labs in it to help you learn assembly, things like buffer overflow attacks, how to write your own malloc implementation and more. It is in C, not java - but still a great fucking book.    As I was going to St. Ives,   I met a man with seven wives,   Each wife had seven sacks,   Each sack had seven cats,   Each cat had seven kits:   Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,   How many were there going to St. Ives?     The proxy forwards all the headers shown above to the client.    I don't think that is actually true... If he just works with them all on the stack. Isn't that true? Then he can just access them all as element.value rather than element-value  	4
    Wow, can I just say how bad ass spencer was tonight, not taking no for an answer. Im so glad that aria apologized to Hannah and they made up. As for mama Montgomery, I feel so bad for her, she just can catch a break. I swear if tonight wasnt foreshadowing a twin theory, then its not going to happen at all. I believe Noel when he says that Alison was never kidnapped. When he says that our friend likes to through away people when shes done using them I think hes referring to A. So if this is true, is A a woman. Im so proud of Hanna for ditching the booze and I have to say it was hot when Caleb stood up for his girl. I love Travis but haleb is growing on me again. I still dont trust Alison and highly doubt that she even knows this guy in custody. We will soon see.       I dont know what upsets me more about the ending of that episode, honestly... that Malia and Stiles are going through a rough patch, which will probably lead to Malia hanging out with Peter! or the people who will use that fight to tinhat Stiles and Derek even harder! or that the people who will use that fight to tinhat Stiles and Lydia even harder.......!!!    Loved this:  See, every time I have given you the benefit of the doubt, it bites me in the ass. Dale Barbara   I just loved Lena`s words so much! 'nothings permanent. not the trees, not the mountains, not us. not even our sadness. i keep thinking about the fact that no matter what happens during the night, every morning the sun comes up. again and again.'   I know shes going through some stuff, but Daphne needs to be smacked in the head. Bay needs to tell her that its not Reginas fault. Shits getting annoying.          I liked her when she was innocent and trying to help...afterwards she became a dumb bitch as you well pointed out   yeah but the writers made her talk and act like a retard slut sometimes...and that`s why she lost her initial character role   yeah me too...i liked her the first 2 seasons..or 3..after that...she began to really annoy me   I`ve only watched 10 min of the first episode and it didn`t make an impression on me...I believe it`s kinda like Lost...you think you will find something out every episode...but you don`t...and you don`t really know anything as seasons pass by....      I haven`t watched it, I just wanted some opinions to make up my mind! Thanks for your reply!  	15

 Hoo said that?!   You crack me up....   Size doesn't matter!   Do fries come with that shake?!    Perhaps insufficient support over the years?  Not very uplifting is it?!    Strange how they both face in different directions though  Better let me give you a hand...or two:~)               Hey there /u/autowikibot! You subscribe to /r/train_subject6188 too?!  We're big time ladies and gentlemen!   What is [Ultra Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Seven) you say?  "Ultra Seven ( Urutora Sebun) is a tokusatsu science fiction TV series that aired on Japanese TV in 1967. Created by Eiji Tsuburaya, this follow up to Ultraman went on to become one of Japan's greatest fantasy TV series. Such is his popularity that Ultra Seven (or simply "Seven") has appeared or at least made cameos in nearly every Ultra Series following his own and has had far more exposure than even the original Ultraman (though the original Ultraman is without a doubt the face of the Ultras). Ultra Seven is sometimes incorrectly called "Ultraman Seven" by many sources outside Japan (or in the case of KHON/Honolulu, Hawaii, Ultra 7, as listed in TV Guide when it ran in 1975). Both the series and its hero can also be called Ultraseven (without a space), which is generally the form used when romanized."      What is Tanabata?  "Tanabata is a Japanese festival originating from the Chinese Qixi Festival. It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar."  It's not a national holiday, so people still have to work and it's more popular with the kids, but many places have festivals and that means food, beer and games.                      A virgin  We approve of virgins!   Life's a beach, so I'll meet you at the sandbar:~)  *-gives a little wave-*     I'm happy to help with any ideas you have.  Seriously, it looks great and I'm stoked.  If anything comes to me, I'll let you know, but to be perfectly honest, so far, so good!                              I agree! Thanks to our CSS Wiz, /u/Handicapreader, /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub on Reddit!^not^really...   Me too! In bed at 10pm tonight!   Night all...      Tell me about it.  One of them stuck a "Kick Me!" sign on my back earlier today:~(   Thank goodness!   Got it. Now I've got to find Hazel...sorry, who am I looking for again?            K  I'll ask for free refills too!            I shouldn't be allowed near a keyboard when hungover...   Not the brightest bulb in the deck, am I?         Indeed. I think the first few goals kind of blew their minds.   Japan's coach is already talking about the Olympics. Guess they start qualifiers in Feb?      I didn't see any of it live, but I've seen enough now...   See? I'm always a day late and a dollar short...         Man, I'm watching the highlights on the news and the US women were just on target.   It all makes sense now!^not^really   Probably, but I've been beat all day today...    Mods are ruining reddit!!  You were paid to say that, weren't you!?   Juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a bit hungover.  Don't know why I drank on a Sunday...back on the wagon again!   I'm green with envy:~)   Ban me!!!!   Yes:~)   There's nothing there!  Are you feeling alright? Feverish?  Shall I ~~play~~ call a doctor?!   Um?   What-chu talking 'bout, Carma!?   Sorry, I couldn't resist!   If I suddenly go missing, it means they've locked me in the cellar!   It's true, it's blue!   "...warns Asian countries could see Australia as 'decadent' if same-sex marriage legalised"  Tentacle porn, soaplands, bj bars, pachinko, hostess/host clubs, cosplay clubs....  He's not including Japan in his statement by any chance, is he?   So....  ...  ...  ...any recommendations for a good place to stay?          As a Japanese living in Chicago  Tokyo winters are like summer compared to Chicago!   Due to the fact that /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub ~~in my mind~~ on Reddit, we've had to take on two new moderators in /r/Handicapreader and /u/Carmabound.  Mr. Reader has created the sky above and below us, because, well, I was drunk and/or hungover every day in high school and wasn't paying attention to my teacher in computer class. All things CSS will go through him and only him. He deserves all the credit for everything you see.  Ms. Bound will be in charge of....in charge of....well, she'll be doing the same thing I do, and that's nothing but making witty comments and having lots of pun.  I'm sure after a few months, the crew will stage a mutiny and boot me off my own sub, but lets enjoy it while it lasts, ok?     Let's do it!!!!!     he said I would do great as a comedian.  Go for it! Can I be your ghost writer?!    I showed this to my friend who works for the county  Can he/she get me a job watering flowers in Waikiki?  Maybe I'm missing something, but I used to see the truck going down Kalakaua every morning and always thought, man, what a great job.    Good gravy, my hangover is really showing in my comments today!    If all else fails, my offer to be a comedy duo still stands... and I might even have an agent.   At this point in my life, I'll try anything!   Did I tell you about that?  Go on...     and you're a twit  Thank you. I love you too.    It's such an awesome team, Kane, Toews, Sharp(will he stay?), Keith, Shaw, Seabrook, Hossa and so on...  I was real saad to see Saad leave, but that's just the economics these days.  That said,the best move that Rocky made was pinching the Bowman's from Detroit.    it would be great if you could find a writing gig.  It would, but have you read my comment history?!      As a Canadian  As a native Chicagoan, may I thank you for stocking my Blackhawks with your fine countrymen and bringing the Cup to Chicago three times!   Ah, sorry, you're right. 2014 was in Brazil, I was confused with the Olympics.    That's great :)  It is and it isn't. You know me, I'm such a worry-wart that I'm wondering what will go wrong, instead of enjoying it for what it is.   Do you already have a place to stay  Yes, I'm just waiting for the realtor to confirm the exact move in date before I buy a ticket. I know it's a holiday weekend and all, but they're kinda laid back when it comes to all things business in HI.   and a possible job lined up  No. Will have to get on this, but I went through this before when I went from Japan to Hawaii. People don't really want to talk to you unless you're there. Maybe because so many people change their minds at the last minute, but it's next to impossible to set something up via phone/internet.   Do you have a laptop, or are you going to disconnect again?  I do, but I'm not sure what they have there. I may be offline for a week or so, but I'll try to set something up before I go, when the actual move in date is set for sure.     As an American living in Tokyo, I'm just happy that I don't have to hear the locals gloat for the next four years.  Team Japan is pretty darn good though, and they do work really hard. It's just that the media coverage here is enough to drive anyone mad, unless of course your a fan of the team.  That said, ~~Brazil~~ Russia is only 2 years away, so I'm sure from tomorrow we'll be seeing how the men's Cup will coming to JP for sure!  **EDIT: Thanks to /u/tokomini for pointed out my brainfart. The Olympics will be held in Brazil in 2016, the WC was held there in 2014.**   Carma, it's looking pretty good at the moment.  I've got to check back in with the doc next Mon, but other than buying a plane ticket and doing some last minute shopping, I'm pretty much 99.9% sure I'll be off next month.  Strangely enough, right around my cakeday again!  Unless the doc tells me that my body is seriously fucked, it's looking like I'll be basking in the sun soon enough:~)   Just want to say thanks to you and all the Mods here for doing such a great job.  That's all.   At least I don't have to hear the locals talking about how great Team JP is for the next four....aw shit, 2016 Brazil?!       I didn't watch it, was Germany hungover?   Well, England did finish 3rd, so it's not all that bad, right?  Do you like how I pitched that?   I've always liked him and felt real bad for him after that WS flub. That was just shit luck and a brain fart on his part, but he's always been a hard worker and good player.    I thought they just took a map of the island and threw wet spaghetti in the air. Wherever it landed, that's where they put the roads.  Same crew must've done the roads here, 'cause that's pretty much how Tokyo is too:~(                                                              	115
    More free time means more time with the pug and smashing demons on Diablo   [Google Doc Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GfqKV1fstXCSTVlk5GwbNC4g5Zw6L64Kl2TenSWd_yY/edit?usp=sharing)      Looking for a little feedback so I decided to post this in a few places.      Does it sound like an interesting read? Is there a specific direction you think would be really interesting for this tidbit to go in? How is my writing?      Any helpful comments are welcome! Please also comment here if you comment on the actual document so I know to go look. If there are specific websites you use to get good feedback on your writing, I would appreciate it if you dropped me a comment on that as well. Thank you    I rewrote some things, check it out when you get the chance if you would.      I took your advice on leaving the portals visible but low profile and not having things have to will themselves through to the other side. Hopefully I did a better job of making it seem less like the humans were inferior to the visitors and more like the visitors simply acted that way.    Its helpful to hear others understand and have similar reactions and bad habits.      What my friend came up with was a sort of system she uses to keep from being lazy. She told me if she puts off doing the dishes one day for example, she would clean the whole kitchen the next day. She thinks it might be helpful to me to turn around and do something nice for the person I snapped at or didn't listen to. It might eventually make me think before I react because I'm also sort of shy and don't like being forced to interact more than I need to with a lot of people. Its a good thought, but I'll have to see if I can stick with it. I also suffer from being slightly pessimistic so its difficult to stay hopeful, lol.   I seem to be so worried all the time that people are not thinking that I'm good enough for one reason or another that my reaction to any kind of criticism is to become incredibly defensive, even if people are just trying to help. I know that this is not helpful at all. I can look back on situations and see that I reacted badly and I know that staying calm would help me a great deal in future situations, but I just can't seem to manage it and that is infuriating. Especially when I'm at work where a professional attitude is a necessity. Or when a good friend is just trying to help me see how to do something a different way than what I'm used to and may not even be telling me that I'm doing anything wrong.   I have tendencies towards obsessive behavior and I'm starting to wonder if these kinds of reactions are another form of this. A lot of times when I am stressed out, I end up in trance-like state and pick at my skin until it just looks terrible. I haven't been able to change this habit either, only lessen the amount of damage for some periods of time. It never sticks though.   I wish I could be more calm and change these terrible habits. They have become almost daily issues that I have to deal with and it is absolutely draining.

 Eh, the doctor said I didn't show any signs of having schizophrenia, he said that it's most likely caused by my lack of sleep...which I honestly like to believe is the cause.   The only reason they bother me so much is that I have had sleep hallucinations it's normally the same thing, which is that objects will turn into snakes. It startled me the first time my pencil turned into a tiny snake, but now I'm so used to it that when it does happen I just ignore it.  Insomnia is a bitch hun! lol  But in all seriousness...I honestly don't know why I see these things, I don't think I'll ever know.   Which might be for the best. O.o  	1

 Aw he did so good on his dates! As far as simulating at home - you may know this, but if you put them somewhere unfamiliar it is best (bathtub with a towel down works great).   We had a lot of success with a nervous bun by opening the pen door and sitting on the ground and letting her come to us - we also put her food in and out that way. She had the opposite problem (ran and hid), but it may be helpful for a little biter, too.   And we don't have chickens - that video is actually in the shelter. They had roosters in there that day!   Can't wait to hear/see more of Squishy! Hope everybun is settling in well.   Awesome. I was there the day he came in the shelter. (I volunteer with the Rabbit Haven)  Enjoy a video of him being "aggressive" to me in the shelter!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8Ac2nAXJA feature=c4-overview list=UUszCsrsauaGtBORGmKIeS2g  I am so happy he found a home. I heard from a volunteer who was at the show that day that he loved his new family instantly and it was a very good match - so congratulations and enjoy this little puff ball! =:)  And please keep posting pics! Seeing the buns happy in their new homes is one of the best things for a shelter volunteer!      Hilarious. Now you need a nice Giant to pose as Jabba ;)   Yes! So cute! Please keep posting pics of him :)   Was his name Herschel?! I think this is a bunny I played with at our shelter!!! :D   Thank you so much!    As someone who works with a rescue, and as a shelter volunteer, I beg you not to have baby bunnies. Our rescue has taken in so many litters born to unspayed female rabbits in the shelter that need a foster home to go to. There are also babies found dumped by breeders who can't get rid of them. There are so many ways to bring baby rabbits into your home without contributing to the problem and taking away homes from rabbits that already exist.   Get in touch with a local rescue or shelter and let them know you are interested in raising a litter. When they were grown the rescue would be helping you find them good homes - and they usually give you first priority if you want to adopt any.   Just my 2 cents.   Female rabbits who aren't spayed have an 80%+ chance of getting uterine cancer before they are 3 years old. Definitely get her spayed. (As abyssurr already said) Plus all the behavioral benefits. 7 months is old enough. 6 months is old enough. She will be fine :)  As far as other ideas - everyone is saying vinegar for cleaning and that is great. The other thing you can do is to put litter boxes there. They will be in the way, yes, but if you fill the area with litter boxes and there is no way to pee there without peeing in them - maybe she will get the point. It helped with a lot of problem areas for us.   All of the rabbits were malnourished and underweight. They were not being fed properly OR enough.   I work with these guys. I gotta say, we have ALL been asking ourselves the same question. I don't know that it was a lack of realization as much as possibly a lack of funds, motivation, proactivity...    love the sweater   So sad 3 Poor little guy, and hugs to you too   He is only about 6 lbs   We have two other bunnies and are working on bonding them :)      Thanks!  It has an opening so I suppose it could have been done any time. We don't have any vet records for her. She was a stray found in a field and I took her home from the shelter.   I need to take her in to a bird vet to get her checked out and make sure she is okay. A vet might have more info for us.  We have no idea how old she is. We don't actually know if she is a she but we named her Leela, so we call her she.   For sure. This little gal was a rescue from the shelter - not bought. Good info, would probably not get any animal that wasn't a rescue/shelter adoption though :)   cute :)   My conure was in the back of the shelter in the rabbit room I volunteer in. The shelter has no bird facilities and doesn't even adopt birds out of there. Because I am a volunteer with a rescue I was able to rescue her under the rabbit rescue's name and take her home. She already had a band on her ankle.   Where would she have had this band put on? What do the numbers and letters mean?    He is pretty independent but easygoing. He is a mellow guy and enjoys some snuggles now and again :)   Awwww she is pretty! If you got her from The Rabbit Haven in California in the last year (he isn't even 1 yet) - she might be ;)            Absolutely!   If you keep them as livestock, they are dirty like livestock. If you give them a home, they are perfect pets :)   Yes I pre-made all the meals and labelled "Saturday AM" "Saturday PM"  We changed the litter before we left and the day we got back (Friday, Sunday)... so we didn't worry about that.   I would make sure they know to refill the hay box if it is empty.   I have heard some people say their pets, rabbits included, like when the tv or radio is left on for them - that it helps them not be lonely. Perhaps your parents could turn something on during the day?    Rabbits are extremely clean! They clean themselves constantly and if kept in a clean environment are not smelly or dirty.   Their breath smells good, they don't have a "smell" like dogs do, and you don't have to wash them.  The only thing "dirty" about our rabbits is that there is now hay everywhere in our house. Hay isn't really dirty... so I would say your roomates are crazy.  Also, as the other commenter said, they aren't rodents.    We just left our buns for 2 days. We have three of them and they range from slightly under a year to 3.5 years. We also have a bird. My parents came by twice a day to feed everyone and talk to them and give them treats - make sure they are pooping and not looking ill.   They live in x pens set up to make a 4x4 area for each so they aren't cramped, but they are used to being let out everyday. They were thrilled to see us when we got home and did not seem angry.   I recommend leaving a note with instructions to your sitter. This is what ours looked like:  Rabbits: Change water Fill hay racks - hay in large green bins Fill food bowls - food labelled in tupperware in fridge If it is very hot - put frozen water bottles from freezer in their cage for them to lay against. You can also turn on the wall AC in the room if you close the sliding kitchen door and come by later to turn the AC off. Pet their heads and say some nice words to them Check for any emergency situations. Rabbits can die within 24 hours of contracting some conditions. Emergency vet information is below.   Emergencies: (none SHOULD happen, but just in case, these are immediate vet situations) Heat Stroke - runny nose, listless, hot ears. Cool water (not ice) on ears and get to vet.

 Thanks! Yeah, I work in an urban school, so my school can assist with any of the funds, but I would very much like a similar pay raise.    Lovely! I love how the characters actually look like themselves. Sometimes tattoos distort their faces...not this one !   I am currently a second year teacher (who desperately wants to enroll in grad school).  For more experienced teachers, when would be the best time to go back for grad school?(3rd year? 4th year? Now?) Any helpful ideas would be greatly appreciated!  	3
 He has Kazunoko, Tonpy and Super_uriajjo in his Quarter Final pool for potential opponents. Good luck to him :(   Damn I missed that...that sucks then :(  Still a pretty cool idea if it actually happened some day.   GREAT IDEA. If both this and Luffy vs Santarou Man are streamed on Mad Catz in Day 2 EVO, this might be the first I'll ever watch an EVO on Saturday.   Also, Angelic's idea of Edition Select for the iterations that each respective EVO champion won with is ingenious. Fuudo with Fei Long AE would win this pretty easily though.    The average player from Japan is better than the average player from US. I'm tired of seeing no-name matches on stream while all the higher-profiled players getting blown up off-stream. This is purely from a spectator mindset.   Filipinoman's C14 pool is no joke either. His 3rd potential opponent is a a very strong Japanese cody player, Sidou13.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zpVn-eP_64  This potential match should also be streamed.  Daigo's pool looks simple and seems to have mostly unknowns. But you are dead wrong. He has some pretty strong possible Japanese players to contend with:  - baby nine (#8 BP ranked Guile in Japanese Arcades) - Aiai ( (#4 BP ranked Juri in Japanese Arcades)  These matches should also be streamed.   Dark Jiewa is no better if not same level as Chris Tatarian in Ken play so this isn't surprising due to his experience against the character.    Don't forget Tampa Bison whipped Infiltration at Final Round 18. Beat his Akuma and Decapre too.   I would even say Shinba abel is better than Shiro but I still feel like 801strider is the best abel in the world. Those whiff punishes and anti-airs [](/Kreygasm)   If there's gonna be 2 streams for SF, the CapcomFighters stream should have James Chen and Ultra David, while the srkevo1 streams should have Seth Killian and Zhi (but he has to be restraint)  	9

 if I ever go bald I am going to march right over to gods house and take a poo on his sofa.   my dad was a weaver   *weed joke*   and now that dad is in jail nothing can take that away from us!   I won't claim to know how an octopus tank size effects its stress level I'm just saying that its intelligence won't have anything to do with the argument. it's a sedentary animal so if all its needs are accounted for it will stay put whereas a tang is highly energetic. it's like having a small apartment and putting a sleepy dog vs a nutty dog in it. they could be the same breed but the nutty one will be stressed and the sleepy one won't be bothered.   how does that make any sense? an animals territory size is in no way related to its intelligence. the only reason an octopus moves at all is to find food or mate.   I have an exam tomorrow and I'm going to get less than 5 hours of sleep thanks to OP. ain't even mad.   I'm down. let's bring a bunch of booze and figure out a way to turn this into the ultimate drinking game?   what did the female do to get kicked out of the bed? musta been something bad.   he's got a point. if I were God id look down at earth and go "holy shit look at that turban"   dude I bet he could palm kanye west's ego   I shall die in a pool of vomit, convulsing on the floor from heart failure but happy nonetheless   awww thank you sweetie I love me too :)   I'm going to make these for me because I love me so much :)   bb I'm bout to plug dis dongle in and charge u RIGHT up (    )   and then a cartoon series based on the toy   how does this relate? particle accelerators are not that hard to understand.

 I wasn't planning on doing any red. I did plan on some orange but I decided against it because of a background i may put on it in the future   Thanks! :) like I said im really indecisive about it right now which is why im waiting to make a decision.   I changed my mind! I decided im going to add more the the background on the piece, likely some blue/pink/orange tropical flowers. So its actually going to be a larger piece now rather than just the bird on its own. Perhaps. Not truly decided yet which is why im waiting!   Thanks! Her name is Lisa dowling she works from her home in the GTA. She's been tattooing for 20+ years so I really trust her with my pieces!      My next sit is February 6th, so i'll post one soon enough! :) i actually found it to be the most painful of any of my tattoos, i have 3 others which are all black and white, this is my first colour piece. I found the most painful spots we're the top of the wings near my butt and the back portion of the bird. But definitely the wings were the worst.  Considering it is the largest piece i've had and also the longest sit at 3.5 hours i feel that was part of the reason it began to hurt quite a bit. It's also a lot of shading and colouring in one spot, but definitely a sensitive area to get a large piece like this   When my tattoo artist was positioning it she was actually talking about how important it is that the lines follow your natural curve. I agree with her, if not it makes your body look off. Im really stoked she played good attention to positioning!   She doesn't, she has a group on facebook but I believe it's closed now and only previous clients can view it. She hard to get! The wait right now is about 6 months... PM me and I'll see what we can do! Btw hi from Whitby as well :)   She used to work at sinful inflictions in Whitby but ended up getting a great client base and left to work from her home! She now has a studio in her house, fully licensed and whatnot.   Yeah I found it originally as a chalk drawing and loved it! Searched up the artist and saw the blurb and then was of course sure to switch it up and give my artist her own personal freedom on the piece. It translated into a tattoo really well!   Im thinking orange and some mauve as well. Like a tropical colour theme   thank you! I gave her the basic idea and said to get creative with it and she honestly hit it out of the park! It looks like a pastel/watercolour which I find really amazing.   Thanks! On the next sit she'll be adding some orange into the blank areas and colouring the tail feathers. Im also considering adding some drop shadowing, but im not sure yet.      How come a girl can't just like a hairy man? i hate the concept of manscaping, i think men are meant to be hairy and i don't expect him to remove his natural growth!  	15
 Hvem er undersgelsen blevet bestilt af? Hvad er referencerne til artiklen? http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2009.00678.x/references  Hvordan ved du helt prcist at denne undersgelse er upartisk?   Links til upartiske artikler, tak.    Det gr sgu lidt ondt nr folk siger at min sde veninde og hendes kreste   Nr folk som Pia smider sig rundt med uvidenskabelige angreb  Findes der videnskabelige upartiske artikler som sttter op om at brn fr den samme opvkst om s deres forldre er heteroseksuelle eller homoseksuelle?   Jeg hader serist nr folk bruger deres egen enkle situation som en generelisering for resten af landet. Og hvad s hvis din kreste er universitetsstuderende? Det er tydeligt at dette er langt fra normen for familiesammenfringer generelt. At s der findes enkelte situationer som din kreste hvor det er get godt er ikke enbetydende med at familiesammenfringer er en gevinst for Danmark i alle de andre tilflde.  rgerligt at det skal g ud over de udlndinge som vil Danmark godt, men man bliver ndt til at se p det store billede i hele landet istedet for at se snvret synet at "Jamen, min kreste klarer det godt, derfor klarer alle mennesker igennem familiesammenfringer sig godt". Det er da simpelthen et latterligt argument.   Folk tror hele tiden at jeg er muslim pga. min hudfarve hvilket egentligt er forsteligt nok da de fleste med en mrk hudfarve i Danmark er religise.  Jeg synes dog desvrre at det gr det lidt svrt at mde piger da jeg har hrt at mange danske piger foretrkker at date en person som ikke er religis. Jeg har endda set enkelte dating profiler hvor de skriver at de ikke er interesserede i visse religise grupper.  Hvordan kan jeg diskret gre en sd pige som jeg mder ude i byen opmrksom p at jeg er ateist? Det virker lidt akavet at bare sige det fra starten af men vil ikke delgger nogen chancer bare fordi de tror jeg er religis pga. min hudfarve.    if we repatriate them  Riiiiiiight, as if that is going to happen. A lot of them will get a Swedish passport after a few years, then receive benefits from the government while spending most of their time watching Al Jazeera at home (remember, telling them they need to get a job is racist - http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2015/03/22/165901.htm) and going on vacation to their home country where they supposedly were persecuted.  http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pal%C3%A6stinenserloven      Probably going to get downvoted but I would not have interfered. For all that you know, one of their husbands were standing to the side and if you interfer he'll start attacking you or even worse might have a knife on him.  I've read many stories these past years of people interfering in fights or robberies, only to get beaten up or even killed. It's the sad truth.   That's how one of my ex gfs broke up with me. The same day we were talking like always, joking, etc. absolutely nothing about her seemed different. Then a few hours later, no reply. Then after I message her a few times I get blocked. Never got any explanation.  The worst part about it? In the beginning of our relationship she told me she broke up with an ex by simply ignoring him.   Amazing song!! Thank you so much Dan, you're so awesome!! :)   They're my favorite band and I know that Dan likes rock so....   Honestly, this is fucking with me so much. To the point where I'd be willing to travel 5000 miles to their next panel just to ask him this question.  Does anyone know what his favorite red hot chili peppers song is? Has he mentioned them in any videos? I want to know so badly, it has been almost two years now :(   That's why you use a mute button.      Hun er sd.   Tja alts nogle feminister pstr at det primrt er kvinderne som bliver udsat for vold i hjemmet s var nysgerring i at se hvordan de er kommet frem til det udsagn.      No voice chat has pissed me off. How exactly do you play strategically when you can't communicate with your team? You're basically just running around shooting the walls and grounds. At least with communication, you could add a whole new element of strategy to it and discover new strategies and whatnot but without voice chat, it's just redundant spray and pray.  Tbh, I've already gone back to Smash Bros.   When a girl has a weird attraction. For instance, I saw this video of a girl who was dendrophiliac and it was a huge turn on for me.   I'm so happy to have Dan in Game Grumps. He is just a really inspirational person and I'm so glad to know that there is a person like him out there. He has honestly made me happiest the most out of all the Grumps and he is truly my favorite.        	22

 It makes me feel torn, said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. **The bottom line is military spending is government spending, and in the absence of any sort of other stimulus for the private sector, we need to get it where we can**.   Why don't you try to write your comment w/out profanity and then resubmit.  Thanks.   if you want an endless war, sure, let's keep afghanistan in a perpetual state of domestic conflict and completely ignore the eerily similar events of history.  Intervention by foreign powers has caused all of the problems you're referring to.  What Afghans do in their own country is not now, nor has it ever been, the business of the United States.  You have to understand that you have been brainwashed by your employer with these phony arguments in order to get you to kill people who have never posed any threat to you or your country.  I'm sorry your life will be perpetually scarred by the immoral acts you participated in while serving the interests of some politicians and the arms manufacturers.   The war is lost.  There is no sense in losing one more Afghan or American life.  Any "mature" observer of the situation would agree with this assessment and counsel the same course of action: bring the troops home.   Moreover, some 70,000 people, most of them Muslims, have been killed by other Muslims in the Syrian civil war, **which the U.S. had nothing to do with**  although many Muslims are now begging us to intervene to stop it.  I guess he doesn't read his own newspaper.   exaggerated reports of coalition casualties, vows for revenge, and glorious victories against great odds  I think you're actually thinking of claims made by the U.S. military.  The U.S. lost the war many years ago.  It's time to admit that fact and bring the troops home.   Yes, peace would be a terrible thing.   But NATO insists that the war is being won, with US General Joseph Dunford, head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), saying on Thursday there was "indisputable" progress towards the goal of a stable nation.   Yeah, I'm sure the murderous Japanese Imperial system could have been sustained for the last 70 years or so in all of those countries.  How long did the U.S. military last in Iraq again?   Yes, what the Japanese military did was none of the U.S. Govt's business so long as it didn't threaten America.  The only reason the Japanese attacked the U.S. at all is b/c we had forcibly acquired colonies in Hawaii and the Philippines (and Guam, American Samoa, etc.) in contradiction to the principles the country was founded on.  If we mind our own business, people tend to leave us alone.  It's not a complicated theory.   It was.   Check out the comments section of the story.  Unbelievable ignorance and stupidity.  Examples:  My new favorite oxymoron: Ron Paul Think Tank  Intent on studying why black Americans won't vote in support of slavery and racists? Because that's just not obvious so let's spend time and money figuring it out...  The Ron Paul Institute for the Peace and Prosperity of Slaveowners and the Operators of Segregated Lunch Counters.   Obviously, there is a coordinated effort to try to discredit the Ron Paul Institute.  How soon before Rand distances himself from his father's think tank?   RUSH:  So the meme is we did it, the United States.  We are responsible. Michael Scheuer, who... I'll refrain, but to me, **no credibility there whatsoever**  Does he even know who Michael Scheuer is?   Being targeted with violence is a major cost of war and aggression. It's a reason not do it.   he still is against targeted killings and especially unwarranted drone surveillance.  Just give him a few more days.  He seems to change his mind on a whim.   I was just fucking w/ you.   Great comment.  Thanks.   Let's try this a different way: "Americans who distrust [Jews] are likelier to back [concentration camps]"   He didn't order the strike. He didn't have anything to do with the story in the article you just linked.  So I guess the drone's just operate independently of any human input, right?  What hoops you partisan Obama lovers will jump through to absolve your murderous hero of any guilt.  You're pathetic.  Grow up.   Why not?   A female E-4 who police said confessed to shooting BBs at passers-by for fun, was charged with assault but will not be arrested, the prosecutor said.   He's not his father.  And I want to keep reiterating that point so people aren't fooled.   While the Deer Team was with the Viet Minh, the Japanese surrendered and the Viet Minh declared Vietnam an independent nation, using language from the Declaration of Independence. Ho gave his American friends a message to forward to President Harry S. Truman asking him to support the Viet Minh against France, which had lost its colonies to Japan during the war and was fighting to take them back. Mr. Truman never replied. The United States backed France.    You still haven't provided an alternative contender for that title.  Please let me know when you come up with one.   Partisan = Insane, in this case.   Translation: I surrender  Not a "surrender," just a waste of time presenting facts to a partisan.   I don't have time to refute all of your false statements about the greatness of the American Empire.  Maybe you should try reading a few books in your spare time to educate yourself.  It's obvious reading isn't currently one of your favorite pastimes.   Give me another contender.   Do yourself a favor and start thinking for yourself for a change.  Your govt is and has been the most evil and violent force throughout the world for decades.  Grow up and start questioning the nationalistic mythology you've been spoon-fed since birth.   Nice comment.  Thanks.   the US does not 'target' civilians, only enemy combatants  Tell that to the people of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, My Lai, Baghdad, Wazirastan, Kabul, etc.   Blowback?   "It's easy to forget what life was like when the decision was made."  04/15/13: [Iraq Attacks Leave 36 Dead](http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content view=article id=452170 catid=37)   Establishment figures called it unfair that Rick Santorum won caucuses in states like Iowa and Minnesota but then Paul wound up controlling the delegation because his supporters organized better for the conventions that pick delegates.   Rand Paul wing  Seriously? When did Rand Paul get his own wing of the GOP?  Obviously the activists protesting the rule change are left over from the Ron Paul campaign and probably have nothing to do w/ Rand.  Nice "reporting."   Yes, Obama is innocent of any wrongdoing.  Bush and Cheney are making him order the drone strikes that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children.   I guess that's why I'm not a Republican.   From the Comments section:  She should have been executed for treason. Now the good Lord is doing the job.  Sorry, she is a traitor and as such should rot in hell - better yet: keep her in prison!  It's too bad we can't help her along her cancerous path with a little "Neck Stretch Therapy"... Treason should get what it deserves.  I do pity her, I would not wish cancer on anyone. However, she did deserve a firing squad.  And they wonder why no young people will join the Republican Party.   Most of the crowd was supportive of Rove, giving him a standing ovation as he walked on stage and applauding when university police officers escorted one protester out of the room.   I wonder if he would have been charged with a crime if he had run over a child in Afghanistan?   as Taliban begin spring offensive  So it's all the Taliban's fault?   Led by Sen. Rand Paul  Huh? A neoconservative leading the libertarian movement?    Yes, I'm sure it was the Hungarian troops who were responsible for the airstrike.   Is there something untrue in the headline?   Or Ronald Regan (Grenada), or George H.W. Bush (Panama, Iraq, Somalia) Bill Clinton (Haiti, Serbia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan) or George W. Bush (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia) or Barack Obama (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya).   USA! USA! USA! USA!   The military has done what it needs to do, sending a clear message that there will be severe consequences for compromising classified information. Now, it should accept Manning's guilty plea, **send him away for 20 years** and move on.   Obama did bomb the hell out of Libya, so what's your point?   We know that the men and women who wear the uniform of the U.S. military are the greatest fighting force and the **greatest force for good that the world has ever known**.  Even better than Jesus?   Nothing a good marketing campaign can't alter in a week or so.  Americans love to dominate and subjugate "inferior" peoples (for their own good, of course).  They don't tend to reflect too much on the trail of fetid corpses they leave behind in their wake.   You don't know Americans   That's probably what the Iraqis thought too.   He can say whatever he wants and I'm free to point out how anti-libertarian it is.   Maybe not, but he also doesn't scaremonger about its use.   I just don't want anyone to be fooled into thinking Rand Paul is a Ron Paul-style libertarian b/c he's not.   Taking a quote "out of context" by simply stating exactly what he said?  Once again, Rand Paul is trying to have it both ways:  He's pro-Drug War but against having pot smokers of certain age groups go to prison for violating laws he supports.  If pot is "a bad thing to do" and thus there s/b laws criminalizing its use, why shouldn't a 13 year old kid go to prison for using it just like someone who is 35?    Pot "takes away your incentive to work?"  That's a Newt Gingrich level of drug hysteria propaganda.  Truly pathetic.   Explain to me why smoking pot is "a bad thing to do."   Bush is a monster but this death goes on Obama's tally, not his.  If you're being honest, and not simply a partisan, then you would have to admit this.   This poor guy still doesn't understand why he lost the election.    Railway police said the soldiers were acting up on a Dongducheon-to-Incheon train on the night of Feb. 2  playing a boom box loudly while dancing and shouting  when a Korean woman in her early 20s asked them to quiet down.  That prompted the soldiers to verbally and physically harass the woman, while taking video and photos of her, police said. During the confrontation, one or more of the soldiers may have touched her breasts, they said.   [Jeb Bush: 'History will be kind to my brother'](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/10/17257330-jeb-bush-history-will-be-kind-to-my-brother?lite)   Thanks Gary.   That's the language of the DoD, not me.   "Remote Warfare Troops"   So The Surge didn't work?    He said dozens of families have already moved out of his home village of Deh Afghanan because of alleged mistreatment by the special forces and their Afghan partners. He alleged that both "beat people and make our lives miserable."  "This is no life for us or for our children," he said.   Earlier on Monday, police in Kabul said two civilian lorry drivers were killed and one wounded when they were fired on by an Isaf convoy.    He should have spent more time on the piece if he didn't want to be misunderstood.  Just my opinion.   But how do you "misspeak" when writing an op-ed for the Washington Post?  He could have ended the sentence with "no American should be killed by a drone," yet he continued.  Why?   I agree.   [N]o American should be killed by a drone **without first being charged with a crime.**  This language is intentional.  He's saying he's for execution by drone so long as due process is followed.     [N]o American should be killed by a drone **without first being charged with a crime**.  This language has to be intentional.  Clintonian way to be on both sides of the issue.   "I knew this was why I was doing it," said sculptor Greg Marra. "**It was divine inspiration**."  Well, at least Jesus approves.   $33 million seems a tad excessive.   Make sure you watch the video.   I guess it's a good thing then that the Soviet Union disintegrated two decades ago.   Afterward, his wife, Rebecca, told reporters the incident has made life awful for her family and nearly wrecked them financially.  She said she was proud of her husband, who now works as a firearms instructor, for standing up for himself. "We didn't do anything wrong. We don't have anything to apologize for," she said.   We're supposed to worship these guys, right?   Do you kiss your Mother with that mouth?  Try to learn how to debate w/out using gutter language every other sentence.   You *did* have another option: not voting.   You sound like Sean Hannity.   You seriously think I supported Mitt Romney?  He would have been a murderous monster, just like Obama.   One morning recently, a teenager named Bacha Zarina was collecting firewood on her family's small farm in eastern Afghanistan. About 30 yards away, as family members recall, two Taliban commanders stood outside a house.  A missile screamed down from the sky, killing the two men instantly. Two chunks of shrapnel flew at Bacha Zarina and lodged in her left side.  Her family raced her to the nearest hospital, a half-hour's drive away, but she died en route, an accidental victim of the rapidly escalating U.S.-led campaign of drone strikes in Afghanistan. **She was 14 or 15 years old.**  Yes, your hero kills children.   The use of armed drones is likely to accelerate as most of the 66,000 U.S. troops in the country are due to withdraw by the end of 2014. **The remotely piloted long-range aircraft, which kill targets with virtually no risk to American lives, carry an unmistakable attraction for military commanders.**   How do you know that?  Do you really think Obama would hesitate to order someone's death just because that person happens to be w/in the confines of U.S. territory?   Furst-Ramdohr says the group couldn't understand how the German people had been so easily led into supporting the Nazi Party and its ideology.  "They must have been able to tell how bad things were, it was ridiculous," she says   Drone strikes, President Barack Obamas signature tactic for killing suspected al-Qaida and other extremist fighters, have been very effective, said Graham. It's a weapon that needs to be used.   The "truths" we're taught to believe from birth - whether nationalistic, religious, or cultural - should be the ones treated with the greatest skepticism if we continue to embrace them in adulthood, precisely because the probability is so great that we've embraced them because we were trained to, or because our subjective influences led us to them, and not because we've rationally assessed them to be true.   Thats when it crystallized: Rand Paul and Hillary Clinton are very similar in that they are both very smart, unlikeable people who are not above unethical actions if they think it will get them what they want.    If Rand Paul persists on going demagogic on Hagel, he will have established beyond any serious doubt that regardless of who his father is, he is Bill Kristol and Jennifer Rubins boy.   Okay, you say. But todays war is entirely different: no front line, no end in sight.  So what? **Its the jihadists who decided to make the world a battlefield and to wage war in perpetuity. Until they abandon the field, what choice do we have but to carry the fight to them?**   We meet this morning in the eleventh hour ..., said Committee Chairman Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif. Now it appears that this self-inflicted wound is poised to cripple our military in just a few days.   Along with the civilians, four insurgents were killed   So that makes it right?   U.S. foreign policy is aggressive, reckless, belligerent, and meddling. We dont need a foreign policy that strikes a balance. We dont need a foreign policy that we can afford. We dont need a foreign policy that is like Reagans. We dont need a foreign policy that is less interventionist. We need a wholesale repudiation of the past century of an evil and murderous U.S. foreign policy.     Quote begins around 4:35 of the video.   Well said.   The only problem w/ your assertion is that I didn't write the headline.  If you had followed the link, you would have noticed that.   USA! USA! USA!   He didn't state in that clip that he would be the sole judge of whether an actual rape had occurred.  Have you ever read the newsletters?  The language in them is typical of what was being said by the Right after the LA riots and hardly "racist."  In fact, he has said on numerous occasions that he has some moral responsibility for what was published.  I am not a cult member.  If Ron Paul ever veered from his libertarian non-interventionist beliefs, I would abandon him immediately.  My guess is that you cannot say the same w/ respect to Barack Obama.   Thanks for posting the link.  Ron Paul is simply stating that there has to be some evidence of an actual (he uses the admittedly more clumsy word "honest") rape b/f he would *personally* agree with any measure to stave off a pregnancy.  He didn't say he would send in stormtroopers and put the hospital staff and woman in prison.  You're reading what you want to into his statement and not listening to what he actually said.   Thanks for the link.  I'll believe the quote when you post it.   What are you talking about?  How about you post a link to the comment you're referring to?   We're supposed to worship these guys, right?   The problem is that in American patriotism = support for endless war.   You noticed he didn't say, "Why do we have to pay *Israel*?"   That's a real article.  Follow the link.   I wonder who wrote Inhofe's speech for him?   Before he even made his opening statement, Mr. Hagel faced a blast of objections from the ranking Republican on the committee, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who told Mr. Hagel that he would not vote for him because of his position of **appeasing Americas adversaries.**   dangers to the economy of across-the-board budget reductions  Huh? So that money won't be spent elsewhere in more productive areas of the economy?   The US itself is the world's leading cyber-aggressor. A major purpose of this expansion is to strengthen the US's ability to destroy other nations with cyber-attacks.    Paul, who has not been coy about his interest in running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, perked up when the interviewer framed a question by saying, lets say you become President Paul at some point in the future.  I like the ring of that, Paul interjected.   So b/c women weren't allowed to kill Afghans and Iraqis, the male soldiers thought it was okay to rape them?   It is the responsibility of every citizen to protect the nation, Panetta said shortly before signing a new policy memorandum that directed the armed services to integrate women fully. Every citizen who can meet the qualifications of service should have this opportunity.    What a creepy totalitarian-like statement.  You can just imagine Josef Stalin saying the same thing.   USA! USA! USA!   Yes, there are U.S. troops on the ground and they've been there for [many years](http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-11-15-fearing-terror-threat-us-goes-back-to-basics-in-mali).   How original.  You're the first one to ever post that quote.   Democracy does suck.  Just look at its results: Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford, Nixon, Johnson...   Defense.gov only posts combat deaths.  They do post a report of suspected suicides every month but they do not list names even of confirmed suicides.   "For the life of me, I don't know why the hell people have to have assault weapons."  The why is he sending them to Syria, Mali, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.?   Bin Laden wasn't defeated by superheroes zooming down from the sky; he was defeated by ordinary Americans who fought bravely even as they sometimes crossed moral lines, who labored greatly and intently, who gave all of themselves in both victory and defeat, in life and in death, for the defense of this nation.  USA! USA! USA!   The US is not committed to spreading democracy and freedom in the world. "Freedom" and "democracy" are concepts it exploits to undermine regimes that refuse to serve its interests.   Then you're just a partisan who excuses and justifies murder b/c it's done by your guy.   What real difference does it make whether it's happened once or multiple times?  Obama ordered an innocent American to be killed.  He can do it again whenever he wants.   Then what did you vote for? Peace and non-violence?   You mean like the [16-yr old Denver born American](http://www.businessinsider.com/alwaki-son-yemen-16-drone-2012-10) he murdered in Yemen?   Read the piece.  He rips Romney for being a murderous warmonger also.   You need to think of Obama ordering a drone strike on your wife or husband, or your lover, or your children -- or you. Imagine it in every detail. Then tell me how "accepting" you are of this monster. Then tell me how you justify having voted for him, if you did.   How about we [disarm Obama](http://news.yahoo.com/drone-attack-pakistan-kills-least-10-intelligence-sources-082455837.html)?   "Well sadly, I think I'd rather open a business in [the United Kingdom] than the U.S.," he says. "The U.S. isit's a minefield. Open a business in California? You must be joking. The lawyers, the taxespeople talk about high taxes here. Well, yes they are high, but in America, in the places you might really want to open a businessNew York, L.A.you've got state taxes, city taxes, state income taxes, city income taxesyou add that lot up, you're paying more over there than here."   The Department of Defense contends that anti-suicide programs installed throughout the armed services soon will curb military suicides  and that such initiatives already have helped douse mental-health stigmas.   Then maybe we should leave.   If they are non combatant troops  I think you're being a bit naive to believe that.   The withdrawal plan always included leaving some troops in Afghanistan  Then it was never a "withdrawal" plan.  It was a try to leave the U.S. military in Afghanistan plan.  Also, don't you think 10 years is enough time to train the security forces?   Care to explain your comment?   Perhaps an easier, less violent solution would be to end America's pointless, unwinnable wars.  What do you think?    Please explain.  Are you denying Obama is responsible for these deaths?  If so, why?   You seem like the angry one, not me.   I think the better question would be: How much will it help the rest of the world?   No, I mean like you.   Nobody likes a narc.   "surgically removing insurgent leaders"  Gotta love those military euphemisms.  Sounds so clean and precise.   Seems like he could find a better stress-relieving activity...   Pot being grown in Bong County?   That 90% figure is ridiculous.  The majority of Taliban are simply Afghan citizens who want the U.S. out of their country.  They are fighting just like you would if, say, China was occupying America and killing your friends and family.  You killed multiple human beings for no justifiable reason, that makes you and your comrades mass murderers.  A govt-issued costume doesn't exempt you from the laws of morality.  You should check out www.ivaw.org to get a different perspective from fellow veterans.  Or, just peruse antiwar.com or reddit.com/endlesswar on a daily basis to read arguments from the other side.  Good luck.   In case you weren't aware, bin Laden was found in Pakistan, not Afghanistan.   We are already defeated b/c this war could never be won.  If it makes you feel better to believe that you were part of some glorious military victory against a bunch of pre-industrial third-world tribesmen, then...whatever.   You endanger my freedom.  You do nothing to enhance it.  You have fouled the air I breath with the smell of a miles-long trail of dead corpses.  If you think otherwise, then you are simply brainwashed and delusional.    That's war propaganda.  Nothing else.  We won't know the true extent of the damage inflicted on the Afghan people until our army withdraws in defeat.   You've "accomplished" nothing other than destroying millions of lives.  If it helps your psychological balance to think that you have, then so be it.  Every man I killed, if given the opportunity to come to America, would have comitted acts far worse than the tragedy in Connecticut.  And you're calling me ignorant?  You're just spouting a warmonger talking points.  Yeah, you killed those people so women could learn to read.  If you really believe that bullshit, then you probably still believe in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.  Jesus, grow up.   If anything, you put my life in danger.  You keep no one safe by invading countries and killing people who don't threaten us.   You participated in an unjust, unconstitutional war against a nation that never committed any violent act against America.  You can't use self-defense as an excuse b/c you never should have been in Afghanistan to begin with.  Every person you killed was an act of murder.  You're no different morally from the Newtown killer or any other mass murderer.  To me, it's actually frightening that you and your comrades sleep well at night after committing such horrifying acts.  I guess that's what psychologists refer to as psychic numbing.   Is that what you mean when you say you're "protecting our freedom?"   No Afghan ever threatened this country.  You *murdered* Afghans for absolutely no reason**.  That's something you'll have to live with for the rest of your life.  **Sorry, just b/c you were wearing a sand-colored camoflauged uniform you don't get an immorality pass.  The Ten Commandments don't have a list of exceptions.     It's a different issue  Please explain the moral difference.   Obama's killed a helluva lot more people than Bales.  Will they seek the death penalty for him also?   In a free society, you would be able to buy a rocket launcher.  And if you never used it to harm others, I would have no problem with that.   I'm an anarcho-capitalist, not a leftist anarchist.  Panetta has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people as head of the CIA and now as Secretary of War.  Stop supporting a mass murderer.   Actually, yes I am an anarchist.  And Leon Panetta is the war chief.  Nothing he does is "defense" related.   Although they functioned as members of Petraeuss staff, they said they did not want to be paid. There are actual patriots in the world, Fred **Kagan said. It was very important to me not to be seen to be profiting from the war.**   The Kagans said they continued to receive salaries from their think tanks while in Afghanistan. **Kim Kagans institute is funded in part by large defense contractors.**   At the August 2011 dinner honoring Petraeus, Kagan thanked executives from two defense contractors who sit on her institutes corporate council, DynCorp International and CACI International. The event was sponsored by General Dynamics. All three firms have business interests in the Afghan war.   No one likes a snitch.   I bet he gets more time than [Sgt. Robert Bales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bales).   The children of north-west Pakistan, it seems, are not like our children. They have no names, no pictures, no memorials of candles and flowers and teddy bears. They belong to the other: to the non-human world of bugs and grass and tissue.   What difference does it make WHO planted the landmine?  The reason it's there is b/c the U.S. military invaded and destroyed Afghanistan.  Obama could have ended this atrocity on the day he became president and removed any incentive to plant IEDs.  And these girls would in all likelihood still be alive.   I'm blaming him for accelerating a war that should have ended the day he became president.  In case you're unaware, Obama is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya, etc.  His trail of death and horrific carnage far surpasses the evil deeds perpetuated by all of these lunatic child killers combined.  If you think that what Obama does on a daily basis is any different morally from what was done in Connecticut or Aurora then you're not being honest with yourself.   Bush should. Mitt never became president and thus had no opportunity to perpetuate an aggressive war against innocent people.   Great answer.  Thanks.   What's the difference?   As expected, after it opened it was elbow to elbow, the history says. The comfort women ... had some resistance to selling themselves to men who just yesterday were the enemy, and because of differences in language and race, there were a great deal of apprehensions at first. But they were paid highly, and they gradually came to accept their work peacefully.   I wonder if he weeps over the children HE kills every day in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia?   You liberals is so smart.   Yes, killing thousands of innocent people in aggressive, undeclared wars is certainly no war crime.    Great comment.  Thanks.   I suspect he isn't.   It's not news, but it does seem to be the [neocon talking point of the day](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-why-was-there-war-in-gaza/2012/11/22/c77582e8-3412-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html?hpid=z2).   So only tax increases, not spending cuts, will solve the debt problem?   If an American citizen really wants to advocate for neutrality on the ground that both sides are equally horrible and they're sick of the whole conflict and wish it would all just go away, then the place to begin with that advocacy is US government policy which, as unpleasant as it might be to face, has long been, and remains more than ever, a key force that drives the bloodshed.   What's wrong with being "anti-war"?   When we met with Karzais staff it was clear that the Afghans are tired of being treated like servants in their own country, Tina Foster said. Symbolic gestures are not going to cut it anymore. They want the keys to the prison, and the ability to determine the fates of the prisoners held there.    Rand Paul will be far more of a force in the Republican Party in the coming years than his father ever was. Thats a problem for conservatives who hope the GOP remains a bulwark of common sense about national defense and foreign policy. It will also mean that one of the partys most prominent spokesmen will not be someone who will be viewed as reliably pro-Israel.   However respectfully the views of friends are considered, **the ultimate decision over peace or war must remain in the hands of the president.**  I thought Congress was supposed to have a say, right?   No, Rush has often used that term when referring to Ron Paul.   I am going to be honest with you dad. I have killed a lot of men and children. Some that didnt even do anything for me to kill them. Also some that begged for mercy. I have a problem. I think I got addicted to killing people. I could kill someone go to sleep wake up and forget that it ever happened. It got normal for me to be that way. I never wanted to be this way. I just took my job way to serious. I took things to the extreme. Anyone can tell you that I changed. It is like being a completely different person.   I didn't imply that nor ever would.   Your hero kills innocent men, women and children.  Grow up and deal with it.   [A Global Force For Good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3wtUCPWmeI)   American politicians never tire of extolling the virtues of the US military, which is now commonly hailed as "the finest fighting force in the history of the world." This claim appears grotesquely at odds with reality.   "Mistakes" like killing Afghan children every day for 3 and 1/2 years?   One of the primary reasons war - especially protracted war - is so destructive is not merely that it kills the populations at whom it is aimed, but it also radically degrades the character of the citizenry that wages it.    So what's your Dad wrong about, Rand?   The first step should be to impose an immediate curfew on all US military personnel, but the only real solution is the removal of all US bases from Okinawa prefecture. As long as they remain here, these crimes will continue," said Miyoko Ashimine, the member of a local womens rights group who advises female victims of sexual crime.   Sorry, that should have been Sailor, not GI.   Dr. Ron Paul was the last chance for the GOP to reform, redefine and renew itself. Paul was sidelined and ignored. As a result, Republicans may be marching towards irrelevance and unimportance.    Perpetual War = Perpetual Employment   Sorry   So horrific is the human suffering brought about by such sanctions regimes that some are beginning to argue that killing Iranians with an air attack would be more humane.  	199

I don't think that using a game engine necessarily means you will end up with a better game, but at least it allows you to theoretically devote more time and resources to other parts of the game, like story, level design, etc.  Maybe companies just drop the ball sometimes because they are afraid to take risks and try to appeal to the lowest common denominator?

And why is the burden of proof on the people with concerns to prove that there may be problems.

There are numerous well-documented studies which provide evidence of fluorides harmful effects on the human body and brain.  You can find a complete compilation of these studies at: http://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-dangers/health/index.aspx  Ill give a summary of the most important findings:  **Brain Damage**  it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain. SOURCE: National Research Council. (2006). Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards. National Academies Press, Washington D.C. p 187.  Studies in animals and human populations suggest that fluoride exposure, at levels that are experienced by a significant proportion of the population whose drinking water is fluoridated, may have adverse impacts on the developing brain. Though no final conclusions may be reached from available data, the findings are provocative and of significant public health concern.  SOURCE: Schettler T, et al. (2000). Known and suspected developmental neurotoxicants. pp. 90-92. In: In Harms Way - Toxic Threats to Child Development. Greater Boston Physicians for Social Responsibility: Cambridge, MA. (See report)  As of now, there are 18 human studies indicating that fluoride exposure is associated with lower IQs in children.  This is after controlling for other facturs which are associated with differences in IQ such as lead exposure and family income.  Some excepts:  These negative correlations between IQ and urinary As and between IQ and urinary fluoride indicate that exposure to high levels of As or fluoride, or both, could affect childrens intelligence... This study indicates that exposure to fluoride in drinking water is associated with neurotoxic effects in children. SOURCE: Wang SX, et al. (2007). Arsenic and fluoride exposure in drinking water: children's IQ and growth in Shanyin county, Shanxi province, China. Environmental Health Perspectives 115(4):643-7.

Effects of coal burning related endemic fluorosis on body development and intelligence levels of children. Journal of Applied Clinical Pediatrics 20(9): 897-898.  **Cancer**  There are many in-vitro laboratory studies which show that fluroide is a mutagenic compound, meaning it causes changes in DNA.  Many mutagenics are also carcinogenic.  One study even found that primates are more sensitive to the mutagenic effects than rats. See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679201?dopt=Abstract  Other findings:  As cells were exposed to higher doses of fluoride, the percentage of L-02 cells with DNA damage increased. This result is consistent with other studies... Therefore, considereing previous studies, we think that fluoride can cause lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis, and that there is a positive relationship among these changes. SOURCE: Wang AG, et al. (2004). Effects of fluoride on lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis in human embryo hepatocytes. Biomedical and Environmental Sciences 17: 217-22.  **Bone Fractures and Bone Disease**  There is a well-known arthritic bone disease known as Skeletal fluorosis caused by excessive fluoride intake. Images: warning! may disturb you    Many studies show that fluoride weakens bones:  In A/J strain, we found significant decreases in stiffness with increasing fluoride dose treatment. There was a significant difference between the treatment group 0 ppm and 100 ppm... In the A/J strain, there was a decrease in ultimate load with increasing fluoride dose treatment, with significant differences between the treatment group 0 ppm and the treatment group 100 ppm (p=0.017).

Combined effects of diets with reduced calcium and phosphate and increased fluoride intake on vertebral bone strength and histology in rats. Calcified Tissue International 69: 51-57.  These are just some of the documented health-impairments associated with ingesting fluoride.  Others include: **Dental Fluorosis** (yellowingof the teeth due to too much fluoride).

Also, don't underestimate the power of children to get their way with parents who don't want to be the bad guy.  Yes, they shouldn't give in but it's not always easy, and why should they have to fight against mega corps for the minds and health of their kids?   It's not.   It doesn't.

Satoshi is a male, Japanese name, whose meaning is variously given as "wise", "clear-thinking", "quick-witted"   Well, you see, complexity is subjective, that's the nature of emergence. What's complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddit's userbase is quite diverse, although there seems to be evidence of an over-representation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors. Secondly, do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? It's through using "copypastas" and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills. And lastly, most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be 100% accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex inter-dependent systems, but your "copypastas" do not facilitate in that endeavor. If even one of these criticisms is valid, your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises I've highlighted. The social commentary you wish "copypastas" to exhibit might seem sensible, maybe even profound to you, but they're just as bad, if not worse than the additions reactiongifs, pun chains or novelty accounts bring to the table. Please consider this seriously, and don't immediately fall back on your preconceived notions without reexamining their validity, at least in a cursory manner after I've presented you with this new evidence you really should take seriously.   Well, you see, complexity is subjective, that's the nature of emergence. What's complex for a child like you is often trivial or routine for a scientist like me. Reddit's userbase is quite diverse, although there seems to be evidence of an over-representation of individuals exhibiting childish behaviors. Secondly, do you really think this situation has been has been oversimplified? It's through using "copypastas" and other hasty generalizations you try to cram each individual scenario with its particularities into a formulaic mold. I hypothesize you require this simplification because of the state of your mental faculties and reasoning skills. And lastly, most of the time your simplifications do not aid in understanding new facets of the subject matter. Characterizations that might not be 100% accurate can act as useful models for understanding overarching facets of complex inter-dependent systems, but your "copypastas" do not facilitate in that endeavor. If even one of these criticisms is valid, your point is moot as it depends unilaterally on all the three premises I've highlighted.

Edit: Thanks for the gold!   Hell, I'm subscribed to /r/Bitcoin and I didn't know most of this stuff about mtgox.   crashed the train.   OK.. But why do they need to take an entire city just to protect a single port?   If you squint your eyes a little it makes it look like you are  translucent. Ghost! Ghoooost!   Yes, I think if the gov knows about ET life and is withholding such information, it's probably at a higher security level than the people being trained by NSA to do social engineering.   The UFO pictures are on pages 35-37 of [the document](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/), right in between a Whole Foods sign and a slide maybe talking about advancing technology. We can only speculate about what the pictures were meant to illustrate.   Kucinich was good too, but unfortunately the media assassinated him.   The solution to all of this is to reorganize society from the ground up. Hyper-local, and online communities with their own internal organization, which can in turn organize into meta-communities like cells of a body.  Community gardens, new forms of communes that embrace the good side of technology.  Any way that we can help each other become self-sufficient.  The more we do this the less we will rely on the status-quo system.  We will cease paying taxes.  No one will elect to go to war.  This is the way out.   *I will not downvote or deride others for challenging my assertions or asking for additional evidence.  Instead I will see it as an opportunity to both educate, and reevaluate my own assumptions.  Ultimately, everyone will come away from the discussion more informed, and hopefully one step closer to Truth.*  *I will actively combat my own confirmation bias by deliberately seeking viewpoints different than my own.  I will critically evaluate all evidence presented, whether it confirms or challenges my current beliefs.  For I understand that there are no "sides".  Only what is true and what is untrue.*  *I will humble myself enough to admit when I am wrong.  There is no shame in changing my mind in light of new information.  My goal is not only to guide others towards realization, but also myself.*  *The process of investigating with dedication and integrity will serve to make all of us ever-more informed, ever-more discerning, and always moving towards the Truth.*   I hear ya!  I know that the last thing that someone who is having a hard time wants her hear is that it's their "fault" or anything like that.  I certainly don't want to imply that anyone deserves to be in pain and don't think problems just go away by snapping your fingers.  However, I do believe that changing your attitude towards believing in yourself and focusing on the positive aspects of your life is often prerequisite for fixing those problems.  You can be totally and completely right about how much crap has come your way, but if that's all you think and talk about, it really isn't going to get any better.  We've got to keep focused on that glimmer of hope, the 5% that is working, until it gets bigger and bigger.  It's interesting you mention science, because I feel like the completely materialistic (meaning concerning the material world) and "objective" world view we've adopted is actually an obstacle for many people to come out of the view that the world sucks.  Things are rarely so cut and dry as a laboratory and subjective experience is much more pertinent to our lives.  I know this is a whole philosophical can of worms.  Also, I disagree that worrying really ever serves a useful purpose.  We can certainly address things that come up without getting bogged down in worst-case scenarios.  Like John Lennon said "There are no problems, only solutions!"  You're totally right about that last point! The best thing you can do is to just be happy and help others be happy too! =)  EDIT: Oh, and for the record. I used to be extremely depressed for many years.  Nothing changed about my life except my philosophy and my attitude.  I'm speaking from my personal experience.   Also, that the pyramids were tombs. In fact, no mummies have ever been found inside a pyramid.   Seriously.  Just sell your game. Don't try to trick people into thinking it's "free" when it's not.  Consumers need to also learn that making games takes time and energy and the creators deserve to be compensated.   Here's the trouble with this question.  Most of the big lies are so ingrained in people's minds, in fact the way we think, that is nearly impossible to distinguish them as lies.  The one that comes to my mind is the idea that life sucks or is really hard.  I hear this all the time from people who feel like they've had it rough.  It's almost always a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Yes we have problems here on Earth, but the attitude with which we approach these problems makes all the difference.  Unlearn the lie that life is hard, and you'll find it's actually really easy and fun!   Zero-point energy or some other free energy production device.      Please provide evidence that BipolarBear0 did anything that resembles a "voter brigade", and isn't telling the truth when he says that he only posted the racists posts to this subreddit and watched them get upvoted.  OP mentions cross posting on IRC. Care to elaborate on that point and/or show some evidence? Thank you.  EDIT: After some more sleuthing I found [this]( http://i.imgur.com/9Iz12h2.png): Originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ywspe/new_snowden_doc_reveals_how_gchqnsa_use_the/cfqxja1)   That was my point.   According to the article they didn't even win the jackpot: Mark Mattioli won $100,000 on 9/16/11. Mark Mattioli won $50,000 on 12/20/13.  It's really not that ridiculous.  This piece of "evidence" however, is.   In other words, denotation and connotation?

Ok, we know it is happening. Let's talk about how we can fight back.  There is no possible way systematically defaming political dissidents threw libel, fraud, and "false flag" attacks can be legally justified.  Somehow this should end up in the Supreme Court.  Of course we shouldn't rely on that corrupt bunch to stop this, but a legal fight would certainly bring it to the public's attention.  Right now they are just doing this in the shadows.  We need to force them to defend what they are doing so it can be met with the scrutiny it deserves.  This is just one idea. Let's hear some strategies for subverting the subversion of free discourse on the internet!   With 12,808 upvotes, why are the views on this video so low? (426 as of the time of this posting).

I just posted a link to [Netflix to pay Comcast for smoother online video] (http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-ct-netflix-comcast-20140224,0,1476262.story#ixzz2uDnilHN1)  We'll see what happens.      We do not know the gender of OP.   Ok, maybe that too.   Except that there are actually emotions which are expressed nearly universally across animal species.  For instance, animals (including humans) will tighten the muscles around their eyes to express anger.  [Charles Darwin wrote about the subject.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals)  My point is that we often wrongly conclude that humans are the only animals that can feel or think and this is why we are surprised when we see animals looking "human".   Yeah, if he were trying to learn to stutter, that's what he would need.   I think what you call "humanlike" is actually being a sentient being. Welcome to the Animal Kingdom!   now why wouldn't a sentient being look sentient?   I'll just put this right here: https://projectmeshnet.org/   Grow your own. DIY.   It's sad to watch people use the struggles of others as an excuse for their own apathy.   I think she did just  fine.  Keep in mind she's not only giving a speech in front of the whole school but she is saying things that are very contentious and will likely earn her the scorn of the "authorities".  It's very brave.   Well let's see, I'll play the skeptic here: The voters appoint them on election day.   What rules specifically are your objecting to?   I agree with your sentiment, but can you flush out your claim that the rulers are "Self-appointed".   That's not true according to Wikipedia and other sources I've seen. Obama: 65,915,796 vs Romney: 60,933,500.  I know that's not your point though.   Reddit.         Bingo.   It's nearly impossible to not get enough protein by eating a variety of foods.  Most Americans get too much protein.   Seriously, I bet almost all mammals do this.  The list is so short because we misinterpret their behavior.   I don't think children should be forced to eat meat if they don't want it.  Also you said "other proteins", fruits, vegetables, and grains all have protein.. EDIT: changed "pasta" to PROTEIN. still waking up here :-P   This should be higher up.   You are absolutely right.  It's more important to care about SOMETHING and actually do something about it then about what you care about specifically.   He obviously didn't mean literally destroying the planet.   By this logic we should outlaw public drinking fountains, phones, and benches.   I'm guessing because it works by selecting links rather than typing in text.  It's more like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book than traditional IF.   From comments on the article:  There are 75 community gardens on about 23 acres of land scattered throughout the city of Seattle, serving roughly 4500 gardeners. These plots, called p-patches, are open to the public and neither fenced nor guarded. Homeless people often camp next to our patch, and they've never taken anything from the garden to my knowledge (though it's so abundant that a bit of pilferage would be hard to detect). In general, theft from Seattle gardens is very rare, so I would expect the same to be true of the Beacon Food Forest. I'm sure the city will post signs clearly stating that taking more than a single family can consume or selling produce is forbidden. You'd be very surprised how law-abiding people are here.   Can someone walk me through this little drama from the beginning?   I'm really so very grateful that someone found my post amusing and/or useful.  Sometimes life can be a scary thing and to know that one little action can brighten the world is very heartwarming.  You have really inspired me upvoter!  I promise to continue to share my wit and insight with the world for the betterment of all humankind!  This is my creed!  I humbly accept this task that has been bestowed upon me.  I will not cower and I will not retreat.  It is a bright new day on the internet!  Thank you all!!   I actually had this experience while on Ayahuasca.  It was very scary indeed and I was thinking "what a dumb way to die! forgetting how to inhale."  Of course I started breathing again.  The shaman also assured me that my body would not do that to me and I would inevitably find my breath again.  I guess the best thing to do is to remember this, you will start breathing again. Remain calm.  This is part of the wisdom of the experience.   Yes, but it must be from another man.   So now that the US gov has confiscated this we are all getting free health care for 12 years right?   What is reddit's obsession with abusive girlfriends?   I'm looking into making my first IF and I'm deciding which engine would be best to use.  Adrift? Inform? Something else?  Anyone have experience with more than one and can tell how they compare?  Is one more geared towards programmers than another? Etc.   Why the hostility at someone calling attention to wealth disparity?   Just because there are two possible outcomes to something doesn't mean they are equally likely.  Your chance of picking the right door out of a thousand is .1%  The chance of it being the wrong door is the inverse of that (100 - .1)%.  Here's another way to put it: Today you can either die or not die.  Is the chance that you will die today 50/50?  Is the chance that will die on  any day that is not today 50/50?   I'm buying CandySwipe just to support this guy.   [i made this](http://imgur.com/xrJbUHt)   Things can always be worse, yes.  They can also always be better.   I stand corrected.

 He's stupid, he's short, he's ugly.  He will not do well in primaries.  Americans don't like short and ugly although they tolerate stupid to a frightening degree.  Wisconsinites do seem to favor ignorant dropouts, though.  Rep. Reid Ribble is a bible school dropout and Walker just couldn't cut it in college.  These men have no education, no brains, and no morals. They are Koch brother whores.       Walker is the puppet of the Koch brothers who are using Wisconsin as the testing ground state for their world/nation destroying policies.   One of my favorite Mozart compositions.  Also love Pollini and Bhm in K.488.   Vier letzte Lieder - 4 Last Songs.  There are many great recordings: Anneliese Rothenberger, Andr Previn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n77jQCrjA6M Martina Arroyo, Gnter Wand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0epM71y1l8M Olga Peretyatko, Dmitri Bliss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QvFynvO7yc    The live broadcasts of Tristan with Flagstad and Melchior at the Met, from 1935 to 1941, are the most brilliantly sung, imo.  Also immortal are the live Beecham and Reiner recordings from 1936 and 1937.    There are some phenomenally sung/conducted Meistersingers from Knappertsbusch (3 available) and a studio recording from Kubelik with Sandor Konya's gorgeous, Italianate Walther and Gundala Janowitz's luminous Eva.    The 1955 live stereo Ring from Keilberth at Bayreuth is first rate.  It was suppressed until recently because of preferential treatment of Solti's studio recording (with less excellent singing, imo).  I actually like the Keilberth 1953 Ring even better.    There is a live Tannhuser from Leinsdorf with Melchior and Flagstad that is one of the greatest live opera recordings I've ever heard.  I prefer Golden Age Wagnerian singing/conducting. Many of these recordings are available on YouTube.   Ljuba Welitsch's Salome was unforgettable.  Here she is with Fritz Reiner and Hans Hotter, one of the greatest Wotans.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SJMlNDFS0Q She recorded the final scene with Reiner in 1949 - hair raising: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BReBIkkExM      All the more reason to condemn him and call him out on his repressive, backward attitude.   Rand Paul is anti-abortion. Period.     It's called the lieto  fine, a tradition in opera buffa to conclude with a joyful ending.   Whatever he calls himself, his position on women's rights is wrong.  	12

 Just came back in from the Point Reyes into Novato. Things are getting hairy out there, for sure. South Beach at the point was closed, ranger at North Beach said he's about to just close the roads at the gate to the point and go home. Some poor group of people has to sleep out at the light house during this.   Wind coming back was pretty amazing. Few times coming over crests on the road the wind put my bike into the oncoming traffic lane. If you're in West Marin, or heading there, tuck yourself's in, it's getting ramped up.   Ribeye's? I thought you guys only grilled Tri Tip out here. I was starting to worry that Californians didn't realize that the rest of the cow could be  eaten too.   In Novato and the winds are 15mph, between gusts. Still raining pretty good here. Come visit beautiful Marin.   [Never forget](https://imgflip.com/i/f6km8)   Raspberry PI, NOIR Camera, Wifi Dongle, a little bit of Python and some bash. Do it.   None at all? Not even one letter?   But what if they inconvenienced them so much that they convenienced them into getting rear ended when they came to a stop because of the protests by a semi-truck, and the lady that got rear-ended was one of the police officers daughters and he had to run over to her car and she was dying and gasping her last breath and she said to him, "Dad, whatever you do, don't gaawkwkkkkchlll hhhhhhhhhhh..." And he's all like, "DON'T WHATTTTT!!!!!!!  WHY, GOD, WHYYYYYY!!!!!" And he goes crazy and starts roundhouse kicking protesters in their faces and one of them is a kung-fu master because he's been training in a dojo that said they trained Bruce Lee and he round house kicks the cop back and it turns into a roundhouse kick fight and they're roundhousing left and right and all up and down University and then all of a sudden they're break dance fighting and than the cop does the hammer time move and drop kicks Bruce Leroy out the park and than the cop picks up a microphone out of nowhere and starts signing "New YORRKKKK, NEW YOOOORRRKKKK!!!!!" and some Giants fan come out of nowhere and snatches the microphone from him and than he gets round housed to the face and his face is all bloody and ugly and the cop is all like "HA, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET" and the bloody-faced guy is jamming tampons up his nose and eating razor blades and the cop places him under arrest, but it's really not under arrest it's under a moving car and than out of nowhere Wonder Woman show's up but she lands her invisible jet on the people in the street doing their peaceful protest and now it's a bloody wonder mess with razor blades and tampons all over the place and no one can get through to anywhere and the world explodes. The End.   What about Jesus? Would you like to discuss Jesus for a bit?   I think I get right you're angling at.  [This should sort of work, or at least get you started.](http://i.imgur.com/YpHJmTn.png) You can't see it in the screenshot, but the false case is exactly the reverse of the true case. On true, we decrement, on false we increment. And make sure you're AND'ing the array, not OR'ing it.  Obviously the while loop in this never stops, so you'd need to define some sort of stop condition. One way I would do it would be by removing one element of the historical array each time you reverse directions. Once you're down to one element left, you know you're at the peak. For your data you'd obviously want to play with the size of the historical array for tuning purposes.   Once you go from simulation to implementation than you'd replace the array and index array with an actual call to make the photo diode measurement, and the increment/decrement would be used to adjust the position of your light.   So, to be clear, you're shining a light at a light dependent voltage source from different locations, and you'd like to find the point at which the resistance (position) is equal to some nominal voltage (perfect light)?   Just re-phrasing it so I understand the goal. If that's right, I've got some ideas.   I know that the people out doing this horrible stuff (this, the meatballs, that ass that covered the children's jungle gym with razor blades, etc...) are doing it late at night or early in the morning, and I'm unlikely to ever happen upon it. But seriously, god help them if I ever do. The sick individuals that derive joy from this kind of malicious behavior (with planning and forethought, at that) deserve a beating.    Same thing happened to me like a week ago. Check my post history, you'll find the guy who definitely confirms that there is no possible way that this could be happening to more than one person in a similar time period.   Holy hell that looks intense.    Came to the comments to find the shop. Disappointed that it wasn't in San Francisco and now I can't go give them my next ink business.

We'll focus on enjoying the beauty of the island than and take-in the Hawaiian food for lunch.   Thanks.   My family and I (mid-30's mom and dad, 18 year old son and a 1 year old daughter) are visiting the big island of Hawaii on the Kona side and wanted to do something as close to a traditional Hawaiian dinner as possible. We read all the luau reviews and after looking at it all and most locals replies it seems like something we do not want to do because of the cheesiness of it. Can someone recommend someplace sort of traditional Hawaiian that doesn't have the touristy, cheesy feel of a luau?   Woah, I just got to Kona yesterday too. Enjoy yourself.

How bad has this world gotten where my over-the-top sarcastic comments are taken as something that a human being would actually say.   Maybe they were implying that things that were on fire were made out of weed. Maybe, the real implication was that the resident's of Ferguson have for years been building structures and vehicles out of weed to cover their giant drug sales and transport syndicate. Maybe CNN was actually revealing the truth behind the city government-run drug mafia and that city councilman was upset that the truth was getting out, hence the 'Fuck CNN' comment.    Oh god.

Didn't have time to watch the whole thing but my heart was pounding from that first match.    The downside of the timing primitive is that it stops the thread. Nothing else is being done while that wait is there. So, for five minutes, nothing happens. However, in addition to that, the Wait primitive occurs either before or after the rest of the code in your loop, depending on how you have things written, which means your loop timing is actually however long it takes to execute your code, plus five minutes.   I think what you want is something like this.   [Code](http://i.imgur.com/zTebih0.png)  The loop is iterating with a 50ms wait, however, it's usually only executing the False case and whatever other code you have in the loop. Once the current timestamp minus the original timestamp is equal to or greater than 600 (the number of seconds in five minutes) than execute your code in the True case. In the True case, make sure you pass the current timestamp into the shift register.    Pull over. Burn bike to the ground. Move to new country.   I think his point is that he did go through it without going to an online community for help, hence the reason why he can't sympathize.    Have an upvote.    I've worked in software QA before. It was neither vital or important. It was thankless and painful. The last thing high-paid devs (and their even higher paid bosses,) want is some QA jerk telling them something is wrong with their last source push. The company I worked for did QA because their customer base thought it was important that they did it, not because it was vital or important in the eyes of the all-knowing software team. If they had their way, the upper muckity-mucks would've rather fired us and used the money to add a sushi chef to the onsite cafeteria.    But it was REALLY hard.    You've been very helpful.

Or, his wife has the handwriting of a six year old.   Marin. Work remotely. Drink wine and feel better than everyone else all day.   First thing I taught my daughter is that the safe pass is the responsibility of the passer. That applies on the slopes or on the track. However, I also made sure to keep an eye on what was going on around her too while teaching her, especially on busy slopes.    This reply is bullshit. You train kids by watching them. Not by allowing them to ski cross slope, behind you, without looking at anything that's going on around you. The snowboarder was already slowing down and paying attention to not running over the kid on his left, whom he was going barely faster than. When he reaches over to make sure they don't collide, the kid is still in front of his dad. As soon as he turns forward he immediately throws up an arm to go to cut but it's too late. What occurred was an accident, but an accident that could've been avoided had the father been paying attention to his young and inexperienced skier.   Edit: Watch it again, you can see he's sideways when he hits the kid and began stopping as soon as he could. It wasn't a speed issue at all. It was a "I couldn't have seen him issue." Keep an eye on your kids on the slopes. I do when me and mine go out, it's the responsible thing to do as a parent.   Kids don't pay attention, that shit happens. However, the father who was holding him, than allowed him to ski cross slope behind him, out of his line of sight, without looking up slope to see what was coming at them is completely, 100% at fault. Sometimes I see videos like this and I try to read both sides of the situation and say, well, it could've been this or that. This was a clear cut case, that dad was a dick. To make the situation even worse, he totally over reacted, causing even more emotion to be stirred up.    Good to see the internet getting won so early this week.   I love it when people say this kind of stuff. They think they know everything but are really just tagging along on the karma train.    Krokodil  I don't know, I think World War era Russian political magazines are cool.     Couldn't help myself from laughing like mad when they drove up on the sidewalk.   This gentleman exercised his rights. He ended up injured and in a jail cell. I think there's a difference between exercising your rights civilly after the fact and just being obstinate to prove a point. You may be right in either case, but one way is definitely more self-destructive. I'm definitely not siding with the police in this case. However, had the rider pulled over and acted in a civil manner he may have had a chance to publish this youtube video that didn't involve his arrest. The thing to realize here is that in either case, the cops are going to get off scott-free. So, do they walk away with you getting injuries and jail time, or do you both get to walk away?   Even if the last word of this post was missing I would've asked if this happened in Topeka.    Mother fuckers with a hand print on the side of their emo fucking faces, that's who.   I've always thought the same thing. My workaround has been to use VIPM to create a package and deploy it with the installer. Than you get your error code file deployed to the right place.    I thought /s closed out a strikethrough, my bad. And I don't even have a beard. Now I have to have a beard and friends to play video games, WTF??? /s   Not into the sarcasm, huh.    People pay tens of thousands of dollars for cars. Recalls still happen. Not to mention that car ownership is fraught with micro transactions, and people still go out and pre-order the fanciest models before they're available.    Must be nice to have all those friends. Thanks for rubbing it in.   Reproduce real-life in our video games. Today I started a kerbal program to put a lander on an asteroid. Only lost 30 kerbals so far, so there's that.   Oh, gotcha. I only play it for the SP. At my age, getting pwned get's old.   I believe they're working hand in hand with Mono project members to make it happen. Says so in the article. Sorry.   Hoping that this was the top comment.   Everyone keeps saying that. I've played through CE and Halo 2 without any issues or weird glitches.   Is this real? Since when did I have to have friends to play fucking video games? The reason I play video games is because I don't have friends.   Motorcycle game where you fail 100s of times???   You're talking about Battletoads, right?   Microtransaction source? Or are we just going with past Ubi-tude?   And you're enjoying Halo now?   And you're enjoying Halo now?   Right, because you know when you go to play it you'll get stuffed on a server where the only thing to be heard from anyone's mic's is the sound of them coughing or their babies crying in the background.   I met one guy, once, whom I had good teamwork with over the mic. It was during the Evolve Alpha (Beta) and it actually made the somewhat bland Alpha fun. And then it crashed and for some reason his GT's from Evolve didn't show up in my recent plays, so alas, no more fun mic times.   I'll miss you mic-bro.   Perez Hilton only has 5.87 million followers, not 6. But yeah.   I need to up my alcohol game apparently.      Whew. I was really worried that you were going to take this the wrong way. Good on you for being open-minded and wanting to be a better rider.    Punched in the face seems somehow not mean enough. Smacked with a flaming 2x4 in the face... hmmm... maybe.   Have a back up controller.   This accident sucks and I wish you all the luck in the world getting it set right with the city. But blaming things outside your control is a recipe towards a second low-side. Analyze what you did and how best to make sure you don't do it again or the next time you encounter something like this situation you'll be unprepared.   I'm not saying that your ignoring the analysis maybe you've already thought about it and are just posting this after the fact, but I want to make sure that you're being as safe as possible, even if it means telling yourself that this may have been partially your fault as well.   Try Volgaar yet?   I don't get this. So I've been paying 60 or 70 a year for Gold. Every month I get a new free game. The games are typically low-level and sell for between 5 and 10 dollars. Times twelve, that means I'm winning.   This Ghosts and Goblins Viking game is freking hard though, I'm a little pissed.   If I were to write it, I would probably start with a generic amplifier object, that way when you or someone on your team decides to replace the Copley with something else later you have some reuse and not a complete rewrite. The public API for this object would expose a settings object to set amplitude and frequency. I would also expose some type of State object which contains feedback of the waveform going to the Copley.  I flipped through the Copley site and supposedly there are some LabVIEW examples in the CMO installed files. However, I couldn't get the downloaded installer to run on my machine, so I can't be much more help.   Not when I saw launch, but it seems like the default to anything I say that the XBone doesn't totally understand is, "Watch E".    Checked your post history, can definitely see why it would be a weird holiday. Would totally join you as this is what me and my family normally do (restaurant holidays) but this year we decided how nice it would be to have Thanksgiving in Hawaii. I will think of you as I pass the poi.    Never watched Ultimatum. Was so pissed at the casting choice that it never even made my Netflix list. Is it really worth it? Keep in mind that I really enjoy the 'Trilogy' as a great piece of action. Almost to the point of being called a die-hard.   As the father of an 18 year old who swam competitively from 1st grade until Sophomore year in high school, I'll try to describe how we handled a very similar situation. When my son got out of middle school we moved to a new school district which meant all new friends and teammates and an entirely new social order to figure out, (we had moved from a rural Kansas town to a more mainstream area in the Kansas City metropolitan area.) Freshman year was understandably tough for him. Trying to make friends, figure out high school, and still excel at a sport he loved was very tough for him. He quickly fell into a group of friends who were not active in sports and went out of their way to heckle and demean him for wanting to be a "jock." Having made up his mind that he wanted to be friends with these kids, he told us at the end of the summer swim season after freshman year that he did not want to swim anymore. After realizing that this a social pressure thing, we told him fine, but you have to do a sport, figure it out. He relented, after weeks of teenage whining, and decided just to swim again. He was miserable. He wanted to be accepted by this group for whatever reasons he had put in his head, and nothing would change that. He began skipping lessons and for the first time ever, lied to us, outright, to our faces. After forcing him to finish out the season and walking him to morning practices and evening meets to ensure his attendance we finally gave in. We told him if he didn't want to do anything Junior year, that was his decision.   Fast forward to post-graduation. We've since moved to California and he's come with us. His very first job was as a lifeguard at a local pool. He aced the requirements exams, got his first aid and emergency responder certs, and actually saved a kid in the first month he was there. He's decided he wants to go into the EMS program at one of the local schools and from there go into Search and Rescue. We were talking the other day, about random stuff, and he said to me, completely out of the blue, "I never should have quit swimming."   The moral that you may be reading here is that we should have done something different than what we did. Maybe forced him to keep going or let him quit earlier. But I still feel that the way things worked out, despite the weeks or months of strife they caused, ended up working out for the best. He has a regret. That regret has helped keep him motivated about his future. He learned a valuable lesson that friends and social circles, albeit demanding, eventually fade and the real friends that you're left with don't care if you're fat, skinny, a jock, or small-dicked. For those reasons, I can sit here on my couch and know that deep down, we messed him up the right way.   One thing you gotta understand, and this is really the only thing I've learned as a parent, is that typically, there's no right answer. There's lot's of horrible answers, and some that are slightly less wrong. But in the end, for the short-term, they're all wrong by some degree.   My advice to you. Go with your gut. And whatever decision you make, own it. And when you think it's wrong, understand that it is, but really, they all are, so just keep going with it. I guess the real moral here is that whatever decision that you as the parent decide to make, understand that eventually it will work out. Just keep being there as a parent and stick through the hard times. As children, they can really, horribly disappoint us sometimes, but it seems like eventually, on a long enough timeline, all of it comes together into this adult that acts responsible (about 75% of the time at least.)  Sorry I can't be more help.   I have never agreed with a Harley rider so much. :)   But ATHF, the bizarro episode? Best "get stoned and watch cartoons" cartoon ever.   I'm not a chopper guy or a cruiser guy. I ride dual-sports and sport bikes mostly. But this, this piece of art, it transcends mere labels of what kind of 'guy' you are. Roland Sands makes amazing machinery.   Came to the comments to make sure this was said. Seriously.   Right, that's what I thought. When I read this line, "Find my Controller to easily find (or identify) a controller by making it vibrate," I thought, oh, they somehow implemented a Find my controller command, awesome, because my one year old likes to come out first thing in the morning and hide it, every day.   How do you make it find your controller? "XBox, find my controller" ???   Yeah, we're gonna need you to share that jam recipe too.    [Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6NqxBZP0Y) to this whole thread.   The word simultaneous isn't really the correct word that you want. LabVIEW is inherently multi-threaded, and when possible will make use of a multi-core machine to distribute that load. However, in your attached image there is no mechanism in place to guarantee that any of those express VIs will run simultaneous. In fact, due to the nature of the express VI architecture, I can pretty much guarantee you that they will not run simultaneously. They will run in parallel, and possibly asynchronous. But the order of operations of those three VIs will be completely up the LabVIEW and when run three times could be three different orders.   The only way to enforce an order of operations is dataflow (usually the best choice) or sequence structures (usually the worst choice, although not a bad idea per-say for troubleshooting.)   There are some methods of enforcing simultaneous operation across multiple cores of a machine, however, just putting them in a line and connecting them to the same inputs and outputs isn't one of them.   So confusing. Back, front, back, front....    Yes, thank you. Let's not delve too deeply into what would happen if you let a rotting corpse walk around in the sunlight for a few days, but seriously, zombies? Yeah right.   Now robots, they scare the shit out of me.   Anyone playing. I got right in a few hours ago, now it seems like I'm stuck at the RROL.   Wait, stealth doesn't leave prints? Dammit.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_sharing  Seems like yours is definition 2 and mine is definition 5. So, technically, we're both right.   My sentiment also. Perhaps I'm assuming people are doing it on accident when they are actually attempting to make my life more difficult. Either way, they affect less than a second of my day. I'm going to put that same amount of energy into being angry about it.   This is what most people don't get. I'm a fellow bay area commuter (Novato to Hayward, yeah, 101 - 580 - 80 - 880 it sucks.) I'll encounter all types on my commute. The inattentive drivers, the old people weaving, the guy on his cell phone, the girl on her laptop, the tech-bus that rides the line, at some point in my week I see a handful of each, at least. I still would never consider not lane-sharing. The safest place for me sometimes seems like it's between two cars.   I've been lane-sharing in California for the past three years, almost two hours a day of a commute. I've never once had someone attempt to intentionally harm me and many, many times over have had people move to the side some amount to make it easier for me to pass. I've also dealt with some inattentive drivers unintentionally trying to harm me, but that's a whole different topic.  	106

From my knowledge of transfers and what counselors have told me, you can change your major as long as you meet the requirements for that said major it shouldn't be an issue.  If the major is impacted or requires certain criteria such as GPA approvals and such per major,  then those must be met as well as deadlines if there are some.    As far as I have heard,  TAGs cannot change.  That may be wrong but that is what I heard.  Hope this helps.  Call your advisor or the counseling office at the University.    Was it a TAG transfer?

I would still not grant you as much because US is to far and to reluctant to go to war.  Look at Syria.  Israel is on the front line.    Threats are different than attacks...  They haven't attacked the US.  Otherwise your point would be valid.    So what your saying is you had a cock in your mouth...    Ha   I likes ya...  And I wants ya...

Shit I think that is one of the only ones they could pull off.  Israel has been putting up with this shit for years...  ISIS is no different. The counter terrorist group is Israel is one of the best in the world. ISIS has picked on countries who are in shatters due to war... Jordan or Israel would murder ISIS. The bully never picks on the one that fights back.     /r/circlejerk    Because Israel is actually strong as fuck...  ISIS would be destroyed.

 Yes/No:  The Australian gun control laws instituted after Port Arthur required law abiding citizens to relinquish guns to the state for destruction.          Yeah, but our president is so much smarter, better looking, and spiritual than the rest of us that it's OK if he acts unilaterally and without the consent of the governed.    I actually didn't read it. Other than the occasional lifehacker article, I have tried to make a concentrated effort to not click Gawker links.      Please explain how throwing law abiding command in jail for owning a gun makes anyone measurably safer.    I think it's cute how you arbitrarily pick 1999 as your cutoff date, and then wring your hands about how "very little progress has been made."  It's a perfect demonstration of how anti-gun people are thoroughly disingenuous. No matter how low gun crime is, no matter how many tens of millions of responsible gun owners there are, you'll still call for idiotic gun control laws, and agitate for throwing people in prison for stupid reasons.    Actual statistics are that US citizens justifiably use firearms in self defense upwards of 2 million times a year.  Please explain why you want to deny people the ability to effectively defend themselves.   What's it like?   That basically makes him the intellectual equivalent of this guy:  http://i.imgur.com/TUPDUkA.gif        Nothing interesting comes from Gawker media.   Even if I had a solution, and I do, there's no point in presenting it to someone who's not only a troll, but a completely authoritarian lunatic.  Please explain why I should take you, an admitted troll, seriously on any level?   The blogger in this case is a female.    Ha!    California requires background checks for all gun sales, including person-to-person.   I don't know if there are exceptions for inter-family transfers.    I don't know the details of California gun laws, but I wouldn't attempt a buy-up interdiction without taking to a lawyer first.    Something... Something...

I was unaware that we were obligated to only post links to places that adopt the supposedly neutral tone of the mainstream media.    I am intrigued by the notion of an ideological Turing Test.      Better take your FFL with you.  California requires all gun transfers to go through a background check, and I believe there's a waiting period for handguns.   I think it's cute that your solution is to take all the guns away from the people who didn't do it.   He is deluded.  He's also the worst kind of troll, an earnest hatemonger with no sense of humor.    MY UP VOTES. HAVE THEM ALL!    There hasn't been an anti to show up in the last decade who doesn't make the entire movement look like it's populated by lunatics, narcissists, or outright cowards.    Nothing like being Monday-morning quarterbacked by people who couldn't even catch a football in a back yard game.    So, what you're saying is that these shooters managed to have more friends than you do?   But you have said you hate Americans, so why are you so upset about this?   I would categorize it as your wet dream.  Two lunatics executing people who actually like to have a beer now and again.                                                                  So I've just started to try a Creatine supplement for my workout. I bought the Body Fortress brand, which claims to have a whole bunch of stuff in it other than Creatine.  Here's a link to the nutrition label: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/815qNfV4toL._SL1500_.jpg  I've noticed some positive results, but since picking this stuff up, I'm wondering if it's the right choice, or if I would be better off supplementing with just plain creatine.  I'm completely new to this game, and a lot of the supplement marketing and advertising strikes me as being about as trustworthy as the average used car salesman.  So am I good sticking with the Body Fortress stuff, or should I be looking at something else?  Thanks for your help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	176

I don't see how there can be good faith if Ubisoft is willing to lie about a game's visuals in order to build up hype.   I understand they are trying to garner good faith by doing this but it isn't enough of a gesture, they're just admitting to a lie rather than doing something to satiate the customers.      How it come off, to me, is Ubisoft saying "look we're going to give you a product that is of lesser quality than what we promised but because we admitted it you guys shouldn't bitch about it."   You see, the problem isn't so much the game itself, it's the marketing. Ubisoft has a fantastic marketing department that knows how to sell a game and make you believe you are buying more than what you really are but without lying about it. This can potentially become the industry standard if the consumers go out and support Ubisoft.   There's also the opposite end of that coin, the author of fight club thought the movie was better.      "imprint" Starring Morgan Freeman and Joaquin Phoenix.   Oh you gotta watch 24.

This also happened to Red Dawn but that movie is forgettable.   Blue valentine, maybe.   Darth Vader's house. See what I did there?   The V/H/S films are decent, helps narrow down what kind of horror you like.   what they showed, i get where you're coming from but all that remained static was tom cruise and the omega. they never implied other universes.   They never implied that.   just a gritty crime movie like that, character focused.   Alice in Wonderland!!!   Yes.   Haywire.   It is, but it's going to lose so much money in the long run. It's a 180 million dollars budget and it only made 29 million on opening weekend domestically. It'll make it's money back overseas but Tom Cruise is not doing well in America if you consider Oblivion.    Since Edge of Tomorrow isn't working like they wanted it to. I would love to see Tom cruise in an independent film like Killer Joe.   That...would be funny. I woulda laughed my ass off. Time is frozen in a continuous loop until he gets a blood transfusion.

I've heard that rather than focusing on Bilbos story, Peter Jackson has convoluted the plot by adding major aspects of The Silmarillion. I have yet to see the movies though.   Don't know if it applies but I'm waiting for all the hobbit movies to come out before watching them.   Why would we want it to be any different?   Predator. Considering the technological and evolutionary advantages versus a squad of spec ops.   ...aaaand dead.   People tend to have so much free time to be getting in comedic shenanigans or pondering what to do about the other person. Don't these people have jobs?         I like the trailers and thoroughly enjoyed the first.   No country for old men, the movie is very visual and already doesn't have a soundtrack. It's your typical black hat versus white hat versus josh brolin.   Both very good films IMHO.    Both loosely deal with trying to fix the past.    Edge of tomorrow is a one-off movie, you go watch it and enjoy it. Take someone with you to talk to about it(not during). It's a bit smarter than a popcorn film. Good performances all throughout.    X-Men DOFP is also a very good movie, but something to take into account is how dense the movie is. This movie doesn't pick up right off of X-3, this is 10-20 years in the future and introduces the sentinel program. If you are ok with turning your brain on and have seen at least 2 X-Men movies then this is a good flick to watch.    Blue Valentine.        Not a movie but the tv show shameless focuses on this.   Dodgeball, Vince and Ben never once touch each other. They leave the competition on the court despite Ben stillers attempt to bribe Vince.   Where the cops literally say "den of evidence"?   It's friendly until one of them dies.   =(   Chris Evans.   American beauty. Lester comes into his own in figuring out what he wants out of life and his main priorities.   Citizen Kane- sad ending, great message.   Pulp fiction did this justice, I think.  	109
 There are very few if any states that operates under the common law for criminal law. Many of the statutes are based on the common law but the crimes are defined in a penal code.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyMgyn6V4yI   It wasn't that he smoked in his youth but: "It was Ginsburg's continued use of marijuana after graduation and as a professor that made his indiscretions more serious in the minds of many Senators and members of the public." Not that I agree with that mindset but it is a distinction.   I doubt he drove Al Capone's getaway car for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre because Capone was not there. He was in [Miami](http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/feb-14-1929-al-capone-gang-wages-st-valentines-day-massacre/) at the time and used that as his alibi.    They are named. The city pays the costs on their behalf.   Goodbye [Kodachrome](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/us/30film.html). Your [nice bright colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZpaNJqF4po) will be missed.   There are tons of civil suits against the police. The NYC Law department has the pay out and defense of lawsuits factored into its budget. It has little to no effect on the individual cops and the city doesn't seem to care either. We need individual cops to suffer legitimate consequences such as losing their jobs, paying for the lawsuits themselves, and having charges pressed against them.   No one is defending the killing of the animals and that is not protected speech. Banning the possession, sale, or distribution of such materials does not extinguish the market. For reference think about the ban on child pornography and drug prohibition. Those markets will exist regardless of their legality. And this market seems much smaller than those.   While the death of an animal is not treated the same as a human why should the video of the death be banned? If a video of someone being tortured and killed is distributed it is not illegal regardless if the person is caught or not. Again, not to mention that many of the videos that fell into the illegal category under the law were not these horrible crush videos. If PETA was to distribute on their website videos of dog fights to encourage people to take action against such abuses than an over zealous prosecutor could have used the original law to prosecute them. The original law was too broad and the Supreme Court agreed.   Actually it is not ridiculous. The case was decided by the Supreme Court in an [8-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Stevens) decision. The law that it invalidated did not ban the making of such videos (that is already illegal throughout the USA) but banned the possession, distribution, etc. So every single person in this thread who ever accidentally downloaded one of these videos would have been in violation of that law. The law tried to make animal cruelty videos equivalent to child pornography which it of course was not. It was an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. In the [case](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-stevens/) that was actually decided by the Supreme Court, the defendant compiled and sold dog fighting footage but took no part in the actual dog fighting. The law was so broad that videos that groups like PETA distributed could have violated it. It would seem weird to me that videos of people being killed can be legally distributed but not of animals being killed.  The law that Obama signed was designed to fix the constitutional issues and to avoid an over broad interpretation.      While that is true the spin used is "you are paying for valuable real life experience that will lead to employment opportunities after school and you get school credit too."   That's why most unpaid internships offer something in return, just not money. The most common example being school credit.   How I view Redditors who steal other people's [work](http://imgur.com/TUMZH)    That's correct. It would not retroactively nullify the decisions already made but as a practical matter those decisions would be easier to overturn on appeal than normal.   Supreme Court justices can be impeached. I believe that only one justice has ever been impeached, [Samuel Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Chase).   Dancing by itself is not considered disorderly conduct. The police in this story had no reason to arrest the couple. But there can be times that dancing or other usually innocent activities could be seen as disorderly conduct. A quick example would be dancing in the middle of Broadway during rush hour risking car accidents and delaying traffic.   No, it has not. I'm not really sure what you are getting at.  	17

Kepler's Laws   Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) developed a quantitative description of the motions of the planets in the solar system. The description that he produced is expressed in three ``laws''.   Kepler's First Law:   The orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.   Figure 1 shows a picture of an ellipse. It is constructed by specifying two focus points, F1 and F2, of the ellipse. All points on the ellipse, such as P in Figure 1, have the property that the sum of the distance between P and F1 and the distance between P and F2 is a constant. The dimension of an ellipse is often described by giving its major axis and minor axis. In descriptions of orbits in the solar system, however, it is more common to use the semi-major axis to describe the size of the orbit, and the eccentricity of the ellipse to describe its shape. The eccentricity is given by the ratio of the distance between the two focus points to the length of the major axis of the ellipse. The periapsis, or the shortest distance between the orbiting body and the central mass, is determined by the product of the semi-major axis and the complement of the eccentriciy (1 - e): if the body is orbiting the sun, this is the perihelion, symbolized by q): q = a (1 - e). A circle is a special case of an ellipse, with an eccentricity of 0, or so that q = a.   Kepler's Second Law:   A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.   Figure 2 illustrates Kepler's Second Law. Consider the line between the Sun and point A on the elliptical orbit. After a certain amount of time, the planet will have moved along the orbit to point B, and the line between the Sun and the planet will have swept over the cross hatched area in the figure. Kepler's Second Law states that for any two positions of the planet along the orbit that are separated by the same amount of time, the area swept out in this manner will be the same. Thus, suppose that it takes the planet the same amount of time to go between positions C and D as it did for the planet to go between positions A and B. Kepler's Second Law then tells us that the second cross hatched area between C, D, and the Sun will be the same as the cross hatched area between A, B, and the Sun.   Kepler's Second Law is valuable because it gives a quantitative statement about how fast the object will be moving at any point in its orbit. Note that when the planet is closest to the Sun, at perihelion, Kepler's Second Law says that it will be moving the fastest. When the planet is most distant from the Sun, at aphelion, it will be moving the slowest.   Kepler's Third Law:   The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their semimajor axes.   We have defined the semimajor axis of the orbit above, in our discussion of Kepler's First Law. The sidereal period of a planet's orbit is the time that it takes a planet to complete one orbit around the Sun. Kepler discovered a quantitative relationship between these two properties of the orbit. If P is the period of the orbit, measured in years, and a is the semimajor axis of the orbit, measured in Astronomical Units, then   P2 = a3   Newton's Laws   Kepler's Laws are wonderful as a description of the motions of the planets. However, they provide no explanation of why the planets move in this way. Moreover, Kepler's Third Law only works for planets around the Sun and does not apply to the Moon's orbit around the Earth or the moons of Jupiter. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) provided a more general explanation of the motions of the planets through the development of Newton's Laws of Motion and Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.   Newton's Laws of Motion   One way to describe the motion of an object it to specify its position at different times. Consider the car in Figure 3. We can tell where it is at different times as it travels down a road. It starts at milepost 0. One minute later it is between mileposts 1 and 2 at a distance of about 1.3 miles from the start. Two minutes later, the car has gotten to a distance of about 3.3 miles from the start. In general, we could specify a unique position for the car at any time. For example, we might have written down where the car was at a time 1.5 minutes after the start, and even if we hadn't, we're pretty sure that the car was, in fact, somewhere. Mathematicians call this kind of a relationship a function. When we say that the position of the car is a function of time, it just means that there is a unique location for the car for any time. For a planetary orbit, we can describe the orbit in the same way, by providing the position of the planet along the orbit for all times.   Another useful property for describing motion is the velocity of the object. Velocity is defined to be the change of position with change in time. Thus, for our car moving along the road, we can find the velocity by dividing the distance travelled by the time it takes to travel that distance. In our example, during the first minute, the car travels 1.3 miles along the road. Thus, the car's velocity would be 1.3 miles per minute (or about 78 miles per hour!) on the average during that first minute. It is important to note that physicists are very particular about the definition of velocity, and when we state a velocity we always make a statement about the direction of the motion. In our one dimensional case, this corresponds to my statement that the the car moved along the road. In general, if we were looking at a road map, we might say that the velocity was 1.3 miles per minute towards the East -- if the street ran towards the East. Velocity always is specified by both a value and a direction.   A final useful property for describing motion is the acceleration of the object. Just as the velocity describes the rate of change in the position of the object, the acceleration describes the rate of change of the velocity. In our example, the car moved farther during its second minute of travel than it did during its first minute. The average velocity during the second minute would be 2 miles per minute (120 miles per hour), since the car covered two miles from 1.3 to 3.3 during the one-minute time interval from 1 minute after the start to 2 minutes after the start. The velocity increased a lot (0.7 miles per minute) between the first minute of travel and the second minute of travel, and we describe this change by the acceleration. In this case, the car's velocity increased by 0.7 miles per minute in a time interval of one minute. Thus, we'd say that the average acceleration of the car during this time was 0.7 miles per minute PER MINUTE --- acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity.   Like velocity, acceleration has both a value and a direction implied. In our example, the direction was ``along the road'', but in a more general case, the acceleration is not necessarily in the same direction as the velocity. An especially good example for understanding the solar system is the case of uniform circular motion. Lets consider the case below of a car moving around a circle. The speed is constant in this motion, but the direction is changing continuously -- note the arrows showing the direction of motion in the figure -- so there must be an acceleration here. The acceleration in this special case of circular motion is called the centripetal acceleration. It is always in the direction of the center of the circle, as indicated in the figure, and it has a value, A, of   A = v2 / R   where v is the speed of the object along its circular path, and R is the radius of the circle.   Newton's First Law of Motion:   A body remains at rest or moves in a straight line at a constant speed unless it is acted upon by an outside force.   If you look back at the definition of acceleration, you will see that: (1) a body at rest is not accelerating; and (2) a body moving in a straight line at a constant speed is not accelerating either. Thus, the first law of Newton says that objects do not accelerate unless they are acted upon by an outside force.   Newton's Second Law of Motion:   If a force, F, works on a body of mass M, then the acceleration, A, is given by   F = M A   The first law said that if there is acceleration, then there is a force. Newton's second law gives a quantitative relationship between the force and the acceleration that is observed. The relationship depends on a new property of the object, its mass. The mass is simply a measure of the amount of material in the object; mass is conventionally measured in grams or kilograms. Note that the second law implies that, for a given force, a less massive body will accelerate more than a more massive body. This is consistent with the world you are familiar with. Shove your kid brother, he might move a long way; shove Shaquille O'Neal with the same force and he won't move that far...   Newton's Third Law of Motion:   If one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.   This law is sometimes called the ``Action-Reaction'' law. Consider what happens if you are in one row boat and you pull on a line attached to a second row boat. When you pull the line, you exert a force on the second boat. But, by the third law, the other boat exerts an equal and opposite force back on you. Thus, if the second row boat has a large shipment of bricks in it so it is very heavy, your lighter boat may do all the moving even though you are doing all the pulling.   Implications for the Planets   The elliptical orbits of the planets have such small eccentricities that, to a very good approximation, we can think of them as circles. (Only very precise measurements, like those available to Kepler, are able to detect the difference.) This means that we can use the idea of uniform circular motion to analyze planetary motion. In that section, we revealed that a body in uniform circular motion was constantly accelerating towards the center of its circular track. Thus, according to Newton's first law of motion, there must be a force acting on the planet that is always directed toward the center of the orbit -- that is toward the Sun!   Newton's second law of motion allows us to state what the magnitude of that force must be. The required force is just the mass of the Earth times its acceleration. We know that the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion is A = V2/R. Thus, we can calculate the force that is required to keep the Earth on its circular path and compare it to physical theories about what that force might be. This is what Newton later did, although he did it first for the Moon rather than the Earth, to learn about the force of Gravity.   Finally, let us consider an implication of the ``action-reaction'' law. If there is a force that attracts the Earth toward the Sun, then there must be an equal and opposite force attracting the Sun towards the Earth. Why, then, doesn't the Sun move? The answer is that it does move, but by a very small amount since the mass of the Sun is about half a million times that of the Earth. Thus, when subjected to the equal and opposite force required by the third law, it accelerates about half a million times less than the Earth as well. For this reason, to a very good approximation, we can treat the Sun as stationary in our studies of planetary motion.   Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation   By now you must be wondering: ``What is the Force that keeps the Earth going around the Sun?'' Newton's great discovery was the force of {\sl gravity}, which is an attractive force that occurs between two masses. The Universal Law of Gravitation is usually stated as an equation:   Fgravity = G M1 M2 / r2   where Fgravity is the attractive gravitational force between two objects of mass M1 and M2 separated by a distance r. The constant G in the equation is called the Universal Constant of Gravitation. The value of G is:   G = 6.67 X 10-11 meters3 kilograms-1 seconds-2   Newton's great step was developing this law and using it, with his laws of motion, to explain the motion of lots of different things --- from falling objects to planets. Amazingly, out of these simple and general rules, Newton was able to show that all of Kepler's descriptive laws for orbits followed as a direct consequence.   When you combine Newton's gravitation and circular acceleration, which must balance in order for the object to remain in orbit, you get a nice relation between the period, distance, and mass of the central body. It beings by equating the centripetal force (Fcent) due to the circular motion to the gravitational force (Fgrav): Fgrav = Fcent   Fgrav = G m1 m2 / r2 Fcent = m2 V2 /r   Let the Earth be m1 and the Moon be m2. For circular motion the distance r is the semi-major axis a. The orbital velocity of the Moon can be described as distance/time, or circumference of the circular orbit divided by the orbital period:   V = 2 pi r /P   so setting the forces equal yields   G m1 m2 / a2 = m2 V2 /a   note that the m2 will cancel, so that circular orbital motion is independent of the mass of the orbiting body!   G m1 / a2 = ((2 pi a)2/P2)/a   which we rearrange to place all the a-terms on the right and all the P-terms on the left:   G m1/(4 pi2) P2 = a3   which should look startlingly like Kepler's third law, but this time for the Earth's mass (or any other) instead of the sun's mass. To use a and P to solve for mass, manipulate once more so that   m1 = a3 (4 pi2/G) / P2    Heyy... I wanna be a mod :)   *Gives hug*   I wanna play too... a lot.

Ok, so I got out of school, and for some strange reason it was already night-time. Just then, me and a group of students and teachers noticed a close-up flying plane that was flying in strange patterns. It wasn't flying stable, it it sometimes went in circles. A few times it even flipped back and flew backwards. Next thing we knew, it took a dive and crashed nearby... there was no huge explosion but still a loud crash. Everyone was apathic about it though.... just talking about it. Just then, like 4 other planes started flying in strange patterns.... ends here.  p.s. It was a lucid dream.

Why!?  Ok, so in the dream I was able to summon a cow(with horns) that came out of the floor(breaking the floor). It didn't actually hurt people, but it did cause a bit of destruction. So I summoned it during school, and it came out of the floor but just then my physics teacher came! A huge pool of water just appeared out of nowhere(about 30 feet deep) and my physics teacher wrestled the cow to death(he killed the cow in the pool). WTF!? I know my physics teacher isn't capable of doing that in real life! He's a good guy! Whyyy oh **whyyyyyyy!!??**  EDIT: Also whenever the cow appeared, classic country music started playing.   Ok, so I was sitting outside, and all of the sudden a moth looking similar to a gypsy moth flew right towards my right forearm and embeded itself into my skin. It was just slightly painful, but the moth's soft texture could be felt when you ran your fingers over it. Why?? Oh why!!?? :D   Yay... looks like our hopes are up again.  	161
 Thanks for the input y'all. Good to know a cheaper bike still has the power to get around, especially for a bigger rider. Does that legendary honda reliability and workability transfer to the bikes as well? Or is that perk reserved for the civics?   Yeah see this is what I've been seeing around. I'm not one to shy away from mechanical work and I think a naked goldwing can look nice and prolly shave a bit of weight   I'm a pretty big dude, 6'-3" close to 300lbs. Help me pick out something that I can learn on and enjoy but still has enough ass to pull mine up a hill and to highway speeds. Been snooping around on here, I thought maybe a mid 80's goldwing would fit my price range and be big enough for me, any suggestions?   Another suggestion for a "cheaper" upgrade, bed that stock if it isn't already. There's good kits around for easily under $100 that'll wring a little more accuracy out of a factory rifle.   Not sure what the handguard in the brownells ad is, but rainier arms makes a similar looking model called the evolution, its a samson product rebranded I believe. To answer your second question, the barrel length doesn't have as much to do with the handguard as you might think, so long as you're using a low profile gas block. If you're using a railed block or one with an integrated front sight post it's best to match your handguard length to the length of your gas tube. These are typically pistol, carbine, mid, rifle and extended. For example, a standard m4 type 16" barrel will most frequently have a carbine length gas system, which would require a handguard in the neighborhood of 7" (from the front face of the upper receiver to the gas block shoulder). This link may help you out some if my explanation was unclear:  http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/ar-15-gas-system-identification-guide/   This is why I don't understand the craze. Yes its a slippery slope letting the ATF ban things and its the principle of the thing blah, blah, blah. I don't even like shooting it cuz it can tear up some of my steel targets, and I shoot SP or HP hunting anyway. Ban doesn't affect me too much   I was talking more about the accuracy. Actually if you shoot someone with a fmj 5.56(as is commonplace for military and police) its going through and through, small hole. 9mm is much bigger and I believe police commonly use hollow points which expand and create a much bigger wound.  	7

 The government has to keep up the fear factor in order to keep Americans scared.  Can you think of a better way of keeping up support for the US' never-ending wars compared to manufacturing these "terrorism" cases?   "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"     Saudi Arabia spends 13 times more money on its defense than Iran does. But somehow Iran, and not Saudi Arabia, is seen by the US as the potential aggressor.  Wow, just wow. 13 times. How many Americans would think the exact opposite is true?  We live in a bubble of propaganda.         By keeping the focus on poor Mexicans seeking to sneak across the border to work in the land we stole from Mexico in the 1840s, the capitalists that run and control the US economy stop people from wondering why all of our jobs are moving overseas.  Immigration has been an effective scapegoat and [wedge issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue) since the ["Know Nothing" Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Nothing) of the 1850s. And it still works today...   "Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world.    If you want to complain about the global elite  What? I never said a word about any global elite.  You're either putting words in my mouth or are jumping to wild conclusions based on your own stereotypes or erroneous thinking. My post was clearly focused on the US.   Also your solution of "join the national guard"  Again, you're putting words in my mouth. As a veteran the last thing I would ever do is to suggest someone join our nation's war machine. My suggestion of the *Peace* *Corps* is pretty much the opposite, but its point was to answer the OP's question.  Have a nice day.

Oh, so we're supposed to ignore the impact of lobbying, FDR's famous observation "In politics, nothing happens by accident.

"Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world.   Agreed. If Barry wanted to be a crackhead that's his business. We should copy Portugal's successful model and decriminalize *all* drugs.  The only thing I'd have against Barry would have been the hypocrisy of his police department arresting people for doing the same thing he was doing.   True, but with the mass media teaching people that accepting charity and government assistance is both degrading and bad, that sort of shaming may work on people with some sort of guilt complex.   That "evidence" was later found to not only come from Israeli sources, but was proven to be BS.  Currently, all dozen-plus US intelligence agencies unanimously agree that Iran has no nuclear weapons program and that has been their position for years and years.  But yet Israel -- which has hundreds of nuclear weapons and which has *not* signed the NPT -- cries wolf non-stop about Iranian nuclear weapons.   Join the Peace Corps or some other program/institution that will wipe out the student loan debt.  Other than that, have him bend over and smile because he's about to be sodomized by our bankster overlords who rule the country. Banksters have had our corporate-funded politicians create the student loan [debt peonage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage) system so air-tight that there is basically no way to get out of it.   "And the banks - hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created - are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place." -- Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, May 8, 2009.   Reuters' propaganda and spin is amazing:   [training will be] likely focusing on issues like tactics and combat medicine,  "Tactics" sounds innocuous enough, and who can complain about training medics who save lives?!  Meanwhile, the fact that we funded the overthrow and arranged a coup d'etat of an elected government friendly to Russia located directly on Russia's border, a government which relies on neo-Nazi stormtroopers to stay in power (aside: those neo-Nazis are now getting restless and [have attacked the government](https://consortiumnews.com/2015/07/13/the-mess-that-nuland-made/) at least once), goes completely unmentioned by Reuters.  Instead of facts, Reuters gives us speculation and Pentagon talking points. :(   The amount of raw propaganda that people accept about Iran as true is astonishing. For example:   Knowing that they're allowing inspectors into the country, I think it'll be hard to say Iran is trying to hide anything at all.   But the US government *already* claims Iran is hiding things.  Iran signed the NPT long ago. All Iranian nuclear facilities have been under inspection and monitoring by the IAEA. That has gone on 24/7 for years and years. Previously Iran agreed to additional restrictions/inspections on its monitoring which are above and beyond what any normal country (e.g. Brazil, Japan) undergoes.  The controversy is that the US wants to inspect Iranian military facilities based on US *claims* that they're doing nuclear things at those facilities. Iran's position has been the normal position by NPT signatory nations that inspections only happen to facilities with nuclear materials.  Iran has a great deal of logic in resisting the US demands. According to former USMC officer and the head of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, Scott Ritter has bluntly said that during the 1990s the US and Israel used UN weapons inspections to spy on the Iraqi military in clear violation of all international agreements. Ritter admits that he committed these crimes under US orders and his misplaced loyalty to the US government. This spying resulted in Iraq dragging its feet and hindering the weapons inspections because Iraq did not want its military spied on. The US government lied about the spying, accused Iraq of WMD skulduggery, and used Iraq's foot-dragging as an excuse to bomb Iraq.  With that history, it is completely logical that Iran does not want its military facilities inspected by the US using a ruse of nuclear inspections. But the Iranians swallowed this and the agreement has a panel that is supposed to decide whether the US gets to inspect various facilities when our war-loving government inevitably demands additional inspections.   At the time of this writing the post is 2 hours old. I wonder how long it'll be before the TIL moderators twist one of their rules or invent some reason to censor this post.   I don't get it -- what's that got to do with finance?  And it's just a damned "conspiracy theory" that the tower people were manipulating the villagers into building the tower for them...  /s   Don's a diabolical genius at milking free publicity, isn't he?!  But then again, should we expect anything less from a reality[sic] TV star?     since it is the long standing, mature democracy.  We're not a democracy, we never have been. We're a republic.  Our propaganda systems preach we're a democracy, but that just is not true. For example, the American people only got the power to vote for our Senators around the time of WWI. And as I said, we still do not elect the US president as the recent 2000 election showed (in that election, more of the American people voted for Al Gore compared to George Bush, but the US' ruling class wanted Bush in power, so the Supreme Court issued a warped ruling to do just that; and that wasn't the first time a US president was put into office that way).  The sad thing is that we're losing our republic. Today the US government breaks whatever laws it wants to with impunity. Our Bill of Rights has been shattered and is routinely violated.  Last year a group of researchers from Princeton University did a study and reported that the US was actually an "oligarchy". (I would argue some sort of plutocratic oligarchy, but the difference is trivial.) This study got a fair amount of media publicity, which was surprising (see [this](http://www.commondreams.org/views/2014/04/14/us-oligarchy-not-democracy-says-scientific-study) or [that](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746)).   But can you tell me where can I read more about this?  Okay, I'll take "this" to mean the problems with our electoral system, ballot access, and vote rigging/suppression. This is the tricky part. Off the top of my head I cannot think of any good books on the topic (though there are no doubt some).  Problems with our electoral system are *many.* But the big problem is that the issue is ignored by the corporate mass media. The media reports each instance individually, but they never put the individual instance into a greater context, and they never examine the system as a whole. After reporting on each incident, the media will then quickly move on to other news stories/infotainment.  People that do examine the electoral system as a whole and point out flaws are typically labeled "un-American" and are smeared as "radicals" or "conspiracy theorists" or some other disparagement.  But here are a few ways the electoral system is biased and rigged:  The plutocrats who control both the Republicans and Democrats work to make the entire electoral system as expensive as possible. This is done in many ways. Politicians have to pay for airtime on the corporate mass media -- thus, it is nearly impossible for candidates to get name recognition and publicity unless they are successful in begging for money. Presidential campaigns now cost over $1 *billion* -- and so we do not see candidates that are not approved of by the rich. Just the raw costs to simply get on the ballot in all 50 states costs well over $1 million -- again, a way to eliminate candidates that are not acceptable to the rich.  Even if a candidate gets on the ballot, they're still discriminated against. On election night, rather than treating all candidates equally the corporate mass media only reports on Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. Other so-called "third party" candidates (that "third party" label itself carries a type of bias which implies they're somehow an outsider or illegitimate candidate) have to wait days or weeks to just find out how many votes they got. For local elections, the discrimination is not as great, but the same trends and attitudes apply.  Ballot access is a major problem. Republicans and Democrats work to make it hard for candidates to get on the ballot, even for local elections. They claim that this is to prevent non-serious "frivolous" candidates while ignoring the fact that anyone has a *right* to be on the ballot. And the bottom line is that even in states that have relatively easy ballot access rules, they're not overrun with "frivolous" candidates. One way the 2 ruling parties restrict ballot access is to pass laws requiring a huge amount of signatures to get on the ballot, and that those signatures have to be collected in a very short time. This means that only a large, organized group can even attempt to get on the ballot. Another way of restricting ballot access is to require high fees from the state to check the signatures that have to be collected -- again, a way of using money to restrict ballot access.  In the post-Vietnam War era, the US passed a media access law that said that all candidates have to have equal media time. This is why today on our TVs we see the opposing Republican/Democratic party response after the president makes a speech. However, our corrupt courts have interpreted that law to apply to only Republicans and Democrats -- third-parties are ignored.  Even if a candidate gets onto the ballot the electorate is discriminated against. In many states, people who live in wealthy areas typically wait in line to vote for only a few minutes. But in poor areas, the wait in line to vote is often *hours* -- this is simply a way of biasing the vote. We have a long, dirty history of suppressing people's right to vote. We used to use everything from voting taxes to reading tests to discriminate and to deter poor people or black people from voting. We invented the entire system of "voter registration" in Pennsylvania to prevent/suppress uppity farmers from voting. But those old heavy-handed ways of suppressing people's right to vote have largely disappeared.  But as I said, we have a long history of this and it still goes on. Today many states are enacting requirements for people to have certain identification cards to vote -- a simply tactic to deter a percentage point or two of people from voting. (Intelligent voter suppression does not use heavy-handed methods; it rigs the vote using only small-but-significant percentage.) But the story is the same: The people being targeted for voter suppression are poor people, blacks and other minorities.  Give me some time to think about it and if I think of any good resources/books I'll add back to this thread.   "How to get people to vote against their interests and to really think against their interests is very clever. Its the cleverest ruling class that I have ever come across in history. Its been 200 years at it. Its superb." -- Gore Vidal   Yellow dog Democrats might love the idea of regulating a Republican's deceptive ad. But that is a very slippery slope and when the karma comes back they'll scream.  Politically, there's no way the country would swallow regulating political ads -- the free speech implications are enormous.  What we should be doing is enforcing the truth in advertising laws on corporations. The Supreme ~~Corp.~~ Court has determined there is a difference between "political speech" and "commercial speech" and that we can have far stronger restrictions on the latter with no 1st Amendment concerns.  Thus, we should eliminate the concept of "puffery" that allows corporations to literally lie in their advertising, and to *strictly* enforce our existing truth in advertising laws.  Perhaps a decade or so after that is enacted we could talk about dealing with the ads of lying politicians...    Much of South Africa remains divided along racial lines, a stubborn legacy of apartheid government policies that forced black people to live in the worst areas while whites were handed the prime real estate.  Much of this "stubborn legacy" is due to the immoral deal that Mandela cut with the racist apartheid regime.  The key part of this deal was that the white racists gave up every government ministry *except* the finance ministry.  Refusing to give up control of the finance ministry meant whites were still in charge of the South African economy. This meant that the decades of ill-gotten economic gains, economic gains from an immoral system of near-slavery and racism, were protected and kept by the white racists.  The economy of South Africa today is *still* controlled by whites and their corporations, and that history is the reason for this "legacy" and is why millions of black South Africans still live in dire poverty today.   "A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones." -- Nelson Mandela.   The post-coup Ukrainian government needs hard cash to continue to wage war on their rebellious people and to consolidate their shaky control over the country.  More neo-liberal economics aren't going to make the Ukrainian people happy, though it will make the billionaire oligarchs of the government ever richer.   Someone hire PBS a graphics artist! That's a crude and vague map.   Note how the rightist Washington Times focuses the story on unsubstantiated claims of a Russian troop buildup, a simple ruse to spin the story away from the real news -- that the neo-Nazi Right Sector openly attacking the oligarchic Ukrainian government.  Clearly the real threat is the Right Sector, and [the coup government is coming unglued](https://consortiumnews.com/2015/07/13/the-mess-that-nuland-made/). Heck, the story even uses a "save the children" claim of the neo-Nazis holding a 6 year old hostage -- classic propaganda to appeal to people's emotions!   This entire claim of a Russian troop buildup is the Ukrainian government's way of seeking more assistance and support from the US.  As you point out, the real threat to Ukraine is the neo-Nazi nationalists that the US used to overthrow the elected government last year.  Grab your popcorn -- it ought to be interesting to see the fight between the oligarchic Ukrainian government and their now-out-of-control neo-Nazi attack dogs.   With the Ukrainian neo-Nazis now battling the oligarchic Kiev government, is our corrupt government *still* trying to blame [the entire mess we created](https://consortiumnews.com/2015/07/13/the-mess-that-nuland-made/) on the Russians?      Fears of further Russian aggression -- what a joke.  With the Ukrainian neo-Nazis now battling the oligarchic Kiev government, is our corrupt government *still* trying to blame [the entire mess we created](https://consortiumnews.com/2015/07/13/the-mess-that-nuland-made/) on the Russians?    Now, lets watch my comment plummet into a horrible fireball of downvotes.  It seems you got your wish. But look at things honestly -- is the 2nd Amendment actually doing what you claim?  Let's see how the Bill of Rights is doing:  The 1st Amendment is weakened, the 4th and 5th Amendments are flat-out ignored. Haven't you heard that all of our phone calls, Internet usage and all electronic financial transactions are monitored? The 6th and 7th Amendments are casually and frequently ignored. We routinely ignore the 8th Amendment's provision on excessive bail for even trivial crimes, and we ignore its cruel and unusual punishment aspects on everything from our government's unapologetic use of torture to the writhing prisoners dying from lethal injections. The 10th Amendment was revoked by Lincoln, so I guess that's so old that it's not news.  I'd say the Bill of Rights is in *very* sad shape -- and the 2nd Amendment is not doing a damned thing. The 2nd Amendment is doing is primarily 2 things:  (1) It gives us a sky-high murder rate that is the embarrassment of the advanced countries of the world.  (2) It gives our evil government a rationale to militarize the police and to put more police on the streets.  The 2nd Amendment stopping tyranny? Clearly that is *not* happening.  If you think that civilians with AR-15s, pistols and hunting rifles can take on the combined might of the US military and police, you're nuts. We could not overcome the British in the 1700s without French cannons, French money, French troops and French ships; we certainly are not going to overcome the US government by force of arms.  The *only* resistance to tyranny today is to organize with others -- including sympathetic people in the police and military -- and to withdraw support from a corrupt government. The people of the USSR and Eastern Europe did this, and more recently the people of Egypt (until the US-backed/armed/trained Egyptian military overthrew their elected government).  Edit: Typos, clarity.   But, but, but Obama!  See, everything's okay now because we have a black president -- we're beyond race! /s   Not being stupid, Poitras knows the real reason.  She must just want to watch them squirm and see what sort of excuse they invent.   Yeah, but the other articles don't feature hard hitting criticism of the corruption of football and the way billionaire owners are getting the public to make them even more money.  So therefore, the post had to go. Reddit censorship at its finest!    I need not be in US to follow the US Presidential Elections 2016, as closely as any US resident would follow.  By "any US resident" I'm assuming you mean the average American citizen. If so, that's easy -- just ignore the political races as much as possible. Seriously.  Fully 1/2 of the American electorate refuses to participate in our sham elections -- and that's during presidential election years. In non-presidential election years the amount of people refusing to vote is even higher.  This is due to many reasons. We have a long, long history of vote rigging and vote suppression. But the system itself is corrupt almost beyond belief. Not only does the American people's vote for president not really count in most states (by the US Constitution, the Electoral College selects the president and not the American people), but our two corporate-controlled political parties have rigged the entire electoral system.  The rigging of the electoral system is done in many ways. Perhaps the most visible is the fact that only Republican and Democratic nominees get to appear on the nationally-televised presidential "debates".  If any so-called "third party" candidates arrive at the debates (no matter how many state ballots they are on), they're simply arrested and hauled away in handcuffs just like some third world banana republic.  But we're still told we live in a democracy and the "land of the free."   "The American political system is essentially a contract between the Republican and Democratic parties, enforced by federal and state two-party laws, all designed to guarantee the survival of both no matter how many people despise or ignore them." -- Richard Reeves.    Plenty of eggs on plenty of faces.  WTF? Officials should have been charged with crimes, tried and sentenced. This is simply an abuse of their office and is using/playing the taxpayers as unwitting guinea pigs.   Iran will preemptively strike Israel? When did the Iranians become suicidal and crazy?  What kind of drugs are the people at adbusters doing?!    It is true that the political deal made between the ANC and National Party to transition from apartheid had some unfair things in there, which put the new government on the back foot. For example   OMFG! That statement qualifies for understatement of the year!  How about, *for* *example,* the fact that the white racists gave up every government ministry *except* the finance ministry?  Refusing to give up control of the finance ministry meant whites were still in charge. This meant that the decades of ill-gotten economic gains, economic gains from an immoral system of near-slavery and racism, were protected and kept by the white racists.  Mandela essentially sold out black South Africans with that single deal. The economy of South Africa today is *still* controlled by whites, and that history is the reason why millions of black South Africans still live in dire poverty today.   "A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones." -- Nelson Mandela.    Why was it removed?  My guess -- and it's only a guess -- is simple Reddit censorship. Reddit is plagued with censorship, it's an epidemic.  Censorship by moderators abounds in *many* sub-reddits. Something like this is directly on topic, but it is critical of the NFL in a huge, economic way which targets the corruption of the owners -- thus, it is huge target for some moderator to twist the rules so it can be censored.   Our tax dollars at work. Go military-industrial complex, go!  General Dynamics Inc. stock must be going through the roof! Yay capitalism!!  /s   "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist." -- President (and former General) Dwight Eisenhower, Jan 17, 1961.  	37
 Thanks for the cents! We are looking for an AG recipe. Looking to pick up from our local HB store. Any tips for using actual berries either in the secondary or flame out or in any capacity at all? Wondering how to best achieve those flavors. cheers.          a hole in the sky or saturns rings melting off   Depends on the mood. If im super stoned I will listen to very laid back chillwave esc electronic. I am not unknown to listen to 80s RnB with friends and have the occasional dance party. Love me some 60s   70s classic rock. Huge Rush and Moody Blues fan. Classical music is also super cool. Steve Reich to Bruckner-its all awesome.   Me and some friends were lucky enough to be there for this when they filmed it. They played through the tune like 6 times and each time it got better. As a trumpet player, I was super impressed that their trumpeter had the chops to play like that 6+ times. They ended up playin us some other fun stuff at the end. These dudes are crazy good and super fun! Real deal   Wow never done that. I'm sure it tasted lovely!   Time for a grandfather blunt sir!   so if you marijuana whilst sleeping?   Take my money   cut me some FRIGGEN SHLACK!!!   Got home at 2am and smoked. Cleaned my room to some music [7] and when I woke up I totally forgot I cleaned my messy-ass hovel of a bedroom. It was immaculate. Surprise to my [0] self.   im about to watch Spirited Away. Any Miyazaki is the right move though.    I'm so sorry man   This played out at my last physical.    Been training to become a tokemon master    Record Business. yes. people still buy music. me included!   i do that also.    what pieces were you playin?? Woke up once for a recording session with my WE still stoned from the night before and I somehow made it through.    smoking with friends outside makes me forget about the cold. We talk and its easy to not worry about weather and just focus on conversation. Otherwise, when I am alone, just dress warm, light my j and enjoy being with my thoughts. I did go to school where it averaged 0 degrees during the winter months so I have some training. Good luck!   great soundtrack. This reminds me a lot of some Phillip Glass operas. Check out Satyagraha if you like the Interstellar score.   Unrelated to Glass, Steve Reichs Music for 18 Musicians is phenomenal. You will certainly go places if you listen to that above a [4]   and then hit the vape? [7]   Smash bros is a staple for us. Always love messing around in GTA. Others include Age of Empires II, Harry Potter   The Chamber of Secrets on PC and not a video game but Settlers of Catan is awesome. Anything open world!    this is fucking incredible. I have been listening to The Moody Blues since I was a kid, maybe 8 or 9. This song is something that has been left unheard by me in a long long long long time.   	24
 No he is on the disgustingly severe end.  I guess my wording was off, but... Jesus.

Products and treatments might make it feel a little better, but there's no way to just *rebuild* hair.    That amount of damage has to be from something you're doing. .. Flat iron?  Color?  Constant swimming in chlorine?    Whatever it is, find the root of the problem, stop doing it and just gradually grow and trim it until it feels amazing again.  It will take a while, but if you want to keep your hair a decent length you'll have to be patient.    Not only do some women like to have dry hair, sometimes they have an unruly texture and have to smooth it down with a round brush.  Women might have too many things, but these aren't negotiable to most.     Well if they'd make all fuckin' counters just a little bit bigger...

[LIVE TO WIN, PAUL STANLEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QdQS1QhQA0 feature=youtube_gdata_player)   Rotten.com   I don't know if I agree with this.  I charge $150 for roots, partial, cut, blowout.  If I wanted to help a friend, even if I went to their house, I would never expect $150.    It's really nice to receive the same, but if you're going to call it a friendly favor, where does that part come out.  The comfort of their house doesn't even do anything for me, I'd much rather have a comfortable shampoo bowl and salon chair so I'm not making them uncomfortable or breaking my back.  When I do hair for people at their house, it's something nice I like to do if they have kids and can't make it in, or if they are unable to drive.  But when it comes to maybe cutting them a break on the price, I would definitely have them come to me, so on top of me taking some off their bill, I'm not wasting my own gas to do it.    I think a fair amount to pay would be 60-80% of what they would normally charge.  If he didn't tell you a price he probably wouldn't even expect that much, and he'd be thrilled.

It's fine that you think it's too subtle to be a pomp(which I disagree with considering the examples wiki shows), but it's definitely not a textbook "comb-over."   I first agreed with you, then I read the part of the wiki article where it mentions men with the "pomp," and most of those men's haircuts aren't huge and exaggerated.  I think modern descriptions have changed how we define it.  OP's might not be huge, but I think you could call it a pomp, mini pomp.   Perfect explanation.    Personally, even if there were 20 parachutes, I'd still never jump out of a plane.   That argument isn't really ideal.  Of course motorcycles are dangerous.  But the fact that you have 60 seconds to make a decision, that high up in the air, is pointless if your parachute isn't going to function.  Which is certain death.  I don't think skydiving is, in any way, an irrational fear.   You should definitely do an AMA.   P.s. I love you.

Every human nowadays has the capability to be sensible and morally correct to their own judgement, why use something else that just causes problems?   Well put!    I completely agree with how you describe your view.  Perfect.    It's important to me because I feel like humanity has a lot of living to do.

No one has that knowledge.  And instead of worrying about it, we should just live.    I guess my viewpoint isn't geared towards fence-riders, more towards fundamentalists.

 This story is some levels of fucked up.   stfu.   hottest pic i could find of kraft's lady was THIS pic unfortunately.  she's fine as fuck in this one.   it's fine stfu   blink distance soooo hard. talk about learn it once and never again.  BIG WHOOP.  cry a river, every fucking casual knows this shit.   git gud.   I can't believe this filthy casual nonsense is getting upvoted.  At this point in the game, no I don't think it was arbitrary.  I once thought randomly having skill shot blink was arbitrary, but it turned out to be meaningful even if very tiny bit.  Then I thought it was arbitrary cause the distance thresholds chosen, but at this point he probably tested the distance out a tad.  You need some more experience in the game or stop spouting this trash nonsense.  Same kind of bullshit that supporters of comeback mechanics in 6.82-6.83.  Stop forcing everyone to play your version of nerfball.  We don't give a shit, and it hardly affects your trash level of play.   Why the fuck is this getting downvoted.  Why do these casuals think this is a punishment/penalty when it's a reward for paying attention/effort.  If you're lazy and you don't give a crap it hardly affects you anyway, even if the opposing mate landed 90% of his blinks in optimal 1150+, it still wouldn't fucking matter.  What is the big deal about allowing there to be room for a bonus given you want to get that bonus blink distance.   Lol, you should prepare to be downvoted in a thread like this, not OP.  Top comment thinks blink is totally arbitrary, and the 960 unit blink is a PENALTY.  Wrong 1200 is the reward, git gud, or just casually blink at 960 like I do because i'm fucking lazy.  But why ruin it for those that want to do things properly/optimally and not like a lazy shit like me?  These threads are filled with casual shitheads.  	8

 wow. okay so at first I thought you're the culprit but then, Tyler came and then changes the story and what me and my friend concluding about it. hope you're okay now. :)  	1
 Damn I need to go to the bank and get that million dollar loan.   We have two local food oriented publications here in St. Louis called Feast and Sauce, local cultish paper has a food section, food section in the St. Louis Post Dispatch every Wednesday, and twitter/facebook.   Keep fucking reading this as anus instead of aus. Dirty mind tends to wander.   Oh yeah big time.   Well gives new meaning to the word peaceful.   UFOs going back to their hanger at lamb....oops I said too much.   Was going to give you a list of stuff but see what I was going to say has been covered. Good luck and most importantly have fun.   Was a KM once at a Mom   Pop place because nobody else wanted the job or work for that matter so I know what you're going through.   What i wish somebody would have told me is to get a key to the place in order to let the delivery guys in. I lived right across the street from the place and would see them show up but couldn't do shit because I never could get ahold of the owner. Had many orders that we had to go next door to the quick shop and buy sodas because the Pepsi guy couldn't deliver.   Somebody get this man some coffee or a beer STAT!   It reminds me of Chumlee from Pawn Stars. Any other time the guy is a few fries short of a Happy Meal but you start talking to him about something he loves and is passionate about and he will blow your mind with his knowledge. Take Gavin and his love of camera work and he could school you I guarantee.   I just want a hug from Bayley. Is that too much to ask?   Wow amazing haul and loving that coffin humidor.   Girl is cute and the dog just needs a reboot.      Like has been said don't apologize because she saw you were actually passionate about something.   Sounds like the David Crosby Melissa Etheridge situation.   With the high possibility of people coming in from out of town I see a mixture of 1  2 leading to 3.   Said the exact same thing but I don't see my comment now.   So... I guess the man that was ganged up on and beaten by the protestors was actually beaten up by the police??? Damn gotta say that if you really are getting an education at SLU I'd ask for a full refund because it's not helping you any.   When you step into a battle zone like Ferguson was you have to expect the risk involved with standing around like the bystanders and media were. Of course I had a debate with you one time before and that was like talking to a wall so I'm leaving it at this.   They're lucky it was just tear gas and not live rounds. Usually when you approach a cop in a threatening manner they have every right to protect themselves any means necessary.   An I went to Ferguson and all I got was this shirt t-shirt but with fake bullet holes.   Enjoyed your gimmick in the E and was just wondering who was the toughest opponent none kayfabe?   The D-Bag radar is pinging hard with this one.      Well that sucks. Used to listen to Brian McKenna and Jeff Burton everyday coming home from culinary school. It sounds like too many people had their hand in the pot thus leading to the fights.   Amateurs! I have a 56K modem for a iPaq 3835 in my back pocket right now right next to my Pog slammer.   Free napkins are great and all but can we talk about the use of comic sans font?   Ditto. We've been missing out on the table, cooler, and seat bed fun.      Hopefully they rebrand him into something enjoyable. Also get rid of that diaper looking speedo.   Oh this fits so well: http://imgur.com/WWwaDLs   I've had one of those girls in one of my kitchens. Takes the fun out of a dirty joke when you have to explain it.   Had a Grandpa serve in the Navy during WWII and my Dad served as a medic in the Army during the Korean War so your service is much appreciated here. Thank You for it.   Go to Pappy's and ask for Mike Emerson(the owner). He's a great guy and I'm sure he'll help you out somehow.   Name???   Yep. Even went through a miscarriage with the girl and she ended up marrying the guy she cheated on me with.   You forgot the eggs. I mean how are we supposed to make the traditional St. Louis French toast without eggs?   Damn it Luke I told you no base jumping until 30 minutes after you eat but nooooo you didn't want to listen.   My question is where the hell did he get his info at???   I'd have had to ask him doesn't the security of said hotel know how to rewind it themselves.   As long as it's one of the central logo ones in fat guy sizes I'm game for any color.   One of those songs I can put on repeat and it never gets old.   Sounds like he's trying to set up an online date for her instead of a dinner reservation.   These costumes are Legen....Wait For It.....dary.   Well besides restraining myself from killing some squirrels (long story) mine was good.   Been having problems with them for the past month trying to get the bills on time as well as the rest of the mail. For 2 weeks straight nobody on my street got mail on Thursday. Just did an exchange and saw where my gift was sent USPS and tracked it like a hawk. Thankfully it came in one piece undamaged. Sucks that this happened but glad it was in one piece. I do have an 800 # for their customer service if you'd want it.   Both The Christmas Story and Rugrats signify my childhood.   Was playing GTA Online with a buddy and his BIL, and all of a sudden his BIL starts freaking out telling us to get to him ASAP. We get there and it's a UFO  that was sticking out of the street. Uploaded the pics to social club: Itsmy6   My eyes MY EYES!!! But like has been said wash your own damn knives and not in the dishwasher either.   Saw where there's one today with the two directors of ABCs of Death and I can't help but ask why. IMO by far one of the worst movies ever made.   A couple of their girls have done this but none to this scale. Most famous of the bunch is Violet riding the gearshift of a parked car. A lot of people don't know that at one time Ryan Keely was a FTV model, and there's a clip of her masturbating and squirting on what looks to be a closed restaurant patio.   If you go to the brewery's site it has recipes on there of what you can make with the beer, and everyone for that beer is a baked good.   That Milk Stout Nitro is one of the first beers I drank a whole 6-pack of by myself. Stuff goes great with some chocolate chip cookies. Also some nice sticks there so kudos on the trade.   Was just about to post this exact thing.   Science Rules! Thanks for the pics and sucks that it wasn't a real one.   It's still real to me damn it!!!   Well I've had Apple and Android over the years so I thought hey go windows plus it was $100 for the phone. Had I known then what I know now app wise I'd have kicked my own ass.   According to him it's all bullshit and he's staying put.      ^ All this and a bag of chips...with some nacho cheese sauce.   Wish there was a Windows Phone version but I'm getting used to not having 95% of the apps Apple and Android get.   Pretty sure a belt sander is what caused this problem to begin with.     If you want one cheap you can go to Ferguson and loot one.   She looks like Charlie Laine with a tit job IMO.   I don't see him getting in. What they don't seem to realize is that South County and West County aka mostly white areas also vote on this too. I said it before and I'll say it again I don't give two hoots in hell who endorses who because in the end it's all about who can benefit the county more    Yeah the SJ pretty much seized to exist about 5 years ago. Was a sad time at my house when it happened.   I live in N. County right by Ferguson and we pretty much forgot about it unless something major happens. It's business as usual other than the neighbors and I have the guns loaded just in case they come this way.   LMAO There was already a banner up on a pedestrian walkway saying the same so I don't see how this is any different.   After goofing off with the What Does The Fox Say question and answer I decided to try other animals to see what would happen.  From what I tried here's what worked:  Cat Dog Pig Cow Chicken Rooster Duck   Tried 5 times to get her to understand hardware store. Eventually I said F this and typed it in.   Be prepared for the common complaint about WP not having certain apps that iPhone does.   Not really. If you bring a cart back yes a quarter pops out but you still have to use a quarter to unlock a cart so technically that doesn't count as free.      Did not even know that one. Haha nice   Found that out last week by goofing off with Cortana and I literally Yayed at it.   27 yo and have yet to have mine.   Was just about to post this. Loved the book but the movie was out there.   That's almost Prime grade marbling right there. Very beautiful pieces.   Won a facebook contest a year or two ago by some local Horchata company. I think I was the only one who entered and it was the last contest they had. Ended up getting 3 cases of canned coffee drinks and a thank you note.  Another time won a contest given by Patron tequila for a top secret dinner. Premise was that I had to show up to a hotel, give the parking attendant the password, and wait for a shuttle bus with other people. Turns out the dinner was on the outfield of Busch Stadium but I didn't go because it was too secrety.   Well we have Wallet on our phones but it's completely useless. They need to make it like ApplePay but I see that never happening.   A lot of these companies have even admitted to saying F You to WP users because the market is so small. There are times I wish I would have went back to Apple instead of WP.   This store look like the Quick Mart in Florissant off Charbonieer.      This post pulled me in but it's like I got stood up by a date.   Love me some lizards and gizzards. They're very easy to make also. Just do a three step breading of seasoned flour, egg/butter milk mixture, and another thing of seasoned flour. After that toss them in the fryer and cook until they float.         You're Welcome and guess not.   Not sure why you're being down voted but would go here: http://www.yp.com/fenton-mo/deer-processing   Any pets? If so blame them, if not it was nice kinda knowing ya.   Not a member but been to a meeting and a competition and have to say they were mostly huge networking events. If you need to network among people in the field I say go ahead and sign up.   Iron Pigeons would make a damn good band name.   Had one of those Taylor ones in my Chef bag from Culinary school and ended up saying F this and got a digital one for $20.   Bun Munchers   Best friend has those same exact yoga pants so I had to check for tats. lol   Tried reporting it but it just takes me back to the pledge page.   Mostly Ghost and spirits. The latest happening Tuesday night with the usual cold spots and shadows. Knew that it was my best friend's mom watching over us so it didn't freak me out as much but she was bugging out.  Have also smelt roses before in places where I shouldn't, and after I googled it I found out it means a loved one who passed is present.   Wow people actually read that paper? I thought it was just put out as free wrapping paper or cage liner.   As a Chef I'd go with Kendrick's. Very friendly staff and they can get you want you need.   Rodney Dangerfield is that you???   Downloading mine now. This should be fun....YAY!   Are they ever going to fix the typo with Area?       Although their food went over well with customers, Siao said they have revamped the old menu by throwing out the dishes that didn't sell and keeping the ones that were popular.  The place wasn't even opened long enough to figure either of the two truthfully.   My best friend happens to be a girl I had a thing for back in high school, and last night I stayed over at her house to keep an eye on her(long story I don't want to post on reddit). Well while not being able to sleep I got to thinking about how right after HS graduation I got real down in the dumps because I chickened out on telling her how I felt about her thus thinking I lost the opportunity for good. Long story short I got a second chance and she has known for a few years.      Remember when the topless photos of Cat got "leaked'?  	108
 cool. At first I thought I was just missing something.   Angela Merkel. Probably the most  in the know, powerful western politician. I'd tell the truth about the system.  I'd also be killed before the day was out by the puppeteers.   Or some hot lesbian. And I'd explore stuff.   Thanks, I just had a Thai red curry dish on Saturday. I'm looking forward to trying the Vietnamese curries. I've only tried their Pho. My next trip after this is Thailand which I am looking forward to also.   No pu'er tea for me yet. I find them to be too earthy.  More and more tea is getting used for red tea in Yunnan because it is gaining such an international following and the prices they can get. They're also finding they can age them and develop a lot more flavor without becoming a pu'er tea.  The link from earlier talks about the differences.   Or more accurately, removed for admitting to hacking into the airplane systems while flying with them in the past, and deemed a security risk because of that. Personally, as a frequent flyer, I support United's actions.   My parents had no way to control my or my brothers behavior short of putting themselves in jail by keeping us chained in the basement. And as a parent now, raising kids can be tough. Pressing harder with the boot on their neck is not how you keep them out of trouble either. The more a kid is stepped on, the more they rebel. There is no formula to raise good kids or everyone would do it.   I just have overnight layovers in Taiwan flying to and from Vietnam, so I'll just hit the 2 tea stores in Taoyuan City I found last time and maybe the day market if I have time.   They also both describe a curing method. https://www.teatrekker.com/new-rest-aged-tea   It's almost like the chlorophyll you get with some herbs. It's also more of a smell flavor than a tongue flavor.   I have found this to be true with all of the Yunnan's I get and notice it very little with the Taiwanese red teas. TWG's golden needle and T2Tea's grand yunnan are the flavors I am looking for. Yunnan Sourcings Feng Qing Golden bud is close, but I think they use more tippy leaves. And I really like Wu Liang Hong Mao Feng from autumn 2014.  Spring of 2015 is really bright still and it overpowers the subtlety of a nice Yunnan.   We already have enough Omen sequels.   Red. Pu'er teas are a bit rough for me still.  I'm not really sure what the difference is between aged tea and pu'er. I just know aged tastes more mellow and has less of the brightness a new leaf has. Pu'er tastes like dirt to me.  There are other notes, but the earthiness is the main taste I get.   Can't it be added so we can put it in before we save? I have no idea what functionality is allowed when a subreddit is created.   I see a lot of interesting stuff on ali baba but it seems like an ebay to me. IMO the minimum you need is a website. But I am not a blended tea drinker. It seems to be a lot of mass market tea with flavorings added to hide that you're drinking the bottom rung of tea.   She probably meant her parents owned them. It would fit with the attitude she showed.      I fell in love with a couple of mid size companies Yunnan tea. I think a lot of what I was getting from them was aged tea because of the volume I imagine they buy. Their prices were both outside of what I would consider for everyday tea.   My dilemma is, when I find a tea that I like after it has aged for 3 to 6 months (or more), that seasonal variety is gone. Since each season is different, as is each year, I'm struggling to find a tea to get in enough quantity to get me through a while.   Tea Trekker has some Yunnan's aged 2 years that I am going to try next.  Hopefully the curing allows me to find something that I can get 250 or 500g's of.   I have a travel mug that I pour into a small tea cup. My strainer sits on top of the travel mug. When I'm done, I throw them in the garden   I feel bad for the farmers. I'll be there in a couple weeks and I am planning on getting some high mountain teas, especially the Sun Moon Lake area. It looks like it will be more expensive than last time. Maybe I can get a discount on last years crop. haha   Just some general info you may like:   There is a grading scale for tea you may see: SFTGFOP1 or parts of that. It means:   Special, finest, tippy, golden, flowery, orange, pekoe, 1st quality. It has to do with where the leaf is taken and when. You find this rating a lot in Darjeelings. I rarely see it in Chinese teas.   The main types of tea are:   White tea, which is the first leaf and is not fermented at all.   Green tea, which is also unfermented and has incredible variation based on region and curing methods.   Oolong, is a fermented tea which means it is cured with heat to develop more flavor. There are huge variations in region, how much they are fermented and how they are processed.   Black tea is heavily fermented tea. Like oolongs, there is significant variation between regions and processing.   Rooibos which is not really the same plant as tea, is very popular in Africa and becoming more popular in the west.  I believe it has a lot more medicinal and nutritional properties. I found it a little too tangy.   Herbal teas, which can really be anything. Check Celestial Seasonings varieties as an example.   There are also a lot of regional drinks that are unique, like Chai's, Mate's, etc.   That is just some basic info I have gathered since I was in your shoes about 4 or 5 years ago. I hope it helps.   If you like Darjeelings, hopefully you have been able to try some of the good ones. They are an excellent example of how the same tea and region can produce incredibly different teas. So as you try new teas/regions, remember that same thing holds true.   I also found a lot of people don't like green tea because they brew it like a black tea. It gets bitter very fast and like a good Darjeeling and oolong, you cannot use the color as an indication of when it is ready.   When I thought of blends, this was the only thing that came to mind for me too.  Unfortunately, what I liked was Twinings loose and I cannot find it anymore, even online.  Although I did like sleepy time tea, but that is tea in name alone.   Not sure about blends but;   Yunnan black tea - I found this about 4 years ago and have never looked back.   Taiwanese black tea - I love the natural fruitiness and floral side of their teas.   Highly fermented oolongs - I like the nuttiness oolongs get when they have a heavier fermentation. I like oolongs from both China and Taiwan.   Twinings Prince of Wales - My regular before I started getting into whole leaf tea. It has such a unique taste that I still keep a tin around.   Jasmine green - I like gunpowder green too, but if I drink a green tea, it is a Jasmine 90% of the time   It's a lot faster to fly over the thin part of the globe. Any flights over or near the equator fly pretty much a straight line, within flight paths.  I've done ParisJohannesburg, S. Africa, ChicagoBuenos Aires, Argentina and LAMelbourne, Australia. Those flights over the equator are long. Very long   I did this to myself. The first corporate job I had was running database processes, After about 6 months, I was wondering why this was not automated so I started building VXRexx scripts to automate it.  Once the team realized what I was doing, they created a project to turn the whole process into a script. I won the corporate annual achievement award for coming up with the idea that took a multi day process and turning it into a program that will run in under an hour. However, I did program myself out of a job. Luckily I proved myself by doing it, so they put me in another position instead of letting me go. And 20+ years later, I am still working for the same company.   Vonnegut has a book called Player Piano that is about technology automating all of our jobs. As a trainer I am creating my player piano by making all of my lessons available in podcast.   Yes, I bring 5 or 6 dvd's with me when I travel. I hadn't watched it in about a year so it was a good selection for a 14 hour plane ride.   Yes, from a little shop about 4 blocks from the big mall in Taoyuan City   Unfortunately Twinings does not make their Russian Caravan anymore.  I was able to find some old tea bags in Europe somewhere, but I preferred the loose. I've tried other companies and they are not even close imo.   I've never tried anything but Taiwanese and Chinese in a gaiwan, but they were both very different than in my travel mug steeped through a strainer.   I would definitely be interested. This looks very close to T2Tea and will probably be the next tea I get online. http://www.teatrekker.com/teas/yunnan-jingdong-wuliang-golden-threads-12    Are they fairly clear brews like you get from the higher altitude?  When I first brewed a high elevation FTGFOP Darjeeling I thought I messed up and didn't add enough leaves. Then I tasted it. mm mmm good. They're much more tannic than a Taiwanese or Yunnan black though, which makes them rougher on my stomach.   I got tea drunk in all the shops trying so many teas.  My biggest problem was testing everything in gaiwan's, when I use a strainer at home. There is a big taste difference between the precision you get from a gaiwan and what I get from the strainer. I also use a little local honey which brings out some flavors and mutes others   About 10 of that price is shipping. TWG's website just recently came online so I have not checked their shipping price but their price is over 40US for 50g online (I think 25US in Singapore's airport), where T2Tea was 45 US to ship 4 50g bags but their tea was only 18 for 50g.  I've since tried about 30 Yunnan's looking for their flavor, with very limited success.  Yunnan Sourcing is the closest I have found, so I am still going through their varieties. Tea Trekker looks interesting too, but I haven't tried them yet.   There is one store in a city about 50 miles from me that gets an occasional organic FTGFOP1 Golden bud Yunnan that has almost everything except the intoxicating aroma.   Processing is so critical to tea, I just figured I was paying for some master to turn good Yunnan into an elixir. :-)   As for the key chain, just put it in the small cheesecloth bags you can get for adding herbs to stews and soups and put it in anything you can attach then. The cloth would protect the pearls of gunpowder tea.   Twinings makes a decent gunpowder green and it is about 5 US for 100g. It is a main brand out of England and distributed around the world. We have it in our local grocery stores.   Thanks. I'm excited to go back and get more Oriental Beauty and the High Mountain box.  I routed myself through Taiwan on a trip to Vietnam I have coming up so I could get more.   I have all those Yunnan's because I am trying to find something like TWG's Golden Needle Yunnan or what T2Tea's Grand Yunnan used to taste like, without paying 25+ for 50g's.   Thanks for the translation too.   Have you tried something like a Lingia or Steinthal plantation Darjeeling? I find them much more mild than the Taiwan teas unless it is very lightly fermented.   Excellent information. I do find a huge taste difference between low and high altitude Darjeeling teas. Low ones are almost like a Ceylon tea. High ones are where Darjeeling got the name Champagne of tea.   It's like the latitude Taiwan is on is perfect. The mountains and moist air makes perfect tea growing weather. Northern Vietnam is starting to develop the same mountains that butt up against Yunnan province in China. Continue west into the Darjeeling region of India. For me, that latitude has all the teas I love.   To get more specific so it is more of the terroir (new word for me) I'd say Feng Qing county in Yunnan province, which is the true origin of Dian Hongs, fits.  I also think Taiwan has their own terroir. You can taste the soil like you can in a good coffee bean.   http://imgur.com/gallery/GGPVR/new  I put this on Reddit but I don't see it. I think it is the 2 on the right in the luggage.    For me it is their Grand Yunnan 22, surprise. :-)   Their Russian teas are nice too.   She didn't tell me it was red tea. Just that it said Tieguanyin. I bought it in Taiwan as black tea. There may have been a bit of a language barrier that my smartphone did not get past in Taiwan. :-)   That bag was pu-erh tea. I gave it to some of the Chinese I work with. I couldn't handle it. Way too earthy for me.  Most of the silver bags in my cabinet are Yunnan's, which are my favorite.   That TWG Yunnan is dangerously good. Sort of like trying Bellhaven's for the first time.   My Tiguanyin and Darjeeling Ligia are in my tea cabinet at work. I'm hoping to get my new order of 2015 Dian Hong's and bring one of those in.      It's interesting you say that. I was given 2 tins of a very nice Taiwanese black tea. When I asked a Chinese girl at work what the tin said, she said tieguanyin, which I thought was oolong. She confused me even more. So, can tieguanyin be both oolong and when fully fermented become red tea? Is it a region or leaf type?   Watching Russian cadets learning to march is only slightly more interesting than watching paint dry.   I travel a lot for work and last year I was in Mexico for about 3 weeks. While there I ate any fruit and veggie I wanted, had ice in my drinks and pretty much ate what I wanted.  While eating with a co worker his college professor walked up and while talking he asked if I had Montezuma's revenge yet. I said, thankfully no.  When he was surprised I told him I drank tea all day long with honey in it. (Honey kills bacteria.) When he heard I was eating so much honey, he realized why I had not had problems.   EU3 (Europa Universalis)   Sometimes trying to figure out which are inexpensive and which are cheap can be a challenge.   Yes, you are correct. #18, not 28.  Thanks for clarifying that.  Just me getting confused.  Personally I am not a huge fan. It comes across as something the Brits might like a lot because it may stand up to milk and sugar.   I try to switch from my Yunnan teas on occasion so I do not lose the subtle flavors I love. There are 2 main black teas from Taiwan. One is the strain developed when the Japanese controlled Taiwan in the 30's-40's which is known as #18 or Hung Yu. Most of the large plantations use this tea.  They also still have the native tea which is incredibly fruity. I like that enough to ration my use of it. I'm hoping to get 250g's when I go back next month.   Today I had the Hung Yu and it is much stronger and more tannic than I am used to now.  Very strong teas make my stomach a little wacka. At least our guest restaurant in our building is Indian today, which means I will have a big lunch so it won't bother me much longer.   Edit: updated with correct #   Landfills release a lot of heat. Makes snow melt fast.  We have one converted landfill but it was an old fill and the slope is actually more off the side than directly on top.   Read the history of Margarine. The same thing is happening with Tesla.  The existing product is using gov regulations to protect their market share.   A little steel wool will get the rust off. No worries about it.   If you have tea bags, use them. Tea bag manufacturers grind the tea and it really doesn't work well in a strainer. Especially the larger hole strainers that typically come with those tea pots.   I can taste if the cup I use had coffee in it last time, so using the same container to brew both would be unacceptable to me.  You can get a french press for coffee for under 10 bucks and that will work fine to make your ground coffee.  People even use French Presses for tea.  You can really put anything in any strainer and pour hot water over it and you will pick up the flavor.  In a pinch you could probably use a food strainer or cheese cloth.   I'd think getting supplements from China would be very, very high risk.   Here is a link I found though: http://www.weiku.com/Sliced-Herbal-Medicine/buy-Ephedra-Ephedra-Sinensis-Ma-Huang-Herbs.html   I started drinking tea again because of honey. I have too much acid in my stomach and I had bad pollen allergies. Honey greatly reduces both problems. I have friends with acid reflux who I have turned on to honey as well, and they then became tea drinkers too.  Tea and honey is my lifeline.   I agree. Twinings was the tea brand that opened my eyes to better tea.  I drank their Prince of Wales for about 10 years. I also like their gunpowder green and still get that. Their jasmine green is nice and people who like Earl Grey, love theirs.  I still use their tins for my loose tea that comes in bags.   I'm not into flavored teas beyond jasmine green so I can't help with that side.  However, I'd try teas from different regions.  I love Yunnan teas. I find them to be very floral and naturally sweet. Fujian teas are a bit stronger imo. They are sort of 1/2 way between an Assam and a Yunnan. Ceylon teas can be very strong and have a taste close to what you get from a nice bag tea.  Darjeelings are some of the most sought after teas and can be the most expensive as well.  I really like the Lingia Darjeeling. It's not too expensive, but it is way better than a mass produced Darjeeling like Twinings or Harney and Sons have. Darjeelings have some of the most subtle flavors of any tea I have tried.   Also try different teas, white, green, oolong (lightly and heavily fermented) and black teas.  I wouldn't go crazy with expensive teas until you really know what you like. A decent mid grade will give you a good idea of what the tea type will be like.  	57

    :57 secs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtA869eH21c   I'm still trying to figure out how this is legal to sell since making the tea is supposedly giving you the same effect as taking an opiate in which you need a script for. Is it just some weird loophole that the FDA hasn't realized yet?  Don't get me wrong I love opiates so I am not bitching about it but it's fascinating that there isn't some kind of restriction on it.  I haven't tried making the tea yet either but I have been contemplating it.  Anything I should be aware of before I make it or any really bad side effects?   I've never had that happen with the blurred vision or nausea unless in a car.  I kinda wish in a way that opiates always made me feel crappy so i wouldn't love them like I do haha.   I was taking my normal dosage though and I have never gotten nauseated when taking them while not in a moving vehicle is why I was wondering.  I think i should just avoid taking meds and being in a car haha.   I did a search for it and doesn't look like anyone has posted about getting car sick while on opiates.  The other night I took 3 norcos while being a passenger in a vehicle.  Felt alright for about 30mins then felt really nauseous like classic carsickness. Just tried to focus on the yellow line until I got home about 20 mins later and felt like shit so I laid down for about 20 mins and felt better but it sucked and kinda ruined my buzz haha.  The last time this happened to me was about 8 years ago after I had gotten out of the hospital and was on vicodin I got car sick as well.  I always have avoided being in a car while on opiates because of that first experience but 2 out of 2 times now I have gotten carsick while on opiates.  I never get carsick if I'm sober or even drunk I do better than when on opiates.   Did it.     damn. iggy pop holding you up is saying a lot!! haha   forgot about him for some dumb reason but my #1. chinese rocks.   gg allin haha   the only reason i was thinking it would be more efficient than swallowing the powder is because when i try that i usually choke on some and/or some gets caught in my mouth.  i thought if they went down to my stomach in a neat little package then dissolved that might work better.   it was a fine powder.  norco 10/325s   i usually just crush up my pills and swallow the powder but tonight i decided to parachute for the first time.  i did it correctly and didn't lose any powder but it is taking forever for the high to come on.  I thought it was supposed to be quicker this way than just swallowing the powder but i'm starting to have second thoughts. What are your guys opinions on parachuting versus just eating them or crush then down the hatch?   lol   haha c'mon guys calm down!!    I know i'm not knocking those people.  Just had to agree with the guy who doesn't like that word haha.   Oh well. I don't insufflate or however you say it haha I take my pills orally.   I have to agree with callmedarlin as I have never heard the term " insufflation" in my life and it does annoy the fuck outta me. I had to google that shit just to find out what it was......   I dunno go try to buy some and get back to us haha   I get blood tests done monthly and one thing they check is my liver.  I have been on 5/500s for about 4 years and recently switched to 10/325s.  My liver readings are slightly and i mean trivially high. my alt serum test is at 40 which is 3 points higher than recommended. What really made my liver readings go threw the roof in the past was when I was drinking a lot of alcohol on a daily basis at that point my liver reading was 150!! Since I have stopped drinking almost completely my liver readings are back to normal.  I don't know if this answers really anything about your question but it does go to show that the liver is capable of repairing itself when a person stops abusing it like i was at one point.   they are 7.5s. watson 387   http://imgur.com/6fm02NX   ok its an opiate like medicine....   I have been prescribed it yet I have never taken it just because i thought it was pointless for a high and I have heard weird things like what you explained about tramadol as well that made me not really want to take it haha.   if you are just looking for tramadol i'd say you are ok.  that seems to be the go to opiate that doctors rx because its supposedly harder to get addicted to but that is just what i have heard so i'm not certain....   I'm from the bay area born and raised until about 1.5 years ago. now i am in Chico. zzzzzzzz (snoring) haha   i only get my tats done sober   haha well it was from safeway which was located on a street so yeah i'd say your are correct!   yeah they have a ton of dispensaries here and i would assume they might come in pill type bottles. i wouldn't know i don't smoke.  and yeah thats nice about the bag. i totally forgot about that since i've never bought a crown royal bottle before.   I guess it's a bit hard to sense sarcasm over type!!  i think you guys looked into this whole streets thing a bit much haha   too late already did last night and i'm here to tell. that is just how street i am lol   crown royal maple. its a seasonal thing.   sorry i'm such a noob. i am from the streets and don't really fuck with the net but here:   http://imgur.com/mt6Nf      ha this is good. never seen this or the website it's on.   lovin the old peoples medicine reminder container haha!!   I know the money is tempting but these are worth their weight or more in gold to me!! i still might need to sell some to make ends meet tho....   If you really have migraines and cannot get a legit script that sucks.  have you tried to?     because i needed to take twice as many 5/500s and i didn't want to be taking too much tylenol and mess up my liver.     Damn i didn't know that. That sucks but at least im one of the people that can't tell  too much difference between them    Sorry i meant 1 hour 30mins. must of still been higher than i thought lol!!   What's 5 minutes refer to?   around 180 since i mixed some in of my last script.  they are for pain!! haha   yeah your right   my joints are pretty messed up in my ankles and both require surgery. i have the xrays/mris to back this up.  that is the main reason i take them but i did also just have a total mouth reconstruction in the last year as well amongst other things.   i mixed in some of my last prescription haha so there might be around 180.     haha yeah your right   train_subject7329 is from the movie bad santa lol if you've ever seen it!! I started on 5/500 generic vics and eventually just recently got bumped to the norcos cause i complained about the apap.  yeah they are all 10/325s if they are the yellow twinkies or the m367s. the m357s are the 5/500s i believe.  I take no more than 3 norcos a day. I have known of the CWE for years now but I am too scared to actually try it and potentially waste good pills!!   nice man you too!! i always dose the same so i should be good!! :)   thanks so much man. took 3 of em about 1/12 hours ago and still feeling them. i hate tolerance!!   never had oxys personally. i just never have seen em in CA. maybe its more of a regional thing.  how do they hit? any different than normal hydrocodone?  and yeah i feel ya, i'm 10 years in and only have my tolerence up to 30mgs a day but its really hard to keep that in check!   I had my appendix totally burst on me about 10 years ago and since then my number 2's havent ever been the same.  My opiate use also has impeded this as well lol.  I would recommend a fiber supplement which you know you can get at safeway, luckys, etc. or just get an enema if you are really blocked up.  Trust me, I have been there. Good luck my friend......   thanks so much!! i am finally in good hands legally i think!! i hope you have great opiate adventures.   thanks so much man!!! and it was all legal!! i almost had to go to the streets for it :(  i send good vibes to you!!!   norco twinkies/nannas!! at least 120 of em!!!finally got bumped up!!    the most i've ever had at once. i respect da opiates though and have decent self control.  love you guys don't overdo it!!  i'm about to sample these bad boys.......  http://imgur.com/LLnC4 and hey i know it's not much and i don't want to go saying this is pill porn either haha.   Well since i have tried all 3 i really haven't noticed too much difference between them but i do know most people favor the yellows   You should get a pill crusher unless you really like the taste!       Also called twinkies haha. That pill is an m367 just a generic norco   Guess how many. imgur.com/td81d   They are m367s not 357s   I believe they all are 325mg apap   I use them orally    What do you guys prefer? I know the yellows seem popular.  I feel that the white ones crush better though imgur.com/S1gOm   they sell this at Costco.   pretty much what has already been said. from my experiences drinking higher quality liquors tend to make a hangover not as bad or nonexistent.  ibuprofen, not tylenol if you need to take a pain reliever cause of the acetominophen in the tylenol.   Motorhead said it best- The chase is better than the catch.  Where I live its so dry and hokey pokey with people who have just pills that I have spent the better part of a day on a wild goose chase just to go home empty handed.  Maybe I should bump up to morphine or heroin since I know i can get that way easier than my lowly pharms........ anyways I feel ya !!   actually now that i think about it i only pay $10 for a bottle of 60 norcos via kaiser pharmacy!!  too bad i would never sell any, i'd make a killing.   $10!?!?! i need to meet your dealer!!   alright i'm in no huge rush but i finally think i figured it out and feel confident with it so i thought i'd at least try and log in.     uh yeah i think so too. just wondering I will ever be able to get onto it.   I just finally tried joining SR and it told me that they aren't accepting new users at this time.  Anyone know the deal with that?  I'm a total noob here with it so take it easy haha.   that area is pretty sketchy and there is a cop shop right in that area as well.  i have never tried purchasing anything from the TL.   damn that sucks. i just mess with pills and can never find anyone up here with norcos or anything!!   i live up near chico now but i'm from the bay is why i was lookin on there.  plus this area is dry as fuck!!   i haven't been that desperate yet to do any craigslist stuff.  hope it will never come to that.   yeah man there are a ton of em in sfbay craigslist but i am still yet to fuck with any of them.   weird. i guess don't believe everything you read! hah   also this thread reminded me to check my local craigslist.  found several interesting ads including this one that looks very fishy:   http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/hab/3497829163.html   isn't SR dead?  i read an article saying its thru.   i made a thread about this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/13flyu/craigslist/  might find some more info there.   thanks! and yeah i'm not necessarily trying to get a pain mgmt doc just for opiates :)  if there are other treatments to help my situation that they can introduce to me I am into it.  thanks!     i think my doctor just went off my word but i do have xrays/mris to prove that both my ankles are f'd up.  i'm not going in busting the doors open demanding more meds haha so yeah thats why i wanted to know what people thought.   i think i would need a referral, i dunno that's what i have heard.  I am just doing this mainly because i know my normal doctor is getting to the end of her string with prescribing me my stuff and i really don't think i should ask her for any more than i am getting already.  I don't use any other drugs than the norco, prescribed or otherwise so i don't have a problem with a pee test and i don't go on binges or abuse my meds so i should be good with adhering to some kind of policy that the pain mgmt place would make me sign.  thanks for the response!!   here's the deal i've been working with my doctor who is just a general practicioner at kaiser permanente for about 5 years now. she recently (and hesitantly) bumped me up from vicodin per my request that i was concerned about my liver. i have an app with her in early jan for just a check up.  I am thinking about asking her to refer me to a pain mgmt doc but not sure how she will react to this.  I am getting 60 norcos a month from her and I feel I am twisting her arm with just that amount not because I have been bugging her about upping my dose but I did hear that general medical docs have to be careful with the amount of narcotics they prescribe because of liability?  I just get a feeling i'm skating on thin ice at that amount lol.  Anyways, i'd like anyones input on my situation or experiences.  Thanks in advance friends!  	85

 I was thinking this same thing recently, and came to the conclusion that we need both subconscious and conscious control of our breathing or we would quickly die.   for example, if we always had only conscious control of our breathing, we would die as soon as we fell asleep.   and if it was only unconsciously controlled, we wouldn't be able to hold our breath, like if we were underwater, our body would be in control and continue to try and breathe.     partial eclipses are a thing.    That's a lunar eclipse.    Employers demand 24 hour work days.    I'm in Australia, so maybe not helpful, but I dropped out of high school, I've had some no experience required jobs, travelled and am now studying at university.  I don't think dropping out affected me much at all.     I'd assume they could survive in either places. But neither animal would travel the length of the globe without human assistance. And they exist in those places for the same reasons that gorillas live in Africa and kangaroos live in Australia. They evolved there, they're specially adapted to that particular environment and have had no reason to migrate to other places of the world     Same story. Incredible!   I didn't see anything but relatives on the eyre peninsula said something spooked their kangaroos. one escaped and two are injured.

I'd recommend Optus, for mobile phones, I've had the best experience with them,  good constant signal, reasonably priced,  good customer service. also Telstra and Optus are the only companies that work rurally,  if you wanted to travel around and use your phone I'd recommend sticking with either of those two.

I used to go in and manually sweep and shovel out the grain from the bottom of the cells, that was only a few years ago but since then they've made it a lot safer, only trained people can enter the cells and they use the electric sweep.     That's horrible, sorry.    South Australia.  viterra.     Its not too risky,  one guy I knew of was killed by a truck,  and that was a freak accident,  otherwise it's pretty safe, they employ some very stupid people sometimes who manage to stay alive easily.

I also know of a few people who have died in farming accidents,  it's tragic,  but you have more chance of dying in a car,  life always has risks   She,  and barleys the worst,  so I avoided that when I could,  wheats fine.       Its not that dangerous,  I broke my arm once but that was my own fault.   And one man was run over by a truck and killed.   But not that dangerous.

I used to leave hidden 'treasures' all over the place when I was a kid,  but I don't remember what or where.  But some day someone will find them.      Some people are over weight due to medical reasons, illnesses, medications, syndromes can cause sudden rapid weight gain.   my cousin gained a lot of weight recently and was diagnosed with PCOS, she had been skinny her whole life to that point and the weight gain caused her to develop severe depression,  which she is now medicated for, side effect of the medication is weight gain.    She is overweight,  but shouldn't be shamed.  If you shame all fat people,  you're also shaming people who honestly have very little control over their weight.  She's losing weight but it takes a hell of a lot longer and is a hell of a lot harder to lose it than gain it.    But also, shaming people isn't going to change them,  or help them, it just makes them feel awful.     corky lulu. brilliant   ;)   I do, have only found one joey that was already deceased, but I keep checking.

Me, male.    centrelink forms   for a long time I didn't get the fuss about Zac efron.   I get it now.    zooey deschanel    Every uni lecturer I've ever had.    Trying to decide which end gets the toilet. I've pleasantly experienced both options, and I found that cleaning vomit from the floor is preferable to cleaning horrible, death poop from your clothes and body.    dalmatians   I noticed   'lying, stealing, psycho scum' all over the face of my sisters boyfriend.    I overcame my fear of city driving by dreaming that I was an excellent driver.    is this referencing something?   They're all parents and/ or farmers/ farmers wives.    I've used sauce kept in the pantry my whole life, never once died from it.      You'd think with all languages on earth that there would be something. disappointed in humans right now.    I want to travel around Australia, camping and seeing the sights, just 'living free'   currently have uni, no money, no car, no tent, fear of murderers lurking in the bushes.    No translation. :,(   throughout my teen years I didn't care about germs at all, I hardly ever washed my hands, even after touching things like bus seats, covered in all kinds of gross. I would get mildly sick about once every 18 or so months and only for a day or two.  since I've started to wash my hands regularly and I'm not going out in public as often, I get sick every few months.   so, exposure to 'germs' plays a part in building a strong immune system.    Being moments from death and thinking of all the things I wish I had done.   although, my dreams suggest that I'm afraid of tsunamis.    I'm sorry, losing a pet is so hard. hope you'll be ok   You should probably see a counsellor     business is good?    Poor Nan   Is this one of those stories?   I read a book by Prof. Brian Cox in which he explains this, he uses very simple examples to explain something very complex. You should check it out.

I also asked my parents but they already stuck with two dogs I've saved and my sisters.  good luck, beautifully ugly dog.     What's this book called? A friend wants to know   This is a good way of looking at it, I deal with my problems on my own (or ignore them, on my own) although sometimes I wish I had no responsibilities, I do ok mostly.    I envy you, I see a lot of people that have just one of those things, but not doing well with the others, like good job but bad relationship, it's rare to see someone who has every aspect of their life under control and then also enjoys their life.   edit: from what I can tell, looking at the people around me.

PRIORITIES MAN! In this galaxy, you should know where your towel is AT ALL TIMES!! ;-)         Think of how obscured your vision gets when you cross your eyes. Thats only a few degrees "out of whack" if the orb of the eye was removed (but remain attached) your brain would have a very difficult time indeed, making sense of the information coming from both eyes.   Given enough time, (and keeping a constant angle between the eyes) your brain would eventually "figure out" how to put the disparate information together to re-form a whole binocular picture. People with extremely "Lazy" eyes typically have mostly normal vision, but need a couple weeks to "relearn" to see after corrective surgery.    I dont know about the tone sweeps, or echoing "sonar style" tones (Sounds like star trek original series SFX, actually) the pulsing static noise sounds a lot like interference from a cellphone reaching out to a tower.

 Today, while applying eyeliner I realized that every morning as I did this, the amount of liquid on the applier would run out after the right eye. I had come to expect this and it had become part of my routine to  re-dip my applier in liquid after my right eye so as to have enough for my left eye. My immediate thought following this was that the eyeliner knew that I had come to expect this of it and it was following some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy/confirmation bias and would run out on purpose so as to support my expectation.

 Just buy pasteurized eggs and don't worry about undercooking the yolks.   I love FTM, and theirs is not really a sound I've been able to find again. But, recently I stumbled across Closure in Moscow, and their two albums have excited me in a similar way to FTM. The two bands aren't very similar, maybe, but it might be worth a look.   There are no gourmet cakes "designed just to look good." That would preclude the label "gourmet." There are competition cakes or cake dummies, of course, but those aren't gourmet cakes, and they aren't intended to be eaten.  So, if you're suggesting that supermarket cake is better than styrofoam and other things that aren't supposed to be eaten, I completely agree.  As for whether supermarket cakes are "intended to taste good," I question that assertion. Sure, they're packed with enough sugar and artificial flavorings to pass without objection in many circumstances, but the primary concern is creating an inexpensive product. Not a great-tasting cake.   Will John Wick at least seem like a decent assassin in the sequel? He spent 80% of the first film getting his ass handed to him, and the other 20% failing to kill people with a gun at close range without using at least 5 bullets.   Or, on the other hand, you could be completely wrong about the cake in this picture (and cake in general), and that's why people are downvoting you.   First of all, you might have a point about sculpted cakes requiring a denser recipe, and thus flavor may be sacrificed. However, the cake in the picture is not a sculpted cake. It is two round tiers. There is absolutely no reason the inside of that cake couldn't be any recipe you can think of. And, for the record, dense cake does not mean flavorless cake (many people love pound cake, which is great for sculpting).   Second, fondant-covered cakes are not necessarily any less delicious than cakes without fondant. Leaving aside the fact that some people genuinely enjoy the taste of fondant (and some fondants are quite flavorful), the cake underneath the fondant doesn't have to be any different than any other cake. Just as much buttercream, ganache, etc. may be used, and the cake is identical if the fondant is peeled away (which is what many people do). Also, from that photo, I'm not convinced that cake is covered in fondant. The mosaic tier could easily be covered in modeling chocolate or some other medium, and the top tier could be straight buttercream.  Third, if you suggest cheap grocery store cakes are delicious or taste better than gourmet cakes, you pretty much lose all credibility. Grocery store cakes are the bottom of the barrel, food-wise. They're packed with artificial ingredients and decorated with hydrogenated oil. No thanks.   I'm really glad other people are willing to kickstart videogame projects. I sure as heck wouldn't do it.    If you say so. I would prefer to have liked something other people don't, than be so bothered by something other people do.     I liked The Order. I agree with your thoughts on the cool new tech, but I'm not sure why it was necessary to bash a game out of the blue.   These days, I'd bet only 1 red velvet cake out of 100 gets its pigment that way. Most cocoa powders are now processed with an alkalizing agent that neutralizes the acidity and prevents the red finish. Consequently, red food coloring is the norm.   Current price is generous. The savings I've realized in free games and discounts is staggering.   Jeff is 100% right about Guitar Hero Live.   Also... can't believe I didn't think of this one right away: 7 Wonders. Great game, plays fast, scales perfectly--all the way up to 7 players. One of the few games where more players =/= longer game.   Small World, maybe? It's great with three, though it does have a fantasy theme (if that qualifies as "nerdy"). It's a pretty lightweight game, easy to teach, quick to play. But, it has plenty of meat to it, so it's a good one to come back to repeatedly. It is pretty confrontational and competitive, though, and that might bother some folks.   If by "almost all of them" you mean less than half, then you're right. Nine films in production, only four of which are confirmed sequels. With two non-sequels being released this year. It's not all doom and gloom.  	14

Now you're just fucking with me. That program is no worse off now than it was before.   You get a second date.   I'm sorry, let me simplify my point.   i get the bowl ban being lifted since anyone who was involved is no longer w the program     Nothing, including the bowl ban and scholarships, should have been reinstated because they would discourage future cover ups.   The purpose of taking the wins, scholarships, and bowls are not just to punish the guilty but to dissuade future violations. So that next time a head coach, athletic director, or university president hears that one of their employees may be diddling children on their watch they will think it's worse to do nothing.   If Joe Paterno knew his legacy would be taken from him do you think he would have risked it by letting Jerry hang around?   If the AD/President knew their program/school would lose the money from bowl games, the competitiveness from scholarships, and the prestige they got from the wins would they have covered it up?   Take a look at how MLB handled Pete Rose. By banning him from the Hall of Fame and sticking with it you haven't heard of any other coaches betting on their teams because at least partially  it's not worth it.   Of course now that NCAA pussed out they showed everyone that it's worth covering up something as atrocious as child abuse because the consequences are laughable.   WTF! Putting football above all was why those wins were taken in the first place.              Whoa, whoa, whoa, too far! Delete Facebook?

       Please include book/author.  One of my favorite lines from Catcher in the Rye was "Ask her if she still keeps her kings in the back row."   Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita: "I talk in a daze, I walk in a maze, I cannot get out, said the starling."  Oscar Wilde, "Every saint has a past; every sinner has a future."  Finally, more than a line, but damn:  You know the reason The Beatles made it so big? I Wanna Hold Your Hand. First single. Fucking brilliant. Perhaps the most fucking brilliant song ever written. Because they nailed it. Thats what everyone wants. Not 24/7 hot wet sex. Not a marriage that lasts a hundred years. Not a Porsche, or a million-dollar crib. No. They wanna hold your hand. They have such a feeling that they cant hide. Every single successful song of the past fifty years can be traced back to I Wanna Hold Your Hand. And every single successful love story has those unbearable and unbearably exciting moments of hand-holding. ~ Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist by David Levithan.   How can the Mortal Kombat guys NOT have a Sub-Zero? Especially with Batman ganking Scorpion moves AND catch-phrases. Imagine how sick he'd look!

One would be The United Conservative Republican States of America (USRSA).   The other would be The United Liberal Democrat States of America (ULDSA).   We'd still be cool and everything, totally best buds, but governed separately.  Let's see who's doing better in 50 years.  **UCRSA:**  * Abortion is outlawed with a possible exception for rape and incest in some of their 25 states (states' rights).   * All or most gun laws are lifted, varying by state.   * School prayer takes place immediately before the required pledge of allegiance, although children may opt-out.   * The 10 Commandments can be listed in court houses, public schools, and other Christian references are allowed in generally public squares.   * Hostility toward non-Christian faiths, and especially secularism may cause a mass exodus of non-Christians.   * Same-sex marriage is outlawed with marriage defined in the constitution as one-man/one-woman. Some states may opt to allow for civil unions.  * Strict laws are passed to prevent illegal immigration with employers of undocumented workers fined or jailed.   * Illegal immigrants are exported.   * Even with 25 states, the UCRSA still outspends every other country on defense, continues war on terror. Efforts on homeland security are maintained or expanded.  * Tax breaks persist for the wealthiest Americans while social programs to benefit the poor are drastically defunded or cut altogether. Welfare is dramatically overhauled.   * The death penalty is subject to state law, with most states requiring capital punishment for at least some offenses.   * Drugs laws vary by state in terms of penal severity, but marijuana remains federally outlawed.   * Free market economy is minimally-regulated with corporate tax incentives. American corporations may therefore choose to be headquartered in the UCRSA over the ULDSA.  * The energy economy emphases oil, natural gas, and coal with expanded off-shore drilling, pipelines, and fracking. Environmental regulations are relaxed.  * OSHA compliance becomes optional. OSHA-certified companies may advertise their jobs as such.  * Minimum wage varies by state and is not mandated.   ______________________________________   **ULDSA:**   * Abortion varies by states, but is legal to some extent everywhere.   * Guns are heavily regulated, but some form of a firearm is legal in all 25 states, albeit with conditions.

No FE asked for. Four days later, the product is in my hand and vacuum sealed. I'll come back to review the actual product, but when it's advertised as "regular commercial" and at this price, you can't be too disappointed. DrWhite is ultra A+. Will do business again. HIGHLY recommended.   I've only ever had MDMA (I think), but what are the rolls like on these other substances? Any worth trying? Good alternatives?  4-MEC  Butylone  MDA  Methylone  MPA       I'm considering dropping a couple grand, but I can't afford to lose a couple grand. Is any vendor **THAT** trust-worthy?                        I know this has been asked before, but it's been a while, and this isn't just about "saddest." Was it shocking? Did it make you angry? Were you glad? Do you ever want them to come back? If they have come back, are you happy or mad?   I'm trying to choose a subject for my Anthropology final :)   My paper will be on applied anthropology, but I need to narrow it down as anthropology is apparently applied to nearly everything!                           Thinking of enrolling my 3-year-old daughter in a gymnastics class. Based on online research alone, I'm leading toward this place: http://www.gymnasticsofsanantonio.com/programs  Anyone have experiences with any place in SA they'd like to share?                     I want to get my wife gift certificates for a quality massage and a pedicure. It doesn't have to be the same place, but we're new in town (from New England), and she doesn't have a regular place for either one anymore. We're in the Ingram Park area just south of Leon Valley, but anywhere an hour drive or less would be fine. Thank you!                           DAE think "quantity" and "price" should be added to the sort options? Popularity and seller ratings are all well and good, but it's annoying to try and find pounds in a sea of grams, or trying to find the pricier bulk stuff out of over a thousand options.   For example, Marvel gets Batman and DC gets Spider-Man.   My pick? It may surprise you. Not Superman. Not Batman. Wonder Woman. Marvel already has a rich mythology with Thor, Hercules, etc., and related characters, and the Wonder Woman mythology would blend nicely. Besides, how many comics does Marvel have starring a solo woman?  Who would I trade to get her? Well, Wonder Woman is one of DC's "Big Three," or "Trinity," so it's going to take a sizable trade. I'd offer Daredevil, Elektra, Bullseye, Moon Knight, Power Man, Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, and The Fantastic Four.   My pick? Spider-Man. He'd be a shoe-in for The Justice League, and he brings a unique style and power-set to the DC universe.   Who would I be willing to trade to get him? I'd like to see what Marvel could do with some 2nd stringers like Booster Gold   Blue Beetle (Kord), but they'd probably need more in exchange for a heavy-hitter like Spider-Man. Throw in Lady Godiva, Fire, Ice, Power Girl, Captain Atom, Firestorm, Red Tornado and Hawkman if that's what it takes. If that's still not enough, throw in Captain Marvel. How could they resist?

I collect many titles, but not all, so some of them may have appeared by now. This is also not meant by any means to be a complete list.                                                                              I'm aware of  one-man/one-woman  one-man/multiple-women  one-woman/multiple-men  one-man/one-man  one-woman/one-woman  but is there multiple-men/multiple-women or just 3-or-more men or 3-or-more-women marriages recognized anywhere in the world?

Your body's name must be Visa, because it's everywhere I want to be...                                 My picks:  Justice League: International - It was just getting good when they canceled it.  Shadow Cabinet: An old Milestone series featuring Icon, Rocket, Donner, Blitzen, Iron Butterfly, Mechanic, Payback, Starlight, Twilight, etc.  Cyborg: I think it's pretty messed up he was promoted to be a core and founding member of the Justice League and doesn't have his own book.  Black Lightning: Very cool superhero who doesn't get the exposure he deserves.  Ragman: He looks cool and there just aren't a lot of Jewish superheroes. He could even join Batman Inc. and be the sanctioned hero of Israel or something.  The Creeper: An entertaining character who, in the hands of the right writer, can be a great read.  Lobo: Yeah, this character reeks of the 90s, but he's kind of like DC's answer to Wolverine.  Hitman: One of the best comics DC has ever published.  The Atom: The on-again, off-again Leaguer has some interesting adventures.  New Gods: It's kind of a classic, and Orion and Darkseid have already made appearances.          It could be artists or writers, but who's someone who gets a lot of fanfare you just can't stand, and why?  Personally, for writers, I have to say Frank Miller. While I loved everything he did up until 300, everything since has been awful.  For artists, ~~Scott Lobdell~~ Kenneth Rocafort, mainly for that [stupid pentagon](http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-21-at-8.54.15-PM-500x319.png) he obsessively draws on every nose.  **EDIT**: I want to add J. Michael Straczynski to writers. In terms of Spider-Man's worst enemies, Doc Ock and Green Goblin have nothing on JMS.                                                   Cowardice asks the question, "Is it safe?" Expediency asks the question, "Is it politic?" Vanity asks the question, "Is it popular?" But, conscience asks the question, "Is it right?" And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that it is right. ~ Martin Luther King Jr.         [Brian Eno "An Ending"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKw5mbcE7VY)  Listening to this song, filling the frisson, then read the top two comments. The second one (philipboydy) did me in. Frisson overload.                     If I were fortunate enough to be given the reigns to direct my own Batman franchise, the first entire trilogy would be focused on The Joker.     Batman: Year One - Gotham is established as crime-ridden city. We get Bruce Wayne's origin story and the rise of two warring crime syndicates: The Zucco Family and The Falcone Family. When Bruce returns, he begins his crusade as Batman and aids Lieutenant Gordon and DA Harvey Dent in bringing down the mobs, the most prominent of which is The Falcone Crime Family, which has their dirty work done by the mysterious Red Hood.     Meanwhile, Bruce and Alfred attend a circus only to see two performers, The Flying Greysons, fall to their deaths with their acrobat teenage son left behind. Knowing what it's like to be orphaned, Bruce offers to take their 16-year-old son, Dick Greyson, as his ward. Batman vows to seek out the guilty party. It seems there's more to Haley's Circus than meets the eye, with ties to the Zucco mob and possibly more. Batman temporarily switches his focus to the Zucco Family, much to this dismay of Gordon, who wants the pressure to stay on The Falcones. Tony Zucco, the man responsible for the death of Greyson's parents, nearly gets the drop on Batman but is stopped by Dick, who shows up unexpectedly, having figured out Batman's identity after finding the secret entrance to the Bat Cave. Dick wants to kill Tony, but Batman stops him.     After some drama over getting involved, Batman leaves Dick with Alfred to discuss it later, now ready to go after the Falcones full-throttle. In the end, after a battle with Batman in a factory, Hood takes the plunge into the chemical vat. Batman thanks Gordon and the DA, leaving a gift on roof of the GCPD: The Bat Signal.     Batman: Year 2 - Lieutenant Gordon is now a Police Captain and facing an uphill battle surrounded by crooked cops and a Commissioner and mayor who are anti-Batman. Unfortunately, a new menace has risen in the form of the psychopathic Joker, who has gone to war with organized crime, with the remainder of The Zucco Crime Family having risen to go to war with the struggling Falcone Crime Family. The Joker has created pure chaos, creating problems for criminals, the justice system, and citizens alike. All of this is to get Batman's attention, with whom he seems to have some sort of vendetta.     Dick, meanwhile, is being put through intensive training as he continues to insist on involving himself in Batman's affairs. Batman is trying to physically and mentally break him to prove he's not cut out for it, but Dick is surpassing every expectation. In some respects, he's even a better student than Bruce was. Still, Batman warns about him getting involved.     Batman's hand is forced, however, when The Joker stages an assault on Wayne Manor as part of his war on the wealthy and powerful. Alfred is safe in the Bat Cave, but Dick is kidnapped, as The Joker is curious what Bruce Wayne would do for the boy's life. Alarms and camera footage alert Alfred, who communicates the kidnapping to Batman. Now it's personal.     Batman confronts The Joker, barely rescuing Dick before an explosion. When Batman orders Dick to stay put while he pursues Joker, but he doesn't listen. During an encounter, The Joker explains that Batman created him, causing Batman to feel guilt for all of The Joker's crimes. The whole ruse was a trap for Batman, getting Batman between the cross-hairs of the warring Zucco and Falcone families. While Batman deals with them, The Joker would be getting away, but he's stopped by Dick, who is crudely disguised with some scraps of green and red clothing he found in the alley. While Dick is able to handle Joker in the fight, Joker catches him off-guard with a crowbar and is violently beating him with it when Batman shows up and ends it. Batman carries Dick's beaten and bloodied body away and hands The Joker over to the authorities.     Joker is tried for his crimes with Dent handling prosecution, but The Joker manages to pull off an acid attack in court, splashing half of Dent's face. Joker is able to plead insanity as a plea-bargain to avoid a possible mistrial as Batman's citizen's arrest may be thrown out in court. The Joker is institutionalized at Arkham Asylum. In the end of the film, The Joker is introduced to his therapist: Dr. Harleen Quinzel.     Batman: Year 3 - Captain Gordon is now Commissioner Gordon and taken control of the police, and it's just in time as Two-Face has re-organized crime in Gotham and all but taken over. To make matters worse, an unknown and mysterious figure or organization mounted an attack on Blackgate Prison and Arkham Asylum, flooding Gotham's streets with criminals and maniacs, including The Joker. Dr. Harleen Quinzel believes she's the person best suited to bringing in The Joker and has a run-in with Batman that confirms what she already believed about him: he's the cause of the problems in Gotham and responsible for The Joker. When she finally finds The Joker, having returned to the now-condemned chemical factory, he lures her in and gives her a taste of what he experienced. She emerges Harley Quinn.     With so much chaos in the city with organized and disorganized crime, Batman finally relents and allows Dick to join him, but only as a sidekick, to hang back, to cover him, to help him out, etc. He is not to confront anyone directly. It turns out, they make an amazing team.     Two-Face is now struggling to control the criminal element as there's so much on the street, but he's amassing an army in the hopes of taking over Gotham completely. It's all-out war between Two-Face's empire and the Gotham police, and of course Batman, but Two-Face has a vendetta against The Joker, The Joker wants to kill Two-Face, Gordon, the police, Gotham in general, and Batman, and Batman now feels responsible for the whole lot of them.     The Joker retaliates against Two-Face for his repeated attempts to kill him, undermining Two-Face's plans, but in the final confrontation, neither Batman, Robin, nor Harley Quinn are able to stop Two-Face from apparently killing The Joker. Harley tries to kill Two-Face, Batman, and Robin, but is stopped in a combined effort. Batman tries to appeal to Dent, who finally turns himself in.     While being taken away, Dent reveals to Batman that he's been two sides of the same coin all along. He's always been the District Attorney, and it was really Dent who undermined Two-Face, not The Joker. He explains that his efforts to organize all the criminals and maniacs was so they could all collectively be put away in a set-up he devised. When he's asked to explain the Blackgate and Arkham breaks, he says that wasn't him, it was "Bane."     "Bane?" "He never gave me a name. He only said 'bane.' The bane of Batman, the bane of Gotham, the bane of everything. He told me this city wasn't mine, yours, or Gordon's. Gotham belongs to him." "Bane..." The last shot is Bane watching Batman through binoculars as Batman closes the doors on the ambulance Dent is in. Quietly he says, "Yes, Batman. Bane."     The fun part is, when you watch the movie again and look really hard, Bane can often be seen somewhere in the background, just watching.     Batman: Year 4 - In part 4, Batman   Robin are forced to constantly put out fires, sometimes literally. A cat-burglar is confronted and put on notice, Firefly is spreading dangerous arsons, Zsasz is a serial killer on the loose, the chemist Scarecrow has released a fear-toxic causing people to go mad, an eco-terrorist calling herself Poison Ivy is causing havoc, a man called "The Penguin" has taken over organized crime in the absence of Two-Face, a mad scientist calling himself "Freeze" has frozen half the city, and some idiot calling himself "The Riddler" is committing crimes and leaving clues. Batman   Robin are able to bring Firefly, Zsasz, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and Riddler to justice, but not without consequences. Batman has been badly burned, stabbed, psychologically scarred by fear toxin, worn down by Poison Ivy's toxins, and mentally exhausted by The Riddler. When he finally agrees to Alfred's demands that he come home and rest before dealing with Freeze or Penguin, he checks in with Robin, who is still doing recon on The Penguin and Freeze, and then he arrives home to the Batcave. Once he accesses the secret entrance to the mansion, he finds Alfred unconscious and is then attacked by Bane.     Bane takes a physically, mentally, and psychologically exhausted Batman and kicked the ever-living shit out of him right into the Bat Cave for an epic battle. He reveals that he (obviously) knows his secret identity and that he's been lying in wait since the beginning to take Gotham from Batman. In the final scene, he breaks Batman's back, drops him to the ground and says, "Broken and done. Gotham now belongs to Bane."     Batman: Year 5 - One year after the breaking of the bat, a now-20-year-old Dick Greyson has assumed the identity of Batman with one instruction from Bruce: do not confront Bane directly. The first part of the movie is the new Batman taking down the tragic villain Freeze.     Not only is Dick doing an amazingly good job of keeping the Batman myth alive, but a new presence has emerged in the form of what the media has dubbed "Batgirl." It appears Catwoman is at least sometimes on the side of righteousness as well, so Dick isn't entirely alone out there.     Bane doesn't control Gotham yet. The Penguin still controls half of Gotham, and they're warring constantly. Bane doesn't go after this new Batman right away because he seems to be focused on Penguin almost exclusively, so he believes he and Batgirl to be unconnected to the original Batman.     With a budding romance between Dick and Batgirl, who is Gordon's daughter, Catwoman lurks in the background, possibly jealous, and Bane hopes to use this. She's been caught stealing from him a number of times, and when he finally gets his hands on her, he lures her to his side. He wants her to work directly with the new Batman and Batgirl to take down The Penguin, which they absolutely do.     Catwoman turns on them, which sets them up for Bane. He says he'll take pleasure in breaking two more bats, which he may very well accomplish, but Catwoman double-crosses Bane, setting him up for his own downfall at the hands of Batman and Batgirl. Bane still manages to get the upper-hand thanks to his Venom, but that's when a Batwing flies overhead, a smoke bomb his the ground, and when the smoke clears, the real, original Batman is standing tall in a modified, armored, cybernetic- enhanced suit. Catwoman, meanwhile, gets away with much of Bane's fortune, so she played him for a fool.     Bane and Bruce battle it out as Dick and Barbara clear the area. Bane is enhanced by Venom, and Bruce is enhanced by his suit, so it's a pretty fair fight. In the end, Batman takes down Bane and reclaims his city. With Freeze, Penguin, and Bane out of the picture, Gotham is safe again.     Finally safe in her own home, Barbara enjoys some quality time with her dad. There's a knock at the door, she answers, BLAM! She's shot through the spine by The Joker.     Batman: Year 6 - The Joker is back. Two-Face didn't kill him after all. Yes, he was tossed into heavy machinery that apparently ground him up, but the remains turned out not to be his. The Joker takes Barbara Gordon and kidnaps Jim as well. Now it's up to Batman and Nightwing to save them both and finally stop Joker once and for all. This movie would basically be an adaptation of Alan Moore's "Killing Joke."     Nightwing spin-off movie follows Year 6.                       Ah, that delightful meme is going around Facebook again: Dear god, why do you allow violence in our schools? "I'm not allowed in schools." ~ God.  1. An omnipotent being is not "allowed?" Doesn't sound too fucking powerful to me.  2. Just to clear something up, god is "allowed" in schools; god isn't allowed to be forced upon students. There's a difference between having a right to worship and having someone else's religion shoved down your throat.  3. So the argument here is that god is either too weak to be where he isn't wanted (by some), is too butthurt by the slight, or it isn't important enough for him to "break the rules" and intervene? So this meme basically shows that your god is impotent, petty, uncaring, sucks and is unworthy of worship.  Nicely done, Christians. Point well made.   Not terrible, but definitely not a fun night. I took entirely too much 2CE (a dab'll do ya) and the whole world just fell apart on me. The shit came on like a freight train. Before I could even react to an emergence of fractal patterns, suddenly, everything around me transformed into wild animations, and not simple shapes, either. For example, a tree in a neighboring apartment complex turned into a cluster of Chinese dragons desperately trying to untangle themselves. I actually said out loud, "How is that even possible? Where's the context?" My wife was too overwhelmed to answer.  I tried to relax and watch Fantasia, but that wasn't working out. I went out to smoke a cigarette, but the smoke trails were interacting with everything confusingly, and I mentally projected that everywhere. I ended up just going to bed, but it was dizzying because the closed-eye hallucination were a thousand time worse. I couldn't control my thoughts, and even rationalizing that I willfully took a drug and that's why this was happening became a difficult thought to hold onto. For the first time in my life, I mentally wished for a trip to end. I wanted off the ride.  I'm not at all mad, though. I'm 31 and started getting into psychedelics with LSD when I was 18. I've had plenty of fun with LSD and shrooms, and this was my third time with 2CE. I thought I was immune to the fabled "bad trip" and had far too positive an opinion of tripping to be subject to such a thing, but I learned a valuable lesson: I'm not invincible, there is such a thing as "too much," and moderation can be a beautiful thing.  Now I'm curious. What's the worst trip you've ever had, what drug was it, and was it because you took too much, or the conditions were all wrong?         Full disclosure: I'm putting the finishing touches on my final, which is a paper on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*. I've read it, I've watched two film adaptations, I've got additional sources, but are there any Shakespeare scholars or experts here (or just fans) who have special insights they'd like to share?   I'm not looking for someone to write my paper for me. I'm looking for new ways of looking at things, different interpretations, historical contexts I may have overlooked, hidden meanings, etc. I'm sure my professor has read hundreds of papers on Shakespeare, and I'd like to give him something he's never read before. Thanks!                           Lame example: You can't have your cake and eat it too.  What else would you do with cake but eat it?      FDR and Johnson were two of the more socialist presidents our nation has ever had, both bringing about sweeping reform and program implementation, some of which is still in place today, from FDR's social security to Johnson's Medicare   Medicaid. Yet, knowing from history the fantastic improvements that were made via implementation of such programs and economic booms experienced under such leadership, why do you suppose socialism has long been a dirty word in this country? It seems many of the same people who would slam big government and demand reductions would never want to part with social security, Medicare and Medicaid.  Is it, perhaps, cultural? Is it historical? Are we a product of the uprising that brought about our Independence, as such that we are the freed rebels in constant fear or oppression and tyranny? Is it just the Spirit of '76 that lives on in us? Is it remnants of the Red Scare, The Cold War and McCarthyism?   The title character is villainous scum! Am I actually supposed to feel sorry for him when he dies?   At the beginning of the play, Richard breaks the fourth wall and invites the audience to live vicariously through him, but after the first few scenes, he just... stops. Why would Shakespeare abandon that device? More importantly, why do it at all? It seems like he had an idea and was doing something differently, and then forgot. It seems odd to start that way and not follow-through.   Since discovering r/shakespeare, I've really begun to appreciate Shakespeare more, especially in the discussions where an expert comes in and shines a light on something I never would have known or thought of.  That makes me wonder; what mind-blowing Shakespeare theories do you have? It could be any of his plays, Shakespeare himself, or differing ways of viewing certain characters, motives, lines, etc. Fan theories, different perspectives, historical knowledge... anything a Shakespeare fan might find eye-opening.                                                                  I used to just slap ham and American cheese on bread with some mustard and call that a sandwich. I was wrong.   My sandwich:  1. Warm a pan with butter in it so the butter melts while you're building the sandwich.   2. Once the butter melts, add two strips of bacon.  3. Take two slices of stone-ground 100% whole wheat bread.  4. On one slice, add Southwest spicy mustard.   5. On the other slice, add mayonnaise.  6. Add a slice of jalapeo jack cheese to each slice of bread. If you want a spicier experience, Cabbot makes a habanero jack cheese.  7. Choose a slice and add one slice of fresh tomato, off the vine, never having been refrigerated.   8. Alternately layer deli sliced ham and turkey at a deli slice thickness of 1 until you have a stack proportionate to your appetite.   9. Add deli pickles. Two or three should be fine.  10. Top it all off with one crunchy and crisp slice of iceberg lettuce.  11. Close the sandwich and press down on it hard to keep everything squished together tight.   12. Remove the bacon when it's finished cooking. And set it aside on a paper towel. In the time it takes to build the sandwich, the bacon should be done.  13. Throw that bad boy sandwich into the pan with the bacon grease and butter and fry it up. After about a minute, skillfully use both hands and two spatulas to flip it over to cook the other side. While trying, try adding a bit of Goya Adobo. It doesn't take much.  14. Remove the sandwich and add the bacon.  15. Eat sandwich.  16. Orgasm.   PS: I want to try your sandwiches. If you try mine, let me know what you think. I will gladly let you know if yours is better than mine ;-)   I was surprised to search r/Shakespeare and not find a single reference to the Tudor myth. Does anyone have any insight on the accusations that the histories (only English histories being labeled as such while Scottish and Roman histories fall into "tragedy") are Tudor propaganda, and that Shakespeare is, in fact, the history's greatest propagator of the Tutor myth?     	192

Thank you.    Just a basic shape like on a puko knife or japanese knife.   Ha ha! Pre- Murica!   This actually made the top 40! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxgagXVqZZM   Nope! Same with oil change.    The right act like loud mouth overbearing baboons because that is how they see their fan base. The left act like better than you strutting peacocks because that is how they see THEIR fan base. In fact, none of them give a shit about all the social issues they go on and on about other than how many votes they can get.Who ultimately wins out of all this? BIG MONEY! They are all just hogs at a trough and if they have their way we will end up just like: Africa, India,South America...pick one.   Nice! If you ever make another like this I would be interesd in buying one, with mabey a slight change in handle shape.   Yeah yeah ,bite me.   I still hate this fucking show.   Took me about 10 years to figure out what he meant ,Ha ha!   Am I the only one here who got the joke? FYI most people I know who abuse welfare and food stamps are lazy fat ass white women.   I hate this fucking show.   Imitating Hoss from Bonanza always seems to work.Condescending city guy: "How's it goin there chief?"  Me: "Right fine, lil' fella!" Irate woman: "Blabbity blabbity I have never blah blah blah!" Me: "Eeeeasy big fella!"   Ha Ha! That one made me laugh!      If you fuck up a relationship, you have one right...The right to pay...and pay...and pay.   I was blinded by digg,...and then digg was gone.   Classic uncirculated doorstop.   Worked at a small restaraunt and Ben Vereen came in with a small party.After cooking their meal,I peeked out front to get a look at this ever smiling old school entertainer, and he was tearing his son a new asshole for screwing up the delivery of some equipment.   Same place, Frank Gorshen comes in to drink at the bar, my boss offers to buy him a cognac if he will do the "Riddler laugh" which he did,quite loudly.We all cracked up, and then it just  snowballed and went on all night.

Nice work!   The only sports I watch are racing, (any thing but NASCAR) and boxing sometimes   3 Thumbs up!   It,s already happening here in the US. A few years ago there was a drought and Georgia was theatening to go to war with Tennessee over a shared lake on the border.Meanwhile the Gator-aid plant in Georgia continued to use million of gallons of water every day. It is  illeagal to harvest rain water in Colorado. Ever see a picture of the fabulous fountains in Vegas? A few miles down stream people are starving because what once was a river is now a muddy trickle. Where I live, companies are lobbying for the right to drill for gas by pumping thousands of gallons of chemicals deep into the ground and for up to  a quarter mile or so laterally.In pennsylvania, where this has gone on for a while, people can light their well water on fire and whole towns have been ruined. The gas comany will supply them with trucked in water while they drill, but after they move on they are fucked. This is just in the US,it is 100 times worse in third world countries and the propblem is not the population, it is the corperations.

No thanks,I hate eating the rich, they are too gamey and taste like bullshit.   Sorry dude.   Good point, I too have noticed "bragging rights" syndrome. It's usually about brands, but what really bugs me is the whole "super steel" thing. There is no super steel,different steels are made for different purposes, period. D2 is good for a camp knife while  carbon steel is better for a butcher knife,VG10 holds an edge forever but if you use it to chop wood or bone it chips and takes forever to sharpen. 440c is a good all around choice used by Buck and many custom makers for years. If it's well made and works it's a good  knife IMHO.   Getting married.   Don't like it ...don't watch it. Don't like it... don't listen to it.

 Christian Rummel was absolutely awesome! I loved having him as the narrator. They let me hear one of his voice samples, reading my stuff, and I remember thinking, Holy cow. This dudes really into it. He did an absolutely phenomenal job. I didnt have a choice, but I wouldnt have chosen different.  Ah, the post-apocalyptic genre. First, Im glad that its becoming a genre all its own. I think it deserves that. And where its heading? Man, it could go anywhere, thats the beauty of it. Or terror of it, depending on how you look at it. I think people will start to move away from zombie and I also think people will start to move away from describing the period of collapse itself, because its been done on so many different permutations. However, an apocalyptic event (virus, EMP, nuclear war, you name it) that collapses current world society? Well, what grows up in that vacuum? The possibilities are almost limitless, and frankly Im pretty jazzed about it. Ive actually been doing some pretty substantial writing behind that concept. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.  Youre absolutely right about the quantity out there in the post-apocalyptic space, and particularly with zombies. Now, Ill admit I havent read it yet, but I thought the concept behind The Return Man by VM Zito sounded pretty freakin original. Cool idea there.  Nowwhy are post-apocalyptic books so popular? Man, thats tough to answer. Some sort of global consciousness that things are going downhill fast? That were heading towards something bad? Maybe. I dont count anything out. Maybe its just a fad. On a purely practical level, I think it makes great stories. Where else can you distill people down to their nuts and bolts, than at the end of everything? People act the way they act in society because we have rules. You take away the rules, people will act different. People will be who they truly are, not the face they put on to be socially acceptable. I find that concept fascinating, and I think its fertile ground for compelling stories.   It is, isn't it? I use "Mane and Tail." That's the secret.   Ahahahahaha! Ladies and gentlemen, my former partner!  And I yell "America" any chance I get.  	3

             For me it had to be when I saw this kid, must of been like 12 or something, come out of the store with his dad holding a pack of cookies. He looked really happy with them. Then he saw a homeless guy and his dog sitting near the entrance of the shop.  He stopped, hesitated for a second and then went up the guy, giving him his cookies. He also asked if he could pet the dog, I could see the dad wasn't to excited about that but let him proceed. He then walked away with an even bigger smile, as if he knew what he had just done was nicer then wat I'de say 75% of adults would ever do. Really brightened up my day.

Important: I'm not a native english speaker and I will try to make this nuanced as possible.  IHonestly, 've wasn't a huge fan of Idra, he was once one of the best zergs out there but then eventually just got passed by others. Nothing bad there, but he kept his 'BM' behaviour and 'I'm the best out there attitude', something wich I tought was a pretty dumb thing to do with no results to back that up. I tough that he would just keep on sinking, trying to survive on the name he once made for himself.   Now, I must say tough, I was really impressed the last few times I've seen him play on stage, he seems to have really dedicated himself on reaching the top level again. Wich was partially what made me open his stream this evening when I was bored. There, I was pleasently surprised, I found a well-playing Idra, explaing his tactics to his viewers, interacting and not calling people bad every 5 seconds. I really enjoyed it and even felt bad for him and the other viewers when he had to stop streaming because someone tought it would be funny to do the Clan Invite glitch thing.  Just an honest story I wanted to get out there.  TLDR: Idra improved and cleaned up his act imo, best of luck for him in the future.   Hi,  So I recently upgraded to iTunes 11.

I prefer a long bed as I will be using it for holding my kayak and summer sports gear.   This will be my first truck. What should I be looking for?

I had entered a contest on Becks website to win a prize package. At the time I was 21 years old, living in a rented room in a band house and barely used the internet.   A friend of mine bought me tickets to the Beck show at Key Arena as a surprise. It was the Midnite Vultures tour and I freaking knew it was going to be a god damn funky ass shit show. I brought my "demo tape" of  various songs I had created on a shitty four track in my back pocket. I snuck in a joint and had my robot dancing shoes on.   Ths show, of course kicked ass. The one thing that really stood out was when he did Debra he started it by being lowered down on a king size bed. I thought that shit was the smoothest thing I had ever seen (and still do). At some point I threw my tape up on stage only to see some stage hand kick it back off :(....  Cut to about 3 days after the show I receive a good size package in the mail at work (that was the only address I really trusted at that time) I open it up to find every Beck album released to date...signed by Beck, a t-shirt and a letter that explained what everything was and it said "we hope you enjoyed your VIP experience"   WTF!!!!  I rev up my bosses beige IBM desktop and sign on to my hotmail (which I never checked...apparently) to find an email congratulating me on winning the prize package. I was to pick up my 2 VIP passes at will call at the same fucking show I went to.   Yep. That happened.         Won't let me interact with it. I press the play button but it just freezes everything and closes baconreader. I even downloaded the vimeo ap but it doesn't even ask if I want to use it when opening a vimeo link.

You shouldn't let other people's opinions determine your actions. What you find attractive about a person is so subjective that anyone else who judges has no validity.  Interracial couples are great because each person gets to experience, learn and adopt a part of another culture. They get to share traditions and food. It's a positive for all since each person becomes more cultured by the experience.   Weak ass click bait title.

Because the clitoris is so sensitive, Brandon says, she sees women being more specific about their preferences for how they want to be touched. "[Men] rarely tell me, 'She touches too hard, too soft, she tickles, her hands are cold.' Women say those things all the time about how men touch their vulvas, clitorises included. Women are finicky, and so are their clitorises."   Men rarely say anything to women because they're either too shy or too awkward to voice their concerns or they think criticizing the way a womam touches their penis will discourage further handjobs.  Well, I'll do a service for most men by saying: Most women's handjob technique is horrible! Guys, speak up and tell your women how to properly give handjobs.   10/10 would hit.    I concur.

 If it does what it says it does, it's ok for the price.  However it's not telling you what grade of metal.  Just "not pure gold" or "not pure silver".  You get much more detail with XRF.   The infinite thickness for gold is 10 microns. Gold plating is usually thinner than that. So our unit can see the underlying metal and give you a warning.  Even reaching the limit, it looks at the ratio between the M and L shell kEV cps and can also give you a warning.  Super engineered counterfeits can fool XRF for sure, but those are rare and costly to make.  What people are doing is getting stainless steel (austenitic aka doesn't respond to magnets), stamping them 18k and then going place to place to see if someone will buy it as white gold.  Stainless steel will pass the 18k scratch acid test, but it instantly shown on XRF to have no gold.  Same with grandma's jewelry.  People will swear up and down that this is a pure 18k gold ring that has been passed down for generations, but the XRF will spot regular plating and costume jewelry in 5 seconds or less.  XRF also helps you pay for exactly what you get when it is authentic.  14k gold should be 58.5% gold.  However, most of the stuff made in recent years is 55% gold.  So if your item passes the 14k scratch test, and you are paying out on 58.5% by weight, then you are losing money when you go to sell it to the foundry who will do an fire assay and get the correct %.  Most big pawn/coin shops will have an XRF unit.  Hardcore Pawn has 2 of ours that they use on the show occasionally.    Acid tests aren't even that accurate, but they are cheap.  I sell xray units that give precise gold concentration and tell you if they could be fake.  They are $18000 though.   my step dad has a  08 g35xS sedan and I have a 08 g37s coupe.  The coupe handles more like a 370z while the sedan handles more like a maxima. So, yeah there is a noticeable difference.   You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you didn't stop to think if you should.   I'm right in the butter zone.   Couldn't keep my unlimited data, but I'm not on the ones that up your rate if you do a 2 year thing.  I COULD save $20 or so by going to an EDGE plan and then having the phone be $25/mo for 24 mo.  But it's cheaper to get it subsidized and keep the current plan.  There is just a new 2 year contract and a ETF if it's canceled. like I said, I'm not going anywhere, so why should I spend $600 when I can spend $250?   The newest plans are like that.  "0 down and $20/mo extra until it's paid off."  I have a slightly older plan.  No extra fees or any garbage like that.   I'll keep my same plan, not an edge plan.  Just $250, no extra anywhere outside of an ETF, which isn't an issue because I'm not jumping ship until someone has better LTE coverage (not likely).  Sell my current phone for ~$250 and it's a net 0 swap for me.   some people want it subsidized.   So did DMX   If you can find a G37, I'd get that. But the engines are really bulletproof.

Looks like I'll just have to wait.   construction, plumbing, welding...any blue collar field, etc  Women can certainly do those jobs, but they tend to be much more physically demanding.  The average man can do those jobs and get worn out pretty easily after a day of work in training.  The average woman will have a far tougher time accomplishing the same job.  Not sure what best describes this, "free market" maybe?  Of all the blue collar jobs, I would think electricians would be best for both sexes.  Lifting some wire bundles and running up and down ladders should be just as easy for both. Unlike normal construction/framing.  That's a lot of weight you are always moving around.

I uninstalled the AW, restarted (not reset) my watch and reinstalled the watch.  I think I had to hit menu, then connect again and it finally popped back on.   Good racing game, but I prefer the racing sims more like Gran Turismo.  Can't wait to see what Project Cars comes out with.   They are forced induction.  So they force more air into the engine.  If you can get more air in there, you can get more fuel (air to fuel ratio, or stoichiometry, says when the mix will ignite) .  More fuel = bigger bang.  Bigger bang = more power pushing the cylinder down.  Now how they function it's different between sc and turbo.  Turbo's use the exhaust to spin a turbine on one half of it, when then sucks more air in on the other side.  Super chargers use the belts of the engine to drive the turbine (or other type).  Supercharged cars usually have no delay or lag between when you hit the has pedal, while turbo suffer from turbo lag from them taking some time to spool up to pressure.  You rarely see supercharged 4 cylinder cars, but 6+ cylinder can go either way.     Can't stand them.  It's the most idiotic thing on TV and I can't figure out how they keep getting renewed.  I did respect them more when I found out that they were behind some of the Old Spice commercials.  Those are funny.  Their shows? Not so much.   When you are trying to record something at 250000-1000000 times per second, you can only get so much data from each frame.  Eliminating color saves a boat load of data.

If you mostly get calls from cell phones, the app seems to tell you "this information is not available to the public"   That's a Moto thing more than android.  But it's pretty cool.

I can't think of any watch that would stand out in a movie that's not something anyone can go out and buy.   What movies would you know the watch from?  Technically the bond one is from the video game   Had it for a year and I had a 100mbps connection.  It was noticeably slower on even the best one.

 Just get a Spark Core, it's for $39 and they have amazing software. Check spark.io   Thanks! Yea he's wearing it in his [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Human-Jukebox/)      Check out the Arduino shield: [1Sheeld](http://1sheeld.com) it lets you use your smart phone easily with Arduino, you don't have to have that much tech. experience, with one line of code you can post on your twitter account from Arduino!         If you aren't familiar with [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com), it is a physical Arduino shield that connects to smart-phones using bluetooth and make use of their sensors and capabilities inside your Arduino sketch.  It is used mainly for rapid prototyping of your ideas. Instead of buying multiple shields and components to connect them to your Arduino, you can make use of your smart-phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity, gps, speech recognition, screen ...etc with out buying them individually. Currently we have more than 30 of those. You can visit our [website](http://1sheeld.com) or our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma) campaign to know more.  We are planning to launch a new feature to our platform. We will enable 1Sheeld users to connect to other 1Sheelds from their Arduino sketch using our Android app.   This feature will enable you to:  * Read a digital pin from your remote Arduino(s). * Write to a digital pin to your remote Arduino(s). * Write to an analog pin (PWM) to your remote Arduino(s). * Send string or float messages to your remote Arduino(s). * Get notified whenever an input digital pin in your remote Arduino(s) changes its state.  You have to have 1Sheeld board, an Arduino board and a Bluetooth-enabled Android smart-phone in EACH network node to make use of this feature.  Here is an example code for what the sketch will look like: http://pastebin.com/6AJdXZfY  So what are your thoughts? do you think it worth the effort? We think it will help people prototype connected-hardware projects and ideas easily. And if you think it is beneficial? what other features can we add?

 x-posted to /r/NotTheWire                    Yeah... I really do like the concept of crowdsourced volume buys though.  I'm sure its made more difficult with "premium" brands that exercise more pricing control.    oui, ca   I'm actually seeing it as a few bucks more on Amazon but with Prime shipping ,but point taken.  Looking at the discount tiers on Massdrop, their max discount rate, and their  comparison to MSRP (not street) ... Massdrop doesn't seem particularly impressive....at least this offer, perhaps others are.   Novel concept though for sure.   Man, I came here to the comments because I couldn't see the offerand didn't want to register just to see it.  And this, the first comment.  Thank you /u/MassdropBot !   I want to start numbering stuff like that here, in USD and see how it flies.    uh-huh.  noone ever thinks twice about ole Milton in the basement till the office is on fire.   yeah, how bizzare to see someone in a Batman costume at an amusement park.  Oh wait, you meant the girl in the fleur d'elise t-shirt?     Tractor chicken   It may be time to implement metal detectors at the building doors.   Exactly my experience. The vietnamese barbershops around me do actually a better job for 9 bucks (plus 3 tips always) than some of the fancy salons I've gone to.     yeah, just figured that one out but thanks for letting everyone else know.   Not sure why they did that ... it doesn't make sense to have the messy detailed interface come up first, and then make you click through (so to speak) for the more simplistic one.  I'll say too that a lot of recent Android "improvements" (realizing that the one we're talking about here is either HTC or ATT, not native Droid) in their UI are just backwards to me for the last couple years   No clue,but the default settings panel (with the shortcuts to wifi, bt, brightness etc) is gone now....    Nah, it was the initial boot screen that stayed on so long I thought it was bricked. Now that it's updated seems to be running normally.  Some stupid UI changes though, like removing the large settings buttons (ie the easy wifi/bt on off screen) and replacing it with normal settings. That one settings panel was the only good thing in there IMO.      This.  If you want peace, work for justice in it's broadest sense of the word.   "'It kills a lot of business,' he said."  Captain Literal.   ok then "fault of "whoever's job it is to realize that since year books were invented high school kids have been doing their best to prank them and someone who knows better needs to double check everything that goes into them."        woke up this morning to an update notification for my att m7.  Turned on wifi, plugged it in, started update.  20 minutes later ... bricked. Or so I thought.  Hit the power button, prompted for encryption pin.  Then went to the HTCOne boot screen and stayed there for like 10 minutes before finally moving to "updating android app x out of x".     So, could have sworn it was bricked, it's actually just really slow.   no smokehead is ever going to denigrate for asking how to start.  OTH, refer to grilling as "barbecue" and you'll likely get corrected.     or they could just not give a fuck, which seems the most reasonable  thing to do here.

Nothing stinks like putting down a couple hundred bucks of seed only to realize you jinxed yourself.     Hi all,   I'm trying to ID this ground cover... or it may be an actual grass.  When we bought our house this was the entire yard... very nice for "no mow" as it stayed relatively short and they would all grow to a uniform height, but over the years I beat it back.    Now it's resuring.  I'm half tempted to give it a part of  the yard, but after all these years I still haven't figured out what on earth it is, even with professionals looking at it. I even tried some grass and weed identification sites and still nothing.   Does anyone have any idea [what this is ?] (http://imgur.com/a/FA02X)     If you use a weed killer you won't be able to seed for a while.  I have 2/3 and acre and while I definitely will use a hose attachment for laying chems across the whole yard, for a small outbreak I'll use a hand carried pump bottle instead, or just a mechanical weeder. The nice thing about just using a mechanical weeder is they're actually pretty darn fast, get rid of the weed right there on the spot, no waiting and watching it all wither and turn brown then black, AND it leaves a nice hole like core aeration that I can then go drop some grass seed into.... most definitely a faster turn around time than when using chemicals.     I would concur with this.  And then for next year I'd plant some food and cover in a remote area of the yard and hopefully attract them to an out of the way place.    I've done anywhere from 1 to 6, kind of depending on what I need to do and how I feel.  I do have a specific goal in mind, but mostly I'm just enjoying running 5 to 10 k at a time.  I"m getting ready to go out now if you want to   looks exactly like my bathroom floor.no big deal, chop out the bad areas, block brace and replace.  or just replace the whole floor if  you want.... I did, so I could have a stiffer floor for tiling.    If you trust their ratings to be accurate, yes.  I don't.  If it isn't EN rated, I don't trust the numbers, period.  Every manufacturer who doesn't subject to standardized testing has huge variances in their numbers ... even I myself recently spend hundreds of dollars on a (different bag) that was "labelled" 15 degrees and is absoloutely, 100% NOT a 15 degree bag.      If you're Ok with carrying a 10 pound bag, great.    thanks !    That's not the best choice you could make.  The limit is only +1C, that's 5 degrees more than you expressed, close enough if you add some layers I suppose.  However, it's probably not using the EU standard ratings; those standard ratings are the only trustable ratings, so the temperatures they present could really mean anything.   The real problem though is that it's 4.6 kilo - that's over 10 pounds...completely unusable for backpacking IMO.   Fine choice if you're driving to a camp site though.   I agree with Mr. Slater.  Regardless of who actually hit the shutter release, it's his photo IMO   Hmm, if I wanted to hide from the law in Mexico I'd probably do it in a police station.  From what I read in the news those places are pretty empty and isolated.    I have some unsettled business to tend to.  In early April there was water galore. ... like literally streams crossing the trail in areas and you could get by with 1 liter just reupping frequently and camelling up at the streams.  What's the water situ like now  ?  Still bountiful ?    That's quite cold in my option (-20c ~ -4F) and would require a full on "winter bag".  That's not a problem, but finding one that's packable and light enough for backpacking near 100$ is a challenge.    I bought a bag for close to 300 that packs quite nicely and have personally used it down to 5 degrees.  Adding base layers and liners I could probably take it to -5 (F) no problem, but it definitely isn't a hundred dollar bag.     I experimented with it a few times, as well as with metal plates to distribute heat and help flow the smoke out more.  Ultimately just using the best cut of meat I could find and keeping the heat controlled (as in "stop checking the damn thing" ) produced far better for me.    that's some crooked ass shit right there. we need to stop treating crooked cops as administrative mistakes and start treating them like criminals.    I've collected a few stamps over the years.  Never once ever thinking they'd be worthy anything, more just because they're so cool.  I mean, they really do put a ton of great design work into those things.   For more pointed advice, tell us:  * What the "colder" region is.  * Time of year going out. * What purposes - a bag that's perfectly suitable for camping may be inapproriate for walk in camping or backpacking * Your size.  Yep, different manufacturers make different sizes. * Your budget   The one with a fire extinguisher in it ?    I believe it.  DC music has always been a bit known for more conscious music.     Yep.  they have staff researchers who do nothing but get smart on specific topics.   IIRC, the gentleman who spins Saturday Night Hot Jazz on WAMU is a staff researcher.   Yep, you have to register in Madison for a card first.   There's also a public library on 7th SE.      I like rap battles and liked the vid ... wish there were less violent lyrics personally.   There's a Library by Congress ;)   I suck at biking, but I have a buddy who's really in to it and it's about time I went on a ride with him, I can ping him, that'll make 3.     I'm definitely an afternoon/ evening guy although on the weekends I could do mid morning. What I definitely cannot do anymore  is getup at oh dark and PT before work ;)  Actually heading to the gym right now for a treadmill tempo run before lifting.     ITS BAYSIDE KILL IT, KILL IT NOW    Super slow runner here, always looking for a support network.  I can push 3.7 12's around Centennial, 13s when with a partner (talking) and I've done 6.6 around it before at 15s. Any other turtles out there want to do some long super slow distance together ?    Shoot me your mobile and email, next time I go for a hike I'll give you a shout if you like.  If you run I could use a running partner, I'm too slow for my current one.  I'm also in Wild Lake.   Patapsco has several bike trails.   I don't ride, but my biking friends tell me their quite good, and the NA Mountain Biking Association maintains additional trails in the area as well.       thanks! I always intend to try seeds, but it never happens so every couple of years I stumble across seedlings and plant them, but the variety available isn't always my preference.  I would love to have a nice bounty of TAMs that my non heat loving friends  and family could enjoy.  And those Hatch chiles are just the best I've had, would love to have those freshly available.   Dang man,  you're really lucky to have real tacos available as fast food.  We have taco bell here in Maryland.  Fortunately though actual mexican food seems to be growing in popularity so there are couple sit down restaurants that have good stuff ... but man that place looks fantastic !    I'm completely confused.  It looks like actual mexican food, but it also looks like fast food.   I'm also really hungry now. Where is that ?   Yep, special.   What country ?   Thanks ! I hadn't found them in my googling.  The seedlings were nice and healthy on arrival ?      Your personality made this really fun to watch.   Title says it all ... I'm not up to growing from seed but if there are any TAM Jalapenos or Hatch seedlings available in Maryland I would really appreciate knowing where.   Just bought a bunch of beautiful little seedlings that are ready for larger homes.  2x thai's (likely numex twi's) , 2x fish, and 4x jalapeno's.   I may just put the thai's in containers so I can move them around for maximum ornamental effect, as I've grown them before years ago and remember them as simply being too hot to cook with.   That would also make more room for the jalapeno's to grow out and yield.   Fish peppers I have no experience with though they seem as if they may make better ornamentals than eating peppers.     I have a relatively small bed prepared alongside the house, and I can't figure out what the full height of the mature plants would be so I can plant them in order of height.   So if you had these seedlings, how would you plant them ?    Wow, after seeing that I really want to hear you say "fuck you guys".  I bet you make it eloquent.    So am I the only person marvelling that they used a real life story for the ad ?    well said.    I see your point now ... it isn't exactly a discussion based post, but it's still a community oriented based post.  There are some things  I would put on CL before here, but if I wanted something for MY community, not the greater Balto region, then it would go here.  Personally, I'd rather keep things in my neighborhood first, my town second before resorting to all of Balto, so if I was looking for a cleaner and I could find the right cleaner for me locally first I would.  Dunno if that makes sense or not.   Second vouch for Colosseum.   It's definitely pricey compared to economy gyms like Fitness 19 and PF, but if you want to lift and lift right it's the place.  I'd been powerlifting for several months and spent just one hour with one of their trainers (they have zillions) and learned a ton. Didnt know about  the groupon thing, wish I'd known about that...    hey thanks - unfortunately i'll be away but please remind me next time!    But...  but I thought Casino's were the epicenter of morality and responsibility and would only attract wealthy out of state citizens looking for mildly exciting entertaining while donating to our state Education funds.      yeah I gotcha     Bier Baron  Thank you! Is this basically BrickSkeller part deux ? Location seems the same, menu instantly reminded me of it, even the model of "over 600 beers".      hey thanks I was using the wrong key. stupid me. they sent two keys (one right, one wrong) and the wrong one fits just enough to seem like it's the right one not fitting.   if that makes sense.     That's actually not bad if they were truly jumbos.  I've paid more than that for mediums that were called large :(     I need to get a  john boat and get back out there myself....    Hi all, I bought some winters on new wheels as a complete combo online, and my mechanic mounted them. Invoice says they are  [montegi 128] (https://www.google.com/search?q=motegi+mr+128), with locking lubs that look like [this]  (http://www.amazon.com/Spline-Drive-Small-Diameter-12x1-75/dp/B008RCINW0/).  Thing is, with the key provided I can't get them off.  There simply isn't enough clearance between the lugnut and the wheel to fully seat the socket key, so it's rounding instead.  I honestly can't figure out how the shop got them on in the first place.  Could it be their key has a slimmer wall and fits better ?  Or maybe it's just one of those things where putting them on requires a lot less torque than getting them off ?   When I looked up the wheel and googled it, every picture shows lug nuts with internal threads.  Never seen that before, but it would explain why there isn't clearance for a socket.  I don't like locking lug nuts either ; don't live in a region where having my tires stolen is likely, and it's alot more likely to just present big problems with changing a flat than anything else.   I have special stripped socket removers that will probably get these off, but at the cost of destroying them... is it possible to replace them with normal nuts if I just go ahead and replace the lug bolts as well?   Thanks      Hey fellas is the Brickskeller still considered the bomb ?     tl;dr.   You obviously haven't dealt with the Md comptroller's office.  "Competent" isn't a word I would use to describe them.      out sourced, practice crab   Added to lexicon !! ;)   mine does at least. they have the ON *isolate* which is the best I've found so far in terms of having very few extraneous calories.    I'm mostly playing, but seriously over here they cut down trees along the Parkway to make room for condos.  Traffic is pretty fricking horrible around the clock now, and the beaches are so damn crowded....   I prefer to run and / or workout after work, so that I don't have a deadline and can take as long as I want.    I did a couple days backpacking over the break so when I finally came down out of the mountains I ate three breakfasts at once.  The waitress couldn't believe it.  But 3 days on mountain house and beef jerky .... believe it.   i also get my ON at Costco.  Don't remember the exact price, but remember than when I checked the price and checked  the quality of the ON (I get the isolate) it was a no brainer.    If you went from the couch to a 3 mile run than having flat feet probably has nothing to do with it; that's just plain ole "too much too soon".   If  you want to start running, I definitely encourage you to :    a) go to /r/running specifically and start learning more,   b) go to a Running store - not a sports store, not a shoe store, but a running store to get fitted with the proper shoes for your foot and gait.   The right shoes makes a big difference.    c) start  it very slow and build gains gradually avoiding injury along the way.   and don't forget to account for paying the man.    bears or bubbas ?   /r/ANormalDayInRussia   highways surrounded by trees.  heavily urbanized area to the countryside in just 25 minutes pristine beaches  Oh, so you left in ..... the 80's ?      I've been on long hikes where I start singing to myself.  After a point, I just need to hear music.  If I can't hear music, than I'll make music to hear.    yep, I hear ya.  It's kind of a "takes a ccw to spot a ccw" type bag.    Yeah, you know yesterday while playing around with relatives (food still cooking ? Lets make fire !) my daughter suggested I take a pencil sharpener to make shavings from sticks.  Pretty ingenious idea actually.   Its also pretty simple to light a lighter.  Lighters are definitely convenient, but I've definitely had them fail on me, fortunately not when I depended on them. So now I carry a light for convenience and speed, but also carry a mag/ferro and a couple wet cubers.    I see it as one is quick and easy, the other slower and a bit more of a pain but guaranteed.   this seams pretty reasonable.  Even though I backpack with a propane stove, I make a point of having two additional fires on me, one of which is a mag/ferro bar and some wetfire cubes.  If you can't start a fire with those damn things, you just can't start a fire.     yeah, good point, hadn't though of that... last time I carried a sidearm it was in a thigh holster, not exactly park friendly ;)    You wouldn't believe how much beef jerky, pepperoni, salami and pouches  of tuna are to be found on the AT.  That's all I ate for an entire 12 mile day.   Not to burst your ccw bubble but if  I were passing you on the trail, I'd immediately ask you what you were carrying ;) they scream 'carry pouch'.  they do look useful for "body storage separate from a pack" as you said though.     Just take all your stuff, and put it in a runner's pocket belt. The pockets stretch like pythons to swallow up more gear than they look like they would, and they're surprisingly comfortable to wear, and you can wear them next to skin 24/7 and put anything else you want (parka, clothes) on top of it so it's always with you.  Honestly though in your scenario, without more details (ie it's 40 degrees and getting colder, or you're 3 days from nearest town) than I'd just camel up on the river water, hoard the snickers, and start hoofing.   You should always know where you are when hiking as well, and know your bailout.  In other words, at any point you should be able to lose your map and compass and generally know the bailout route.  It's not as hard as it sounds - it's often as simple as "that draw takes me to hardball." You don't have to remember specific trails, distances, etc, just "in an emergency, if I remember nothing other than go down that draw or hike up that spur it will get me to hardball and then i can move fast or flag someone down".    You'd be surprised how many miles you can log in a day on minimal food, especially if you carry calorie tanks around your belly.  Snickers is very dense too.  Seriously.  I've done all-day strenuous hikes with a light pack on no food at all, but I have plenty of calorie reserves.  If the idea of drinking river water au naturelle doesn't appeal to you, and the area isn't abundant with springs (many of which I'd have no problem at all drinking from straight in a pinch) than carry a 25 dollar sawyer mini in your pocket.   Fishing kit ... LoL.  If you're ever in an area so remote that hunkering down and FISHING becomes your best survival option than I would hope that emergency step 1 would be to activate the beacon, step 2 would be try to locate satphone.     Funny what you noted about tent footprints.  I just got a new small tent and elected to pass on the footprint, since I intentionally paid alot of money for a very light weight tent. While on the AT I find a lovely campground to bed down for in the night and ... like so many campgrounds here in Maryland ... the sites are all gravel.    Since I hope to bring my dog into this new tent, a foot print would  help there as well....in this case going INSIDE it to help prevent her claws from piercing the gossamer floor.   I think one good thing about these lists however is that they get people thinking more about what they do and don't need, and thinking about the different angles to gear and hopefully helps them rethink conventional wisdom.     Also forgot, Bertha's in Fells Point.  Feels like for decades you'd see those Eat Bertha's Muscles bumperstickers *everywhere*   And if we're just including great places that aren't necessarily a "maryland unique" thing ... Ethel and Ramones is one of the best restaurants I've enjoyed in the entire Washington Baltimore region.  Cajun and Creole, all presented by a chef owner steep in one of the most famous New Orleans restaurants.   It's on my short list of favorite restaurants in the region, for sure.   Yep, pretty sure they're using pasteurized, forgot about that.    Yep, all depends on where you live/hike.     this is true. I do enjoy elevating my feet on my ruck at night though.     3 season tents during winter in the White Mountains My understanding of the Whites is that 3 of your seasons *are* winter.     INTERESTING.  It looks like someone decided to build a better mousetrap.  I like the large dump pouch on top, perfect for say ditching the hat/sunglasses temporarily.   I'm a little curious about these lines though:   water-resistant/breathable soft-shell fabric  /  100% waterproof fully-taped seams throughout   One of the benefits of a poncho is that it's a simple, single large sheet that shouldn't need taping.  This one also weighs 2.5 pounds, so I'd say it's probably best for non backpacking use.     Oh, there is.  LoL.   I have scolios and thoratic kyfosis. Years of pain, serious posture problems and occasional chiropracty. Bad posture to the point where people would say stuff about it.    Over the last several months I've made a big transformation.  Of all of it, I would say honestly that the biggest impact on my posture has been the yoga, deadlifts, and rows. Can't say enough good stuff about doing deadlifts.    I really want to find the right one. I have a couple nice PVC ones purchased on the cheap years ago, but they're too small for a pack.  For me the key is finding one large enough to go full hunchback of Notre Dame with.  I mail just mail order a military one... they're just so useful.  I can't tell you how many nights I've spent just under a poncho hooch.    Charm City Cakes, actually got themselves a reality show and product line in major grocery stores.   Boh hasn't been a Maryland brand in 20 years which fascinates me especially since I've seen young folks (in their 20's) with Mr Boh tattoos.    I would agree on G M although I'd say the other side of that crabcake debate is Timbuktu.      Irocinally despite their plastering the Maryland flag on every square inch of anything they can, they're also quite proud of being the single largest importer of the asian blue  *swimming* crab.      	113

I think it's a nice gimmick for them to say, you only pay what you use, well that would be a lot of dinero.

Im wondering how these compare to T-Mobile, ATT, and Sprint?                     It sounds like a way for the government to ensnare some of those that are not financially savy, but on the other hand that lump sum can help with a down payment on a house or to purchase a vehicle clear and free.   Ill jump on the Vote Mike out bandwagon.   True, it will depend on what they contribute, and a Mustang seems like a better idea in the short term.

Zen rep said they'd love if digital rights went across devices...   This is Microsoft's decision (fault).    Microsoft - Digital rights should work across all your devices: XBOX   Windows.   It's apparent you're focusing your business on selling licenses: VIDEO / MUSIC apps   your marketplace. You're trying to get in on a major shift in media. People are turning from physical media to digital rights. You need to establish a better reputation than this. You are F'n Microsoft!   When people buy from you, they need to know:  - the license is valid a lifetime for the user - the license works across all your devices during that lifetime   If you don't, you'll lose out to Sony, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc...   then you'll put out a press release like you always do saying 'now MSFT sees the light'... the market will speak.

 1987!   I didn't know that's how ^how ^^you ^^^did ^^^^it   Everyone has been talking about WHO the killer is, but regardless of the killer's identity perhaps it is more important to ask WHY he killed the kids.  One possibility is revenge against the company.  Another possibility is that he is a psycho.  However, I think it is likely that the killer was attempting something beyond violence and horror.    We've all seen real animatronics.  They are slow, clumsy, and artificial.  They are mechanical and impersonal.  What if you could create a human machine?  A robot with character?  What if you could give dead servos and metal beams a life?  Perhaps this is what the real killer was after.  They wanted to bring hope to a dismal restaurant.  They wanted to give the robots personality.  They wanted it to be a place where "fantasy and fun come to life".    And what better to give a robot life than the soul of a child?  Curiosity, joy, energy...  It seems perfect.  And each kid would give his character some type of personality, and they would live forever.  "It is lamentable that mass agricultural development is not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experiments... Countless uses will be made by future generations."   I live 15 min from Disneyland haha.  Gotta love Disney but there's still something creepy about all those smiling animatronics...   What if someone who doesn't know the game finds these actually scary?   How come Cedar Fair is into building double B M hypers at some of their parks?   I made a watercolor painting of that in high school, pretty much the exact same angle.  The double corkscrews over the ponds are pretty amazing.   Excellent   He means it is scary, not bad.   Good stuff!   I don't care if you're waiting for the 3rd game to come out today.  Maybe you're trying to keep everything under control on the subreddit.  Whatever.  One of my favorite albums is Daft Punk's 2005 "Human After All".  Listen to it to make your Friday better. http://youtu.be/wh6Vh0xL0uI   How does this tie in to the game?  1. Human After All - Even if you don't think that the robots in the game are haunted, they have many human qualities gamers have attributed to them.  Curiosity, anger, loneliness, suspicion, playfulness... Do they actually have personalities or is it nothing more than basic programming personified by our imaginations?  2. Prime Time of Your Life - Several children have been cut down in the prime time of their lives at Freddy's Pizzeria.  Listen to how this song starts out slow and fun, but then accelerates into a ridiculous frenzy.  It is over before you fully appreciated it.  3. Robot Rock - Fun to hear the robot voice evolve over the course of this song from a guitar to a voice distinctly saying "Robot Rock".  You can imagine all the robots jamming out to this one on the show stage.  4. Steam Machine - There's no way that the company is good after everything that they've tried to hide.  Fazbear Entertainment is a ridiculous excuse for a corporation, and yet they keep plodding forwards, mechanically wiping everything out of their way.  At the end of the song, it sounds like the whispering voice says "Fear Machine" instead of "Steam Machine".  5. Make Love - Probably represents that weird part of the fandom.  Toy Chica... yeah, never mind.  But on a better note, maybe this relaxed song is about the parents trying to move on without their children and let it go.  6. The Brainwasher - Killer track.  Imagine those hallucinations getting more and more intense as the robots get closer... are they messing with your mind?  7. On/Off  - Sounds like switching a television on and off.  Minor glitch in the system.  8. Television Rules The Nation - Closed circuit television rules the pizzeria!  You are in charge, and somehow the robot's behavior is affected by which cameras you look at and when.  However, this could be the robot anthem against the security guard... you might think television rules the nation, but we'll see who's in charge at the end of the night.  9. Technologic - Shut it.  Wind it.  Switch it.  Find it.  Check it.  Close it.  Quick, replay it.  10. Emotion - Pretty much sums up the whole game.  Do the robots have feelings?  What do they think when the clock strikes 6-o-clock and they realize their robotic programming has made them kill someone?  What do they feel when they get back in their places as the sun rises?  Do the families come back to look at the restaurant and remember?   Anyway, thanks for reading.  Rock on and relax and remember how great the other 2 games have been.   How can you tell?   What is it?   I wasn't sure where one act started and the other ends... So they just kind of fade into each other   Yeah I think so   True.  Fortunately a lot of people are posting links to more story structures so next time I can cover more   Sure thing   Haha the Double Shyamalan... classic   I know it's click bait but gosh dangit I put some work into it.  Unlike Buzzfeed or Upworthy or whatever.   For sure!  Next time   Including Campbell for sure next time!  Aristotle's Poetics is boss.  Not sure what part to put on the chart though.   Haven't seen the movie.  Take the run time and spread it along the length of the chart, then find events in the movie and see if they coincide with some of the story descriptions   You mean thesis, antithesis, synthesis?  That's a good one, I should add that   Wow, why have I never heard this before?  Awesomeness   True that.  A lot of my friends also finish something for the first time and then spend forever trying to sell it, instead of realizing that they can go back and write something new and better now that they have the practice.   I've seen some of Kurt Vonnegut's simple structures and I really like them (Boy Meets Girl, Man in Hole, Cinderella).  Not sure if I should draw all of them in or what though.  Definitely going to include Campbell next time around, some other comments pointed out that Campbell and Vogler aren't the same like I thought they were.  Russian stuff is great too.  Never would have found that by myself, thanks.  And holy cow, that search engine is ridiculous.    One of the reasons why I made this chart is because it shows you that one "structure" obviously doesn't have it all.  Learning from all of these and then borrowing what you can is great.  Personally, I think it's kind of hard writing from a formula, which is why I use this chart mostly for analyzing other stories and not when I'm writing my own.  I love what you said about vignettes/sequences.  If you think about it, you could shrink this whole chart down and then repeat it several times within a movie.  So we might have several separate quests within the overall journey and it will still be interesting to the audience   I really hate using computer software if I could be physically drawing it myself, but maybe I'll give it a shot. Any idea what software I should use?  Photoshop?   That's true, it is definitely not exhaustive.  These are just some popular ones in America.  What are some examples of foriegn storytelling that I should include next time?     That sounds awesome, thanks.  I'll be sure to include him in the next version of the chart.   I like how he puts focus on ending your story well, because it's very easy to have a great opening and then not know where you're going.   Thanks for reading   Thanks for reading!   Sure thing   You're welcome!      Are teh same person   What game do you play solely for the purpose of how hilariously unpredictable the program is?  My favorite is Backyard Skateboarding from 2004.  Flying through walls, falling into the sky and having your character turn into a mangled ball are all common occurrences.   In one single shot, straight from the beginning?   Pride and Prejudice for days   I've only been here a week so it's kinda hard to keep up.  I've brought this theory up a few times and people say it's "likely", but to me it seems pretty obvious to me that the shadow ghost from FNAF 2 is a hint to the next game.      Makes me wonder though. http://i.imgur.com/nB83X7J.jpg   I know there's only a few interviews with Scott Cawthon out there, but what are your favorite quotes from him?  Here's mine from the IGM interview, Scott is responding to why the animatronics in the game rarely move:  "Thats one of the things that makes these 'creatures' so scary in real life. If youve ever been to an animatronic show at a theme park or a restaurant, they can be creepy when they move, sure. But its when they are turned off that the veil is lifted, and you realize that they were never alive. They are, and always have been, dead."   I think the hilarity of what you're talking about is that the game is an innocent concept gone wrong, and for some reason, everyone in the fandom has tried to put it back to normal.    So now we're at a place when everything seems so stupid because Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Freddy are so familiar to us in their happy cute cartoon forms.  Until you open up the game and play it again, which is when you realize that metal sculptures left in a pizzeria at night are moving towards you for mysterious reasons.  Scott said it best in the IGM interview: "Animatronics can be creepy when they move, sure. But its when they are turned off that the veil is lifted, and you realize that they were never alive. They are, and always have been, dead."   Do you think it is likely that Shadow Bonnie is Salvage?  What else is it supposed to be?   Salvage obviously looks old and withered.  The 3rd game takes place 30 years later, so do you think that he could get that old and withered in 30 years time?  He obviously wasn't created after the pizzeria in FNAF1 shut down, and he wasn't pieced together from the remains of others since the Steam description says the animatronic was discovered, not built.  So he's been around.  What if he was in the first game.  What if he was the one creeping around, writing messages on the walls and on the backs of the signs...  WHAT IF SALVAGE HAS BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME  P.S. has it been confirmed if Shadow Bonnie from FNAF 2 is actually Salvage?  The teeth look similar.  If so, that would confirm his presence in both games.   Made it to 5 AM before power shut out, does that mean I'm getting closer?   Had this happen to me on mobile.  Had to put down the phone and look away   Bought it, there's a link on the side of this page, it's under "The Community"  	48
 I seriously doubt it is.  There's no hard and fast rule for this.  If you call your dress that, and an attorney for the movie company thinks it looks to similar, and they feel like suing you, you'd get sued.  You'd have to pay for an attorney to defend you.    If I sell them only on a marketplace for handmade items and specifically state "This is not an xx-licensed product," would that satisfy that requirement?  Almost certainly not.   I thought I read somewhere that it has to be 20% different, but I don't know if that's right.  I've never heard that.  How do you judge want percentage of a dress is different?     [Come on.](http://bit.ly/1CwahrG)   This is just a hypothetical situation.  Sounds like maybe it's your torts homework.   I would be ok with a mutual agreement that neither parent is allowed to have their unmarried partners over during child visitation.  You have little to no chance of getting something like this.  You should speak with an attorney so they can inform a judge about what's going on.  If what you're saying is true the girlfriend's actions are inappropriate and a judge can order her to stop.   Top comment to the old post is from NYPL... :(   Not a legal issue. He should go to the head of the department.    If you want the prenup to be valid you both need to retain separate attorneys to review it before signing.     ya because i would prefer not to pay. I'm not saying I am a good guy or anything.  The cop can and would issue you a new ticket for going 44 in a school zone.   I'm in the midwestern US. I'd rather not say which city.  What state?   We don't do referrals here.  You can call your local bar association and ask them for a recommendation.   As I understand it, the FPT concept exists in criminal law and allows defendants to be charged with a string of crimes all descending from the original violation. Why does it not extend into civil tort law?  [That is not at all what that means.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree)   This is not a legal issue.  It is an administrative issue with the school.   If you're going to be running a real life charity, you need to consult with a real life attorney.  This is too big an issue to ask here.   There is nothing here. If you made a formal request for the tweets they would print them out and give them to you.    I'm not sure what you're trying to say. It is a fact that both mulatto and negro originated as Spanish terms and have since become part of our language.    Negro is a Spanish term too.  They've both become a part of the English language.   Here's my comment.   I've never heard the term used in the North East, and I've known many mixed race, or biracial, people.  If you google it, you get results that refer to it as a derogatory term.  It's archaic in the majority of the United States.  I certainly wouldn't refer to someone as a negro or colored, just as I wouldn't refer to them as mulatto.  The fact that your cousins are okay with it doesn't change that.   How else would you describe someone who is half-black and half-white?  Mixed race?    OP sustained an injury to his honor and his standing in his family.  Good thing OP isn't a Klingon.    mulatto  Do...do people still use that word?   You can sue the bus company yourself in small claims.   Cast iron pans have to be the most bizarre circlejerk on this site.   The first thing to remember is that you need permission from the government to erect something on government property.  If permission is granted, the government must let any other private group that wishes to erect a monument do so, so long as they are comparable.  For example, if a small cross is erected in a park, the local atheist society cannot put up a 20 foot tall billboard-they can put up something comparable to the small cross, like a small sign, etc.   No one has contested it because that would be stupid. Lawyers get paid for the work they do. There's no require you be an "expert" whatever that means in order to bill someone for something.    Social engineering isn't a real thing. Do you mean via fraud and/or lies?   Yes of course it is, so long as what he described actually happened.    I'm a municipal prosecutor and it makes things tough. Their only option often is to go to trial. There's not much else I can do for them sometimes.    What an idiot.    Why can't someone go in and then mail it to you?   No plea bargains for DUI allowed in NJ.    In NJ it actually changes the fines and penalties. Also the municipal prosecutor doesn't need to show her driving was unsafe, only that she appeared to be under the influence. The field sobriety test is a good indicator of that assuming it was done properly.    Plea bargaining for DUI is not permitted in NJ. You'll want an attorney to review the discovery and the information on the breathalyzer. Her potential penalties will depend on what she blew. She's looking at minimum a 3 month lines suspension and several hundred in fines.    For real?   Can they arrest her for not feeding a patient? I would hope so.    "Principle of legality" I have no idea what this means.  "Right to a fair trial" There is no specified right to a fair trial in the Constitution.  However, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a number of rights that, taken as a whole, ensures that trials are fair.   The question was not "how do I fight this ticket."  The question was is GPS evidence real or was that a scare tactic. That question was answered.    Lol okay. What helpful advice would you provide?   None of which makes citicop's response wrong, much less disgusting. He was absolutely correct. If there is GPS data it CAN be used against you.    What are you talking about? Cops do that all the time.    I got a lot of upvotes for that.   Also downvoted.    Citicop's response was 100% on point. What was "disgusting" about that?   If you don't fill out proper paperwork the church can refuse to perform the ceremony.     does hereby remise, release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge with prejudice the said Releasee, of and from all manner of actions, causes of action, suits, debts, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, promises, claims and demands whatsoever, which said Releasor ever had, now has, or which any personal representative, successor, heir or assign of said Releasor, hereafter can, shall or may have, against said Releasee, by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, from the beginning of time to the date of this instrument with relation to claim certificate #     So the shipping company has insurance. Their insurance settled with you. You have ale of no chance of a successful lawsuit after a defendant's insurance settles with you.    And who are you attempting to sue?   The locationbot works just fine and performs a needed service.   Also this is not a democracy!! The mods rule with an iron fist! I'm starting an underground brotherhood to oppose them from the shadows...just call me Emmanuel Goldstein...   Wait who purchased the insurance that reimbursed you?   It says it takes into account the value you put down. Not that that value is set in stone.  If it's not reasonable they can discard it.    I get your point about the PR campaign, however the point is to make it untenable for him to drag it on and NOT settle. The goal is to never get in front of a judge.  Again, if he has insurance it is quite likely they will pay for an attorney to defend him.   The insurance can also stand in the shoes of the insured whereby they are asserting his rights. The release on behalf of the company can be found to apply to their insured as well.    Immediately prior to filing the lawsuit, I intend on launching a very aggressive (although far from extortionate or libelous) PR/marketing campaign against him.  A judge would likely hate this and it would make you look terrible. Skip it.   If he has insurance they pay for his attorney. If you've settled with his insurance you're likely reading the release wrong if you think you can still go after him.    Just because a website hasn't been shut down yet doesn't mean it's legal.   She can recover the actual amount of her damages. Punitive damages are highly unlikely.   You can subpoena the trooper or ask the court to dismiss the case. Your case is likely not as slam dunk as you think.    [...](http://makeameme.org/media/created/well-that-escalated-jmg8n6.jpg)   Boooooo      Has she been asking those attorneys for work? Her looks have nothing to do with it. Also your daughter is an adult and needs to be solving her own problems. Having her parents try to help her out isn't going to take her far. Offer her encouragement but otherwise she needs to work this out on her own.    What books would you recommend to the average person to just educate himself for general knowledge. Getting to know your rights, understating how the system works, and what i can do as a citizen to be savy and not a victim of a complex world i know nothing about.  The vast vast majority of people are not attorneys, have little to no legal knowledge, and yet still go through their entire lives happy and healthy. It's highly unlikely that you'd be a "victim" or anything, nor is it likely that a situation would arise where legal knowledge is immediately necessary. Just don't talk to the police if they suspect you of a crime and you'll be fine.    If they have your number already what's the concern about giving them a copy of your card?   No one here will help you abuse the legal process just so you can be a dick.     That makes it extraordinarily difficult to act when the rules of what a person can and cannot do are intentionally made fuzzy.  And yet somehow the vast majority of the population finds a way to get by.   I'll flip it around. It a simple waiver of all liability was so simple, why doesn't everyone use them all the time? Why are there any lawsuits?  Signing a waiver may show assumption of the risk. However, that does not absolve you from any and all lawsuits. You can't act in a negligent manner and expect not to get sued.    Because those waivers are usually not worth the paper they're written on. At most they can show that you understood risk is involved. You could still be sued for any negligence.    [It's not entrapment.

 There is two levels of scam artists. The first kind scams idiots. The second kind scams orphans, veterans, firefighters, cops, etc etc. There are several circles in hell, but the second kinds is going in the lowest level. Right next to Satan. Better bring a warm coat Buddy, because when you pass over from old age they have a seat available for you.   Blood money. I get it.   Takes one to know one.   There are people suing for less crazy things. Plenty of lawyers willing to take a case for a percentage of the cut.   Also I'm sure her hubby can embezzle more pension funds to pay for a lawyer.   No no. She is ordered to pay the lawyers of her employer. She lost the case and is liable for their fees.   SHe doesn't even have the money to pay back her former employer's legal expenses (according to her defense). I doubt she has any substantial liquid or illiquid means.   Getting fired. Sue. Get money. Bail out criminal husband.  I doubt she has much money into reddit anyway.     One cannot exist without the other. Money needs to flow.   Pretty sure only Pao is actively trying to destroy reddit to further her own agenda.     Microsoft is getting a ton of hate from things in the past. Their current products are incredibly good and innovative. It's a bit cyclical it seems. Happens to Apple too. From good to bad to good, wash,rinse, repeat.   Getting reddit gold is like catching herpes these days. It's a badge of shame. Not of pride as it used to be.

I wouldn't personally be fuzzed about it. Then again I also eat raw eggs.  If you're in a 3rd world hellhole, crisp the everliving s- out of pork.   I am a proud jar of Hellman's Mayonnaise.    Yes.   Not Pao I'd think. After all one cannot eat a being more evil than itself.   After firing /u/kickme444 I don't think this is something I'd want to be a part of anymore.   But that would be gender discrimination, and then she can be a professional victim again and sue reddit for money to bail her criminal husband.   A man can dream can't he?   Like any good dictator would do. Kill the dissidents.   I remember sitting in front of the TV watching THe United States of Freedom bulldozer through Iraq in the second Gulf War and this Iraqi bloke was saying on TV:      THERE ARE NO TANKS IN BAGDAD  I see the reddit admins saying here      THERE ARE NO SUBREDDITS CLOSED  Despicable.      I don't think they sell shit flavoured popcorn.   Then again they do sell shit flavoured and popcorn flavoured Jelly Beans. Maybe combine those?  Also instead of a postcard why not http://www.shitsenders.com/ ?   1. Bring back Victoria with a huge raise and the freedom to coordinate AMA as she pleases. She did an amazing job and more creative freedom will only be for the better. 2. Fire Pao. 3. Hire a competent tech savvy CEO. 4. Formally apologize to the community for this fuck up and for ever hiring Pao to start with. 5. Subreddits go back online.    Ph'nglui Mglw'nafh Pao San Fransisco wgah'nagl fhtagn.  ftfy    Sir. I kindly ask you NOT to compare Pao to the Great Dreamer Cthulhu. It is an insult to the High Priest of the Great Old Ones.   Then the term " Ask Me Anything"  has two false statements.  "Me" and "Anything".  I'm pretty sure he never even saw the AMA. Just 1 minute in between whatever important business he had a PR person pushed a sign in his hand and said "Smile".   You mean like the Obama AMA?   Those are the San Francisco offices where Glorious Leader resides.   It would probably be cheaper for reddit to pay her blood money instead of going to trial.   Firing her would result in her likely seeing reddit for a ton of money to bail out her criminal husband. Ever hiring the Chairwoman was a lose/lose situation for reddit.    I find Chairwoman Pao's reaction priceless. Her masterplan is coming to the end game. Within a few months they'll sack her. She'll sue and try to bail her criminal husband out again. #truelove    Yes.    When this guy goes in normal sentence case you know shit is ON. It's like shouting to this man.    A lot of critical posts are been deleted. The admin team is in full cover up mode.   German. I live close to the border and have lived in Germany for a couple of years. I'm pretty much fluent in spoken and written German. There are not many people that know. In my current job I have to audit regularly and most of the time this is in Germany. It helps to understand what they try to discuss behind your back.    Is measuring a head racist? No. Once again it's the person that makes it racist. Not the actual technology.  	47
                         I think there will certainly be a market for this (assuming it was possible - presumably these meats would be much harder to develop), but I expect it will always be a fraction of the main market - novelty and speciality food that people have at dinner parties or in hipster noodle bars, but not the sort of thing you'd eat at home during the day.   But who knows, maybe there will be a food craze for synthetic dodo meat? It's a fascinating prospect.                Mmm grain-fed skeletal muscle meat, my favourite.         Yeah I think familiarity is going to be pretty important if people are going to take to this as an acceptable solution.

How about instead of marching in and educating these people we focus on understanding their culture, why some people feel this way and how we can help. They aren't animals that need to be herded.   Technology - at least not the warfare kind - is not the answer.    The traditional perception that bonobos are all peace and love has been challenged by recent studies.

I generally agree with you - I really only worry about privacy when its on a local scale, ie people I know/live near knowing private info about me.

 I wish they wouldn't try to super-charge this information with overblown words i.e., "astonishing." It's meaningless and I think trivializes the report.   Saying, Rate of glacier melt accelerating, is scary enough.    I stayed earlier this year at a Trump hotel in Vegas for work conference. The price was on par, and maybe even less, than some of the on-strip hotels. The Trump hotel is slightly off Strip, located on right side of the Fashion Mall. (You can cut through the Fashion Mall to get to the Venetian or Mirage.) The hotel was actually pretty good. The rooms had sinks, fridges, and coffee maker. There may have been a stove top/microwave there (but can't recall.) Very solid place, and the convenience store had things like cereal and milk and other breakfast foods. Prices were reasonable. Staff was very nice and professional. In total, the room amenities were heads above most of the Vegas hotel rooms I've been stuck in (for conferences) that don't even have coffee makers. The Trump hotel didn't have a casino and I actually enjoyed the sanity. The only issue was on check-in. They try to upsell you slightly more expensive room, pulling out a book to look at. I had no interest, but the fellow in line before me spent what seemed like 10 minutes considering an upgrade. I waited patiently....   I think that's great. They allow folding bikes on Marc and Baltimore has some outstanding places, including a Italian section with some good food.    This is super. It's a real washboard for considerable lengths.    There aren't many areas in DC where they can build tall apartment buildings. Established neighborhoods will oppose them because of concerns that the taller buildings will block views and light. Exceeding current height limits will be a pitched battle in many neighborhoods.    There's always Eye/I street   The piece now has (as of 11:15 a.m. ET) a new lede that matches the on-air video report (although there were still errors in the text. The fix was probably rushed). The video report is fine. The online text version is, as the OP notes, a mess.   This original text report the OP cited is so messed up that it was obviously a mistake. It almost seems as if someone accidentally published some notes.       Here's my question:   What's your stance on gambling, either online gambling or a casino?   (Reason for question: Once Maryland builds a major casino at National Harbor, people may complain that D.C. is losing tax revenue. Similar arguments were raised in Massachusetts as a rationale for approving casino gambling in that state. Many Mass residents drove to Connecticut to gamble there. So before this becomes an issue in D.C.,  I think it is important to know how candidates feel about it today.)        - Maryland is building a casino in National Harbor. Do you think D.C. should respond by allowing a casino within the District?  - How do you feel about bicycle lanes? Should the city expand them and how aggressively - would you pick up the pace? How important is bicycle safety and what would you do to maximize it?  - Considering the recent scandal in campaign financing, what changes do you think are needed to campaign finance laws in the District?  - How do you feel about FOIA and online access to city documents?   - Do you support a bid to get the Olympics in the District?   You know, if anything, maybe we can at least crowdsource questions.      I'm actually surprised that we still need to state the case about human complicity.    Good point. I'm a little put off by the "terrifying" click-candy usage. There's nothing especially new here; the report refines some predictions, narrows time frames, but generally affirms consensus. Anyone who is familiar with the science and ponders feedbacks at all, considers the possibility of a methane releases in the arctic, and acidification on the food chain, is already, in a sense probably terrified or at least worried sick for future generations. Trying to scare people with yet another alarmist headline doesn't work. What we need is for elected officials to come around to the reality of the problem.    You can live in dull-as-crap Berlin or an equally charming suburb. You can spend your weekends mowing your expansive lawn, and devote a major portion of your household budget to maintaining two cars. You can also sit around with your neighbors and work yourself up into a froth about Connecticut's "dangerous" cities. And, as we all know, nothing bad ever happens in Connecticut's suburban towns. They are islands of sanity.   Or you can seriously take a look at New Britain, Hartford, New Haven, or some other city and imagine being part of a diverse community. You can consider how being close to the arts, shopping and entertainment might enrich your life. The concept of "walkability" might enter your life. You can downsize to one car. Ride your bike. Live a healthier lifestyle or rot away in a suburban town.     What if they say three weeks processing for returned cashiers check? (This sounds like a horrible rule and completely, totally unnecessary, especially since they are doing a credit check.)    Ok, so what happens if they don't rent to you. Do they return the check, uncashed? How long can they hold these funds up? And what if you have a sudden change of mind about the place, or find something else?       How do you measure productivity in DC? Half the people in this town have jobs where they are paid to drink: lobbyist, journalists, elected officials.    I love Connecticut and lived there all my life until 1998 and now live in DC. I'm in my late 50s, but have many friends and family in the state and visit often. When I visit, I often hear people talk about leaving the state. The property taxes, for instance, on my sister's house are $4,600 a year and she can barely afford the bill. It won't be affordable in retirement, and that's the truth of it. It's a simple ranch in Northern Connecticut. I hear my friends complain as well. They think about leaving. Since moving, I've gotten much more familiar with the mid-Atlantic states and how they run themselves. They do some things better than Connecticut. I don't mean to be  negative. There's a lot to like about the state. It is beautiful. But there are bunch of things the state can do to reduce its tax burdens and run more efficiently. Here are my recommendations:     1. Move to county/regional services. It's an incredible waste of money for towns and cities to pay for their own administrations, finance, information technology, police, fire, etc., for small geographic areas. This duplication contributes to high local property taxes.   2. The taxing system and economic development effort should be regional. Take New Britain. When the factories closed, it lost its downtown to West Farms Mall. That's a simplification, but there's truth to it. Farmington gets New Britain shoppers and most of the property tax benefit. To compensate for this lack of a regional tax system, the state waste money on economic development projects in the urban areas that actually end up accomplishing little. Hartford has been an economic development sinkhole since Constitution Plaza.    3. Get rid of property taxes on cars. It's absolutely the most horrible tax.   4. Adopt a homestead tax provision. If you live in your home, DC reduces your assessed value by $38,000. It's a significant savings. The trade off may be higher income and sales taxes.    5. Adopt alternative means of transportation. Connecticut's bus system is a total joke. Many communities lack sidewalks, and forget about bike lanes. The state is overly car dependent, and that makes it very expensive.         40 and you call yourself a geezer?    I do this. But I pass as gently as possible, sometimes say 'excuse me' and exercise caution, especially since I assume the person doesn't know the custom and may behave in an unpredictable manner.      I was unimpressed with this piece. Explain please: What is accomplished by heaping everything on the Republicans? The Democrats have been quietly complicit. They have not pushed as hard as they might on this issue because the policy decisions are extraordinarily difficult. Frankly, I think a lot of Democrats are taking cover on Republican denial. It's too easy to blame the Republicans for everything.  I'm disappointed in the full spectrum of political leadership, including the White House's actions to date. Even if the Democrats owned both chambers, I question whether they would be much better than the Republicans in addressing climate change.    Well, eat, shoots, and leaves me: Whatever on the headline.   The report itself is very clear that young voters are an election threat to the stupid, ignorant and bribe-soaked elected officials among us.   Now, if only my we're-to-busy-watching-tv generation of baby boomers would rally to action ...    An overwhelming majority of voters under 35 understand the threat of climate  change and already see the harmful effects of it, or expect to in their lifetime.    66% of young voters say climate change is a problem to address, while just 27% say  climate change is a natural event that humans cant affect, and only 3% dont believe  climate change is really happening.   Similarly, 65% say climate change is already affecting us or will in their lifetimes.    This recognition of the threat, coupled with the age groups strong favorability towards the  President, leads to intense support for action.   80% support the President taking action to address climate change.   Among those favorable to the President, nearly all support him taking action.   But even among the minority who are unfavorable to him, 56% support action and just  38% oppose.   This widespread and intense support translates into a willingness to punish  legislators who stand in the way of the Presidents plan... and to support those who  back it.   79% say they are more likely to vote for someone who supported these steps    73% say they are less likely to vote for someone who opposed these steps   The best source on what is wrong with Metro is http://unsuckdcmetro.blogspot.com/  But it hasn't published in about a month.

You can find them here: http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/dir/1600044556   I bough at Dahon Mariner for $200 on craigs list from a fellow who was relocating. It was about 10 years old. I brought it to a bike shop and had them make a few adjustments and parts upgrade. I've been super happy with the decision. That bike sells new for about $600. You can find new folding bikes for around $200 from some makers, but not sure about the quality of some of the bikes.    I'm not suggesting that the ice on Greenland or Antarctica will melt in 25 years, but I do believe the trend and patterns will be pronounced by that point.    People are so clueless about how to lock their bikes. They may lock the frame to rack, but the thief will take both wheels.    Not to complicate this too much: But consider a folding bike. You can bike from GW to Metro Center in about 10 min and it's flat. (I once lived on 24th near hospital and made this same trip) Folding bikes are allowed during rush hour. And once you get to Brookland, you won't have to worry about the shuttle. They may even allow you to take a folding bike on shuttle.    You will love it even more once they shut the government down!   There are striking similarities between Climate Change denial and what happened during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. One in particular. In the early years of AIDS it was becoming increasingly clear that it was being spread via blood (this was before the virus was discovered). Babies were getting ill as were drug users. But there was resistance from the blood bank industry, which attacked the science and epidemiological work  making these connections. That didn't last long because the accelerating rate of infections made it impossible to ignore the problem.   However, here's another way to look at how the AIDS epidemic unfolded. Imagine that each year of the initial outbreak was actually 10 years. Something akin to dog's life math. And all of a sudden it begins to look like what's going on with climate change. If you use the decade of the 1990s as year one, (Hansen's testimony in 1988 as the starting point) then we are in year 2.5 of real climate change awareness and action.   The first Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on what would eventually became known as AIDS appeared on June 5, 1981. It received little attention. The national news media only gave AIDS attention when it began to expand beyond the gay population, and even then attention was minimal. Policy makers, with few exceptions, ignored it. It wasn't until the problems cascaded and the number of cases grew that AIDS became a true national issue.   This past June marked the 25th anniversary of Hansen's testimony, and I would say that the awareness and level of action about climate change is about on par with AIDS at its 2.5 year point. It took about five years for AIDS to get truly recognize for what it was. Although the deniers (and that includes people who considered it a gay disease alone) were still at work five years into the AIDS epidemic, they were being marginalized. But it took about five years for the U.S. to begin to turn real attention and money toward combating AIDS.  It will take another 25 years before the world is truly ready to deal with climate change. By then, the polar cap should be just about gone if not gone. The evidence from Greenland, Antarctica, and temperature records, will be inescapable. Similar to the number of AIDS cases at the five year point, the evidence will be beyond rational dispute.  Today, the people who deny climate change, the policy makers who refuse to deal it, and a public that refuses to understand it, still hold sway. Such as it was with AIDS when you adjust the time scales. We have a long way to go before real action is possible.    Update Monday Aug. 5: The entire wall was was being painted over white at 9 a.m.        I have a counterview: I really do think most people recognize that something is amiss. They know the growing seasons have changed, and patterns have shifted. That's my experience in talking with folks, especially older relatives. But they aren't asked the right questions in surveys that attempt to assess knowledge about climate change.   Ask people about what they experience and see. Ask them whether they have noticed changes in growing season of plants in their backyards, different patterns in the arrival of some bugs. Ask them if they are noticing slightly earlier springs. Ask them about their memory of the weather.   I think the answers will be a lot different than just asking them about "climate change."  It takes a sophisticated level to have the basics of climate change denial. People don't think like that. People who say they don't accept "climate change" may not even really know what "climate change" is, and aren't connecting the concept with what they observe in their world. I find, especially when talking with older people, that the best approach is to ask them what they observe.      This is just another way of saying that everybody does it (selectively ignores the law), so it's ok. Personal responsibility demands that you respect the rules, even if you think it's unfair because others ignore them.      The steel security bars appear to be very nice. And the matching beige cubicle wall and curtains, well, it just simply took my breath away! I'm impressed by your harsh and lean aesthetic. I mean, there's nothing on the cubicle walls!

Start with anyone wearing green.    This story isn't spam.    Obviously you are rejecting the science that links the increases in extreme weather to climate change. People who take positions that can't be defended very well have to turn to insult, which you are now doing. I'm done with you.    If you *combine* all the records in the DC area that have been set in the past decade or so, a pattern presents itself: A lot more weather records are being broken now than before. My point, and forgive me for not being clear, is that the sum total of accelerating record breaking is strongly indicative of climate change.    The headline on the story is about how the latest heatwave set a irecord/i.   They've been able to drill into ice cores going back many years and have run analysis on C02 concentrations and temperatures. C02 is rising, global temperatures are rising, and if you haven't noticed lately, the glaciers, ice caps and Greenland are all melting. Exactly what sample size are you waiting for?    The post is about another record being broken. It's not about the weather.    It can stay at 80+ plus for the next six months and The House GOP will still be in denial about climate change.   	45

When in home, watching porn and masturbating, there is no problem. But this seriously makes my relationships very awkward and frustrating. I lost my libido. I used to be obssesed about sex, but since I take my medication, I totally forgot about sex. I rarely masturbate.  I quit with some of my medication, antipsychotics to be precise (paliperidone, I think) and I have recovered some of the libido. Now I masturbate more regularly. I haven't been with a girl since I quit the pills, though, so I don't know if I'm still fixed.   CRA YYYOOON   I live in a relatively small spanish city and I still have not known anybody who likes Death Grips.   I have a music blog where I share and review albums. I'm still not very good or professional with the reviews but these are some things I've learned:  -Listen the album at least two or three times before you form and opinion.  -Write about the artist/band origins and story.  -Tell some interesting details/trivia about the album, the artists, some story behind them. For example, I'm very interested when some of the members of the band died or commited suicide. I don't know. I'm just like that, interested in morbid details.  -Have in mind the album's historic relevance, how important or influent it was for other artists at the moment of its realease. Maybe you'd listen Black Sabbath or Venom and find it bland compared to other contemporary albums, but at the moment they were pioneers, the first of it kind doing that thing.  -Explain how the music makes you feel. Its flavour. Its texture. Make metaphors.  -Read other reviews in famous sites like Pitchfork, Rate Your Music, etc, but also in less known blogs or Youtube channels.  I hope this helps you.   What the hell im doing watching this shit...   Lots of purples   Beware, Guillotine and No Love are obligatory for me.      Don't forget this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b9ci_z4v7M t=2m46s   Resulting in a what?   No fun. Ever.  Look, Reddit is a great plataform to experiment in different ways, and people is having a lot of fun using their imagination around this subject. Why not have some fun?   My theory is it was some kind of game. She has to find "the killer" and call him to confirm to win, but called the wrong number.      That's racist   This reminds me that time, when I was like 18 years old, I was home alone and somebody called. It was a girl.  "You, sir, are a killer", she said, in a very convinced and funny tone. "What?" "You, sir, are a killer", she repeated. "I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about". "Well. You will find it tomorrow then".  She hanged up.  I'm 34 now and still have no idea what was that about or who she was.  Now that I think it, maybe I should even tell this in its own thread.   Wrong number?   You mean those frames with boobs   Don't worry. You are not a bad person or a pedophile just for having those thoughts, that seem just intrusive thoughts caused by your OCD.  Imagination is free. Mind is free. Just thinking about something doesn't mean you are gonna do it or you agree with it, specially with thoughts that you can't control.  Indulge yourself. Imagine whatever you want. You are free. Your mind can't hurt anybody. Your actions do. Don't be scare for your thoughts. That's just your mind trying to fuck you.  I've had problems like yours. Sometimes I see little children and imagine raping them. But I know I'm in no way attracted to them. I would never do anything inappropiate to a kid. I know that's just my mind looking for another way to make me feel bad, like when I imagine accidents or think again and again about that person that insulted me on the street.  Have a conversation with yourself and make things clear. Take a decision about your feelings and grasp to it whenever you feel insecure about these thoughts.  I hope some of this help you.   I started watching I Be-Area and found it a very interesting visual experiment. But since english is not my first language i didn't get the 90% of it, so i quit.  Also, just in case there is still anybody doesn't know, DG sampled I Be-Area: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxid-di6PQE   How do occultism and magick influence your work?   Glorious   This is really interesting. Like a visual portrait of OCD.   This makes a great plot for a movie or a short.   just recently we had the label sign up to a deal with BitTorrent, which was pretty much unheard of.   Cool. I didn't knew about this.   Yeah, I see the connection, but that song is too soft maybe.   I'm not sure people relate OCD to not being capable of finishing works. Maybe they could think you are just obsessive and meticulous, that you have some rituals. That's the most extended view about OCD, I believe. You shouldn't worry.  I'm not sure if this is what you are asking.   The idea is to make a music video mixing some DG song with this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I33u7P-XokE  What song do you think will go well with this?  Also, I'm quite lazy and could take a long time to do this, so, if anybody wanna use this idea and edit the video himself, go ahead, I have no problem with that.   That's a difficult question, actually. If you want to shock and anoy people, if you want to make your friends say "What the hell, why do you like such strange music?" you should play one where Stefan screams the most. Maybe "You might think he loves you". It's very noisy and agressive, and Stefan screams a lot.   Man... what the hell...   I love it. Thanks.   Yeah. A very nice place to listen to death grips.  	69
 Cool.   If you are, then so am I... I can't even remember the last time I cried, and even then it might have been out of frustration. In my adult life I don't think I've ever really cried hard.      People that buy the "high end" expensive RAM for game usage are really better off throwing their money elsewhere. For most applications such as gaming, memory is never the bottleneck.  The only place it really counts, and even there not too noticeably, is with enterprise/businesses/researchers/enthusiasts that are running in-memory DBs.    Personally I would recommend always going with 1600Mhz or less for DDR3. Anything more is a waste of money for most consumers.   Yet they are still nearly 2.5x what they were almost 2 years ago. Prices never recovered after the factory fire.    What a bind. The situation in Eastern Europe/Ukraine is escalating and we don't want it to escalate, and the way to deescalate the situation is to escalate our actions against Russia.  ... I'll be in my bunker.   I have chronic pain due to an autoimmune disorder. I wish I knew what mistake I made =(   Most Muslim countries are already death camps.   Volunteer somewhere. For me, the only time I really make friends is when I'm working with someone towards a common goal (usually manual labor).   Jupiter be like 'deez my hos'    And the award for the most boring job in the world goes tooooooo....      This could really turn your world upside down!   It's cool, but I don't have motivation to buy one. I already have Cortana with my phone, and I can take it anywhere, and it doesn't take up any extra space.  The Amazon Echo doesn't look like a BAD device, but I would be very amazed if they sold enough of these to justify the research   development costs. Not too pleased as a stockholder.   I had my investments split between two brokers and it allowed me to see which one performed better with my assets. After seeing a clear winner I transferred all my funds into that brokerage account tax-free.  That would be the only benefit I could see, it would allow you to 'shop around' a bit, even if it's only two options.   What an excellent documentary show. Lots of information, lots of visuals, and no over dramatizations.    Would an Nvidia Tesla card have been a better performance/price buy in comparison to 4 GPUs?   I only check mine in the following scenarios:  * I get an email from my bank about suspicious activity * When I get a bonus * When there is a significant event that greatly shifts the stock market or my stocks for better or worse * When I'm checking in against goals (such as another home)   It's also worth noting that the WHO statistics for Ebola are for cases confirmed through testing. It is estimated that the number of cases are vastly under-reported, the actual numbers are believed to be at least 3x as high.   You are likely thinking of Smallpox. Polio is actually seeing a resurgence in the Middle East due to conflicts and the difficulty of vaccination campaigns in such stressed and distrusting areas.    Just a note, if you are actively running your VM VHDs off the NAS and plan to do any data intensive operations, you are going to have a bad time. I'd suggest perhaps storing the virtual hard disks to the NAS for backup purposes or swapping, but when you spin up the VMs themselves use local storage. That will GREATLY simplify your NAS needs.   "Look at me! I'm FABULOUUUUUUUUS"   All I see is a guy getting cancer.  Source: I used WebMD once.   I am not 'good' with math and I think I'm a fine programmer. Been with a very well known software company for 8 years now and still climbing, so I'm not sure it can even be said that math helps... the vast majority of programmers will never need to do any complex mathematical operations.   Ramen   "The type of tree they grow at the Boardman tree farm is called Pacific Albus, a trademarked name that loosely means Pacific whitewood. Its a hybrid of four to five different poplars, cross strained for better yield, faster growth, less use of irrigation water, straighter growth, and things like that."      Just because it hasn't been observed/detected in active use, does not mean it does not serve a potential purpose correct? That's like monitoring some computers on the same day and saying 70% of the binaries of Microsoft Windows are non-functional and unnecessary (just because they weren't observed to be used during that time period).   Can confirm. I have a friend who works at a large company that will be announcing/releasing an automated hair styling/cutting machine for men and women. It's going to be marketed to franchises. The results are impressive and according to female feedback, look better than styling/cuts done by humans.  When and if they take off, thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands of hairstylists will no longer be able to compete. I'm sad they will no longer have jobs, but I am extremely happy that automation/technology has no longer made such labor necessary.   You're supposed to dress up in a costume. It's not a costume if you wear it everyday.   Well now I know what my getaway vehicle may be for my next bank robbery...   No particular order:  * A stop to ISIS gaining ground in Iraq/Syria * A reduction or end to Ebola cases in Africa * A better agreement/truce for the Ukrainian/Russian fiasco so tensions can calm on all sides. * A US economy expanding more than predicted * More space tourism from private companies * A reduction in RAM prices (computer memory costs have been increasing since 2013) * More states voting for legalizing marijuana * The collapse of the North Korean government * Continued protests in Hong Kong until they are allowed to choose their own candidates (unlikely, but I hope it happens) * The discovery of the missing airliner MH370 * The Elios car go into production gain good reviews * More stem cell/regenerative medicine trials with absolutely amazing results * Announcement of new metropolitan fiber networks with ~1Gbps speeds      My god, that brings back the memories. The most disturbing thing I ever saw was [this goatse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).   Watching LiveLeak videos at 7?   How I imagine this went down:  **Daughter**: "Dad I want to be a princess for Halloween!"  **Dad**: "No you're going to be a Xenomorph!"  **Daughter**: "But Daaaaaaad"  **Dad**: "NO!" _   I wasn't attempting to "buy a girlfriend". She was already romantically interested in me prior to that, though I was not interested in a serious relationship and she understood that and said she was fine with it. She said she just wanted to have a fun and carefree relationship after getting burned in previous relationships. But because of the way she abruptly broke off contact I think she was just out to use me. I would not consider her a bad person in the slightest, I'm just using her as an example of why it would be hard to get anyone to just 'gift' money, even if there is already some attachment.      Good luck with that unless you're an attractive young lady. Even then you'll have a hard time. I once paid off the college loans for a girl I had recently met because she was working towards good things (health field) and her loans were really holding her back. Then about a week later she stopped talking to me. Then she got a fitness trainer boyfriend, and that was it.  So... Yeah, good luck. Older billionaire dudes are probably a lot wiser.   HOW did they do it?!?   It's cool until it falls off on the freeway and you're in a mesmerized state after following the vehicle for miles and miles. Imagine how terrifying that would be... It'd feel like time suddenly stopped.   I think the important part of the fear is the chance of injury and death in relation to the amount of exposure to the item. Nearly everyone rides in a car or bus everyday, and almost everyone has a good outcome percentage wise. However if everyone were to step on a snake, or have a bee/wasp land on them, the percentage of bad outcomes would no doubt be very high (even if just a dry bite or a sting).  Just because something doesn't kill many people, doesn't mean it's not a worthy candidate for fear.   From the little bits I just read it seems as though the severity is typically reduced over time. That's got to be a good feeling in a less than ideal situation. As time goes on, does your seem to be improving?         You don't really need a pump if it's just goldfish and frogs. Just think of how many goldfish bowls are out there without pumps! I think adding a pump will just give you more headaches.  I've had a backyard pond for 10+ years with no pump, and it had large goldfish for most of those years until the racoons came and decided to go fishing. It also had frogs and salamanders, and algae was never much of a problem (it also never really got full sunlight). In the winter it would freeze over with almost a foot of ice, and the fish would still be there the next spring when it thawed. You'll be fine without a pump.   Not touching your eyes is equally important if not more important than your nose.   Just a regular surgeons mask seems a bit unreasonable for Ebola, but gloves aren't anything bad but overly cautious perhaps. The biggest thing to remember is to not touch your face, and to take off the gloves without making contact with any part of the glove that could have made contact with surfaces. Throw them away each time of course.    The whole finite resource part doesn't make much sense to me, but temperature increases associated with wind farms is well known. Thankfully based on what is currently known, we also know that the effects are minor, and are of course reversible.  An example of a paper regarding research into this subject: http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n7/full/nclimate1505.html   Cue the armchair Redditor architects and building engineers who will tell you about how it's going to rot and fall to the ground within the next couple of days. But that'll be the least of your worries, because they will also diagnose you with some fatal disease related to some imperfection found on your skin in one of the pics after glancing across it with their doctor eyes.       if (profile.Gender == Gender.Female    GetAttractiveness(profile) = Attractiveness.High) {        MatchHelper.AddMatch(me, profile);     } else {        MatchHelper.AssignRandomMatch(profile);     }   Really? You haven't really lived until you've been on fire!   Another thing to note is that due to competition and also the nature of pleasing investors, it is highly unlikely for a company to cut hours unless it is because they lack the budget to pay for the number of hours they'd like employees to work.   It comes down to how no business wants to be the first to reduce hours without cutting pay. Unless you are an absolute market leader, making such an action will only allow competition to get ahead, while the business costs remain the same for you.   How do you think people get battle hardened? They have to start somewhere...      I firmly believe the reason it has not been enacted in the US or other 1st world nations yet is because it has a high potential to cause an economic collapse. Not because goods in those countries would be disrupted, but rather because it sends a huge negative signal to markets that things will be getting worse. By keeping travel open it falsely conveys the sense that everything is under control.  If the US government were to announce such a travel ban, I would begin selling and taking profits on more of my investments in stocks. The economy looks to already be teetering on a precarious edge that few officials are willing to admit.   I don't think I could ever live in a building so tall. I'd be paranoid of fires all the time. I'd probably learn how to base jump just to give myself the unrealistic feeling of safety.  I can't imagine how terrifying it would be to be so far up, sitting in that bathtub, hearing the fire alarm go off, and then seeing smoke calmly drifting up past the window. I'd sure hope the toilet was nearby.   i'll tell you hwat. That boy aint right   What's it like being the son of the Michelin Man?   Most 3D printers work with plastic, and those that work with metal are really unable to extrude the materials needed for handling the thermal aspects of a laptop. It really comes down to designing something that is capable of dissipating heat in such a small form factor. I don't think consumer 3D printers are near that point.   Not really no. There is a lot of custom hardware in name-brand laptops, and you would be unable to shrink/slim down a laptop chassis to comparable common consumer models without going through extensive design and research.  A giant bulky one that probably doesn't have much visual appeal or comfortable 'laptop' functionality is doable though.   More than 1 in 50 people died in WWII. That's pretty eye opening.   The navy version has the ability to take off and land vertically, it's part of, if not the biggest reason that the project is so ridiculously over budget.   This looks like further spiraling in Ukraine's downward spiral.   They typically do with disinfectants. Decontamination stations are critical.    This is pretty damn scary considering that the patient the health worker treated was the first person to come down with Ebola symptoms while in the US. They were extremely well prepared for that patient, they were extremely careful, and they put vast resources into keeping it from spreading. Yet it still spreads.  I'm fearful of what will happen when enough cases start popping up that such resources cannot be dedicated to single cases. I hope to god they find a significant/fixable flaw with their previous treatment and containment procedure... Because if they don't, it's very bad news for what the future might hold.   Reach over to your glove compartment and start screaming "Allahu Akbar!!!!!!" at the top of your lungs.   I would advise against this unless you have liquid bandages and someone to help you. The risk of something going wrong far outweighs the benefits in my opinion. For example if you use super glue and accidentally make contact with something before the glue dries entirely, you risk ripping open the cut to the point where it could become a serious issue..   Ok cool. Can you tell us when you'll next be in a public place and where it will be so people can come take pictures of you for Reddit?    Just because something is not illegal does not make it right or less douchey.   Even though it's not really an image for ridicule... taking a picture of a stranger because of his appearance and then posting it online for millions of people to see  is a total doucher move unless he gave it his blessing.   I really don't understand the issue here. Some of the companies he invested on failed, and obscure companies can be found in a lot (if not most) of investment portfolios. What's the unethical part?    Seems a lot better if the girl planned it. Versus: "I like that girl but she doesn't seem to notice me. I'm gonna go knock that bitch down."   That looks like me when I can't remember whether I turned off the stove.   I'd much rather the response be overboard than not enough.   Deactivating my Facebook account was one of the wisest life decisions I've made recently. Since then I feel much less depressed (seeing people posting their fun life highlights while I slayed away at my career does that) and it also resulted in me hanging out with my friends a lot more in real life, and just generally being more sociable.  I highly recommend it.   It is certainly scary. Though I think it's partially because it brings thoughts of huge pandemics such as those caused by the Spanish Flu, the plague, etc etc.  Even the regular flu which is often brought up as a huge worldwide killer, isn't *that bad* in terms of some of the other pandemics the world has been facing. For example, AIDs is estimated to **kill 4000+ people per day** and the HIV pandemic is still spreading, yet I think the overall 'panic' is absent from the media.   The world is a scary place.   Play it. _   A lighter full of chlorine. When he goes to light a cigarette he will press the valve release and the striker, but it won't light. Instead he'll get a wiff of **extremely toxic** chlorine gas.   Fuck you pickpocketer.   There is no greater punishment.   $4.99 for shipping and handling.   Doubtful. Both tins and documents from the early 1900s are not uncommon. I would be surprised if you could get $3 for this.   We can only hope. But at this point it is the only *known infection* to take place outside Africa. It's not impossible that there are other infections which have occurred in countries outside Africa without the infrastructure/support to detect/isolate it.      Pretty cool, but someone should put a seizure warning on this post.   I rebelled in school and didn't do the work, mostly because I didn't like being told what to do when I didn't see a huge benefit in it. When I went home after school I'd tinker around with software and programming if there was nothing super fun going on.  I dropped out of school when I was 16. Got hired at 21 for a 6 figure job doing software development. I've been there 8 years now and it's been very good to me. The only thing I regret about not taking school seriously and dropping out, is that I missed out on a lot of social experiences like college shenanigans.   Your cat may be the spawn of a vampire.   Multiple casualty counts in the wikipedia articles:  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present) * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War      I don't think a lot of people realize just how bad the situation in Mexico is... To put it in perspective, the number of deaths from the Mexican Drug War since 2006 is estimated to be 4-5x higher than the deaths (including civilians) occurring in the **ENTIRE** Afghanistan War since the US invasion in 2001.  It truly is a bloodbath down there.     	87

 I would say Boehner and Netanyahu's behavior to Obama was more reprehensible.    You think it should be legal and accepted part of society that businesses can discriminate against black and gay people. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them. Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people, discriminate against people, or poison the environment along the way so be it.

I think Ford Field would be great.    look at that unbiased source. The difference is that those laws doesn't allow discrimination. The Indiana bill didn't include any measures to prevent discrimination. Also it is plainly obvious that this law was passed as retaliation against gay people for getting marriage equality.    and here's you thoughts on gay people. http://np.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/2yv2c6/opinion_is_georgia_turning_its_back_on_tolerance/cpdetg8   Bill was signed into law today, goes into affect in July.      so you admit this was passed to discriminate against gay people?    You really think republicans are going to let gay people become a protected class?    You can use the exact same arguement for segregation. You think I makes economical sense to discriminate against gay people?  This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS.

You have also shown that you don't know anything about the bill. You haven't shown me that it WON'T happen. And no Indiana isn't a terrible place, but because of this bill I will no longer do business there. Have fun while your economy suffers because of this.    If I can't find the damn thing how can I make my point. Also I guarantee you haven't read the thing either since the thing is impossible to find online. It's almost like the state of Indiana doesn't want the public to see it. If they didn't want discrimination all Indiana had to do was be like other states and add a provision into the law saying that no one could use this law to discriminate against other people. That fact tell me right there that your politicians don't care about "religious liberty" but are instead a bunch of homophobic bigots. Also the fact that they made this law now after gay marriage became legal says a lot, if this was so important they could have done this 10 years ago when being a bigot was in-vogue. And no one who didn't support this bill would be defending it as hard as you have been on this thread.    "And they elected me TWICE"   If you don't think the bill is necessary why are you defending it. And I can't even find the damn bill online. Have you actually read the bill? Can you tell me where is says that no one CANNOT discriminate against people?    http://www.religionnews.com/2015/03/24/indiana-house-passes-controversial-religious-freedom-bill/   Don't listen to the Bolier guy. He fails to mention that the Indiana bill doesn't have any amendments to protect against discrimination like other laws in other states do.    Tell me why this bill is needed.    Michele Bachmann isn't in congress anymore. She left last year, and she made is crystal clear it had nothing to do with a federal investigation into financial misconduct during her failed presidential campaign.    [The Georgia bill stalled in the house today](http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/). That's right folks Georgia is more progressive than Indiana.    Yes it is the intent. Why introduce this now when gay marriage is legal. I have not seen a single argument for this bill. And that is exactly what the bill is about. Discriminating against gay people.    That is exactly what the bill is saying. A store can refuse service to you if you are gay.    But do they specifically target gay people like the Indiana bill    Oh look. Christians passed yet another "Christians may discriminate against everyone, but nobody may discriminate against Christians" law.  Well, what a surprise.   Good.

Under 32 is damn cold. Freezing is 32, 40 is cold, 50 is chilly. 60 is cool, 70 is perfect weather, 80 is mild, 90 and above is hot. It is just like Celsius expect units of 10 instead of 5 - simple.

I live in Georgia and my god did people lose their shit last year when we had a whopping 2 INCHES of snow. People were stranded for days and the entire city shut down for a week. (Yes this is Atlanta I'm talking about).    More likely that the pilot left for some reason (like going to the bathroom) and while he was gone something happened and the co-pilot either responded wrongly or didn't know how to respond at all, causing the plane to fall and the pilot unable to get back in as the plane fell.

You should have recorded the calls and published what they said   how about not give it to anyone and just keep it for themselves. (I'd prefer that they didn't spy on us at all but I know that won't happen)   not give it the members of the US Congress so that they can sabotage US foreign affairs.    That is one thing. What Isreal did though was take the information that they got and then gave it to GOP members in congress so that they could sabotage the deal. That is why this is news and probably why Obama doesn't like Bibi so much (among other reasons)    There is nothing stoping Cobb or Gwinnett from entering MARTA and "differences " between the counties can easily be resolved. CCT and GCT are just bus service. Its easy for MARTA to come in and simply  replace it. Public transportation is universal, there is nothing that makes it special. It's bus and rail, that's it. CCT and GCT are not special. Funding might be a little different but again nothing stoping Cobb and Gwinnett from joining MARTA. Also the best public transportation systems are large ones that serve the whole region, not a peace meal of regional ones. Looks at the systems in San Francisco, Botson, and Washington dc. They work because they are one system where everyone contributes and everyone benefits.    I'll answer your question with a question. What is wrong with MARTA?    If you have no problem with the state subsidizing public transportation in Cobb and Gwinnett county but have a problem with the small possibility that Fulton and Dekalb county are subsidizing public transportation in Clayton then you have your priorities out of line. Also there is no legitament reason for Cobb   Gwinnett to reject MARTA. MARTA works just fine, Cobb and Gwinnett don't deserve special treatment and should join MARTA so that we can finally have a universal public transportation system    Look at his comment history. It's full of "libtard" and "demtard" comments. If you expect a rational discussion from him you are wrong.

I'd say they are acting more like North Korea.    my god look at the score   [Netflix decided not to bit for the rights to Seinfeld after spending $118 million for the rights to Friends](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/amazon-hulu-yahoo-compete-for-seinfeld-reruns-after-netflix-passes/). Amazon, Hulu, and Yahoo! are in the bidding for Seinfeld streaming rights (at least in the US don't know about other markets). If you really want to watch Seinfeld [Crackle]( http://www.crackle.com/c/seinfeld) posts about 12 random episodes at a time      Nope, they paid really paid $500,000 per episode for friends (or $118 million for the whole show )   [source](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/amazon-hulu-yahoo-compete-for-seinfeld-reruns-after-netflix-passes/)   You are failing to recognize that C-Tran was shut down during the worst of the recision when the economy was literally in free fall and governments were slashing everything. With an improved economy there is a chance that Clayton County will be able to contribute enough revenue to MARTA in order to make the whole thing worth while. But regardless I highly doubt that Fulton and Dekalb contribute an equal amount to MARTA funding. If Fulton contributed more than Dekalb you could make the argument that Fulton is subsidizing Dekalb (or vise versa if Dekalb contributed more) so I still don't see what your argument is   people who act on their conscious shouldn't be discriminated against   those gays however, fuck 'em.      what this path we are walking down leads to  What path are we leading down to? Nothing has changed. Capitalism is doing great. Stock market is at an all time high and companies are posting record profits.    I didn't say you preached hate. I said that I HATE people LIKE YOU - ONE ISSUE VOTERS. In that YOU put GUNS BEFORE PEOPLE. You said you support gay rights, I'm gay and I'm glad you do. HOWEVER the fact that you think guns are more important than me being able to marry the person I love, being able to go to a business and not be turned away because I'm gay, or not being able to be fired just because I'm gay. I support Democrats for more than just their stance on gay rights. You said you vote for the GOP just because of guns. You seem to put guns before people and that is what I don't get. I never said I hated you, I never said that you preached hate, I said (maybe poorly) that your values are misplaced and I didn't like your values.    Last one then I'm done. The reason that I HATE people like you is that you chose something as stupid and unnecessary as a gun over the rights of your fellow humans. [This is what republicans are for](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/19/james-lankford-chipotle_n_6904070.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices ir=Gay%20Voices). Again the fact you chose guns over people is something that I can't understand.    You and I both know that I'm not going to convince you of anything, so I'm just going to tell you what I think about you, the NRA, the gun lobby, and the pro-gun nuts of this country   More guns doesn't stop tragedies, having no guns period stops tragedies. It is people like you that keep electing the GOP to power. Because we have people like you electing the GOP to power we have federal student aid being slashed, food stamps being slashed, women's rights being reduced, gays reduced to second class citizens, and our healthcare under constant threat from being gutted. All because rednecks like got to have guns to compensate for the fact that they are weak pathetic human beings who don't feel complete unless they have a  gun to shoot at people who piss them off. You people are sick. I hope you are happy with yourself that you are ruining this country.    I was under the impression that C-Tran failed because the county couldn't afford it once the economy crashed. But I could be wrong.    Right because a pistol will do a lot to stop a semi-automatic. I firmly believe that had the amount of ammo in the magazines been restricted, or better yet the gun not be allowed to be sold, that the loss of life would have been a lot lower.    Considering that you live in CT makes it even worse that you believe that considering what happened at Newtown. Also are you saying that we use guns to stop people from taking away abortion and gay rights? If so then 1. that is absolutely fucking insane 2. you should start a rampage immediately because all the republicans have been trying to do for the past 3 years is take away gay and abortion rights - put your money where your mouth is.    That makes absolutely no sense at all. The Democratic party is not coming to take your guns. All they want AT MOST it universal background checks and to stop the sale of  of semi-automatic weapons (some don't even want to stop their sale but set a limit on the amount of ammo in the magazine to a respectable number like 15 or 20) . It is good to know that you value inanimate object like guns over the rights of women, poor people, and gays.

I have a few of the season on DVD and while Seinfeld is a hilarious show I don't think if lends itself to binge watching. When you watch the episodes back to back you realize just how ludicrous the show is and how unlikeable/ridiculous the characters are. Many would say "that's the brilliance/joke/point of the show". While this is true I honestly believe that it's best in small doses, otherwise it gets tiring.    When you grow up with something it becomes second nature.

So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them.  Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people or poison the environment along the way so be it.

You are free to have whatever fiscal views you want. My point is how can gay people vote for (or be excited for) a GOP presidential candidate when the entire GOP presidential field is against gay marriage and protections for LGBT people.    My point is that even if you have fiscal conservative views why would you be a member of a party [that clearly hates you]( http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/06/05/3445234/texas-republican-platform-ex-gay/)   I'm shocked, SHOCKED that Jeb decided to pander to the religious conservative nut-job base of the republican party.

If you live in Ontario you might root for Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Toledo, East Michigan, Akron, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, or Syracuse.   There's probably a bunch of schools that I forgot. It also might depend on if you want to root for a powerhouse school, like Michigan, or want to root for a smaller school, like Toledo, and like some other people said you don't have to choose now. Wait until the season starts and if a team catches your eye you can start rooting for them.    Let me start out by saying I'm and atheist and hate organized religion. That may add some biased to me when it comes to certain religion affiliated schools (though schools with loose affiliations like TCU and Wake Forest I have less problems with). Let me also state that this hatred of religion comes from me being gay and all churches rejection of me as a human being.   BU's policy on gays is absolutely stupid. The fact that the ban on gays and gay sex is still in place in 2015 is deplorable. Kids at college age should not be told by their church, much less their school, that they are not welcome on this earth because of the way that they were born.

Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.  Budding's first machine was 19 inches (480 mm) wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast iron gear wheels transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along.Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.            You cum a lot.

Relevant text:  The Three Sisters are three rocky islands in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., west of the Key Bridge. A notable landmark in colonial times, the islets are less well known as the Three Sisters Islands and Three Sisters Island.  Various legends are associated with the Three Sisters. One of the earliest myths involves three Algonquian sisters who crossed the river in an attempt to win the release of their brothers, who had been kidnapped by another tribe. They drowned while crossing the river, and were turned into the rocky islets. A less commonly cited legend says three daughters of the local Native American chief were marooned on the islands by their father after rejecting the husbands he picked out for them. The legend holds that the sisters cursed the spot, saying that if they could not cross the Potomac there, no one could. A strange moaning or bell-like sound is said to come from the Potomac River when the curse is about to claim another life.  The first European to see the Three Sisters was Captain John Smith, who sailed up the Potomac River and saw them in 1607. The islets were a landmark in colonial times, and appeared on Pierre L'Enfant's first map of the area.               Relevant text:  General Order No. 11 was the title of an order issued by Major-General Ulysses S. Grant on December 17, 1862, during the American Civil War. It ordered the expulsion of all Jews in his military district, comprising areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The order was issued as part of a Union campaign against a black market in Southern cotton, which Grant thought was being run "mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders." In the war-zone, the United States licensed traders through the United States Army, which created a market for unlicensed ones. Union military commanders in the South were responsible for administering the trade licenses and trying to control the black market in Southern cotton, as well as for conducting the war. Grant issued the order in an effort to reduce corruption.  Following protests from Jewish community leaders and an outcry by members of Congress and the press, at President Abraham Lincoln's insistence, the General Order was revoked weeks later on January 17, 1863. During his campaign for the presidency in 1868, Grant repudiated the order, saying that it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading it during warfare.

Their original treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five, and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, Linda's brother "W.W." and their dog, Too Much, who were all members of the band "Mysteries Five," including the dog who played bongos. When "The Mysteries Five" were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty dog. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane, but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke.

In which my remains, with those of my deceased relatives (now in the old Vault) and such others of my family as may chuse to be entombed there, may be deposited."  Immediately after Washington's death, Congress resolved that a marble monument should be erected to his memory in the new Capitol in the city of Washington, and that his family should be requested to permit his body to be deposited beneath it. Martha Washington's consent was solicited and obtained. A crypt was provided under the dome of the Capitol, but the project was never completed. In 1831, the surviving executors of Washington's estate removed the bodies of George and Martha Washington and those of other members of the family from the old vault to a similar structure within the present enclosure at Mount Vernon.        Where in your source does it say that?  This is a clear violation of rule one.  This is what I found in your source...........which I was able to get to after having to verify my age and search through a table of contents.  This is what I found:  *How is the alcohol content in beer measured?*  *Alcohol content in beer is typically measured in one of two ways: by volume (which is most common) or by weight. Using Coors as an example: A 12-ounce serving contains 5.0 percent alcohol by volume which means that of all the liquid in the container, 5.0 percent of the liquid is alcohol. The same 12-oz. serving of Coors Light is about 4.0 percent alcohol by weight, which means that of the total weight of the liquid in the container, 4.0 percent of the weight is contributed by the alcohol.*  *Sounds simple, but if we're talking about the exact same serving of beer, why the difference between volume and weight measurements? That's because a given volume of alcohol weighs less than the same volume of water. (An ethyl alcohol molecule, or C2H5OH, is larger than a molecule of water, or H2O, and takes up more space.) So whatever the serving size, the alcohol weight percentage will always be smaller than the volume percentage. This basic fact should help dispel any myth about 3.2 beers or so-called "near-beers" allegedly containing much less alcohol compared to regular beers. The "3.2" in 3.2 beers represents the percentage of alcohol by weight, which means that there's about 4 percent alcohol by volume in the beer. Anyone who believes that he or she cannot become intoxicated consuming 3.2 beer is just plain wrong. If you know of anyone who's a believer in the 3.2 beer "myth," do him or her a favor and share the facts.*         	181
 Honestly, there may be some truth to that (I'm NOT a denier). Zyklon B was an industrial agent made to be a cleanser for sterilizing whole rooms (think like a field hospital). There were absolutely gas chambers, but chemical sanitizer was expensive and probably wasn't used to gas people when cheaper alternatives existed.   From what I've read, several accounts point towards using diesel engine exhaust being used in the chambers. It was cheap and plentiful. Just hook up some engines to exhaust to an enclosed space with little to no ventilation and that's it, carbon monoxide did the work. Plus you could find any low ranking soldier and tell them to hook up a tube. There was no special training needed like there would likely be for a specialized agent like Zyklon B.  This is a horriffic thing to say, but if you are a Nazi officer, you are still trying to fit into a budget. Carbon monoxide from exhaust is far cheaper and more budget friendly than a medical grade cleanser that has to be purchased from IG Farben, especially when you need it to actually sterilize rooms too.  I don't claim to be a holocaust scholar, but it seems like it would make more sense to me. Then again, I don't know if diesel was rationed for the Nazi war effort, in which case that would be a strike against that approach.  Edit: After doing some more reading, it looks like both were used, depending on which camp.   That's not really true. People in China and Korea (ESPECIALLY Korea) are very cognisant of it. Though Japan was less likely to do death camps - they usually gassed entire cities (to be fair, gassing an entire city was way cleaner than some of the things we did to them - there's a reason why firebombing is now banned). As far as using prisoners - the Japanese were far bigger on conscripting prisoners and forcing them to fight, or using them for medical research.  We also don't talk about it as much on the US side because most of the Japanese researchers who performed medical/chemical weapons research on living human test subjects were given clemency and jobs working for the US doing chemical weapons research (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731). There was no big showy trial where the dirty laundry was aired like there was with Nuremberg.  We went so far as to then claim that anyone who accused the Japanese of such warcrimes were spreading communist propaganda. So, that's pretty much why no one talks about it in the west.  The only country that tried to perform legal proceedings for Japanese war crimes was Russia.   It doesn't. But it is a nice reminder that no matter how many horriffic things there are in the world, some things are still good and pure and wonderful. Like puppies.   +1 for the puppy picture. Honestly, I love that it's the last photo in the set. After all of that darkness and horror and human tragedy, it's a wonderful reminder that there are genuinely wonderful things in this world.  It kinda reminded me of this: http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/jtbjft/moment-of-zen---a-puppy  Edit: A little context - this was the first episode of the daily show to film after 9/11/01, and the whole country was reeling. So Jon Stewart presented a puppy to show the world that there were still good, wonderful things out there.   They did build gas chambers out of diesel engines because exhaust was cheaper than dedicated poison agents. The gas chambers currently at Auschwitz aren't real (they're reconstructions) but that doesn't mean the there weren't other gas chambers there beforehand.  The medical experiments alone prove some of the horrific atrocities committed by the Nazi war machine. Sadly most of the Nazi research was medical or psychological in nature, so we executed most their researchers. Unlike Japan whose research was mostly in torture and chemical warfare - we granted most of their scientists clemency and allowed them to continue doing research for the US (but without human test subjects). Kind of pathetic how that worked out.   Cognitive dissonance. You can ask a young-earth believer if they believe in the speed of light. You can ask them if they can see the stars in the sky. You can ask them how a 5000 year old world could see light from a planet a million light years away when technically that light should still be 995000 miles away. They'll attempt to rationalize to justify their position even though they know that their position cannot logically coexist with the scientific facts they already accept. People are able to handle cognitive dissonance incredibly well when beliefs are on the line. Basically, they don't believe it because they don't want to believe it, and it's easier to just ignore the facts or become numb to the cognitive dissonance.   I 100% agree. I too have a copy from pirate bay, lol. I think the most "useful" one is the meat book   There is a TED talk where they discuss how they made the book. The work that went into it - well... I will eventually buy a physical copy out of respect. Some of those photos took weeks to create.   It would be a tie between my Antique copy of Larousse Gastronomique, and a really interesting one called "[In Memory's Kitchen](http://www.amazon.com/In-Memorys-Kitchen-Legacy-Terezin/dp/0742546462)."   Neither one is a traditional "cookbook". Larousse is an encyclopedia that happens to have a lot of recipes in it, and my edition, 2nd, edition still has all of the cool quips and jokes before the editors advised they be removed. In Memory's Kitchen is... different. It is a compilation of recipes, written from memory, during the holocaust by concentration camp victims.   I love both because the recipes are very often just general guidelines. They aren't like modern recipes where you are walked step-by-step through every detail. Rather, you'll see an ingredient list and then "assemble like a pudding" or "prepare like a cookie." They are difficult, and you often have to do work. In the case of In Memory's Kitchen, a number of the recipes were written by people who were terrified for their lives and on on the brink of starvation, so some of the ingredients make no sense. The difficulty really drives home what the people were going through when you try to recreate the food.   Came here for tacos de lengua, leaving happy. Seriously one of the very best dishes you can make with tongue.  The other option is braise it until it is shreddable, but do NOT shred it. Peel it and put it in the fridge for a day to re-solidify. Warm in a steamer until it hits about 190 and then slice as thin as you can and serve on some crusty bread with horseradish and cheese.   Go out of your way to do something nice for her and let her know that you don't want to be a deadbeat. Make a nice candlelit dinner. Try to find some free things in the community to do together (free or cheap concerts, go to a museum, go walk around a park). Worry about building memories together and not necessarily spending money on her. Get across the point that you are trying.  Make a conscious effort to improve your financial situation - all the tools you need are available on the tubes for free. /r/personalfinance is a great place to start. The folks there are incredibly helpful. If you think this could go for the long haul, you owe it to the both of you to get over any bad habits you picked up from being in a low income/low NAV family. I'm *not* ragging on your family, I came from a low income family too. Usually not having any money comes from bad habits in conjunction with misfortune - stuff like not having an emergency fund, not budgeting, etc. You can be the one to change that.   Did you see the tread watch while you were there? I want to get one but I'm still having a hard time justifying the price.   Hello, I just received further correspondence from the law firm that they need my name, date of birth, my parents names, and an ID number (such as passport). They also provided a copy of the PCC-3 form that they say it will be used for.  I'm working on translating it. My concern is that my passport number in the wrong hands is extremely problematic. Do you know if I can provide an anonymized version?  Sorry to lean on you for this, but I find myself in a rather uncomfortable position. I understand that there can be real consequences of not paying the tax, but I also understand that the ramifications of people opening up international accounts in my name is very very bad.

In most American meat processing plants, ground beef can contain meat from literally thousands of different animals. All it takes is one bad animal to contaminate thousands of packages.  However that doesn't mean you can't do it safely. If you start with a single good cut of meat (or a few good clean cuts of meat) and grind that on site, it is just as safe as eating a steak. The key is processing at a restaurant (or in a home) produces a product that is far less likely to have a contaminant.   I usually take it as a sign that a restaurant cheaps out on ground beef if theu refuse to make me a rare burger.  If raw or rare ground beef could never be made safely, how would anyone make beef tartare?   First, always ALWAYS brine chicken breasts. There's just not enough fat to keep them moist otherwise unless you are perfect, and given salt and water are cheaper than chicken breasts it just makes sense to take the extra step.  Then I usually sear for about 2 minutes on each side and check temp. If I am not at 150 I will ginish in the oven.  You can also heat in the oven to 135 or so and then sear to finish on the stove.   His duck episode is legit. When I plan to cook the whole duck at once I usually go his route.   Eat this Rock.  I never understood how powerful salt was until watching that. It also started an entire career of canfy making for me by making the salted caramels.  Followed closely by "The Catfish Shall Rise Again".   Hm, usually I cook the barley separately with some beef stock.  To get it velvety, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you cook the beef low and slow. The gelatin and collagen need to melt out of the meat and into the cooking liquid which happens above 190 degrees (f).  After cooking, strain off the cooking liquid and reduce it until it is closer to what you want (French cooks look for it to be napp, which is when it will coat the back of a spoon, and you can draw a line across the back of the spoon with your finger that holds its shape).  You can also add some bloomed unflavored gelatin.  Once you have the broth where you want it add back to the meat and stir in the barley.  For the "not too beefy" flavor, use mostly chicken stock in the stewing liquid (usually ill do 3 cups chicken to one cup beef). Also when browning your veggies, add about a tbsp of tomato paste and about 1 tsp of anchovy paste. Cook for a minute or two until it Is rust colored and fragrant. Then add a little flour and stir and cook for a minute or so.   Probably the only one who will say it, but I freaking love pickled herring.   Go as big as you can afford. Lodge is awesome, amazingly enough so are the food network and Mario Batali ones.  For your first one I would HIGHLY recommend you get an enameled dutch oven. If you cook acidic foods in a cast iron dutch oven you will not only end up with some really nasty flavors, but you can damage the pot. If you were using it for short fast bursts of cooking it would be less of a deal, but usually you go low and slow in a dutch oven so it becomes a bigger problem.   I don't peel unless necessary for presentation. The skin is where a number of vitamins and a large amount of fiber are located so you're really doing a disservice bu removing it.  Just wash thuroughly.   Tofu parm.  Buy a brick or two of firm tofu but do NOT freeze it. Slice into 8-16 slices, coat with a mix of breadcrumbs, oregano and parmesean cheese with a tsp of baking soda mixed in. Brown in a skillet with two tbsp oil.  In an appropriately sized cooking dish, pour some tomato sauce (9x13 should work). Lay out the slices of tofu, overlapping if you need. Add the rest of the sauce until coated completely. Top with a generous amount of mozz/italian shredded cheese and some more parmesean.   Serve with some pasta and a salad.   Do both. They aren't mutually exclusive.  Usually I use a rub as a dry brine. Rub the day before and include a good bit of kosher salt (usually for a 5lb butt I use 1-2 tbsp), and whatever spices you'd like.  Before cooking, pat dry with a towel and sear in a ripping hot pan on one or two sides.  You can probably sear about 8 mins a side.  Then add to your dutch oven, add enough cooking liquid until the meat is between half and mostly covered, and bring to a simmer, then put in a low oven (between 275 and 325) for a few hours.  Check with a fork, if it feels tough, put it back in the oven for a half hour.  Braising is basically foolproof.   Brine the duck.   You need to give yourself as much buffer as possible because the breasts and leg/thigh cook to very different temps at rather different rates. Thats why most recipes call for breaking down the duck, it lets you treat the quarters differently.  When you roast whole you lose that flexability, and run into a very real risk of having the breast turn into cardboard by the time the thighs and legs are done.  It CAN be done, but you will definitely benefit from brining to give you some extra buffer for the breasts.   There are several things that make food go bad. Bacteria, fungus, and oxygen just to name the big ones.  The first two we can control via sterilization or pasteurization. Cooking essentially falls between the two (leaning a bit towards sterilization). The act of cooking essentially wipes out most of the "bad bugs" in your food. However, it doesn't remove any toxins or waste products that they may have already created. It also doesn't prevent them from coming back.  So cook first, serve later. If you dont think you will use it, cook and then freeze.   I have a dream of opening either a late night diner, or a public house. In either case, I know I need to better understand the "little things" about running a kitchen.  How do I plan a menu? How do I budget for supplies? How do I figure out how much to make? How are the different stations organized? How do I delegate work?  Stuff like that - things an amateur wouldn't know but someone who has gone to culinary school or hospitality school WOULD know. There's a marked difference between hosting a group of friends and hosting a ton of folks at a restaurant.  I have never worked in a real restaurant outside of a pretzel making job (and silly me didn't realize the meaning of the fact that it was the happiest I'd ever been at a job). I know these fine points are what usually kill most restaurants, so I want to learn them... somehow. My work schedule blocks me from getting a part time job at a restaurant or attending culinary school, so I am almost entirely self taught.  We have several soup kitchens in our city, and I was thinking - wouldn't this be a great place to cut my teeth and learn a lot of that stuff for free? Would skills learned there be applicable? I know most are on tight budgets, they have full kitchens, but I know many essentially serve from cans. It isn't perfect, but it seems like the experience cooking on a budget for a crowd is really what I would get out of it. Plus, y'know, the good feels.  I'm just looking for feedback from anyone who has commercial kitchen or restaurant experience who may be able to tell me how applicable the experiences would be.   Depending on the alloy though. Like, 300 series stainless, it gets exponentially harder to work with every time you do something to it.   Hey everyone. A buddy of mine has what I believe is the metal gear solid legacy collection for PS3. However, every video/unboxing I find has the game in a plastic case. His case is Metal, very similar to the special case that came with Beyond: Two Souls.  For the life of me I haven't been able to find a copy of the legacy collection with the metal case, or any of the other collections for that matter.  Does anyone know what this is?   Moloko aka Risn Murphy.   Hands down one of my very favorite music styles.    Edit: accidental repost  HAHA I suck cocks!   Especially they aren't wearing chainmail gloves. Holy hell.   Sir, you are brilliant.  I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.   Garlic custard. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/garlic-custards-recipe.html  Also goes very well with crown rack of lamb.   OP I feel you. I am on the board of directors for a company, and since I am the only one who works in the nearest large city, I have to attend and represent the company.  I literally sit there, look around at people talking, and drink beer until the bartender shoos me away.   Damn, Dolores O'roirdan is still flipping gorgeous.    ...with the fist of an angry god.   How the fuck did he pass the medical licensing exams? What licensure board lets this happen?   Yeah, I do have to concede on that one. The price they get on the bulk buys of chickens is absurd. I can usually get a roaster pretty cheap but not THAT cheap.   You can make it better, have a little confidence in your ability to learn. Remember - Julia Child didn't learn how to cook until her late 30's and look what came of her :)  Cooking is just a collection of different techniques you apply, I promise, you are totally capable of doing it. I'm saying this as someone who teaches cooking classes. I have yet to meet someone who is unable to learn unless they've convinced themselves they can't.   God damn that is a gorgeous dog!   Our grocery store sells bags of hard boiled eggs for $7. First, that's a 250% markup. Second, HARD BOILED EGGS.   It is so sad. At least he is in good hands now. Hopefully Death brought his kittens.  http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/073/b/9/death_and_kittens_by_powermadmistress-d4sqc98.jpg   There is almost no prepared food in the grocery store that can't be made better at home with minimal effort and lower costs.   Oooh, too soon?   Just now watched the recent [NOVA episode on sinkhole formation](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365411270/), and one of the major items it covered was the formation of the [Bayou Corne Sinkhole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou_Corne_sinkhole). The sinkhole was caused by injecting water into salt domes, which slowly dissolved, causing a massive sinkhole several football fields wide, and massive leaks of natural gas to escape. Several communities had to be abandoned, still others are in danger.  The process of salt brining involves injecting water into salt mines to dissolve the salt, and then the salty water is pumped out.  It occurred to me that this process is not unlike hydraulic fracturing OR deep injection wells. Both are usually done in limestone rich areas, and limestone, like salt, is water soluble. This seems like it's a ticking timebomb for the surface. Yet hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells are constantly advertised as safe.  Some of the events preceding massive sinkholes were bubbling up natural gas into local aquifers and surface water. Also, they were paired with earthquakes. I live in a state (Pennsylvania) with hydraulic fracturing, and have personally seen well water that reeks of diesel gas near fracking wells. In addition, the USGS has stated that [hydraulic fracturing is causing earthquakes](http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/).   Is there another factor involved here that allows hydraulic fracturing to be safe? Is this just whitewashing a real potential catastrophe? What makes hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells different from the processes experienced in the Bayou Corne sinkhole?   You know ima let you finish but no.   Whoever downvoted you is a moran. Paul Harvey was the man. I grew up listening to "The Rest of the Story" every morning/evening on AM radio.   I don't think so. Kaufman actually did some really cool things if you were smart/intellectual enough to understand it. Like reading Great Gatsby for an auditorium of people who wanted to watch an hour of him pretending to be a character from Taxi.   Just saying, your mom rocks.   Excellent - I'll check it out. Hopefully they're registered in the state where they're located... if not I'm guessing Delaware is a safe second guess.   USA Pretty simple question I hope. How can I look up a corporation's charter, and legally required public announcement of formation?  Is there a free way to do it? I am basically trying to find out a listing of the founding board members for a particular corporation.   Edit: Holy cow, thank you all for the great responses! I managed to hunt down the company - they were registered in a neighboring state from where they currently reside. Thank you!   This could totally explain why it isn't shown on the w-2s then! I saw some sites (non-IRS) that stated it was only valid for undergrad education though, so it looks like that may be old info.   Thank you! Ultimately it would be a difference of a few hundred dollars back on our refund so I'd like to find out how to approach it correctly.  I can see the two reimbursement payments for the school which completely cover the cost of tuition. However if the school considered it part of income, then we should still get credit for it since you're not supposed to include income from your w-2 as part of employer sponsored education assistance.   But if it's tax free, then we can't take it.   But then I would think the employer would need to call it out on the W-2, right? It's certainly a head scratcher for me!   So, my wife is a music teacher. She finished her masters degree last summer. We are located in Pennsylvania.  As a teacher, she does receive tuition reimbursement from her school. However I have found mixed information about whether or not tuition reimbursement is tax free or if it counts as taxable income. Specifically, it seems to meet all of the criteria EXCEPT it was used for graduate classes, which don't seem to be tax exempt.  The riembursement is not marked off on her W-2.  I would assume that I enter the cost of tuition, and then enter the same value for the riembursement? If it isn't clearly indicated on the W-2, that would imply it was tax free, right?   Will rate up for dog pictures! I'll see if I cant get a pic of my hound up this evening.   Well, the guy is the one on trial, not her. So if you can do anything at all to cast doubt on his case, you're not only sowing seeds of doubt in the minds of jurors, but in many cases you can use it as a strategy to appeal down the road OR for getting a smaller sentence.  In this case, you can claim there is doubt that he was the driver. You can say that her purse was on his side of the car. Anything to cast doubt on his guilt. Remember, all it takes is one juror to say not guilty.  In this case, it was pretty much rock solid, but in a lot of cases sowing doubt and blaming other people can provide enough doubt to keep your client free. The prosecutor then has to prove that those people couldn't have done it, and prove that the doubts are unfounded.   Heh, no. Nice suits reference though.   Anecdote: When I was still in pre-law, I had an internship at a very successful law firm. I was focused on constitutional law. I wanted to fight "the man" and protect "the little guy." My plan was to work for the ACLU. OR, to go into corporate litigation and go after companies who wrecked the planet and abused people. But an internship at a defense firm was where I started.  A client of ours had gotten shitty drunk, and got into his car with his girlfriend. He drove headfirst into a cement embankment going well over 100mph. He was wearing his seatbelt in the driver seat, and survived. She wasn't - she was thrown through the windshield about 60 feet from the vehicle. She also survived... if you want to call it living. She suffered massive internal injuries, just about every bone in her body busted, crushed spine, etc. She had been a pretty, young, straight A student, huge dreams and potential. 2 years later when this was in trial, she was still in the hospital being put back together.  My mentor handed me the case file and told me to find a way to put this girl in the driver's seat. I saw the crime scene photos. I saw what she looked like beforehand. I realized I would be telling the public "well the truth is THIS WOMAN drove into the embankment! It's all HER fault!" I felt nauseous and realized there was just no way I could do it. I couldn't, ON PUBLIC RECORD, try to victimize someone who had already lost so much for one stupid decision. I read through, couldn't find anything despite some halfhearted looking, and gave the file back to the lead attorney and said there wasn't anything.  I also saw my mentor on multiple occasions literally get up and walk out on people who desperately needed his help because they couldn't afford to retain him for $5k+. Folks begging him for help. Folks who were beat up on at protests. Folks who got caught with a dime bag of weed and were unlucky to be faced with a DA who wanted to make a name. One kid was assaulted with a baseball bat at a rest stop, so he pulled a pocket knife and stabbed the other guy. The DA wanted to charge him with aggravated assault because apparently there was a juvenile record. And my mentor just shrugged his shoulders at desperate crying people who had huge chunks of their lives on the line, and calmly walk out of the room. He just looked at me and said "they almost always come up with the money when they realize you don't owe them help."  I have huge respect for people who can do defense law. But a lot of time there is either a blatant coldness, a certain amount of moral flexibility, or a certain amount of moral dedication to the idea that everyone deserves an ardent defense no matter the cost... maybe some of each... that defense attorneys have. I just didn't have it.  At the end of that internship I dropped out of prelaw.   Honestly? I completely disagree. Traditional power companies will try to put them out of business, but companies like Google will fight it tooth and nail because it would be significantly more cost effective to build a small power plant than it would be to pay for the cost of power for a series of datacenters.   She started out on classical guitar. I'm pretty sure she knows it already.   Hey everyone A few years ago, I made absolutely KILLER cupcakes. They were chocolate stout cupcakes with a chocolate stout ganache frosting, topped with a raspberry.  There was also a filling that, if I remember correctly, was made with pureed raspberries, lindemans framboise lambic, heavy cream, and some sugar (possibly some other ingredients I can't remember). The resulting product was about the consistency of a pudding. It made a wonderful filling for the cupcakes, and the leftovers made a wonderful standalone dessert on their own.  For the life of me though, I can't find the recipe for it anymore. Can anyone help?  I have found these two:  http://ohmyveggies.com/recipe-chocolate-lambic-cupcakes-with-raspberry-cream-cheese-frosting/  This recipe produces a final product that LOOKS like what I made, but I absolutely didn't use cream cheese. The pictures are good for a reference.  http://www.beercook.com/details.htm?record_id=3d56c9a17e7637d7_97910  This one is CLOSE. I may use the ice cream base without the puree, reduce it a bit beyond nappe, cool, and stir in the puree to loosen it up to a pipeable consistency.  Has anyone made anything like this before that could help? Sadly raspberries are out of season so I won't be able to afford taking more than one shot at it.   I saw that... it honestly made me wonder if maybe she was playing rocksmith. Not that there is anything wrong with that - I also started with classical guitar, and I love me some rocksmith.   That sounds exactly like where I am!   I have a classical, a strat, and a little martin... any suggestion on what the best to learn it on would be? The nylon strings are the most forgiving but sometimes it's easier to learn on the steel strings...   I honestly felt the same way. Especially when he had both of their weight on that floppy ass diving board. She seems cute enough, it'd be a shame for her to get hurt.   If you are doing individual stocks and you aren't an institutional investor, you may want to check out robinhood (not sure if it's public or if they still have a waiting list). No commissions on basic trades. There are some big limitations... you need to be using IOS for starters. And not all stocks are available. But for the majority of my single-company stuff they've worked out extremely well.   First, I'd see if you can get mom and dad to find a 1/2 or 3/4 scale guitar. It would be way easier to learn on. Not that it can't be done, but it'll be way easier.  I would stick with teaching music. Songs. Some scales would be fine. Teach her to improv on some pentatonic scales so she can learn to make her own songs. Kids that age are a bundle of learning ability and don't have the hangups adults do. Improv would be choice. Even just one or two notes and build from there.  Theory is simply beyond someone her age right now. There's a lot of abstract concepts that, while they have good justifications behind them, most kids simply won't be able to get (why are there 12 notes? what is a note? what is a semitone? What is the 12th root of 2? Why is A 440hz? What is a hertz? what is an interval?).  Send me a PM reminder and I'll talk to my wife when she wakes up. She's a professional band teacher for elementary students, but most of her kids don't start until about age 10. She may have some ideas.   I've tried the following:  * Arching my finger * Tilting my finger so it's against the corner/side of the finger instead of the bottom * Holding my guitar like I play classical and letting gravity pull my hand down on to the fretboard * Just pressing with all of my strength  No matter what I do, i can't get strings 1, 2, and 3 to sound clearly. Usually 4, 5 and 6 sound ok.  I have really short fat fingers, so the area that is causing problems is really fleshy/chubby. Any tips would be really helpful.   OP needs to listen to the sing "Common People" by Pulp. It sums it up well.  No, you may not have money, but you'll also never have any idea what it's like to choose between food and rent, or what it's like to live on the street because a boss decided his son needed the job more than you before rent was due. You'll always have a safety net. A lot of people dont have that luxury.  I'm not trying to belittle your situation OP, but it sounds like you have a lot more than you realize.   Honestly, I use it for their portfolio builder these days, I can't invest in the individual funds as cheaply as I can invest via SB.  A long while ago when I invested in single stocks their automatic investment was a great deal. Not nearly so much anymore thanks to robinhood.   Pretty simple question. At the end of last month, they sent an email that they had an extension until the 12th of March. As of a few days ago, I received a new one saying they had an extension until the 18th.  What is the point of having a deadline for the materials if a brokerage can keep extending ad infinitum?  My account is just a series of funds, so it shouldn't be anything complex. Specifically, this is the message I have been receiving:   As a result of the reallocation of dividends for certain securities you hold, your official 1099 tax form(s) will be available no later than March 18, an IRS approved extension. For details see the icon to the right.   "Quick, congress, I need approval to commission Motorboat 1"   Did you give him grief for screwing over Pluto? :)   As mentioned, this is a question about US law. This is mostly hypothetical, though it is also concerning a number of leaks about a company I used to have a business relationship with that have come out over the past 2 days. A number of people would like to see the company prosecuted for defrauding tons of investors, and the leaks are extremely damning.  To my knowledge, the constitutional protection against illegal search and seizure protects you from the government illegally searching you. However, another person like a thief or a hacker is certainly not the government. So if they uncover evidence of a crime being performed (suppose they hack into someone's email account), that should be admissible, correct? Because it wasn't a government agent who took it illegally?   So, my brother and his wife have consistently had financial issues. They are well over a quarter million dollars in debt, they both work minimum wage jobs. They have two kids that both have medical issues.  A few months ago they ran a gofundme campaign to raise money for their plight - as far as I know they raised several thousand dollars.  I am in significantly better financial shape. I use kickstarter occasionally because I like to help get businesses off the ground, and it's a great way to get fun art and gadgets for around my house. Well, it turns out my sister-in-law is using kickstarter too.  Daily.  Like - almost every day I get a notice that she has contributed to something. But then a few hours later I see posts on facebook from either her or my brother that they're hurting so badly financially that they don't know how they'll make ends meet, etc.  Then I think about all of their friends that they suckered in with their gofundme thing.  I really want to call them out on it. Should I?   Hey everyone. I got my LXME earlier this week, and it sounds great. It's meant to be a travel guitar for me, so it isn't super fancy. I picked up a strap as well. I have no problem attaching the strap on the heel.   The problem comes up when I try to attach the strap to the end pin. It's about 3x the diameter of the pin on the heel because it's also accommodating a 1/4" jack. Working it a bit I was able to get it to fit, but there are still tabs of leather sticking out everywhere and it seems very insecure.  Is there a trick I'm missing? Is this normal? Should I just rig something else to make it work? Can I cut out some more of the leather to make it fit?   Hey everyone - hopefully this is a simple question. I am trying to send a letter to a Tax Attorney in Poland. I used the USPS calculator here: http://postcalc.usps.com/  And it says that the product "international letter" for less than 1 ounce is $1.15.  Can I just attach 3 forever stamps? Or do I need to take it in to a post office to ship?         Any help would be appreciated...  Este nevoie de o zi de sptmn de administrare care se utilizeaz cteva zile mai devreme   This should be a very simple request. I'm still new and don't have a very good ear yet. It sounds really easy, I just can't quite figure it out. It's just chords.  Here is a youtube vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvf9f_3RmU   It seems whenever I post about something like it on this sub, I get rated down but no one is ever willing to offer constructive criticism to help me ask the right people. I'm just trying to find the right place to ask.  For example: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2wubf1/can_anyone_tell_me_the_chords_in_i_hate_the_man/  No comments, just a rate down.  Is there a sub dedicated to tabbing or figuring out how to play songs?      So, I personally find I like playing with my nails vs using alaska piks, fingertips, or other fingerpicks.   I've never really been one who had to worry about having a manicure kit, so I'm learning how to handle all of the care-and-feeding of having slightly longer nails.  What do you recommend putting in a "nail kit?" I've seen some for sale from companies like Savarez, but it seems like $40-50 is awful pricy for what looks like a few emory boards, some press ons, some sandpaper, some resin, and some silk.  So, for those of you who play with nails, what do you keep on hand to both shape, maintain, and repair your nails?  I've also seen the Mel Bay "Guitarist guide to fingernails" mentioned some places, but I wasn't sure if it's really worthwhile to spend the cash on such a narrowly focused book.   Just an esoteric post because it's lunchtime and the smells are overwhelming.   Currently wafting from our work pantry/kitchen are the fragrances from an amazing assortment of different curries, daals, kadhi and more. No matter where I go in the building, I can't escape that incredible sweet-spicy smell. Every pantry is the same way. It's both divine and torturous at the same time. It's like standing outside a restaurant but not being able to go inside.  Does anyone else work in an office with lots of foreign workers? I can't be the only one who undergoes this torture on a daily basis. I guess I'll just softly weep into my sandwich :'(   TLDR: Indian co-workers are reheating their homemade leftovers, and it makes me want Indian food.      So, I know this song is simple. I have been playing for less than a year and have a really hard time playing by ear. There seem to be no tabs or chords available for it.  Would anyone be able to tell me the chords?  I can figure out the strum pattern from there.   Here is the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvf9f_3RmU   I am located in Pennsylvania, USA. A few months ago, on a lark, I saw a small bitcoin point-of-sale that was running an initial offering in a Polish Joint Stock Company. I had some play money, so I invested. Worst case? It's a scam. Best case? I help get a business I believe in get off the ground. The investment was in bitcoin and I had some bitcoin on hand, I figured what the heck.  Well, as of today I received my stock certificate. In addition, I also received a form letter, and  surprising to me, a power of attorney form.   The body of the form letter:  Dear Sir, Acting as the Board of Management of InPay S.A. with its seat in Warsaw (register number 0000512707; herinafter referred to as "COMPANY", we would like to kindly thank you for your interest in the activities of the Company. Regarding to the completion of the public offering, subscription and allotment of shares, hereby we state that on 22-10-2014 was concluded a contract of purchase registered shares of the Company, which shall enter into force on the date of receipt the document of shares, on the basis of which you acquired 10 Company's registered shares of A Series with numbers from 64122 to 64131.   Therefore, please find attached to this letter the document of company's shares which is corresponding to the substance of the contract referred to the above.   Simultaneously, we would like to inform you of the obligation to pay tax on civil law transactions in respect to the conclusion of the contract, which should be paid to the proper tax office within 14 days from receipt the document of the Company's shares, according to the Act of 9th September 2000 about Tax on Civil Law Transactions (you can find a consolidated text of this act in polish law gazette under the number: Dz.U.2010.101.649). In order to facilitate the fulfillment of the obligation described above, we would like to offer the possibility of preparing and filing the appropriate tax declaration with the payment also of that tax. **For this purpose we submit the attached power of attorney to sign, upon receipt of which we will make the payment of this tax to the proper tax office.** Please send this power of attorney directly to the law firm, which is cooperating with us, on the address which is indicated in the document of power of attorney. Sincerely (president, management board member).    The power of attorney form requests me to:    "grant power of attorney to a tax advisor (name) to prepare, sign submit, and to represent me before the proper tax office in the issue of submitting the tax return no. PCC-3, in respect of purchase contract of the share/shares of InPay S.A. (polish joint stock company) with its seat in Warsaw (register no. 0000512707), which have been concluded between me and that company."  I've attached images of the 3 documents (including the sealed, watermarked share certificate). http://imgur.com/a/bSLUG  I have 3 concerns -  1. Does this look legitimate? Does it look like a scam? Having foreign nationals have power of attorney to submit taxes for me raised my suspicions a bit.  1. If it is legitimate, the sale completed back in November. If they want me to return it to Poland within 10 days, that's going to be nigh impossible. How much leeway is given? Is it only the postmark date that is important?  1. Did I open a can of worms investing like this? I figured it would be fun, but I have to admit I didn't fully think of all of the consequences of the investment. It's tiny, but still I want to CMA.  Any help would be really appreciated.   Edit: added emphasis   Sadly it takes having some extra ingredients on hand and a few hours of work, but one little (well, 6lbs) duck's sacrifice gives me the following:  * 4 meals (2 breasts, 2 leg quarters) *  1 pint of rendered duck fat (no idea exactly how much, i used about 2/3 cup making roasted root veggies) * about 3/4 cup of duck liver pat * 1 quart bag of dog treats (rendered duck skin rinds) * 1 quart of duck stock  IMO, it's the single most versatile animal for home cooking. The only thing that comes close is a pig, and I can't really buy a whole hog at a time like I can with a duck.  I wonder why they aren't more common in American kitchens? There's pretty much nothing to waste.  Sorry there aren't any pictures - too busy cooking to take any :)   So, I am trying to remember what episode this was.   Basically, I remember a number of quotes along the lines of "Americans have it so good that all they can do to fill their time is complain about everything."  For the life of me I can't remember if it's the episode about smug, the episode about the economy, or something else. I just remember that the point was that people who complain all the time are people whose lives are so good they don't realize it.  Anyone have any ideas?   Hey everyone! My teacher and I have been working through the Parkening method book, and recently we added in the Pumping Nylon technique book.  I have been mostly focused on the finger independence exercises.  If I leave my middle finger planted on the third string, at first it was almost impossible for me to put my ring finger on the first string. I had to use my other hand and push the finger down.  After two weeks, it will go down there on its own but the movement to get it down there seems like it is in slow motion, and it almost never sounds clearly. It also makes my hand ache for a good half hour afterwards. If I move it up to the 6 th string, 90% of the time the middle finger comes up with it, even when I am consciously telling my hand not to move my middle finger.  Do some people just have really "stuck together" middle and ring fingers? Will I work through this? Is it a normal part of developing finger independence?  I was expecting the little finger to be way worse, but I don't seem to have any issues with that one. Just the ring finger.   A buddy of mine has been attempting to sell and then backing off of selling this guitar for years. In college it was his baby, so he is hesitant to part with it. But he never plays, so it jas been languising in his basement for nearly a decade.  So I asked him if I could long term borrow, and if he ever decided he wanted to sell, I would buy it. That way he could always get it back if he wanted.  Anyways, I got it set up, but he has 3 of the tremolo springs missing, the backplate is missing, and the tremolo bar is missing. I want to replace the missing parts (probably not the springs because I don't want to set it up again and it plays nicely).  I've found a replacement backplate, but I see hundreds of different tremolo bar options.  I tried reaching out to fender but got no response. Can anyone link me to the correct one?   Feel free to use an amazon aff link if you want to get a few cents off the purchase, its the least I can do.  This is basically the exact guitar (sunburst with gold hardware): http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/fender-deluxe-players-stratocaster-electric-guitar   Hey everyone. I want to make black pudding for an Irish breakfast party we are having sunday. For the life of me, I cannot track down pig blood. None of our butchers carry it (going so far as to claim it's illegal for them to sell). None of the meat processors will work with us.  An Ethnic Chinese market near us sells quarts of frozen cooagulated pig blood. Every black pudding/boudin noir recipe I can find calls for fresh though (going so far as to strain out anything that is coagulated).  Does it matter if it's been coagulated? Is it TRULY necessary?  After researching, [pig blood curd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_blood_curd), the stuff the Chinese market has, is usually just blood that has been left sitting for a few minutes to solidify and then it is frozen. The way to serve it is to cut into cubes and poach. Similarly, black pudding is mixed, cased and poached. So it seems like the processes are not entirely different.      Just curious - is this expected? When I launch through steam, it seems like steam has all of my profile info saved. But if I try to click on dlc, it tells me I have to set up "external purchases in steam." However if I exit steam and then launch, uplay works properly.  Is there any way to make it work properly with steam?   Hey everyone. I want to make black pudding for an Irish breakfast party we are having sunday.

In the exercise, it says that you are looking to snap the second finger on to the string to create the snappy yet even tone. However it also says that as soon as you have applied the second finger you're not supposed to apply extra pressure.  After playing with it, i've found if I completely relax the second finger while leaving it on the string it mutes, creating a nice staccato sound. If I leave it with some pressure the note keeps ringing producing a nice legato sound.  Which is correct for practicing the exercise? It just says not to apply extra pressure, not whether or not you should remove all pressure.   Simple question I hope. My bonus came in and I am looking to pick up a little martin LXME for when I am traveling.  Basically everywhere you look the price is the same, and pretty much all of them have free shipping. Are there any vendors that differentiate themselves by including a bunch of extras?  Stuff like extra picks, strings, etc?   Hey everyone. We have a 51" Samsung PN51e7000 plasma TV. My wife tends to be the one who uses smarthub, and lately things like netflix and amazon prime video have been freezing up, causing the tv to hard reset itself.  I've tried doing firmware upgrades and downgrades and gotten nowhere.  So, I started looking at the smart upgrade kits that are made available for smarthub. I know the sek1000 can be had for under $100, but I figure if I am doing it I may as well go with the latest and greatest.  For those of you who have used the upgrade kit - how well does it work? Are the problems with freezing apps gone (googling around this doesn't seem to be an uncommon problem)? Do you NEED to use the new remote? Does the new remote replace the old remote entirely, or is it only for smarthub?  Just trying to get a feel for the product and if it's worth it to drop 150+$   Hey everyone. I am looking to rebalance my portfolio over the next few weeks. I currently have about 1k invested across the following funds, with 50$ being added weekly and an additional 750$ quarterly:  * 7% - EWX (SPDR emerging small cap etf) * 17% - PID (PowerShares International Dividend Achievers Portfolio) * 10% - SCHA (Schwab U S Small Cap ETF) * 17% - SCHM (Schwab US Mid-Cap) * 4% - VNQ (Vanguard REIT Index Fund) * 30% - VONV (Vanguard russell 1000) * 15% - VOOG (Vanguard SP500 Growth index fund)  In addition, I am making the 3k minimum investment into VPAIX (Vanguard long term tax free PA Muni bond fund). I'm a PA resident, so it seems like a no-brainer to add it to my portfolio.  However, once this is added I will have to rebalance out my portfolio - the muni bonds would make up 75% of the portfolio. I want to try to stick to the Ben Graham 50% stock/50% bonds (leaning as far as 75%/25% based on market conditions) suggestions. How much of my portfolio should go into those tax free muni bonds? Should I look at adding another bond fund as well?   Hello everyone. I am looking to help diversify my portfolio by investing in VPAIX (a vanguard tax free PA muni bond). I am a resident of PA, so it makes the most sense for me.  In the past week or so as I was assembling the minimum investment, my sharebuilder account now seems to show that the fund is closed to new investors. However my fidelity account gives no such warning.  Is this just a website thing? Is it possible for new investors to be blocked from one brokerage but not another?  Checking on the vanguard website, there doesn't seem to be any indication that the fund is closed but I don't have an account there to really be sure.   I know the books were originally released in Polish, then the video games were made. I haven't played them, but the world caught my fancy.  After the games were made, the books were translated by fans and then official translations were released.  So, that said, I began reading the Last Wish 2 days ago. I've been surprised that the book is actually VERY readable. Not a masterwork thus far, but good enough I keep wanting to read more.  I suppose I am so used to video game related books to be... Well... Terrible.  So who else has read them? Your thoughts? Are all of the translations decent?         The caps are intentional. Growing up, I was raised to know there is a difference between hot cocoa, and hot chocolate. Hot cocoa is based on just that - cocoa. Hot chocolate includes both cocoa solids and cocoa butter.  I can find tons of recipes that use just cocoa, but I can't find any for hot chocolate/hot drinking chocolate.  Does anyone have any decent recipes they could share? I haven't been able to find it since I was in belgium, and with the snow I'm going nuts!      Pretty simple question. I know they both effectively mean the same thing in practice, but can someone explain what nolo contendere really means to set it apart from guilty?  Location: Pennsylvania      I haven't been able to find an answer to this anywhere. Do the little martins use a nitrocellulose, polyurethane, or laquer finish?  I'm looking at purchasing an LXME for traveling, but I can't seem to get an answer about this question.   Just curious who out there has purchased one of these guys? How do you like it?  I am considering picking up one of the HPL little martins with my bonus from work in a few weeks for when my wife and I travel. I thought that it might be fun to pick up one with a pickup and connect a tonewoodamp to it for some neat effects while we're camping, but I'm not sure how well the TWA works, or how well it would work on a parlor guitar.   Hey everyone. In june of last year I purchased a kremona f65c. I have been using the stock strings since then, practicing about 1-2 hours a day daily. None of the steel strings have any visual degradation like steel strings would, except you can see marks from the fret wire on them - specifically the steel strings. They still seem to be ok and are keeping tune just fine.  The only issue I seem to be running into is that g# on the 3rd string (first fret) refuses to play clearly. Where everything else on the guitar rings nicely, this makes more of a "thud" sound. I've had people suggest it could be a wolf tone, but when I play g# elsewhere it rings cleanly so that seems unlikely. Other suggestions were it could be the strings, or it could be a problem with the guitar.  So, does it sound like time to change my strings? Could it resolve my g# issue? How do i know what strings the guitar shipped with? When I bought the guitar the guitar shop gave me a pack of d'addario pro arte normal tension strings, but I'm concerned using them if the tension/weight is wrong because I don't want to damage the guitar (I know that changing string weight can cause other guitars to need to be re-setup because of tension on the neck changing the action, but a setup is less of an option on a classical with no truss rod).   Do classical strings age faster or slower than steel strings? Am I due for a change?   Hey everone. First, an apology. I am a newbie when it comes to tea, and I am posting this using a mobile app so I cannot see the sidebar. I hope discussion of specific brands isn't prohibited (since I already seem to have gotten a rate down).   A year ago a coworker gave me a box of tea - he called it "red tea". After some help on /r/translation I have found it is   (xin xiang brand tai guan yin tea).  It's a type of oolong tea.  I have fallen in love with this tea. After some research I've learned that the traditional varities count themselves among some of the most expensive tea on earth, and usually it comes in single serving packets.   I would like to purchase more, specifically the Muzha variety (he described it as red tea, so that would make the most sense right?). I have had no luck finding the same brand.  However for the life of me I can't find much more information. I can't really go to a store and buy more, so I was hoping there are notable trustworthy brands.  Any advice for a relative tea newbie who wants to track down more of this awesome tea?? Preferably in relative bulk?  Really any help would be appreciated.   Can anyone tell me what brand of tea this is? It was a gift from a Chinese coworker and I'd like to buy more because it is quite good.  Hopefully this image is clear enough: http://imgur.com/jaTk5dr      Hello everyone. My wife and I are planning our vacation this year - a little 2 week roadtrip through the Finger Lakes in NY for wine tours, and then the Canadian side of Niagara falls for 3 days, and then south to Falling Water (the famous Frank Lloyd Wright home) southwest of Pittsburgh.  Currently we are planning to travel from our home to the Finger Lakes first, and while in wine country of course purchase a healthy amount of wine for our personal enjoyment.  My concern is about crossing the border into Canada with a case or two of wine, and then back into the US. I know that it really comes down to the border agent whether or not they want to hassle you about "personal use" amounts.  Since it would have been purchased in the US, do I have to declare it when entering Canada? Do I have to declare it when coming back into the US (we obviously will keep receipts)?  I'm just trying to figure out if we need to reverse the order of places we are planning to visit so the Finger Lakes is on the last leg, but we had really hoped to enjoy sitting on our hotel room's balcony, watching the falls, and drinking some wine.  Any thoughts would be very much appreciated.   So, for christmas my wife purchased a stationary trainer for my bike. I have been using it periodically since. When I set it up, i replaced my brooks saddle with the stock saddle for the bike, thinking the more race-oriented saddle would be a good way to go.  However, after about 30-35 minutes on the trainer, my groin/penis goes numb. Not "my foot is asleep" numb, but completely dead to sensation. Sensation comes back after about 5 minutes of being off the trainer and everything is ok.  I am, I think quite reasonably, concerned about this. I have heard about poor fitting saddles putting pressure on nerves to the side of the groin, but never anything that would directly impact the genitals.  Does this signify I need a new saddle? Do i need to adjust the saddle? This is the first time this has happened to me so I'm kind of at a loss.   Hello everyone. I am trying to verify the authenticity of what I think could be the first copy of a first edition of a book from a rather famous artist (Ralph Steadman). The book is little.com.   While in Paris on our honeymoon, my wife and I stopped by Shakespeare and Co. The store is split into the main store, and a rare and antique books section next to it. Being an antique book lover, I stopped in.  There I beheld this guy. A signed first edition copy of little.com by Ralph Steadman, one of my favorite artists. Further, it seemed to match up with the books own claim to being part of a limited edition run of 300 books. Even more, it claimed to be number 1 out of those 300. Considering the price of 40 EUR, I thought it was too good of a chance to pass up and picked it up.  The imgur album shows off the book, but it also shows the part that has me concerned about the authenticity of the book.  The copyright mentions the limited edition run of 300. On the title page, the authors autograph is prominently displayed. At the top of the page in different writing is 1/300 (though it could be printed vs script). That would indicate that this is the very first book out of those 300 special editions. But its also what has me concerned. The only other example I have been able to find is this: http://www.stellabooks.com/stockimages_sorted/384/384394~2.JPG  The numbering is completely different. While mine is in what appears to be pencil, the other example seems to be written in the same ink as the authors signature. Now, obviously Mr. Steadman could have started it out one way, and then switched over.  The copyright also mentions that the limited edition and the normal edition have 2 different ISBNs, but I don't know if the different ISBN is just the same book in alternative packaging.  Mr. Steadman is based in Wales, so it doesnt seem farfetched that a copy in that limited edition would find itself in Paris. Further, it seems doubtful that a book store as acclaimed as Shakespeare and Company would sell a forgery given a substantial portion of their business is selling antique and rare books.  I tried reaching out to Ralph Steadman over twitter but only got a confirmation that there was a limited edition run of 300 - not really a verification.  So - what is everyones thoughts? Could this really be the first, first edition of this book?  I tried posting before but automod removed it because it was a link to an imgur album, so I am reposting with a bit more info.  The imgur album is here: http://imgur.com/a/urWxE         Hey everyone. This is something I am pondering. The wife and I are going to be doing our vacation in Niagara falls this year. We will be staying on the Canadian side, and spending a day in Canada and a day in NY.  I am not paying for international roaming, so while in Canada I will most likely just turn my phone off. However, when we are in NY is there any chance of my phone trying to go into international roaming?  When I am on the canadian side, is there any chance my phone will try to connect to NY towers?  I'm not near international borders very often, and when I am it's usually in Europe so I use my work phone.   Hey everyone. My wife and I have been looking to begin small-scale production of jellies, jams, and candies to sell publicly. We are in Pennsylvania which has some of the looses cottage food laws in the US, which is a great boon for us. However the department of health still requires that any food prepared in a kitchen be done so in a home that has no pets - we have a dog and a cat, and we aren't just going to kick them to the side. We don't have an in-law suite or a place we could put a separate kitchen/sink, so it seems like our house won't work.  I have investigated renting a shared commercial kitchen, but the prices are simply absurd. We're talking $25-50/hr, a minimum of $250, with a $500 deposit. So at least $250 every single time we would can or prepare candy. After purchasing jars, ingredients, and the time it takes we will barely make a profit (if we make one at all).  So, how did you get started with your food based business?   I've been playing since july of last year, so I absolutely still a beginner. With my teacher I have been working through the christopher parkening method books (still on volume 1). We have splashed in some other material (some chord work with folk music). I've been practicing about an hour to 1.5 hours a day. In addition, over the past month and change I have been mussing around with a strat that a friend is letting me long-term-borrow along with an application called rocksmith - usually another hour to another hour and a half a day.  However, I seem to be hitting a pretty heavy wall. My teacher had been assigning 3-4 pieces a week, though that has slowed down. Reading reviews, apparently one of the big criticisms of the Parkening books is that they have a HUGE ramp up in difficulty.   I am up to about exercise 60 (Beethoven's 5th) and I'm finding that I just can't keep up. Working on that one piece all week, playing extremely slow (15 bpm-30bpm), and I'm only about half way through. My fingers just can't seem to find the right spots on the fretboard and it doesn't seem to be sticking mentally.  It just feels like my progress has seriously slowed down at this point and I'm feeling a little discouraged.  Is this normal - like if I just keep pushing it will pass? Is there a "hump" when you're beginning? Or is this a sign I'm doing too much?   I have heard this multiple times, and I honestly don't understand the logic or math.  So can someone explain where this statement comes from?   Hey everyone! I know the echo has no battery backup. My plan is to use it as a replacement for an under-cabinet radio we currently have that is dying. I also think it would make a great kitchen companion. My wife and I cook a lot, so the ability to be in the middle of working and just say "alexa, add fresh cilantro to the shopping list" or "alexa, set a timer for 20 minutes" is fantastic for freeing up our hands when we're busy.  My concern though is if for some crazy reason we lose power. I know when you start a timer, it shows up in the companion app. If you start a timer and the echo loses power, does the timer keep going on the companion app? Or does it stop completely?  Second, my wife and I both have android phones. Does a single echo only work with the companion app on ONE phone, or can she and I both use it?  EDIT: One more question - can you modify the wake word? I have heard several folks say that it can only be configured as "Amazon" or "Alexa"   Super excited. I'm even more excited having played around on youtube and finding some really creative hacks people have come up with to let Echo handle home automation.  I'm especially interested in using it in tandem with Nest thermostats (we don't have any yet, but it could be a deal maker) - something really cool about saying "Alexa todo - turn the temperature to 70 degrees" and having the thermostats all adjust automatically.   Hey everyone. Not sure if this is appropriate for here or /r/personalfinance, but I think this may be the most appropriate.  I work for a large telecom that lots of people hate - enough that it was caricatured on a popular sitcom. The company is in the process of trying to purchase one of its larger competitors, and in the event of regulatory approval, the stock could see a significant jump in value. That's all the information I can provide - it should be enough for most of you to figure out who I am talking about.  They offer employees an ESPP which provides shares at a price of 15% off the first or last day of the quarter, whichever was lower. This usually leads to a handsome return. The catch is shares aren't eligible to be sold for 1 year (I know there are tax ramifications with that short of a sale anyways). After 1 year, they're yours to do with as you please.  So, after years at this company I have a decent sized collection of stock, but my concern is that I am so heavily invested. Most of my portfolio is well diversified. But this one particular brokerage account - if the stock nosedives, the account will go with it.   My speculative side wants to keep the shares that are eligible to be sold with the likelihood that the merger is approved. My safe side wants to sell the eligible shares and buy shares of an index fund to minimize risk. I have 4 quarters worth of shares that I can't touch so if the deal is approved and the stock soars, i will see some benefit. Also if the deal is not approved and the stock dips, I will see some pain when speculators jump ship.  The stock soaring is at least a little unlikely given the efficient market hypothesis, right? Outside of some folks who will jump in when they hear that the deal is approved but I assume that would be temporary.  Just looking to get a feel of what other folks would do in this situation.  My goal is long term growth.   I am asking this based on experience with piano. Many pianists have worked through the Czerny's 101 exercises OR Hanon - they're considered essentials.  I know Bach fugues are kind of a big deal, but are there any other exercise compilations that are common?   Hey everyone. I am working through my new lesson music, and one of the chords is an inversion of A major. It's played on the 2nd fret, 2nd, 3rd and 4th strings.  Per my teacher, I'm supposed to play using 2/I on 4th string, 3/M on 3rd, 4/A on 2nd.  The problem I am running into is it's a rather small space for 3 fat fingers, so obviously one of my fingers has to be almost entirely across the fret from the fret wire. It feels like I am choosing between having one or more strings buzz when playing, or I am muffling a string, OR I have to press with a death grip. Damn my sausage fingers.  Can anyone offer any advice on how I might be able to play this a little bit more clearly? It seems like it should be simple, but I just can't get it to ring.   After having yet another guitar-related post get downvoted within seconds on /r/guitar, I just wanted to throw this out there. Everyone's helpfulness on here is greatly appreciated for beginners like myself.  The folks on this sub all seem to be helpful, willing to listen, and always good for pointers. I genuinely enjoy posting here, and most of the time get great answers to questions I ask. Most people seem to have the same luck. Further, it's really cool that there is a sense of community and that we even have devs poking around.  So, just keep doing what you do. You guys rock.   Any suggestions? So far googling around is yielding a lot of "learn the pentatonic and major scale" which isn't really an exercise per se. I can play the scales around the fretboard, I am looking more for exercises on applying them.   Pretty simple q I hope. I use sites like amazon mechanical turk and microworkers to pull in a little extra cash. Is there anything like that built entirely around bitcoin?   Exactly what the title says! What are your favorite easy songs that you learned really early in your career? Ones that you're still playing when you pick up your guitar presumably years later??  I'm still new to guitar - I've been taking classical lessons since june, and recently started branching out into jazz and rock on my own (with my teacher giving some guidance to help me learn chord shapes). I'd just love to hear what "easy" songs you never get tired of playing - things that are enjoyable to play - it doesn't necessarily have to be a crowd pleaser or some mainstream tune. Stuff you'd play when you have 10 minutes and are alone in a room with your guitar and no one else is listening.   Yesterday I was playing RS and I realized that none of my DLC was showing up. I exited the game and went into steam, and for some reason the game was grayed out as if it was uninstalled. I right clicked to check DLC and it said that both the game and cherub rock were uninstalled.   I doubleclicked to install - it brought up a dialog that said "checking existing files" which took about 2 minutes, and the game suddenly showed up as installed again, and with it, cherub rock came back, and further all of my CDLC.  So has anyone else had this happen? I've never seen it before.   So sometimes I will have issues transitioning between chords for a particular song, and the game recommends playing star chords.  But then when I take the suggestion - none of the chords I need to practice appear in the game. So, while it is helpful, the suggestion doesn't really help with the song.  So, is there any way to specify ONLY specific chirds to show up?   Hey everyone. I have noticed that on my classical everything sounds great EXCEPT the first fret on the 3rd/g string (A flat).  Where pretty much every other note sounds fine and rings clearly, when I play that fret it sounds very dull, as if the string was muted.  Does anyone have any idea what the issue could be? My teacher suggested it could be a node on the string, but are there other possibilities? I doubt it is the fret because first fret rings clearly on every other string.   For me:  * [Grateful Dead - Friend of the Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XacvydVrhuI)  * [The Stray Cats - Stray Cat Strut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEtbfzMLVWU)  * [Django Reinhardt - Django's Tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ZYLvcAFXQ)  * [Pink Floyd - Pigs on the Wing \(Full 8-Track Version\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGSPUOaHYn4)  * [Peter Frampton - Do you Feel Like We Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Yq5m9eLIQ)      Exactly what the subject says. It seems like biologically it would be a disadvantage. The act of tearing the hymen would (at least theoretically) expose the woman to the possibility of infection. Tearing creates an open wound, often created by a foreign body entering the vagina (which should allow external bacteria to get by the normally acidic fluid in the vagina). Obviously this wouldn't be the case for tears that come from any number of other reasons, but still, a lot of females do have it torn via intercourse.  Are hymens found in all species? Is it a vestigial thing?   So, in light of the sony hack and subsequent threats of violence (and likely blackmail based on unsavory info gathered in the hack), I am of the opinion that this, along with drones, is going to be the way a lot of modern warfare is going to be heading. We all know (whether we want to admit it or not) that human beings are good at killing one another. That will not stop.  So, what are options for investing here?  I have a long stake in Kratos Systems (control systems for drones). I assume a lot of the more traditional players (general dynamics, raytheon, LM, etc) aren't the best options because they have more  traditional warfare solutions they have to attend to in addition to cyberwarfare projects. What other players are there in these markets? Are there other smaller players who are dedicated entirely towards cyberwarfare or cybersecurity that may be more nimble and inventive than some of the traditional players are capable of being?      The title says it all. I am currently long term borrowing a friend's deluxe players strat. He has done some minor work to it, part of which I think includes adding noiseless pickups.  The one thing I have noticed though, the pickups have what looks like metal nubs that stick out of them under the strings. Some of them rise out of the plastic block part of the pickup a few mm. Others are actually sunk down into the plastic block. Still others are about flush.  Is this correct? Should they all be flush? I don't have a pic but I can try posting one when I get home tonight.  The pickups look kinda like this: http://www.themusiczoo.com/PDGImages/Noiseless_Stratocaster_Picups_0992115000_a576.jpg    So, I posted a few days ago about rocksmith not detecting a lot of notes. I took advice from folks here and got my guitar a full setup for the new strings I put on it. No matter what, I'm glad I did it because notes south of the 12th fret are actually correct now.  However, rocksmith STILL seems to be intermittently ignoring certain notes. For instance, I can't seem to get 100% on the shifting practice track, as simple as it is. Half the time the 7th and 12th frets aren't detected. I've used my snark to verify that the notes are being played as expected (B and E respectively). There aren't any problems with intonation. Despite using HDMI I seem to have lucked out with having no lag (good TV maybe? or maybe the fact I'm using a HDMI 4 cable?) so that isn't the issue.  My fingers are in the right spot - at least with the 12th fret there are times when the note repeats multiple times with a few counts in between. My fret hand doesn't move, finger is placed directly next to the fret and I get a clear tone, yet only 1-2 out of 3 will actually be detected by the game. I've tried downstrokes, upstrokes, finger picking it, hell I even slapped it a few times out of frustration.  I have my pickup volume cranked for all pickups. On my mac I went into the mixer and cranked up the line in volume for the rocksmith cable to as high as it would go before I started getting a hum.  I've easily put in 50+ attempts now and it always seems like either the 7th or 12th fret has trouble.  So, has anyone encountered an issue like this? Any idea how to fix it?   **UPDATE**: I seem to have resolved my issue! I made the following changes.  1) I began using the bridge pickup exclusively as opposed to the neck/center pickup on my strat.  2) I went into audio midi settings and verified that the cable was set as 48k audio.  3) In audio midi settings I raised the volume from the default to about 40%  4) In rocksmith, I changed the audio engine settings from the default 4 to 6 (I had previously changed this, but it seems to have reverted back).  5) In rocksmith audio options I increased the realtone cable gain from the default to 4.1  As it stands, I am now nailing every note.  Thank you to everyone who helped! I compiled together a bunch of your suggestions.   I am currently working on a seemingly simple piece arranged by my teacher. However, I am still fairly new to guitar. I'm used to chords being arpeggios,  not more traditional strumming/picking with multiple fingers.  What I am finding is that I have a very hard time switching between picking single notes, moving my fret hand and playing hand into place to play the chord, and then moving everything back into place for playing single notes.  Are there any decent exercises anyone can recommend for this that I can drill on? I know it is a fairly simple thing but I seem to be having a really tough time with it.   Hey everyone. I've been drooling over some vintage Gretsches in the store (we have a vintage 1964 country gentleman at our local guitar shop). One thing I noticed - it's a hollowbody, but the f-holes are filled.  They referred to it as a "closed hollowbody."  I'm used to archtops that have the f-holes open. So, what is the major difference sound-wise? Does it have less of the noise and feedback issues that a normal hollowbody has? Is it more or less resonant?  	145

 Damn smelly ghosts just won't stop haunting me.   Very true, can't argue with that    Somebody is going to get killed for this eventually. But, Id be damned if I said I didn't laugh hysterically at this.    I'll be surprised if no one said this already. Cut off all purchases of toilet paper and wipes. Including napkins and paper towels so there is no way around this.   Exactly what I should be doing   It's a never ending cycle!   I do the same thing you're not alone.   Just out of curiosity.   I think the fact that I shit myself as an adult actually scared me rather than having the shit scared out of me.   Ticks and Scorpions. I have never encountered a scorpion, but I hate them.

       Now brasil has to deal with not only the fact that they were humiliated, but FIFA made away with millions of their tax dollars. Smh   Male Nurse here. Stay away from drama. You can't change others,  just yourself. On the floor (medsurg) I remind myself why I'm here and focus on that. After a while, people start noticing your actions and stop complaining around you because they realize they sound like a whiny teen that didn't get their way. Sometimes I like to amuse myself and play devil's advocate for a situation that didn't go their way so they can put their ego to the side for a second.    At the rate parents take pics of their kids and post on Fb. Then in their teens with selfies and such. Then when they're older the whole process repeats itself when they have kids. Not to mention they will be old and tech savvy.    	5

Sorry to sound harsh. We have just had a rash of this tactic being used lately. We try to be nice and give out warnings. We do not like to be dicks. But there are a few who are abusing that.  If there is a special reason you want it removed, contact the mods and they will do it for you. Then there is no suspicion or no problem.   Sorry to sound like a hothead. We just don't want any of your generosity to be taken advantage of.       This is a real special moderator of the day. /u/Fwogzilla has done such awesome work and has helped so may. This guy is a hero among heroes.   Please give all the love you can mustard to today's Moderator Of The Day:  ***FWOGZILLA***  http://www.freakingnews.com/pictures/20500/Superman-Kermit--20747.jpg      I'm facing all sorts of adversity right now. Whether it is health, being able to afford to live, being able to work, and just being able to live for another day. It is all happening at once. Without a family to run to and without any remote friends that can lend a hand in the way I need, I am facing extreme calamity. Possibly death.   Everything that I'm going through is because of a mystery illness that I was faced with a couple years ago. It's gone to far to the extent where I really need help, especially since a recent accident that happened a couple months ago. I can't walk. If I must, I have to wear leg braces. I can't walk because of my arthritic and ligament problems, which was caused by the illness that spread throughout my entire body to cause all of these things. It doesn't help that I was training and working out a lot during my time in the Marine Corps. It's caused me constant bleeding throughout these past couple of years. Lately, and for the first time this year I have lost feeling in both of my feet and legs. It's starting to spread upwards on my leg. I've fainted numerous of times just from being too sick. I've found myself passed out in the bathroom floor or in the hallway. I've fainted in the hands of professions in the hospital, as well. I've had to deal with tons of research done to me. Seen tons of medical professionals. None have been able to really help me or conclude what possibly happened to me. I haven't gave up despite all of my problems.   I'm ultimately needing 20K for treatments. I'm living in an apartment without any bed (I've been sleeping on the floor) and my tent has been due ($1,445 for November and December). I'm about to get an eviction notice. My apartment complex wants to kill me. It is winter time. I'm on my last $30. To say that I just need $20K for treatments wouldn't be enough. My treatments can take 1 and half to 2 months total. This is from a doctor that I know can make me better. I'm really ashamed and feel like I'm asking for too much already. But, I already exhausted all the possible resources I can and whatever anyone can give me as advice. I can immediately start working after this and finish my schooling.   * www.gofundme.com/gilvx4   I'm the review of what I ultimately ask, please consider my statements hereforth.  Does someone chose to get sick? Or is it someone else's fault to get sick? I have been blamed for both. I feel at fault and at my wits end. I feel like I have asked from the VA (Veterans Affairs), to the government, to my friends (and "friends") and to my connections to no avail. I am at your full mercy to pick me up. To give me a chance, again. Not to run and to sloth at this given opportunity, but given a chance to make a difference. A difference that I know I can do and promise. To give back.  If you need any proof, questions, or concerns, please let me know.   I woke up this morning and found that the Teddy Bear and Dinosaur had babies. Six of them:  http://i.imgur.com/ssyFMUd.jpg   I am so sorry to the folks that didn't win. I wanted to get one for you all. I really did.

Backpackwayne's mom has really gone down hill in the last couple months. I have had to face reality and accept that I will lose my mother soon.     The last couple months I've watched my mom, who is the epitome of kindness, waste away to what look to be her final days. She didn't eat anything for the last month.    But this last week I bought a new TV for her hospital room just to give her some kind of stimulus. I never dreamed it would spark her will to live like it did. She has started to eat again and can once again carry on a limited conversation.  Well I thought if something like a TV could do that much good, Just think what would happen if we flooded her with hundreds of cards from arounf the world. Even if it didn't have that effect, it would be wonderful that in her final days she knew  that the world was still thinking of her.  **Please, everyone send her a card.**  She likes cards with cute babies and kids and loves the funny stuff too. She is no prude. So feel free to send risque stuff too. Just make her smile.  If there was ever something you could do for me, this would it. I want my mom's final days to as happy as I can make them.  Please PM for the address.  Thank you everyone   And spread the word elsewhere if you can. I want to shower her with all the cards and love I can.   -------------------  Thank you everyone. Over 250 cards and it has really brightened up my mom. She is actually carrying on a conversation. She just loves it. Words can not express my appreciation. Bless you everyone.   Backpackwayne's mom has really gone down hill in the last couple months.

 Swear down. It isn't built yet and there were two Croatian men building it. We asked and they said it was ok. I can provide proof if needed but they are filming GoT in Dubrovnik right now. I also met Brienne today so check my profile.         I thought it was a solid summer blockbuster and was surprised at how much I enjoyed myself. I had read a few reviews and the concept interested me so I gave it a watch. The plot, characters and setting were able to hold my attention throughout the film and I thought the ending was probably one of the best Disney have ever done.          The room is pitch black, the only light shown is from the computer monitor. A large dark figure is at the chair, light gleaming off his glasses while he types in a large red font "Half Life 3 is not going to happen"       Yo mama so fat that Obi Wan Kenobi said "that ain't no moon... that yo mama".   Are you not scared of your flat being possessed due to it being over a Mexican burial ground?   	10
 Spicy Banana Disaster      JVC 750 is great for long term shooting like your lecture or Documentaries. Very Large Camera though.    It's not bad, but Dialogue is mixed way too low and it sounds heavily EQ'd  	4
 But look how pretty they are !   Well I do a lot of preperation before so I just have to put the things together. But of course you can't avoid a downtime completly, still worth it.      	3
 Whilst it is a good thought, I find that it's just such a waste of water.   You can also find it easier to play with a friend and have them if they video, choose somebody who you'll talk with and will help you lighten up and not feel too nervous.   If that happened in rank.. no no, but the reason Apollo can support is the protections he gains from his mez (in case you were wondering). Also, you need to try two junglers, just get somebody who can play safely on ADC and maybe have them play Neith.   Whilst it is a good idea in thought, in theory it would fail as somebody could always just leave an obvious loss just so that the team doesn't suffer as big a TP loss.   Not to be rude or anything, but I could not understand what that meant.   Well good guy Greg, have you seen... support Apollo?!   Heyo   The best/main way to join a professional team is to play league and get to somewhere such as masters and get people to notice you. Good luck on your quest to make it big.   Each god has a Gold ~ God Rank 1, Legendary ~ God Rank 5 and recently added in the Cabrakan update Diamond ~ God Rank 10 skins.   Another piece of advice is actives, while beads can be really good, on a support it would be wiser to get something that helps your team, e.g. heavenly agility, shell or creeping curse. And would be nice to get a reply for feedback but can't since it is only for ranked, but looking at your stats you didn't seem to have done bad. If you have any questions feel free to PM me.   Before the Cabrakan update in which it fixed itself, I couldn't hear any gods taunts, jokes or laughs. Can you hear any of them for other gods?   Exactly, I'm getting sick of players who just want a snowball game, who cares if you're down eg 10 kills, if you work together and try you could actually bring it back instead of surrendering.   That seems about right   I play a fair amount of conquest and these all seem normal picks to me but I can still run Neith solo, Ra mid/solo, (Can't jungle). What servers do you play on, NA or EU?   Keep in mind, this way also helps encourage the support when to ward, generally you should make sure the area is clear before putting down a sentry to clear another in case this happens^^ but as somebody who mains support, it does get annoying being unable to rotate to a fight because that ability was used for a ward.   When I get a Geb shield on at the last second saving them with the smallest amount of health and they escape (although it generally inspires people to run back in *sigh*)   P S with Garterbelt is an awesome series... if only they made season 2   Hoping for a Neith skin  	18
 I'm not proud.  I browse the web on a (Dell Optiplex 770L)[http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/op170l/en/ug/specs.htm].  You may laugh, but it was free and it runs Ubuntu just fine, thank you very much.  But every so often I click on a stupid oversized cell-phone picture like (this one)[http://imgur.com/FVQ5x] (only chosen because it's the latest culprit)  and it FREEZES MY COMPUTER FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES WTF!?!  The picture wasn't even that funny and there's NO REASON ON EARTH THAT IT NEEDED TO BE 1,936px  2,592px.  No reason at all.  The resolution is crappy and there's just not that much information there anyway.  imgur provides low-resolution links, let's start using them, people!  Thank you for your time.   Once I was waiting on the subway platform with a group of friends, and this woman was singing acapella.  She was *terrible*.  I walked over to her and told her I'd give her a dollar if she'd stop singing until we got onto the train.  She looked confused and explained that she'd been classically trained.  I said, "Well, I don't know much about music, but there's something very wrong here."  She accepted the dollar and stopped singing.  My wife was mortified, and one friend said, "You're either my hero or the biggest asshole I've ever met."  I report, you decide.   k.  I'm gonna jump in here.  Years ago I was talking with a gay friend over beers, and I asked: "What is **with** you guys?  Why are [your clubs](http://www.paradisecambridge.com/) always getting shut down over wild orgies?"  He explained, "In heterosexual relationships there's usually one party who wants to do it **all the time** and another who sort of keeps things sane.  Well, you get a bunch of guys together, and you pretty much don't have that sanity element.  Everybody wants to do it."      If so, then wouldn't Sarah Connor have already blown it up?   Just finished watching Watson run the table on the meat-puppets.  Anybody else feeling obsolete?   I'd say save yourself $100 and get the Pandigital Novel.  It's still no iPad, but it's quite [hackable](http://www.slatedroid.com/wiki/index.php/Introduction_to_the_Pandigital_Novel):    Non hic adsum ut amIcos faciam!

Just to put your $400 in perspective:  The sysadmin and I put an incorrectly configured redirect click server into the pool, so it basically silently failed to redirect clicks to our paying advertisers, and not only that, it was logging the failures as 200s, i.e., successful pages served, so none of our Nagios alerts were fired.  Nobody noticed it until the next morning, so 1/3 of our click logs were lost.  The business is ALL clicks, and if they're not served, we're not paid.  Lost revenue was about $25k.  Our overlords were *not* happy.   is that sarong?   Or more practical, "Where are my keys?"         This above all, to thine own self be true  And it must follow, as the night the day  Thou canst not then be false to any man.      I'm planning to decline a role in our local [Security Theater Production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater) at the South Station T-stop in Boston.  The cops stand by the turnstile with a little counter and ask every nth person to have their bags inspected.  If selected I will invoke my 4th Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure, as politely as possible, of course.  What should I expect?  I imagine that I won't be able to pass, but what else?   Wow.  Hadn't listened to this in about 20 years.  Thanks.   How sad is it that somebody from China has to show us how to stand up for ourselves?  I don't mind a few trailers, but the last few times I've gone to the moves, I've been subjected to numerous commercials.  It's ridiculous to buy an expensive ticket and then be subjected to advertising.   Another First World Problem.      ... best served with a side of crow?   Oh, and for you home-brewers out there: never leave your hops out where the dog can get them.  Very bad.   I'm really sorry about your dog, but ... I couldn't help thinking of one of those [Things You'll Never Hear A Redneck say](http://www.goofball.com/jokes/top10/talk_Top_36_Things_Youll_Never_Hear_A_Redneck_Say): "You can't feed that to the dog."   I guess I have it down pretty well.  It only takes me about an hour to fry up the bacon, make the weave, and fill it.  But the smoking does take a few hours.      vulgus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur -- The people want to be deceived, therefore let them be deceived.   So this guy is telling his dad about his first time paratrooper training:  "Well, I was scared and said I didn't want to jump."  "And ... ?"  "The jumpmaster said, 'well, son, I'm gay and there's only one way you're getting out of this.'"  "So, did you jump?"  "A little, at first."   Two things: 1. Eating fat doesn't make you fat, eating carbs does: http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html 2. Exercise doesn't help you lose weight.  It doesn't burn enough calories, and generally makes you hungrier.  This is not to say that exercise isn't good for you, it's just that eating less is the best way to lose weight.   So ... not one photoshop job on the group photo?  	39
 I find myself going a few weeks without masturbating at times. It's not even like I abstain, I just don't feel like it most of the time.  So yeah, it depends on the person and how they say it, and situation dependant.   I'm writing one at the moment. I have a backstory and an ending in mind. The rest is as it goes.  Though i'm doing a _lot_ of procrastination on that.   I'd say so!   My border turns 11 this year too! He's still as manic as ever. I think they Immortal, sometimes.   Apps on smartphones. I see other people's handsets and they're absolutely overloaded on silly games, gadgets and other faffery.   I have a couple of News apps and a music mood thinger, and that's it. I can't sit and stare at my phone for extended periods of time.   "Dude, it's been like 10 years. Wait 'til you see the fucking sweeet flying car I learned to fly. I can do loops and shit with it, though I have bumped a few kids on their hoverboards.  Also, dude. Space Marines are _real_"   Thanks! I love making up characters - though I never thought I'd make one for the ME universe. Yet another character to wander around in my head. :D   Well, that's what I get on average a month. I get about 60MPG when I drive well enough   As someone who fills up once per month on a payday - the whole Panic Buying thing _really_ ticked me off today. I was forced to buy the Premium stuff because I like to run my tank to fumes before filling up.  Yeah, Kinda my own fault, but the whole thing kicked off on Monday - guess who had no money until today. :(  300 miles to a tank though. Bitchin'.   I'd probably be a Quarian Engineer.  Rei'einya vas Sayania - Left the Migrant fleet to embark upon his pilgrimage, and is still on it! He has spent years wandering the Galaxy, salvaging, fixing and interacting with the other races as he goes.  In his travels, he's managed to save up enough credits to buy himself a small frigate, which he uses to travel to and fro. He is a free spirit and is even considering returning to the Migrant Fleet, to announce his plans to remain outside the fleet. He'll visit, obviously, but he enjoys exploring and meeting new people far too much.  (Oh god, did I just make a Mass Effect OC? Keelah..)   It was a sort of nick I came up with a few years back.

There are so many mind fucks on your first run, watching it all again isn't the same, you know what goes down.  Also - Mass Effect, because aside from the ending, holy shit all 3 games were amazing.   [](/twibeam)I have absolutely no idea what I just read, but it was full of **SCIENCE**   Redbubble are good.

[](/fabulous)I'm subbed to 189 subreddits, and it's kind of hard to pick my favourite.  I post the most here in AskReddit, but I lurk a _lot_ on /r/mylittlepony     My friend went in there and did the test, He knew it was all grip strength that sent the reading wacky. It was funny as hell. If the poor guy interviewing him believed it worked, he must have thought my friend was a proper nutjob   [](/hahaha) Not OP - but I airsoft a fair bit.  Most airsoft guns are battery powered, some pistols are gas powered though. If you're hiring on site, most places will offer replica coloured guns, though you can buy your own two-toned with no UKARA Licence  Airsoft shots sting like a bitch, but not as bad as paintball - I think a single hit anywhere on the body will count as a kill.  Obviously, rules can vary site to site.  As for your knockout - Go for it, it'll be funny. Take vids.   It was my first visit to the Netherlands ever in '07.

If you were the Goofy in Florida in 2004, and the stupid teenager ran away from you - My bad, you chased me a little bit. It was warm and I can only imagine how you felt in the suit.   Aw, and I got all excited then too. Welp, now I know how to fuck with people. :D   Because cake is ace.   Must have been about 6 years ago now, we were just getting into DnD and we were in the process of creating our characters.   Most of us had already read through the rulebook and were in the process of refining them, our other friend was still reading through, picking his class and traits and all that.   It was pretty late on, and the host's little sister was asleep.  Suddenly, with absolutely no warning, the guy reading the rulebook just shouted out "I CAN'T READ"  We blinked - assumed he meant he couldn't read, and was looking at the pictures in the rulebook. We were rolling around the place laughing.  He looked totally dumbfounded and then was all "Ah! No! My character! Not me!"  It was too late, the little sister had woken up, and we were in for shit when the host's parents woke up.   Hmm.. I've always thought of this. I'd go for a Augmented Reality interface, coupled up with a personal HUD embedded in my vision. With a sweet aesthetic look - much like SFX contact lenses.   I could turn the Augmented view off with a series of blinks though, I could see it getting in the way if I ever just wanted to see something pretty.  And maybe some kind of heat resistant material on my hands. I burn my hands all the damn time picking up pans and oven trays and shit.    Yeah.. I was gonna say. I took Tali and Garrus and saw them on the cinematic.  Eh. I'm still confused.   Wait, the guys you take died on the beam?  I was so immersed, I didn't even notice, I was just all "GOTTA GET TO THE BEAM"...  I feel bad now.   I think they're still on the Tom + Jerry chef stuff in the UK  (Van driver - I pass them all the time)   Custard Creams. Man, I'll kill for those things.   I didn't _hate_ the ending.. I just hated the lack of sense it made, and the complete lack of a follow up to either choice you made.  [No matter what, Shep dies (Unless you get that secret ending), but no matter the choice you have (Synth, destruction or control), the Relays get destroyed, and all we're left with is a Normandy Crash Landing on an unknown planet with your crew who were with you not 15 minutes ago, running behind you before you got fried](/spoiler)  _There's no follow up, that's what makes me mad._ What Shep did at the end was totally in character, he'd do that if it meant it would end the threat.   Hah, hey there fellow Brony! :D [](/hahaha)  I'll just echo [Honilee's](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/qsdun/i_was_routed_here_by_some_bronies/c403dzi) comment, discovering the sub and the community just gave me that sense of "Dude..

I dropped history in my 4th year, took on Geography instead  In the 3 years I did take history though, I learned absolutely naff all, really.

All of a sudden, I'm in some kind of Canyon, steam rising from the river at the bottom.  I must be flying, because I look down and I'm right over the chasm, I've no body. The sun was supposed to be setting, though if it was midday, it probably would have taken up half the sky at least.  Then suddenly, an explosion over the horizon. I look back up, A wall of white rips the canyon below me apart. There is nothing left.  I wake up. Somehow the curtains were open and the sun was right in my face.    I think I witnessed the end of the world.   Lets see...  [Alex S - Party with Pinkie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sryqaS07WaU)  [Devildriver - Grinfucked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWKppF-ZcBI)  [Florence   The Machine - Cosmic Love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EIeUlvHAiM ob=av3e)  (Edited for song links)   Way too many. My head is a whirly-swirly bastard machine full of ideas. I might try pitching an idea at some point, they're super fun to watch in my head.   It's my cake day too!  It's not going too bad, actually. Quite boring.   It was 2002 (or somewhere around that time)  Furbies were just starting to gain popularity and we were on holiday in Turkey. We saw them. My 12 year old self and my 8 year old sister _had_ to have one.  I settled for a green one, and my sister went for a black and white one.  We played quite happily with them for a day or two. Poking its belly, sticking our fingers in their mouth, all that jazz.  There was that one night, it was stormy as all hell outside, our parents were at the hotel bar downstairs, me and my sister were in the room, trying to sleep on the sofas, Furbies on the tables opposite us.  The lightning cracked outside, giving the room that lighting you see in horror movies (you know, with the cracked shutters?)  They were there. Staring at us, eyes wider than fucking dinner plates.  These things close their eyes when they "sleep". But there they were, staring at us. My sister was on the other sofa, and hers was doing the same. I heard her start to wail.  "Feed me!"  I don't think I ever punched a toy so hard in my life.   Since then, not heard a peep off the thing, it's hiding in the attic. Somewhere. Not sure where. I'm always careful when I go up there, though. Demonic little bastards.   I'm currently on the "How can I do it?" step.  Mainly because I've no fucking clue what's going on and and stepping way out of my comfort zone on this.   Thanks, you too, my good man!   Crash Bash was legendary. Wasted many a weekend with my sister playing it.   So, today (Yesterday? Meh. it's 1am) was my birthday, and I got to thinking. What the fuck am I doing? I mean, yes, I'm planning this whole internet/gaming caf thing out, but there's this part of me that knows I'm pretty much secure in this job that I have right now. It's boring as fuck though, and I've been doing it for two years now.  (and that's only because I got shifted department. I did 3 1/2 years in the most soul sucking department ever known to have existed, and I'd still be there now if it wasn't for the fact that I slacked off a bit.)  I digress  I'm a big fat pansy when it comes to security. I've been working almost every day since I was 13. It started with my little paper round I picked up, and since then, my jobs have overlapped each other, only leaving the prior once the workload eventually sent me mad. So that puts me at nearly 10 years working. I went to college for a year (Americans, College here is 16-18. University is 18+) I dropped out after a year, because I couldn't fucking stand it.  Unless I grow a fucking backbone and learn that being a fucking warehouse lackey is an "Inbetween jobs" job and that I should kick my own ass into finding funding and property for my ideas, I'm going to be stuck there for years and years and years. Even the prospect of that pisses me off.  On another point - I live in England. Our nightlife, like many others revolves around getting drunk, flirting, pulling and eventually having sex. Mostly. Girls won't even look at me twice if they're not drunk.  Here's my problem. I'm not much of a drinker. I'll go out, maybe have a few bevvies, hang out with the lads, then the girls are completely wasted and start flirting with everyone. Every fucker in that bar is out for a one night stand - I'm Asexual - no fucking interest in sex whatso-fucking-ever. Going out on a weekend is a waste of my money, and a waste of my time.  Every few weeks, I lie in bed, thinking. "What the fuck, man. Everyone you know is getting girls, getting engaged and being happy. What have you got? Fucking no-one." I get sad as hell, and start thinking I'm destined to live alone, that creepy dude living in that flat upstairs all on his own, never leaving except to work. But what the fuck am I to do? I sure as hell don't give a fuck about sex (Aha, pun!), so any relationship I wish to pursue will end up falling apart after a few weeks, because "He's that guy who never puts out, even for his girlfriend"  There. Vent over. If you read it... thanks, I guess?   I'm a big scaredy cat when it comes to healing. When I'm on a roll, I'm quite happy. One little fail will send me on a downward spiral of "Oh god I'm terrible why did I even try" as some might have seen a few weeks ago.  I'm a little busy this weekend, but after work (dependant on how I'm feeling, too!) I might give healing another try and see how it goes   The fact that _everyone_ is different. No two people are alike - personality wise. There are so many different people to mee, though it makes me a little sad that I'll never get to meet them all. :(  That, and the small acts of kindness I occasionally see. I always feel better after seeing one, then I usually go and do 3 or 4 myself.   Visited back in '07. Didn't want to leave. Everyone I met was super-chill and happy to chat for a little bit. My choices would either be Belgium, Sweden or Canada. :D   I've lost me authenticator!  I've ordered a new one, but I'm not going to detach my old one until my new one comes in. I'm a little wary of hackers, and I've spent waaaay too much time earning all the gold I have across the realms I play(ed) on. Not risking losing it, even if I can get it back off a GM. xP  ~~Hopefully, It'll be here soon.~~ Sorry for not posting earlier. :(  (Disregard that, It got here this morning! See you in game tonight. :D)  ~Zeifey   Love the Flair! Surprised you put Bolton in there. :P Layout's pretty cool too. Thanks for the work! :D   With the rise of Smartphones and laptops, would an internet Caf be widely used?   I'm the same. My nails become nothing if I'm in shotgun, the backseat - I'm not as bad.   I usually drive when with friends, just for the sake of my sanity!   After my abysmal attempt at healing in yesterday's HC dungeon, I think I'll roll with what I know best until I get back into the game (I've been off for a few months)  Gonna roll on with my Hunter (Zeifey) for a while. Might hit 85 end of this week, or mid next week if all goes to plan!    Fucking hate this thing. Guaranteed I'll see it every week before I go to bed. (Someone will post it at 1am. They just know, the bastards)   Smoked up for the first time last night and got a serious case of the coughs.  I have learned now, and will buy this next time.   I wub you too, Karma! [](/raritydaww)   I use an Emulator with my copy of the game. I've got a new-ish GPU and it still struggles on very busy environments. Make sure your PC is powerful enough!   Shameless copy paste from a reply before:  I toked up tonight with the lads. I didn't reach a [10]. I probably reached somewhere along the lines of a [2] or a [3] I just found things funny for no reason and felt really sleepy.  Then we ordered takeaway and played some halo.   Thanks for the advice. I actually toked up tonight with the lads. I didn't reach a [10]. I probably reached somewhere along the lines of a [2] or a [3] I just found things funny for no reason and felt really sleepy.  Then we ordered takeaway and played some halo.   Pefect, thank you! Just what I was looking for. We'll be smoking up at their place, and they're my best mates - so I've no worries there. :)   Nice one! Wish I was there to cheer you guys on. Next time, you'll have the one lone hunter on, cheering you on from /g :P   I've only ever seen Star Wars: Episode 1, the Phantom Menace.  I plan to remedy this, soon.   I've not really smoked many cigs, either. I have done a few though, so a joint would probably be best for me. (I have also used a hookah, but with Shish flavouring)   I've never smoked before, and for the past few months, I've been considering giving it a try. I know a few smokers IRL, so I'll probably be lighting up with those guys, but they can't really remember their first blaze - it was a while ago  So I've come to you guys for a bit of help.  What should I expect from my first time, so I don't freak out? I think the guys usually just do joints, but they do own bongs. Which is more intense, which would you recommend?  If there's a comprehensive thread on this, feel free to whack me on the head and tell me to go over there.   Me too, brony. I actually welled up a little bit. And that's only reserved for when I get hurt lots or other various bad things.   I just got back from The Darkest Hour, but I still welled up like it was my kid who just said "Daddy" for the first time.   I'm not even a dad!  [](/raritydaww"I might just have to take up Babysitting..")   [](/allmybits"SHUT UP AND TAKE MY BITS")   Dude. I just got finishing watching The Office (US) for the first time.  He's not that crazy, I assure you. Maybe a little bit crazy.   Yeah, but they're cool guys. Pretty relaxed place. I mean, who lets us flings a screaming stuffed monkey around the offices and joins in after 3 or 4 throws? :D   I remember when I was offered a job, my name must have been passed around the office as "New guy [train_subject8542] is starting Monday." I had so many friend requests even before I started. xD   Turns out that total random guy "poking" me 2 weeks before I started was my boss.   3.50 for my usual poison in the local. Pint of cider.

It's quite a ways out for me to come down often (I'm in Bolton)  I miss it, but, hey. I usually hung out on the upstairs bouldering walls, and the downstairs ones. I wasn't much of a climber. I belayed a lot, though!   True. It's still bloody cold though. :   My windscreen was iced this morning, are you in an alternate dimension?!  	109

 Interesting question, and I am sorry your tutor vastly over-simplified the answer. It is true that inter-cellular space is nearly nonexistent, as the role of an epithelium is as a barrier. But, it is not true that they only excrete substances. Epithelial cells can express a myriad of transporters, ion channels, and pores that allow all sorts of different things into, out of, and through the epithelial cells. It varies based on the epithelial type in question.  I am wondering one thing, though: to me, the epithelium I think of last is the skin (I research the urinary bladder for a living). The questions you bring up here seem to be related to "transport" across the epidermis' stratum corneum (outer layer of skin) and not an epithelium in the more general sense.   The stratum corner is a pretty tight barrier against a lot of stuff, but it is still made up of cells with hydrophobic membranes...so many hydrophobic compounds and lipophilic small molecules are more than happy to alter the cell membrane stiffness and pliability and/or pass right through. Thus, most of the moisturizers you use aren't really imparting water, per se...but imparting elasticity and flexibility.   As far as the patches and lead and mercury and stuff? Some patches increase permeability chemically, some have special formulations of the drugs that allow them to pass through the cells, and some just rely on simple diffusion of tiny molecules that are intrinsically capable of passing through the skin. The heavy metals you speak of, as inorganic ions, aren't particularly well-absorbed (IMO)...however, organic molecules containing lead and mercury are EXTREMELY well-absorbed through the stratum corneum and EXTREMELY toxic. Again, this is because of the lipophilicity of the organic compound and thus it's ability to basically pass right through the cell membranes.   Well, in the simple sense, if your ic50 values are within the confidence intervals of the ic50 values reported  elsewhere, then it seems you could attest that your values are not significantly different from the original values. I can't think of a statistically legitimate way to make the comparison between 2 separate groups without at least knowing the variance within one of the groups. Then you can see if your value fits within that variance.    Comparisons without replicates is not really the best idea, IMO.  But when I do this (for EC50, but essentially the same thing), I always use -log(EC50). You can't really average EC50 or IC50 as they are, since on a logarithmic scale...let alone calculate reliable SEM. It's explained well [here] (http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/6/curve-fitting/index.htm?reg_why_prism_fits_the_logec50_rat.htm).   Something else...the "effects" of which you speak are either due to TRPV1-expressing sensory nerves near your rectum, or due to inflammation in response to large, local release of neurotransmitters due to nerve activation. Interestingly, from a pharmacological perspective, menthol and capsaicin are really doing the exact same thing: opening an ion channel that is depolarizing a sensory nerve. The fact that we perceive it as cold vs. hot is merely coincidental...so, sadly, no balance. Might actually feel WORSE, given the circumstances. :)  	4

The opening of the Wikipedia article on [the Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) addresses this issue with this sentence.    Some historians use a definition of the Holocaust that includes the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to approximately eleven million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories.       Einstein wrote some essays about the Nazis rise to power.   I guess in the late 1920s there were groups that would give series of talks about how Einstein was an evil Jewish scientist who was working to destroy German Science.   Einstein got interested a bit and went to a few of these talks and sat in the back and listen to their crazy rants.   From what I recall, he said they never recognized him.              	150
 This would be super fantastic :) Yes please!    Idk... Nokia is playing the comeback game, they have more incentive to be innovative. Apple hasn't done anything new that's useful in years and the GS3/4/5 are essentially the same. Slightly bigger screens and faster GPU/CPU/SoC, but nothing really innovative.  Nokia is experimenting with crazy cameras and other emerging technologies. You can buy "charging covers" for a few other Nokia models as well to give them wireless charging functionality.   One cool thing Samsung did on the ATIV SE is put an IR blaster in it so you can use it as a universal remote. I would love to see that in more products!   EDIT: To answer your "big fat coil" question, other than my knowledge of induction, I have no idea how they implement it in the phone. The Nokia Icon/930 is 9.8mm as its thickest, so it's by no means huge.    There are some cords (I own a Logitech one) where the two side are asymmetrical. The top half has a big bump thats really easy to grab. I use it in my car so I can plug my phone in while driving without having to look... not the best idea, I know. I'm trying to find a link...  But seriously... Using locks must infuriate you. Up, down, left, right... WHICH WAY IS IT?!   the Nokia 930/ Nokia Icon has wireless charging built in. You can either set it on a stand or plate (those do need to be plugged in) and it charges almost as efficiently as if it were plugged in.  I routed out the bottom of my night stand, left about 1/16" of material, and glued the plate in. Now, I just set my phone in the corner of the night stand and it charges!  http://www.nokia.com/us-en/accessories/accessory/dt-900/   Thank you. I laughed way harder than I should have.   The article clearly states that the school administration made him delete it. Also, almost half the posts before you reference this.   This has already happened to some extent with [John Joe Gray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joe_Gray) in Texas.  During a traffic stop in 1999, he attacked a state trooper and was found to have terrorist literature in his vehicle.   According to all the news articles, he's basically been holed up on his 50-acre property ever since, and law enforcement don't want to risk entering his property to arrest him citing fears of violent retaliation from not only him and his family, but nearby anti-government extremist e.g Timothy McVeigh and the Waco Seige  The only obvious difference is that Gray kind of imprisoned himself on his land whereas Bundy is still "free"   You need an Office 365 subscription which is $99/year. However, that gives you 5 PC/Mac and 5 mobile device licenses...  SO, with one subscription, you can get FULL office professional (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, OneNote, and more) which is normally $400/license on 5 computers, plus 5 phones/tablets (iOS, android, Windows Phone) running mobile Office. Additionally, you also get an extra 20GB of Onedrive storage   Serious question, have you ever used a Surface or Windows 8 phone?   I still dont understand what the older Start Menu gave you in terms of functionality that windows 8.1 doesn't. Additionally, its seems even EASIER to get to certain things.

Go to programs and features in control panel, sort by date installed, and remove anything suspicious. Many times its listed as Conduit.  2. Open your browsers, and go to you addons/extensions and remove them. Next, change your default search provider to Google or Bing and remove the bad ones. Lastly, change your homepage to something reputable.  3. Download and run Malwarebytes (quick scan) and ADW Cleaner.   4. Install Adblock Plus on all browsers.  This is very abbreviated and can depend on what OS, browsers, and severity of infection. Feel free to PM me, I would be happy to give more detailed advice!   -Run ADW Cleaner and Malwarebytes (quick scan) monthly or as needed  -Remove startup items. Run MSCONFIG and uncheck any items that aren't vital to the computers operation. Generally leave any hardware, OS, or antivirus items and remove everything else. Googling specific items can help determine what should be kept.  -Periodically check your installed programs, and remove unnecessary items. Again, googling things can help identify good, bad, and necessary. I like to sort mine by date installed as it makes it easy to identify what was done recently.  -Update windows, Java, and Adobe flash and reader from reliable sources.   Windows Phone 8 has Google Maps... http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/google-maps/a2282991-ff5c-4038-994f-b03be450120d   No problem! Hope they love it!   To help mine, I put it in the corner of the cage and then fed them treats through the bars behind it. This forced them to climb on it and if you position the treats just right, they will start running! I did this for a few days and a week later they were using it on their own accord    There are many ultrabooks with 3200x1800 resolution out currently, some with discrete graphics. This is nothing special.   Pros: Properly owning and caring for a pet can be very rewarding   Chins can live a very long time (15-20 years)   Cons: Chins can live very long. They probably can't take the chin to college, so who will look after it?  They have stringent needs. Specific food, temperatures, housing needs, etc. Kids can't give them tons of treats.  Although adorable, their cuddly level varies from chin to chin and even the cuddly ones work on their own schedule. Don't expect this to be a pet you can just cuddle with whenever.  If they get out, they are difficult to catch... think squirrel.    Yep. http://vimeo.com/67769684   Mr old roommate use to weld occasionally. If you look at your weld WHILE your welding (without a mask/proper eye protection) it can cause serious eye damage. Think staring at the Sun.   He would get around this by setting up the weld, close eyes, weld, and repeat. Worked pretty well!   Oh! Did you purchase a windows 8 key?? If you have the key, you just re-install windows and use the key again. There no limit to how many installs you have with the key, just one device can be activated with it at one time.   If the drives are within manufacturers warranty (normally a year), they will probably replace them for you. Technically, overvolting isnt covered, but its very hard to determine... might as well try!     I'll assume this is an OEM computer that you're dropping a new motherboard into.   - Make a set of backup disks from the manufacturer utility or type "Create a recovery drive" on the start screen to make a system image. (Having an escape plan is important!)  - Get a bootable Windows 8 .ISO on a disk or USB http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only  - Download Belarc Advisor. http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html This is an awesome utility that will tell you everything about your computer, including all your software license key about halfway down the page.  - Install the new motherboard and attempt to load windows 8! Worst case scenario, revert back to the original motherboard and reinstall using your recovery disks.   If you're looking for a faster route (not really better than sandpaper though), You can get a cheap (~$10) rotary tool at Harbor freight. Put a buffing/polishing wheel on it and your good to go.   That is quite an impressive jig... just... WOW.   hit up craigslist or harbor freight and all those tools including the vise will be less than $200...   Thank you for that. :)   The steel he purchased was already "folded", so it was, just not by him.      xpost from /r/ ASMR...     	32
 Swimmin in that minimum wage cash.   Amazon. B N really hates Amazon. Every time something bad happens with Amazon (like their recent disputes with book publishers), theres an article pretty much celebrating it on our Insider website.   Also, there's Book People but it's not a huge competitor since there isn't one very close to our B N location.   Damn, I wish I knew. I've never heard of anything like that so I'm guessing not. I would love it if they did, though. I said in a previous answer that books that are required school readings are always the most popular. I'll also add that those horrifying Fifty Shades of Grey books are still really popular and its usually tired moms who come in and buy the whole trilogy.   We have a shelf of unreleased books that we can take home. I've read a few of them, honestly they haven't been my favorites. A few days ago someone left their payed copy of Flowers for Algernon at the check out counter and I read it during my shift and it was depressing at shit.   So far, my best day at work was my first time working at the Customer Services desk because there was no one there who needed help so I pretty much spent the day hanging out with my friend at the children's section. My managers are super chill so they don't care if we just stand around and talk as long as there are no customers looking for help. So yeah, it would either be that day or this other time when it was storming and we were doing inventory so for the last two hours of my shift there were literally no customers so we went around the store taking pictures with the hand puppets.  	4
 I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Thanks OP.   Nah man, he's summoning the planeteers because he needs to speak with Captain Planet about global warming.   Horses like bowling too.   Even without the beard I have a hard time believing this is a woman.   Einstein didn't smoke a pipe. He was known to pick used cigarette butts off the ground whenever he felt the urge for nicotine. He also enjoyed sailing when there wasn't any wind, because he liked the challenge.   It amazes me how people like this say their adults and they have the right to say and act how they want, all while living in mommy and daddy's house enjoying the amenities they bought for them. Its like they've got the mind of a five-year old.   Is that a slightly younger Angus T. Jones?  http://imgur.com/D4qpBOA   You can beat Dishonored without killing anyone. Hard as hell but it can be done.   Wut...   Give him a kiss and pets for me. He's adorable.   I was on 300mg Luvox for about a year. Didn't notice any help with my thoughts or compulsions.

Yeah I am, but at least I'm not a milkshake.   http://imgur.com/NyKq9YX   Wait.   Social media.   This is fucking hilarious.   I've been on benzos before and my advice is STAY AWAY. I was on 1mg Klonopin a day, and I ended up with severe side effects. Numbness, difficulty breathing, photophobia, insomnia, hot/cold flashes, I legitimately thought I was going to die. You can experience these side effects even if you do everything your dr. tells you, and they can last for years. I've been off them for about 4 months, and I'm still having problems with numbness in my arms and legs. Unless you think you REALLY need them, stay faaaaar away.   *What other people think of you is none of your business.* My therapist told me that and I've found it to be very helpful.   Robin never got the credit he deserved.   Try b12 vitamins, they'll help put some pep in your step. 5-Hour Energy's work too, just be careful with them. I didn't listen to the instructions on them one stressful day at work and I downed 2 extra strength and 1 regular in a very short period. I had heart palpitations and couldn't bend over without my heart skipping a beat. Which is a serious problem when you cook for a living.   B12 vitamin can be helpful.   The only serious side-effect I had when I was on SSRI's was anorgasmia. Was hellish given my age and just in general, I really hope its not something you have to deal with.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorgasmia   :)  Also: I love your name.

 My friends and I wore the hell out of that pause button for the "upskirt" scene. It's amazing what the teenage brain thinks it sees.   He's officially out now with a concussion.   That's what I assumed, but I wanted some reassurance. Good thing I made him throw Bush into the deal as well.   Who won this trade?  Alshon/Reggie Bush for Percy Harvin  Thanks!   Depends on Charles' injury. If he plays, take a risk on Khiry. If Charles isn't playing then you have to go with Knile.   I doubt Charles will play, but just keep monitoring the situation. If he plays, I would go with Smith.   1pt PPR Emmanuel Sanders or Reggie Bush?  The Sanders matchup worries me...  	7
 That's reddit for you, good question, gets no answers, so there won't be anymore recommendations for us.    No that's a good idea    Yes I liked it    Love lord of the rings   Give me some that I would like :)    Annabelle   Just wondering.    A salaried position.    Just wondering.    Do you steer clear of it or embrace it?   "Things just went wrong too many times."    "My power cord was wrapped around my body when I got up."    Come to the realization now that it's over and find things to do that distract you until enough time has gone by that you're better able to move on.

 And Blizzard WCS if that is gonna be held again.   JoRoShaRk   Wasn't this posted on here like a few months ago? I've already seen this somewhere for sure..   I was plat in WoL, got placed in silver, quite disappointed. Just got gold today, but i dont really feel confident in my use of the new units. Lots of work to do!   Ik ben sowieso aanwezig! Zin in!   I dont know if this was already posted on here, but Totalbiscuit made quite an interesting [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwAo8lcAC4) about this topic.   the two best analitical casters out there, woohoo!

 Probably first and only time I post here, but wow.    Cool, Thank you! :)   Do you actually have to join each covenant to get the achievement? So far each covenant I go to does not give me the achievement, but I have not actually been joining them.    Can anyone confirm this? I have been blowing friends off on Live for the last week!   I thought I was the only one.    Works both ways pal.    I have been advocating this as well for a very long time. Maybe then some people would realize how batshit crazy some of the people they vote for really are.

Nathan Fillion is the only man that can make me question my heterosexuality.    Exactly. Sorry if that was misleading.   Fuck. I just realized that I fucked that up too...   Had roughly 4,000+ souls and 6 Humanity sitting at the Gargoyle boss. I needed to get more humanity so I could reverse hollowing and summon someone to help. Ended up getting poisoned trying to farm the rats for humanity. Ran out of Estus Potion and died about 5 feet away from bonfire.    Jumped off a ledge...like a boss   because you should be reading it in Sean Bean's voice.   Curious to see reddit's take on this. Bill seems to forget that a large part of these amenities are provided to the poor through social programs we have in place. Without those programs, I think the numbers wouldn't be as close.    I imagine it's pronounced, "Joe-lynn". If so, it's not that big of a deal.   EDIT: Spelling   Obviously there has been improvements, but overall it is more Battlefield. Mostly all new additions are welcome, even though some need more work. Graphically(XBOX 360), this game looks to be comparable to Modern Warfare 3.   It's a good game, but too early to tell if it will be great(or surpass MW3 for that matter).    goatse      tubgirl   I am betting it has something to do with adjustments made to a part of ME2 that was less than popular. Mining?    I am just curious if you think games like Mass Effect and Deus Ex are also wrong for coming out with content for the game after release.   EDIT: I'm a dumbass and can't put shit in the right place   Yeah, but we seem to constantly rip MW3 for this while letting every other game off easy. What about Battlefield 3 or Gears of War 3?    I didn't know Call of Duty was the only game to release map packs. Interesting.    Tyrion says hello   I liked the Doom movie too. Kind of tired of people saying that movies sucked just because they didn't like it.    Was I the only person that liked the Prince of Persia movie?   I think if you were moving FTL, than most of these rules would no longer apply, since our understanding of the universe is based off of a theory that states this is not possible.    I am pretty sure that Brian Greene explains this in *The Elegant Universe*. It's been a while since I read it though. He explains how one can essentially "travel through time" given our current understanding of the universe.    [Somewhat Relevant.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btuxO-C2IzE)   As soon as I saw the article, I came into comments expecting black joke to be top comment. I was not disappointed.

TIL   Not sure if it has been mentioned yet, but when you are trying to exit a parking lot in your car and nobody will let you out. When you are next to a stop light and some asshole pulls right up into the exit of parking lot, even though the light is red, I just want to ram right into their fucking car.    with the strength to carry on...   I must have got 4-5 straight calls back for 2nd interviews before finally getting a job (an underpaying one at that). To me, getting so close and feeling good about your chances only to get the "Thanks, but no thanks" email was a much bigger kick in the gut.    I am saving this thread for the next time I hop on Amazon   That's the point. Ron Paul even says, " I just don't think we're at the point where anybody has absolute proof on either side".   Ron Paul definitely believes in a creator, and in that sense he does believe in creationism. However, what he (and, originally, you) is arguing is the theory of evolution which specifies how we as human beings came to be and not necessarily who created us.    Actually that statement says that he does not believe either side of the argument entirely. By your logic, that would put him squarely in the anti-creationist camp as well.   EDIT: Spelling  	45
 It is so humbling to have the parents of these kids think so much of our handmade gifts to bury their children with them.   Thank you for sharing your story! It is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time   I did stop! Somwonw else must be doing it :P  Best wishes for your nephew and I hope he gets well soon. Amigarumi toys make the best gifts! And they are easier than yiu would think. I only learnt to crochet about 2 years ago   I love crochet squids! I think one of those is going to be my next little project   Thanks. Keeping my fingers crossed fpr your niece   I am so sorry about your sister. But it is wonderful for you to spend your time making gifts that come from the heart for people in those situations   Thank you. I hopw your little one is doing OK now   What a heartbreaking story! Thanks for sharing. I hope that teddy brings you nothing but good memories and I am sure your sister would appreciate the blanket more knowing its origins   Sorry, I'll stop chopping them...   I'm sorry for the feels, but thank you :)   If only he had the chance to be loved to pieces :(  But I am sorry for the emotion avalanche. I just wanted to put this story out there and share it with people who truly understand   Thank you :)    Thanks :)   Man, I cried just writing this. It has been a hard couple of weeks. But things like this that I can think about make it a little easier. He was so adorable, and I am not biased at all! http://i.imgur.com/SfIHGvT.jpg   What's the rent like?   Earlier in the year I made an elephant for my newborn nephew. He was hands down the best amigarumi I had ever done: http://imgur.com/a/Sz1zZ.  My Sister in Law and her husband loved him and they were sure that as he grew up, my nephew would love him too.  However, my nephew was not a healthy baby. He was born with a very rare congenital bowel defect and was whisked off to intensive care the moment he was born. A few days after he came into the world, my husband and I met our newest family member and I was so excited to give him his little elephant. His mother gave him pride-of-place in my nephew's crib, nestled amongst the tubes and monitor wires near his tiny head.  It was such a bittersweet sight, seeing my tiny nephew railing himself against the defect he was born with whilst cuddling with a toy that I made so lovingly for him.  Unfortunately, like many stories, this one turned more bitter than sweet in the end.  After a heroic 6 week long struggle for life, my nephew passed away. His parents were with him...and so was his elephant.   The funeral was heartbreaking. My nephew's coffin was so tiny, and looked even smaller in my brother-in-laws arms as he carried it into the chapel. I almost couldn't bear it...until my sister in law told me not to worry, because his elephant was in there with him.   He loved his elephant, she told me, and he will be taking it with him into the next world. She asked if I was ok with that, and through my tears I was able to tell her that nothing would cheer me up more than knowing he wasn't alone in there. I made that elephant for him, no matter what.  My nephew was cremated the next day with his little elephant by his side. Although we are all now left with a gaping hole in our lives, I have at least found comfort in knowing that our special little fighter had something soft and loving with him til the end.   Sorry for the feel trip guys, but I just wanted to share this story with people I knew would appreciate it and understand.   Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. The pain of losing him hasn't lessened over time, but I am getting better at handling it. Bonus pic of my nephew telling us all to live with peace in our hearts: http://imgur.com/fsDnE65   *their?      And his wife?   Given the choice, I would rather not watch football, talk about fishing or play Xbox. But my husband enjoys those things, so I got involved with them too  I picked a football team to follow, I got a fishing rod of my own and I learnt how to play COD. I do those things so I could spend time with him while doing them. I understand that this isn't realistic for all couples, but I just feel like if a partner has to lie or decieve the other one in order to find the time to do something they enjoy then there is a problem.  If I found out my husband was doing something like this (I am making the assumption that the wife knows nothing here) I would be disappointed in myself for being the type of wife that needs to be lied to.   Thank goodness. I thought I was doing it wrong there for a sec. I was thinking I would have to start forbidding gaming, withholding blowjobs and complaining about sports   Am I a strange wife for letting my husband play computer games if he wants? Unless we have plans to do things together, I don't care if he sits there and plays them. I am usually off playing one myself, or sitting there crocheting and watching him play   Damn! Imagine if this was an Olympic event!   Poo.   I just moved to Melbourne recently and I get the vibe that Flinder's St Station is seen as a major icon of the city, but to me it just isn't at the standard I expected. If it looked like that proposed design, it would be a splendid icon. It would be awesome and people would probably see it in the same light at the Opera House and flock to see it.  That being said, I would really rather not have to have a system where every now and then it takes me 3 hours to get home.    Man, look at that shitty photoshop. The river has never been that blue! At least make it realistic!   Instead, lift your knees a little by going up onto the balls of your feet while you sit. Not the same as squatting, but you'll have less broken rims   Digust is my spirit anim-....feeling?...little emotion person   Holy shit, that is so satisfying to look at   Am I the only one who doesn't piss my pants at the sight of spiders?   This thing is adorable! Look at him dance! He he he    FreddyFeel*Bad*!   That is the type of yawn/stretch combo that leaves you thinking "hell yeah...that was a good one."   Warning though: Give your machine a rinse with vinegar before washing clothes with it. It gets soap scum off your barrel really well...and right onto your clothes   I have heard vinegar works well   How about this picture of a goat in a Christmas hat?  http://i.imgur.com/1PqRYqc.jpg   Just greener      Hey I totally agree...it sucks. But mine was actually a health issue. I was constantly getting painful, somwtimes infected ingrown hairs. I tried EVERY trick in the book: shaving, waxing, trimming, oils, creams, oitments with no relief.  It was also a source of constant embarrassment for me, so me paying that much money was 100% worth it. It has given me so much confidence. I can actually wear a bikini now!!!  I would also like to point out that laser is permanent. i will never have to wax agaim. That is $40 month for the rest of my life saved right there   I saw results after 1 session. I am now 3 sessions in and i have gone from shaving once a day and still having stubble to shaving once a week IF I remember. The hair is now light and wispy.   I was one of those people who was a perfect candidate: dark hair, light skin, quick growing hair, so my results were bound to be good.   I also got my bikini done which was the same story of coarse, dark hair and sensitive skin. I hadn't worn a bikini without boardshorts EVER but now, I am so happy to strut it.  All up I paid $740 for a years worth of treatment for both under arm and bikini, and with it only halfway done I am already feeling like it was worth every penny   I know this is probably not the kind of answer you are looking for, but I had terrible problems with shaving under my arms. My skin got so irritated, it got really pigmented and scarred.  So I got lazer hair removal and it is hands down the best decision I ever made. I am 6 months in, my skin is smooth, healing and I am no longer ashamed of lifting my arms in public.  100% recommend it!   Plus, the price may seem steep at first but there are groupons available, payment plans, ete   I'm in Croydon South...it is pretty nice here :/    Meh. I'm a bookreader   I would still like to stretch them out over time. Why blow your load in one night when you can make the joy stretch out over weeks and weeks?   I decided to watch the first ep, but wait for the next 3. Otherwise I am just dooming myself to a month long wait for ep 5   Thith ith tho thoothing   Fun fact!   I worked in a lab that helped Frazer out with his work. He (or his team) were sloppy at labelling samples and it was my job to go through our liquid nitrogen storage tank and toss out the 20+ year old samples of his that were inappropriately labelled.  Somehow I felt like I was destroying a part of history...but he was never coming back for them, so it had to be done.   I once had a whole carload of them come to our rural, quiet property....on Easter Sunday!....to try to preach to us. I had to run out and shoo them away before my dad could get to them because if he dealt with them it would not have been pretty.   My dad answered the door naked once.  He was never bothered again.      So let it faaaaaalllll      It was sold in a gaming store called EB Games here in Australia.    SO last year   It is the back of a notepad. No bacon :(   Here in Australia we have The Blue Mountains, The Snowy Mountains and the Great Dividing Range.  Imagination isn't too popular here either.  Oh, and let's not forget Mt Disappoinment!   Everytime I read it while taking a sip it makes me a little sad that I am at work and not at home playing video game      I work in a Histocompatibility lab! It reay is super fascinating and you would not believe the amount of people and effort that goes into each transplant   My husband and I split our chores 50/50. I appreciate him, he appreciates me. simple, really.  I also can't help but think that the "she leaves her family for you, moves in with you" is utter crap. Unless you live with his parents, he did the same thing!   Nope.   Lucy.  I was convinced the movie was about some poor girl taken in by a mad scientist and turned into a crazy assassin for a sick experiment.  Instead I got to see warthogs doin it.   Period pain. Light exercise always helps me   My 6 week old newphew passed away 2 weeks ago.  Definitely that.   Still not Facebook   \#repost   Gone Girl   He was probably asleep during them...   Titanic 2   I just don't get what this post is trying to achieve. Firstly, this isn't the 50's, women don't "give up everything" for their man, and secondly, who is saying that men aren't appreciative? It just seems like stirring up crap with no actual reason for it.  http://i.imgur.com/jMBbIt2.jpg  Sorry for screenshot!   I could almost guarantee no one would give a crap if this was in Australia   Same here!!! I had no clue til I found this sub.  And just look at me now, Ma! Moving up in the world!!   I haven't blocked any blankets I have made, but I do give them a wash before gifting them and that seems to be enough   Actually this pattern was only worked in rows, so I am not sure!   This took a lot less effort than you think. I wet the doily then laid out a towel on my carpet and pinned it down. Waited a day then voila!    Also made it heaps bigger! :D   Thanks :)   If it is still in packaging, I would think a hospital would take it? I dunno.  I want to say an orphanage...but I actually don't even know if they exist anymore   The cat got a new dog bed  FTFY      It is corner to corner box stitch.  The yarns are just a collection of soft acrylic DKs I had stashed in my cupboard...all the cards are thrown out now sorry :/  Also, thanks :)      No, Vic   Opening round of the AFL, Lunar eclipse and half the country is out bush, Easter camping...you have no hope!   My friend posted this pic she took while bushwalking today. [Relevent?]( http://imgur.com/W20gfzz)   I am using a combo of DK yarns from my local craft store. I just grabbed whatever felt soft and was in the right colours. The stitch is a Corner to Corner Box stitch. I posted a pic of what it actually looks like from afar.  I am not using any specific pattern tho   Ha ha! Completely reasonable...and useful!   Fun Fact: We have a footballer here in Aus called Karmichael Hunt. I am sure he cops it a lot   Hey! That looks great. Still haven't got around to blocking mine yet :/  I didn't mention in my post but I also modded the last row coz I was running out of cotton!   Pineapple doily?   It is deceptive. It is a corner to corner block, taken diagonally.  http://i.imgur.com/543SSPL.jpg   I know! I tried so hard to take a straight pic but it is draped across a pillow and I was too lazy to get up and put it on a flat surface.  Tell your OCD I am sorry      That sub is incredible! Just look at all those happy people, so clearly thrilled to have finally found themselves.      Ha! Burn!   /r/beforeNafteradoption would love this!   ...   Littermates   Goddammit! You mock the guy ONCE in a text and your phone remembers his name and autospells it out to make you look like a damn fool!!!  Sorry people! I really don't like him at all   Because I'm feeling particularly self-righteous this evening, I wrote an email to the local prosecutor named on the docket for this case. And because posting it publicly makes me feel more important, here it is:   I love your honesty.   Also, thumbs up on the letter. I feel the same as you when faced with something as ~~ludacris~~ ludicrous (I'm so sorry!) as this; overwhelmed with the burning desire to get involved   Ok, I imagined it...now what?   I joined somewhere around then too. Was so confused   [Oh what a difference a day makes]( http://i.imgur.com/ZOGRL45.jpg)   :)      Got a pic?   Corner to Corner Box stitch. Super easy and quick! I have since added 3 more colours, all greens   I am hoping I can ride the wave until at least it is big enough to be a shawl.

You didn't do anything!   Thanks! I have been told that I have excellent tension by a few people :)  In the crochet-world it feels like a pick-up line   That happyface on the end :)   After telling people I (a female) work in a hospital.  "Oh, are you a nurse?"  Bitch, I could be the head of neurosurgery. Don't just assume that since I am female and work in a hospital that I can only be a nurse.  I'm not actually head of neurosurgery, I am a Medical Scientist   That's some specious reasoning      Dat widdle paw lick!   To be honest I am not totally certain of cancer risks. I think it does all the depend on the cancer and if they are due to external or genetic risk factors.  Also, once you go through the first blood test you will go through a few more rounds of testing. You have to be crossmatched against the recipient a few times, and have confirmatory testing done too. We like to make sure we are 100% sure before ripping your organs out :P  As for the surgery itself, sorry I can't speak for that part...i am just a scientist    I work in the lab that handles only the Histocompatibility, which we determine from blood.   Each person has a "Tissue Type" which they inherit from their parents. That refers to a cluster of molecules called the Major Histocompatibility Complex. Essentially, these molecules help the body's immune system determine self from non-self. When you are being tested for compatibility, you are being tested to see what MHC molecules you have and whether they are the same as the recipient.  Now, in Solid organ donation, your Tissue Type is not the most important thing. You can still donate if you are not a match. Is it the case that just being the right blood group can mean you could donate. To explain this simply, the recipient is going to be on immunosupressants, that the body can't really recognise self from not self anyway.  That being said, doctors will try to match you as best as possible. Because a good matched organ is leas likely to cause the recipient to develop antibodies.  When your body is challenged with something foreign, it can develop antibodies against it, which will attack that thing the next time it enters your body.  Kidney recipients are usually very sick. They gets lots of transfusions. Transfusing blood challenges that person with something foreign, and they develop antibodies. Not all of these antibodies matter to us at Histocompatibility. We only care if they are antibodies that would specifically attack the organ we are trying to put in. We call those Donor Specific Antibodies.   A recipient with no antibodies at all (unsensitised) would have a MUCH better chance than a person who has lots and lots of antibodies (sensitised) and if that person has lots and lots of DSAs, matching can be almost impossible.  For that reason and for those people, Typing becomes very important.  A sensitised patient could have so many DSAs that only 5% of the population would have a Typing that could "slip through the gaps" and be both compatible and not under the DSA umbrella.   Once you take into account size, donor health, waiting time, etc a person could find themselves waiting a very very long time for that 1 in 10 person to match them.  Edit: I am on mobile so sorry if this is a bit garbled   I work in a lab that tests for compatability for Transplantations (not in the US). I can give you insight to the actual test, what it means to be compatible, and why kidneys can be so very difficult to match, if you are interested?   Flawless                     You have one shot at making them realise it was you, how do you make it count?      http://i.imgur.com/yLw1pmK.jpg  Edit: and the other misc objects around his face   My newborn nephew is in the Royal Children's Hospital, a month after being born with a rare bowel defect. His parents have just been told to expect their tiny fighter to remain there for 6-12 months. My heart is breaking for them, and I want to do something to support them, but don't know how.  Does anyone know which charities are best to help parents in this situation? They live local to the hospital, so accomodation isn't the issue. I just worry for their mental and emotional states and want to find someone who can help me make their lives a little easier.  Thanks   My husband dropped that one on me last night and I flipped my lid. I am nowhere near my time, so for me, having him say that was very hurtful. It showed a complete lack of respect for my feelings. It felt dismissive; as if any problem I had with him was only because I was full of hormones and thus not worth his time. I told him how very hurtful it was but he says he doesn't regret it.  Am I overreacting?   A world full of men, or a world full of women. Big changes and little ones.   This is assuming reproduction is still possible, of course.     	137
             So I start college in the fall and they offer an EMT training/certification course. It's something I'm very interested in but I'm pretty out if shape. Lifting wise it's not that bad because I've been lifting for about 5 months now, but cardio and BF% wise I'm waaay out of shape. 237lbs, 5'9. But I have lost about 10lbs so far! Anyways would it be better to take the class and get certified once I'm more in shape or would I be good to go now?      Special thanks to /u/CongratsOnYourBike (and the rest of rideit) for [his advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/2b5hl0/why_cant_i_use_the_clutch_properly_its_so/cj201cr). To be completely honest, I was about ready to write off motorcycles as a lost cause, but today was so fun once I got the whole pressing thing.  So I'm wondering how I can practice more. My instructors recommended that I come back and take the intermediate rider training or practice for awhile before I really try to hit the streets so I don't stall out in an intersection or something. I can work on all that friction zone stuff at my house, but to practice braking my issue is that the nearest large empty parking lot is a few miles away. Any ideas on what I should do?   So I just finished my first day of my MSF course and they've got me on a GN125. I can't get the clutch right. I'm either rocketing off the line uncontrollably or I stall out. I get off the line correctly about 50% of the time and the rest I'm just having trouble. Do you have any tips or tricks? The parking lot we're using is weird because it's sloped a bit so you have to apply more throttle depending on ehat side youre on. I need to improve clutch control because I really do not want to fail tomorrow and have to pay another 200 dollars.      Iirc the most dangerous place for motorcyclists is actually within the city, specifically in intersections. Which makes me wonder, why doesn't cycling have the same reputation as motorcycling? In the city a bicyclist is basically a slow motorcyclist with less protection.       http://imgur.com/a/awt1S (NSFW)   She's an instagram fitness model famous for the belfie (butt selfie)         I kind of like the look of [this bike without the fairing](http://oi44.tinypic.com/2wnd2f6.jpg)  Specifically the bit I circled in green [here](http://i.imgur.com/OEYnVqk.jpg)   Tl;dr: Would it work as a social lubricant?      I found a 2000 KTM EX250 for $1825, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone make a joke about getting their buddy a tool kit with their KTM. It would be my primary mode of transportation, 20 miles round trip per day on highways and surface streets. Plus however much I ride trails.             So I'm looking for a sort of casual shoe/boot that could work with most outfits. I'm not the type of guy that wears kicks or leather boots. I primarily wear Nike frees, vans, and topsiders.  I kind of like these  http://images2.revzilla.com/product_images/0070/9488/sidi_gas_shoes_zoom.jpg  And these  http://images3.revzilla.com/product_images/0069/6378/dainese_merida_shoe_black_zoom.jpg  I'm open to suggestions though. I'm buying my first bike, a GS500E in a couple weeks. It's a standard/naked.  Edit:  Here's a bunch of different shoes and boots for motorcycling. I'm not looking to spend more than $150  http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle-boots#v2-page=1 page_size=48 sort= tab=all         They posted a couple videos of tests that included a drag test and holding the material up to some kind of spinning metal wheel thing. It seemed to out perform kevlar.    So here's the listing. It's a ninja 500  http://eugene.craigslist.org/mcy/4528619780.html   The alternative being this GS500  http://eugene.craigslist.org/mcy/4558114417.html  I know these prices aren't great for these bikes but the local market isn't great either. To get cheaper prices I'd have to go to Portland and then ride the bike through portland and on the interstate for 2hrs which I'm not sure I'd be comfortable doing right off the bat.         *be helpful   So I was on Craigslist looking for bikes and I found a GSX600 streetfighter and I think I came when I saw it.   http://i.imgur.com/b3mGlJ2.jpg  It looks like sex. How are these things when it comes to acceleration and all that jazz?      I'll start off by saying that I mean no disrespect to you, /u/WNW3. I think you're doing a fine job, but I liked the vibe of this sub when we governed ourselves. I do think that we need a mod to update the sidebar and post meetups and whatnot, but beyond that I think they should be hands off. Experimentation with subreddit dynamics is, in my opinion, a poor idea.      M/18/5'10/SW:247/CW:???/GW:150  So six months ago I wouldn't touch a salad with a ten foot pole and the only time I did anything that would get me out of breath was when I went up stairs quickly. 4 months ago I started a strength and conditioning class at my high school which got my mile time from a ~16:40 to a ~13:15, which is great! but I wasn't progressing fast enough! So, I go to the gym twice a day now! In the early afternoon I go do a 40-60 min cardio/light lifting workout, and on the way I stop and pick up a cobb or caesar salad and a bottle of water. Then in the evening I go do a 40-60 minute light cardio/heavy lifting session. I haven't been completely keeping track of my calories but I think I'm eating around 1800-2000 per day. I've been supplementing creatine and whey protein so that I can continue to build muscle mass while in caloric deficit.      I kind of want to try a [teatox](http://www.bootea.com/products/14-day-teatox), partly to prove to myself that I can, partly because I'm hoping that it'll clear my mind, and partly because I think a strict plan will help me cut calories.       So I'm starting at a CC in California and I noticed that they offer an EMT course and it got me thinking. Would it be possible to work as an EMT Basic and attend school full time? The primary ambulance company in the area is AMR btw. I figure I could take the EMT course this coming term, get fully certified over spring term and start working over the summer, assuming there's a job opening.                         I've been away from the reddit nootropics community for awhile, but last time I was here everyone seemed to recommend modup.net as modafinil/armodafinil vendor.                  I'm thinking about going on a cleanse for multiple reasons, one of which is to sorta kick start my weight loss because I've been stuck for a while, but also to feel more energetic and happy                                                         You sacrificed yourself in the line of duty for the sake of others. That is the ultimate sacrifice. So for that, here's to you, Capt. David Van Camp. May you forever rest in peace.  http://imgur.com/a/jSOAJ  Context  http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/29d5ny/smokedrink_one_for_captain_dave_tomorrow_please/cijwryb?context=3   I found one for 3k and I'm tempted to pull the trigger. Would it be too powerful or too unreliable or anything like that? Im 5'9, 230 lbs, riding experience is limited to the MSF course.   Side note, most if the bikes I'm looking at are 70's/80's motorcycles, primarily British and Japanese, are old bikes just a bad idea in terms of reliability and safety?                I've been to two gyms in my town (a YMCA, and a local athletic club) and neither have had an area to deadlift, nor have they had the big bumper plates.                                 Often times I'm in a rush and have little money so I'm forced to go to McDonald's, BK, or DQ. What are some healthy options from drive thru restaurants? I always skip the soda. Usually at mcdonalds I'll get the 10 pc mcnuggets with medium fries. At DQ I'll get the 6 piece chicken strip basket. At BK I'll get a burger and medium satisfries   So I've been bench pressing for about 4 months, and in that time I've also tried DB press at least once a week, but anytime I'm using dumbells that are actually hard to lift I have trouble balancing them and keeping my wrists from wobbling and keeping them in control through the rep. I don't  have this problem when I'm bench pressing. Any tips or advice?       I was just looking at a post I recently made and when I clicked the link, which when I posted it lead to a picture of a jacket, it redirected to a porn site.   My favorite breakfast of champions is:  [1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition Oats and Whey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002DYJ0K2?vs=1) - ~200 calories  10 oz of 1% milk - 125 calories (12.5 cal an oz)  1 banana - 105 calories  Blended all together gets you a surprisingly filling ~425 calorie chocolate banana breakfast shake. Toss it in your shaker and mix occasionally to prevent the protein powder from settling.   My favorite breakfast of low BF% champions is:  - 1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition Oats and Whey - 200 calories  - 10 oz of 1% milk - 125 calories  - 1 banana - 105 calories  Blended all together gets you a surprisingly filling 435 calorie chocolate and banana breakfast shake. Toss in shaker and mix occasionally to prevent protein powder from settling.                I purchased ON creatine monohydrate and instead of dissolving it settles on the bottom of my shaker.         I'm between gyms at the moment and looking around. I'm especially interested in the snap fitness by market of choice on Willamette      So I've been lifting for about 3.5 months now and I'm at this kind of weird inbetween stage where I could really do either a beginner or intermediate workout. I'm looking for something that I can do 5-6 days per week. My primary goals are strength building, fat loss, and muscle growth.   I'm so confused by the different workout plans and I have no idea how to decide. I've looked at a [P/P/L Routine](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833) but it seems like it'll leave you with an underdeveloped lower back. I've looked at [Cory Gregory's program](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/cory-gregory-fitness-360-lifted-up-training.html) and that one also looks good but I would probably have to sub out day 6 for a rest day.   I'm thinking about starting this now. This would be my first legitimate workout routine, previously I've just been following a loose list of lifts set up by the weightlifting teacher at my high school but I've just graduated so I figure I should start a legit program. My goals are fat loss, strength gains, and a bit of bodybuilding.   Here's the workout:  http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833  I'm concerned about underdevelopment of the lower back woth that program but I figure I can just do the variant that includes deadlifts.   I'm also eyeing this program, but it might be a bit much. If I did it I think I'd sub out the 500 and 1000 rep days for cardio days.   http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/cory-gregory-fitness-360-lifted-up-training.html            I've seen a lot of bodybuilder bro science that says 1-2gallons per day (how is that even possible???) But I'm having to dig pretty deep to get a legit answer. Anyone know?      Would using protein powder work to help me lose weight? My plan is to use it as a meal for breakfast and occasionally other meals if I'm in a rush. The stuff I'm looking at is 120 cal/24g protein/1g sugar per serving so I figure it's healthy enough and the protein will fill me up nicely while also help in me take a nice chunk out of my calories. I do lift and have been doing so for about 4 months.  Edit:   Secondary question,  for meal replacement would it be better to use whey or casein?   I'm trying to lose weight but I don't want to lose my gains. Would it work for me to take creatine for a week every once in a while or a few days a month so that I can pack on some muscle without getting the water weight side effect of regular creatine use?         My doctor put me on 150mg of welbutrin about 3 months ago and it worked for a while but it seems like my depression is coming back. Not as badly as before but it's definitely there. I'm going off to college im two and a half months so do you think it'd be best to ask my doctor to bump me up to 300mg or to wait and ask the college medical center?   I was doing modified dips yesterday, feet up on a bench and hands on boxes on either side of me, and after the first rep my collarbone started hurting like a bizatch. I could only do one more before the pain became unbearable. It hurt for about ten minutes afterwards and then went away and I continued my workout, even doing bench press with no problem. I chalked ut up to me being heavy and not having trained for that exercise before. Today though my left collarbone has a slightly dull pain when I move my left arm or head. Can DOMS occur around your clavicle after dips or do I have another problem?  At the time of the workout the pain was probably a 7/10, now it's a 2 or 3/10   I was doing modified dips yesterday, feet up on a bench and hands on boxes on either side of me, and after the first rep my collarbone started hurting like a bizatch.

Can DOMS occur around your clavicle after dips or do I have another problem?          So I'm looking for a low calorie/carb/fat/sugar, high protein powder that I can use to supplement small meals. My goal is to cut weight. Here's my problem though, protein powder brands are confusing as fuck. I've been told that muscle milk is straddling the line between a genuine protein powder and a full meal replacement powder. That's the only brand I actually know of and I'm wary of consuming powders from a ranfom source.                Material,  graphic lifespan, etc      It's a modification of your standard bench press sets. I put my usual BP weight, 25 each side, on the bars using 5lb plates. I do 10 reps for each set, and remove 10lbs after every set. For the last three sets I increase the number of reps by 5 so that on my very last set I'm doing 25 reps with just the bar. My friend that showed it to me called it a burnout but I've come to learn that a burnout is something else.   I've been lifting for about 3.5 months now. Gained a bit of muscle, haven't lost any weight. I'd rather lose weight than gain muscle but doing both would be a huge plus.    Idk if you guys saw but the Daily Nexus released a list of all the Guachos that died this year. 11 total. It also makes me wonder just how many Isla Vistans die every year. I think that every year on either may 23 or may 28 we should have a paddle out to honor all those that fell on that tragic day and all those that die each year in Isla Vista.      http://www.hashtagfifty.com/   Both the DAC and the Y are closed   "I mean, they say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time."  Let's not give that monster what he wanted. Let his second death happen when the last reporter utters his name. However, let's make sure the people that died at his hands live on forever.    Anyone want to get the ball rolling on this?  https://www.sbfoundation.org/islavista Here is an article on the shooting:  http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isla-vista-rampage/gunman-kills-least-six-uc-santa-barbara-shooting-spree-n113931  Summary: A SBCC student tired of being rejected by women decided to have his "day of retribution." He stabbed his three roommates, ~~all believed to be chinese exchange students~~ two of whom were exchange students and one was an American, and then went on a shooting spree in Isla Vista where he intended to kill sorority girls. He ended up killing two sorority girls and one male UCSB student. 7 other people were wounded either due to bullet wounds or being hit by his car. The shooter wrote a 140 page manifesto detailing his hatred of women and outlining his plan to get revenge on society. He also posted a video on YouTube which is essentially a condensed version of his manifesto.                  I wouldn't mind a bit of dropkick murphys or blink 182.  And Radical Something even has a song about us      Didn't go, anyone got pics or vids so I can see why I too should be obsessed?         The only way I could get it to turn off was by removing the battery which I've done twice but that didn't work.   I want to work on a ranch next summer doing work like mending fences, digging irrigation, herding cattle, but I've got no experience in agriculture. Honestly, I kind of want to do this because being a cowboy sounds like a fun adventure, even if it requires doing a lot of dirty work. Next summer will be after my freshman year of college, what kind of part time work can I get to help build my resume for this? Currently I've got a line on a construction job. What websites advertise these jobs? I'd prefer to work in Wyoming, Montana, or Colorado at a larger ranch. Thanks for your help! And I apologize if the answers seem obvious to you guys but this whole industry is confusing to a kid that grew up in a city.       IE: scumbag steve type posts, bad luck brians, good guy gregs, etc   I was telling my friend about a forearm tattoo I want to get that has lettering and he was saying that typically a forearm tattoo has the bottom facing the wrist and the top facing the elbow which seemed counter intuitive to me because I wouldn't be able to read my own tattoo without putting my arm in an awkward position.                            I know that we're considered one of the most bike friendly cities especially due to the bike lanes they add whenever they repave streets, but it seems exceedingly dangerous,  especially because a lot of bikers don't follow the rules of the road. I've seen one biker get hit in my years here, and I've been in and seen plenty of near misses. Just today I was walking on the bike path by SEHS and I saw some kid fly into the parking lot at 10-15 mph and nearly get hit by a car that didn't see him.  Until Eugene expands the bike path a bit more I'm afraid that I'll always view them as a bit of a nuisance.          I've never really been on campus at night but last week I was driving around campus at 11 o'clock on a friday night and I was surprised that I didn't see any house parties during my travels. I'm obviously nit planning on dropping in, but I've heard that there's one street that has a bunch of parties.       So I'm a fat ass but I've started taking a strength and conditioning class to get in shape and lose weight. Running hurts my back like a bitch. I think I need to lose more weight before I can actually run. Should I use an elliptical, or bike, or some other stationary machine instead?   Lifting is no problem although I did jack my back up doing SL deadlifts but it's almost back to normal now.         Basically are there any that are not massive fast food chains?     	165
          Thanks for the feedback. I can see from your high link submission karma that you know what you're talking about and you're not just an armchair dude farting on your keyboard. :)               I'm not sure they are thinking clearly. I imagine they are working brutal hours due to overall shortage of staff. International workers and Red Cross have been attacked several times by locals and it's scaring off volunteers. Those that braved it are wearing themselves down.  I'm a nurse and I feel like more should volunteer to get down there and help contain this, but I have a family and take the easy way out. I still feel this has potential to get very very horrible.  I hope the doctor makes it through. :(      Where does Jesus advocate military spending versus helping the poor? I'm looking and...I might have a busted copy because this copy of the New Testament doesn't mention that at all.      Came to post this very thing.      That is also not true. Shareholders also have interest in longevity of positive return for investment. Criminal activity, even if it could result in higher share price, isn't the ideal scenario for the average investor either.   I'm going to go with this answer myself      Hawking speculated in 'The Grand Design' that conscious observation may be a fundamental part of the formation of the universe, since without it 'existence' ceases to exist.   I like to take it one step further. Since energy is infinite, time is irrelevant. Everything energy will be or can be/has been currently exists at once. We interpret the state we're in based on perception of our current existence, but that's our nature. That doesn't make time as we understand it a natural law.  If we were to perceive this infinite energy in its true form, we'd see the state of everything we know to exist as simply varying forms of the same energy. Everyone around you are simply different states of you. You are every single person who has ever been, currently lives and who will ever be. Along with every single other "living" thing.         The United States should install minarets, as many Muslim countries do for prayer. Each day, at sunrise, midday and at sundown this song should be blasted. 365 days a year.            A piece my wife did of her cousin, wanted to share. Thanks :)      **My 5 Questions:**  1. Describe a typical day doing your job. 2. How much influence do you and your kind really have on global oil prices? 3. Do you feel speculation as a whole has a positive or a negative impact on global economies? 4. What made you decide to do this job? 5. Do you feel oil markets need more or less government regulation? Why?  Thanks for your time!      "Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks" by Adam D. I. Kramer, Jamie E. Guillory, and Jeffrey T. Hancock  Thanks for the advice. I am lodging a complaint now. Hopefully others find this as disgusting as I do.   Excellent point. Do you think there is a way to obtain the names of involved practitioners?       Because of the new movie, this franchise is dead to me.   I didn't ask what caused it. I asked how to lessen it. In my former life as a nurse, I saw hundreds of gallons of various fluids thrown away in sealed rubber bags. Bags that are not going to biodegrade in your grandchild's lifetime. This is daily.  My question is, over the course of years, decades, that kind of resource abuse is a zero-sum game.   But a good friend of mine who is a devoted Tea Party member completely agrees with you and said almost your exact argument. I just feel like it fails to touch on the issue of preservation.  We recycle aluminum. We separate plastics at the bin. We take absolutely no steps to preserve water or reintroduce it into our ecosystem, which I feel is a misstep.   I was hoping for an intelligent response to this. Thanks for posting the opposite, though.   Shouldn't draining containers that possess water be required before disposing of them? It seems logical, but this question stirred quite the debate amongst my friends and I last night.      That is an entire season of Celebrity Rehab with just two men.               Thanks everyone, I appreciate the feedback. He is nearing middle school age. The divorce was years ago, I can't even imagine her discussing me publicly knowing how many times we've been to court. I'm going to try the pro bono avenue, I've tried before and I get many rejections based on wages.  Any attempt to return to court from position of plaintiff fails on my part, they don't listen or take me seriously in any real regard. It's hard to get into details, but essentially the relationship between a counselor and the judge in my case wound up costing me. I disagreed with the counselor regarding her attempt to medicate my son (I work in healthcare and knew a licensed counselor was not legally allowed to recommend medications for my son), so I requested a new counselor and suddenly she testified that I didn't listen to medical advice and bam, lost medical rights over my son. This was followed by my ex immediately filing and stating that if I disregarded medical advice, then my son wouldn't be safe traveling to my place. Ta da.   A frustrating aside, the divorce started when I caught her cheating with a man 20 years older, who was both of our boss in the civilian military contract we both were working at the time. She denied this in court, I presented evidence she lied. That's how she lost, as she was proven to be unreliable in court. But the moment this counselor and I disagreed, the entire game changed. Just incredibly frustrating how biased the family court system is in favor of the mothers, but in this case I am convinced there is a loophole or a crack I've been overlooking that could help me.  Thanks again everyone.   After my divorce in West Virginia, I moved to Baltimore MD. The courts had ruled 50/50 custody. My ex repeatedly dragged me to court for every single reason you can imagine, and each time I won until the final court case, case number 9, where she said my sons mental health was impaired because of the travel to see me. Out of money and representing myself, I lost that single case and she gained majority custody.  My ex has completely stopped letting me see or contact my son and I cannot get the courts to act. I am still paying a large sum in child support and live paycheck to paycheck with my current wife and our baby, even though she is married to someone retired from military and they own three houses. The fact that she has children with her new husband was considered a hardship by the judge in our case and I had an additional 10 percent added to my final monthly child support.  I just want to see my son. I have no money, at all, to hire another attorney. I've burned through every dime I had in court costs. I won 8 consecutive cases. I have tried appeals, they were overturned. The judge told me to get a lawyer. I make too much to qualify for legal aid but my wages are on paper. In reality, I have a family to support and I'm struggling.  Anyone with any suggestions, please let me know. I literally have no idea what I can do now.         Your English is great! No worries   Sreb's my wife. It's her sister that made these.   Could you ask her for specifics on how she did this? :)    They're all real eggs, apparently some type of tissue and tile? I have no idea what they're talking about :/   I don't think I'd use the word easy to describe it lol. There appear to be no seams of any kind, it's one smooth shell with a layer of varnish sealing it and enhancements painted on them.   I'm lucky if I can dye an egg in food coloring without causing skin discoloration and/or ruining clothing and furniture.            "Hey, he don't thunk like me thoughts, he must be one of them weirds!"  Your post reads like a really bad bully in an old ABC after school movie.   The sequel: "Terminated by Noon"?   1) What timezone do you live in and what hours do you normally reddit? DC area, all day typically off and on.   How many hours a week do you normally use reddit? 20+  2) Where have you moderated before? Game and music forums mostly, including the XBOX Addicts forum, dnbmp3, soulseek 'music', OKCupid and long ago dogsonacid  What do you like and dislike about moderating? I like interacting with people and helping solve problems. I do not care for having to sift through endless pictures of genitals.  If you could ask the admins to change one thing about moderating, what would it be? Bundled HTML notifications via email are always useful  3) What does AskReddit need to change? Less repeat questions is a big one  How would you improve AskReddit by being on the team? Actively search history, plus I am here enough that I recognize the repeats and questions that feel "common"  4) A post goes up and your gut says that it breaks the rules but youre not sure which rule it breaks. What do you do? Research. If that doesn't turn up a good solution, then I ask someone who may know (another mod)   5) Why is rule 5 important? Objectivity is important. This should be a place to share knowledge, not rant and rave. There's better places for that. No exceptions.  6) Why is rule 6 important? Should there be exceptions made? If so, what? There are more suitable subreddits for that. No exceptions.  7) Do you agree with the expansion of rule 8? I agree so long as it remains in genuine good faith adherence to the community spirit and not some personal act of spite against a particular user.  9) What do you consider to be a bannable offense? Blatant trolling, repeating a question despite the question being removed and harassing other users are significant issues.  10) Youre a new mod and you see another mod make a banning that you dont think is justified. What do you do? Stand behind the moderators decision and expect they stand behind decisions I make. If there's a REALLY strong case for "wrongful banning", I'd shoot them a PM voicing my concerns then let them make the final call.     If you read Reddit without worrying what other Reddit users think of your opinions, you realize it's shit.   So you're saying conclusively that the standard of living of a nation is dependent on it having a stock market?       Never thought I'd have to break this down for someone, but since you missed something along the line...It's the sound of the word. I hate it. Hope that makes my selection acceptable to you. Do I have your permission to dislike it now?   Moist. That word has always troubled me.         I imagine virtually every single person who posts on reddit to look like some variation of a Garbage Pail Kid.   I vomited in my mouth. A lot.   They should have clarified that before wasting my time.      I'd suggest actually reading what he said instead of making random ominous statements. It's the literal definition of hypocrisy for the United States to object to Russias "intervention" in Crimea. The US government made their bed and they can scream like 2 year olds, claiming the sky is falling, but at the end of the day they have little choice but to sleep in it.      Funny, they won't say which care facility he is in. It's almost like they don't want a bunch of people showing up picketing at the location...      This is what I didn't understand, Chapter 11 doesn't apparently have any type of waiting period. Thanks!   Keep spending your time sitting around posting questions on Reddit. Nature will take care of the rest.   Insane ramblings from someone who thought they were special.   Technically yes, there can be some cauterization from the entry of rounds depending on distance. As an ER nurse, the majority of severe bleeding I saw in wounds from gunshots came from one of two major points. The exit wound or the internal bleeding which was normally related to the round exploding internally and causing significant damage to internal organs.   Taking into account the major shift towards "corporate personhood", it seems contradictory that they would have special privilege when it comes to going bankrupt.   If you do anything other than back off, you are wrong.   Depending on what country you were in, you may now even be married :)         Zero sympathy for someone unemployed for two years.   Unless the object of the game is to have sex with someone, I'm not seeing how it matters, honestly   Wish there was video of this.               Seriously?      What is one role from any existing story you wish you could play before you die?   My ex-wife left me for her boss, who was 20 years older. That was...something.   I once had to break up with a girl by telling her I was gay so that she wouldn't quit a play I was directing. It was a really weird time in my life.      I have the baseball one somewhere, if you are referencing the one with the red lights that moved?   I still use AOL Instant Messenger. Daily.   *hangs head in shame*      Your history reads like a 7th grade girl on the playground screaming "I'm telling" over and over and over...  You knew that, right?   No, it is quite accurate. They are both beginning the process of discrediting the messenger instead of focusing on the message.    This proves beyond any doubt that our Congress has completely detached itself from the rest of the world. They literally cannot process how a man could see something wrong and try to fix it. They have to try every form of smear they can think of. And sadly, it took them this long to come up with "Blame the Commies!"  This is disgusting.               "The governor accepted full responsibility but not an ounce of blame." Great quote, and a great way to explain exactly what Christie managed to do.      Disgraceful.   Rot in hell.   Exactly. And these aren't aides. One is a friend. A friend since high school. I don't believe for one second that his friend from high school hid that act from him. No way.   The person directly connected to it has known Christie since high school. I have a hard time believing Christie didn't know anything. The man is too much of an asshole to let things go by in his office without his sayso.    What do you mean? Personally, I think he is sinking. Not sure what you mean by motive?   Also, did they ever conclude how these emails leaked?   Yes this is a political topic, but I'm curious what Reddit thinks about the issue.          This is so sad.   Unless you dont die. You linger. And require skilled care for years and years...   THIS is something I would love as a benefit. My insurance doesn't offer this and I think thats insanity   Whatever the case, they ultimately care about money. It seems like giving a discount card for members to get fruits and vegetables for 5 percent off would ultimately save them money down the road if they have a healthier membership? Until we address the fact that cheeseburgers at McDonalds are cheaper than balanced meals I think people will be forced to make the unhealthier decisions...at least here in the US.    Covering discounts for fruits, vegetables, whole grain breads etc seems like it would ultimately save the insurance companies money. why don't they do this?  	118
       Fallout 3      Ask the same questions over and over on /r/AskReddit   The first one was pretty good, then it started going downhill.

 Exactly that. I'd suggest reading Sherlock Holmes for that, there're a lot of long dialogues there.    Thank you! Now I understand [Bioshock Ininfite](http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z7/prettybigguy/Telegram.jpg) better.    It depends on the type of music. I generally like relaxing music. Soft Jazz is my favorite. I also chose my playlists depending on the scenes (peaceful scenes, chaotic or just thoughts).    I have ADD, so Ritalin helps me to concentrate. I'm not sure if it increases creativity though. However, as one who tried both alcohol and marijuana, I've discovered that it simply makes one think he's creative WHILE writing.    Never works.    Ah, my beautiful country.    In August, goddamn EA with their failed marketing techniques.    That's a stupid question. I have an account with SimCity Delux, if anyone's interested in an exchange.    Apparently, this is true for Israel. Someone called and said 'I'm kidnapped' (he really was), and the police didn't respond for the next eight hours.     I have a few 'missing information' in my novel (mostly about characters).  This is because my novel is 'a journal' of the protagonist. Therefore he writes for himself, and it makes sense that he won't explain much about what is obvious to him, and it's great for me (the real author) because it keeps some of the details (occasionally important details) in the dark. I think it makes the reader unsure, while he might fill out the details for himself.  I love it, but I wanted to know your opinions about things like this. Is it more harmful than beneficial?    Is there another one besides "Buried At Sea"?    I call it 'searching for inspiration'.    Thanks for the answer. Perhaps you know the name of his agent?  P.S. Obviously I don't have any bad intentions. I enjoy his music, and I wanna try my luck in getting in touch with him (not physically).    Why? It's not like I'm going to murder the man.       I'm doing a research (:   How much time did it all take? (All of the drafts)  Was it easier to write after the first draft?      I just noticed that my story contains a fair amount of sentences that begin with- This, That, Then, etc.  Should I replace them? If so, how?    It's not really related, but I'm always wondering- how can the photos be so good and with such high resolution? (Considering this was ancient equipment)   I'm from Israel and I prefer writing in English. My English isn't perfect and my grammar is often awkward, but I feel that it's more fluid than Hebrew. Try both, and see what works better. I don't think there's a universal solution for this.    Most of them probably did.   I found it increasingly difficult to keep my desktop and my .docx stories organized as I continue to write. It is bursting and almost entirely occupied with folders, webpages, and various notes which I suppose will be useful. How do you, writers, keep up with that?   I don't think it's possible. Procrastinations happen to everyone, in every field. Especially if you're a writer, and I like to consider myself so. Drugs also help.    Hey! Does anybody know an interesting book that contains good descriptions of alluring cities, landscapes or even rooms? It could be fictional.  I read my first book (!!) last month (TFIOS, if you're interested), so I'm open for any suggestions.  Thank you!    I can relate.   I need more like this.    Motivation fades naturally, especially after after getting painful reactions. It's human nature. Especially if you're a beginner.  Believing that the average writer ALWAYS has motivation to write is simply untrue. I'm also curious, by the way, why doesn't every writer has the potential to be a great writer? Isn't is a mainly matter of practice? As any other skill?    I have to say I'm actually surprised by the comments.   I thought most writers are depressed, i wasn't sure if it's for the better or the worse.    Some are actually good and funny.   Every writer should be encouraged, doesn't matter if his writing sucks. I'm 16 and I my writing is nowhere near to be considered good.  If I wanted a review from someone for the first time and he didn't encourage me afterwards, my motivation, just like any other beginner writer, would slowly fade away.    Every writer has the potential to become an amazing writer, yet without motivation I think it's far less likely.    The comments here are disgusting.   	33
 nice touch with the wine at the end   So like, before humans, God created Angels. They were his servants and Lucifer was born the greatest of all. He was born perfect, given consciousness directly in the presence of perfection and radiant light (God). Over time, Lucifer became jealous of God receiving all the glory and, being so powerful, deceived himself that he too could be Lord over all - Higher than God. Which is just logically an impossibility. That's like a a character in a story believing they could be greater than the person that wrote them into existence. Anyway, having once deceived himself, Lucifer convinced 1/3 of God's Angels to join his army and rebel against God. God then cast the Angel's out of his highest chambers of Heaven, banishing them. After this, at some point in space and time, God created humans. Satan then proceeded to deceive humans into disobeying God, making them believe God was trying to hold them back from becoming "like God" if they obtained the knowledge of good and evil. This is called Sin - disobeying God. Ever since the *fall of man*, and progressively throughout history, the fallen angels and demonic forces have existed within and out of our realm (spiritually), affecting us directly and indirectly. Whether that be through temptation or various other methods such as possession, demons have had a negative effect on our world. Fortunately, through the power of prayer, we have been given authority through the Holy Spirit of God and the authoritative name of Jesus to command these spirits to have no power over others and ourselves. This is all due to the faith that we have in God through Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for our Sins. This brings terrible anguish to Lucifer (Satan), as he knows his fate has long since been sealed and doesn't want anyone to know the power that can found through the love of Yeshua (Jesus).  Ps - it's just so freeing to humble oneself before God and embrace the forgiveness that Jesus offers. Once someone accepts that love and knows their name is written in the book of Life for eternity, God will shape you into the Christ-like individual He originally intended you to be. Salvation happens in a moment, Sanctification occurs over a life time.   becuz who cares about iOS games? u should go make one, who knows, you might make a billion dollhairs!   His *Seven Swans* album is definitely the most Biblically inspired, but his music is so varied I wouldn't say it falls under the category of Christian. Rather, he is a Christian who makes beautiful music and, at times, pulls those themes into his lyrics. *Illinois* is for sure his most popular album but I consider them all very enjoyable.   also, rel4ted to prayer - There is authority over  the spiritual forces in the name of Jesus, Yeshua. As in, authority over all spiritual beings has been given to him by the will of God (the author of all life). "12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." So, when you pray, pray that the spiritual forces that are not of Christ be bound and cast away *in the name of Jesus - Amen* (Truth) - There's a lot of supernatural things going on in our natural perspective that we don't even realize. Thankfully, we have our Lord to guide us through.    /r/circkjerk   whatever happened to pop icons being muscular, tall and sexy?   People are deceived, people think religion belongs in what our United States has turned politics into. It's all for show and the show has created a culture where if you affiliate with A religion, you should stand by B candidate. That's an idiotic and closed off mindset. Most likely, those politicians care more about their deep pockets than pleasing Christ. And the elections are blatantly rigged. There were scores of people supporting Ron Paul, but the establishment would not allow it. The media is owned. It IS propaganda. The world is ran by Satan and his human puppets. All we can do is look to Christ for freedom in the afterlife and present people with the truth of his gospel today.    Prayer is just demonstrating that you wish to communicate with the one who created you. Also, you pray, God moves. You pray and Angels are sent by the scores to lovingly attend to you or others. There is much power in prayer. An unseen spiritual power that begins with aligning our will with Christ through love and humility.  Ps- Listen to Sufjan Stevens.    I've just come to terms with the fact that, as a Christian, I have no right to be offended. Ever. It's just not part of my purpose for being. It also makes no sense to get offended by words because that's just empowering those words to have a deeper grasp on you.    she's so pretty :)   why's its eyes so dilated?   nyahaaaa   yes  EDIT: for OCD   it's not like anyone would see that you "edit" it right? and usually they mark EDIT for really pointless edits.   quit forcing me to watch your god damn PYRAMIDS!   its like a SlugCat that, much like the other creatures in the post-apocalyptic world, have adapted to hibernating for extended periods of time until the need to hunt for food becomes necessary.

Please...someone take a picture of me so I can post it on Reddit"   [yes is it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Bqob-weFk)   I mean, how am I, as the viewer, suppose to be informed on a topic when characters such as Piers Morgan and Nancy Grace never allow their guest to get a single word out other than their opening statements.    never watched the show. Can't relate. Downvote    You "got lost"?   Prof. Stuntman   thanks man. thank you very much. Christ bless   I want to stop fapping. I've tried. Made it the most 18 days. I've prayed and asked for the temptations to leave me. I've fought through it many times before, but the day to day just never ends. I want to "repent" of this Sin, but God, it's so hard to go through this everyday. And I legitimately see no end in site. I could go a year, two years, 50 years down the road, and then do it again and maybe my anxiety is unwarranted but i really could use some insightful christians to chime in on this subject and God's forgiveness. It just worries me, ya know.     not the entirety, but at times in the manner in which is turns everything into a religious show and a step by step process than really the breakdown and confession of the heart to forgiveness. I didn't post that to offend anyone, it's not aimed at you who trust Christ with your heart. The question is meant to expand the thought behind Establishment Sized Religion and how at times, it creates this culture of worrying more of the superficial than a relationship with God.    unlock grid?

WARNING: The following comment section you are about to read is filled with inside jokes and circlejerking that no self-righteous human would allow to pollute their screen for longer than it requires to click the red X in upper right hand corner. You've been warned.   I wish someone would post a long thing about the power of Prayer cuz it seems to be pretty important.   1.) God punished them for disobeying his direct command, they were not ignorant to disobedience. Then they tried to hide from God. Adam also tried to put the blame solely on Eve, as she was deceived by the Serpent initially.  2.) The Original Sin that occurred that day befell Mankind and Sin cursed their species (and World), not Lucifer - Lucifer is an Angel who committed his own Sin long before by rebelling against God in separate context and as an Angel born into knowledge and presence of perfection.   Excalibur!    Worthy post indeed! Though, this is an important en devour that we're all embarking on together, it's important to poke fun at the overall reality of the situation.    haha      Now I CAN'T WAIT to see devil due.............*fart noise*   Exactly! i went 18 days using nofap and prayer through christ and I felt amazing! unfortuantely, i fell again, and that stinks. But never give up! Go loves us, forgives us, and wants us to be the best we can for Him!   (bullet note) Be Titan Fall   I felt the support.   Some of you may be aware of this subreddit already. [/r/NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap) is a great support Reddit assisting those with the desire to turn away from pornography and alter the way they perceive sexuality. There is even a day counting badge to mark how many days it has been since a previous relapse or failure. I'm submitting this as this is one my many sins that I struggle with and pray Christ conquers immediately in my life. There's a lot of love in that subreddit, similar to this one. Surround yourself with love and you will overflow with love.    what's a miser?   Fuck your video games! Jk   thaat is cool   k   mmm, i donno, i've heard it a few places and i'm too lazy to go hunt them down.    that is....photo realistic. Tell me how you got so good? i want your whole story if you don't mind.    Certain societies mention the existence of giants, such as in Genesis 6 of the Bible. There are also reported giant human like bones that are reported to be kept in the Smithsonian. Any thoughts related to their possible existence?    Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was releasing around the same time, so they also didn't want to take sales away from themselves.    How long did you go without PMO before you found your wife? What were the struggles like? Did you feel that the lack of this Sin in your life led you to more opportunities to meet a life partner through Christ? Now that you've met your partner and are sexually active with them, do you still feel the temptation of pornography or are your passions quelled by the love of God and your wife? Any other input here is very welcome. Thank you. God bless.    Romans 2:  12-16  This might shed some perspective. But I suppose this is still up to interpretation.   12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Gods sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 16 This will take place on the day when God judges peoples secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.   wowza   all those bird wings make the hipsters go buckwild    what kinda game is it?    i don't agree with the title. Reddit is always poopin their pants over natural  phenomenon as if some scientist in a lab created this formation.   I work night shift, don't sleep much, workout quite a bit, and have been sick lately. I just found out I have Shingles ( a reemergence of the chicken pox virus when your body's immune system is compromised). Please pray that this will pass, i'm currently taking anti virals). i'm 23 and I've found out that if you get shingles before the age of 50, you have a 74% chance of having a stroke in your life. So that's got me worried as well.     maybe they want to do a natural birth? We will pray for that the labor pains will come and pass friend.   they killed JoePa too. Radon 80 in his home. ten times the normal limit.    thnx will check it out      blacklist   i just can't comprehend how someone can keep track of sooo much detail in one single image. too much for my simple mind, i gess   i just don't understand how anyone could outright NOT support snowden and be able to sleep at night. The news woman just seems like such a tool. How can anyone be that way? How can you lie to your self for so long and not change.    yeah, that   outright gayest movie of the year - why reddit? why?....oh, right. This was planted by some hollywood shill trying to promote their lackluster garbage.    yeah, killing people is just great   not sure why pointing out your lack of religiousness, but whatevs. At least I know now so i can't JUDGE you   IN THE VOICE THAT'S IN MY HEAD WHEN I SEE CAPITAL LETTERS!  Edit: Fuck you for the gold :)   I'm a Christian and every day I would go to bed full of guilty related to PMO. It would even convince myself at times that I wasn't saved and that Christ's sacrifice wasn't sufficient. I knew this was a lie and I also knew the satisfaction I thought I could find in PMO was a lie as well - yet I bought into it like a slave to my body. God has blessed me with another day away from guilt and, praise Jesus, it feels good. It feels good to look to God without a contrived blemish looming over my soul. There are many other sin's that I am also dealing with in my life, as well, but Lord it is uplifting to be free of this one. God bless all for freedom from sin. Sanctification. :)    quaid, start the reactor      great response to his great response.    sounds like exactly what some reviewers have spewed. Think yourself friend. it is a game.   hijack: this is a fucking joke. This is about as staged as back at the studio.    Quaid      kin ka zoo!

HIPPA!!!   LITERALLYYYyyyyyy   The Next Generation of Gaming is HERE      it's time to do something!...but first, to the grocery store      I've seen CG trailers for games such as Diablo 3 and they look [Beautiful](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpLVYHOkvM). I've begun to ask myself, with the over saturation of Pixar copycats flooding the limelight (aimed primarily at children), why haven't there been more full length animated feature films that are of higher quality, such as [Final Fantasy: Spirits Within](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaI7ZPA9I1c)? With such a large market of teens and young adults who watch Japanese Anime, why haven't there been more attempts by Western culture to tap into this mature audience?   This is just unbelievable. I wonder if the fraudsters will be dealt with in time or if once this fixes (if it fixes), nothing will be done...well, at least we have a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. Not to dapper down this obvious injustice.    I've been noticing my urethra dribbles Semen like urine after Voiding. Am I the only one? Lol   ahhh man.....mmm, well....   good point   what can one do?   If I wanted Batteries, I'd go to Radio Shack   me three!   Do you think 9/11 was an inside job? I do. I personally feel that our country's war efforts are no different than that of Nazi Germany in the 1940s. [Some thoughts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvg_rv3B_wU)   use good act as means to also make more money for movie? That's just evil.    certainly not a timeless show. just seems to have the most traction   so essentially everyone else but jesus should not look at porn?   the creation of man and the creation a day time talk show host both have their origins founded in Genesis    it also repeats a joke til it's all the way down your esophagus   You will never redeem yourself as the love of God extends as a gift that has redeemed you in full through the second you choose to accept His son Jesus and his sacrifice. It is already completed and you can rest easy knowing how much grace, love and mercy rests on your spirit now. Go in peace and continue to be sanctified by the blessings of The Lord in all it's forms.   I kept reading that as Oprah.    I don't see how his comments on porn being okay stil maintain his purity.   instead of upvoting you, I down voted you and wrote this comment instead. Does that tickle your twacker just the same?   Their cartoons are funny   maybe just measured in visible light.  In the case of reflective energy, it would follow projection qualities. Still have to consider matter as well.    Your life could end any day. Make sure you're right with Yeshua.    Valid point. Counter point. Who gives a shit?   Some people, just want to watch the world...burn   have u met the Rothschilds?    Unbelievable.    Why hasn't a crazed, suicidal,  transient trillionaire done the unspeakable and sent a spacecraft to destroy Earth's one single satellite? Seems like the best possible terrorist plot since Benghazi, yeah?      "how much money would it take to get you to do 9/11 part 2 for me?"   I've met a lot of Catholics who tend to stray away from Christ due to the contradicting doctrine of Catholicism. I don't, for certain, know if this plays into your issue - but if so, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions in PM and would highly suggest finding a non-denominational church that sticks directly to the Bible. Just my thoughts. Once again, not trying to put down Catholicism, just stating what I've noticed. I'll pray for you, friend.          ya blew it   Yeah, like my mom accidentally became pregnant with me with a guy who didn't love her, and wanted her to have an abortion, but she couldn't live with herself if she did and here I am! I'm not the best Christian ever, but I AM loved by God and happy he gave me the mercies of life and the opportunity to help others to Yeshua. :)   I wish that guy was still in the background. In your shower perhaps?   Pretty good for a beginner. O0o-_-o0O   Hmm, maybe?   not sure, who's the mod? Alert them of this. Then they'll send out a subreddit message letting everyone know it's banned and then when we see this imgur pictures, we can report them and remove them before they confuse people more.    Maybe we should ban posting random Imgur pictures with text?   Maybe we should ban posting random Imgur pictures with text?

I've been depressed before and I'm depressed right now (it's Winter), but I've come to the conclusion that it's a normal aspect of life. My question is, if human beings have gone untold millennium without psyche medication to treat depression in the past, what makes an issue that appears to be a natural part of life a valid clinical illness within the last 50 years?      Sorry, I drive a Cummins     You should put *your* Panthiez-On   Thank you for quoting my previous lengthy passage so I wasn't left out of context. Allow me to further elaborate. Because it's fucking gay as shit!    college is worthless   It's even more odd when someone starts clapping and you can tell it just naturally prompts others to do so out of learned behavior. Fuck Hunger Games.   that's from the movie! holy fu-      no one fucking asked you!   But you are reinforcing my perspective with your own confirmation bias. Rather than answering the question with neutrality, you, similar to the dogmatic characters you've just described, have answered a question on world views by attempting to sell me your own world view. It would appear it's cyclical no matter what side you take. The question then arises, is there a side to take?    Whether someone believes theology, ideals, or even the theory of evolution - Why do people claw teeth and nail to impart their understanding of the world upon you?   And my axe!

 So you get the far superior player and a pick? Good lucking signing Aldridge and Love.    Other Suns fans will have different opinions, but I agree with you and I think the front office is fickle.          It appears he's on the block and Phoenix will take a half decent offer because they're eager to unload him. What are possible trades and what is the best Phoenix could do?    Because I don't have to buy food from the one grocery store you go to. I don't have to chicken with broccoli to live. I can substitute ramen and cans of tuna and live off of that. But if I need a particular procedure, what choice do I have? I think you should reconsider.  We really don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have medicare and we can use that as our base. Just look at every other developed country. There's not that much mystery. Single payer would be better.    These are great questions!!! Let's hope we hear them in the debates.       oh, this is making me remember stats   why?      The markets of supermarkets and heatlhcare are very different! If I don't buy Safeway's overpriced  produce, I'm not going to die. I have many other options to buy groceries. I can even grow some food myself. Now, what happens if I need medical care? The inelastic demand curve says I have buy the product no matter how much everyone is going to rip me off. If there was medicare for everyone the government can bring down prices drastically just like every other country does. That is the power of a single provider.    [God wills it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6wfJWVCeI), Sanders will win!            this is a win for democracy and Americans    It never is to get progress. It can be done though.   which website is giving those odds?   it makes sense   exactly         Let's not confuse the 2% who are part of organization with those that support it. [42%](http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/03/how-many-doctors-support-single-payer/) support it according to one source. With the implementation of the ACA and it's success, those numbers could be even higher if a survey was conducted now.   This is a great ruling! It gives power to the people rather than politicians.             Just when we think we're becoming more progressive and humane as  a country, we're reminded that we still execute people. We have a long way to go.      Great observations, it definitely would be a huge plus for business.   [Many doctors](http://www.pnhp.org/) are for single payer FYI.   Fuck insurance companies.

No, you wouldn't like that? You'd prefer to keep charging twice as much as you need to? Ok.    I'm sorry.   you could maybe get a new job?       I think it could show confidence and leadership if one of the republicans declared it. Somebody has to set themselves apart.   republicans? lol   You  have to at least try even if it's going to fail at first. Obama could have set a bridge for it if he delivered the public option that he promised.   Wait, what? doctors can barely make a middle class living? do you know doctors? because all the doctors I have come across and know are making a ton of money  I'm totally for abolishing for profit healthcare and pharm though   Jewish carpenter who works for the poor and those in greatest need? Where have I heard that before?   Some doctors are greedy pigs. Some doctors actually know how to use medicare to make a lot of money. If everyone was insured they would get care from their PCP instead of waiting to get seriously kill and go to the ER.    When there is one giant insurer they set the price. They tell companies what they will pay and they make them compete. It lowers the prices significantly! We have so many other countries that prove this. It's why things costs so much more in America.   Single payer will reduce costs.    If anyone is peacocking, it's Trump or maybe Jindal. Sanders is realizing his goals.   You know that medicare currently sets the prices, right?    And the high prices due to inelastic demand is immoral.    Did they say it though?   Obviously private insurance companies would be **-**, but the money saved from their profits and administrative costs would be a **net gain** for the economy.    that's another monster   Yes, govt is the insurance company just like they are for medicare and for vets. It doesn't stop you from purchasing anything though.   [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Health_Care_Act)      I can count. You can't be more than 100% sure.

I think they have more empathy but more in touch? That's definitely arguable. Clintons make more in one month than Bernie's net worth.   You're  right. For profit is immoral and inefficient.    You haven't heard others saying it now, have you?   What kind of odds are you giving me?   You are not as you are born. You are as you make yourself and as you live your life. Just look at Jindal.   Same here, I'll support the Democratic nominee. I won't be excited about it though. Hillary is a corporate democrat.   Not quite a solid argument there bud.         I'll be excited when I see Bernie leading Hillary in a poll.   I'm sure he knows this. He's pretty busy. I think you have to be strategic where you go and in what order.          You're right, his supporters currently are almost exclusively white. That will change. There is no other candidate that matches up to Bernie in terms of record or policies that support minorities.    [Video](http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/sen-bernie-sanders-thinks-hell-win-white-house-32083348) of the interview.   [Video](http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/sen-bernie-sanders-thinks-hell-win-white-house-32083348) of the interview.                     legally though?    I think a lot of the west coast and other parts of the country would love to see him in person.   It is Hillary's to lose. And there is a lot of time to lose it.      I think we need to get [Lenne Hardt to introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wCXgS_dYE) Bernie. Some pyrotechnics wouldn't hurt either.    It's still early. We'll see how things start shaping up towards the end of the year.   Bernie cares about the environment and he won't sacrifice it to corporate overlords because he's not a puppet like all the republicans and Clinton.    His plugs are even worse than Trump's elaborate comb over, but at least he's super tall. It would definitely be a different dynamic if it were a three way race, but I think being the only alternative to Hildawg is working out for Bernie.   You're right. He and his campaign realize this though and they're working on it. Plus, early states create momentum.          if only i could bet legally on sports and whatnot in my state :/   but I can't, not even draftkings   People love Bernie too.   I saw him 11/1 at another site.    You got a time machine bruh? Because if you do, he's 11-1 right now and we can become very rich!   McCain had lapses and said questionable things. Sanders is sharp.   He's running as a Democrat. If he loses the primary, he's not running as a third party candidate.   No he's not :)   About the same age as John McCain when he ran. And Sanders is healthy and sharp.    As an Atheist, no Yoel. I'm not going to go for Jesus. This is a secular country. Keep your religion to yourself.    I bet they pull a Jon Jones and delete that tweet.    You can thank God and such, but keep the proselytizing to yourself, especially when it is bigoted and not PC. And you can be sure this will blow up beyond MMA. When that happens, you can be sure he's suspended or cut. Whatever action the UFC decides to take, Romero brought that upon his self.    Without being political or talking about religion, let's just the Abrahamic religions are not tolerant of homosexuality. This is what happens when proselytizing goes wrong.   Will he get suspended or outright cut?    what did he say exactly? go for jesus not gay jesus? i couldn't understand him   all they need are headlines and soundbites  facts don't matter to the media  	139
    A parallel with the invention of cameras. What a coincidence.      I got a 22 on my mac. Definitely going to try on different screens and in different light.    If we develop a strategy to prevent individuals from pressing the button, we could solve a lot of world problems. Temptation and the desire to screw someone over are just so appetizing.       I really like taxing negative externalities and efficient energy sources...but what about the private property? What about the harsh economic impact (specifically fewer jobs and expensive infrastructure?)  What about the environment being an bipartisan issue? etc. Does anyone had ideas on technological advances? or just out of the box whacky ideas? Anything!  Like photosynthesizing humans are a great answer.     Reddit, I'm curious? What do you think the answer to climate change. You don't need to know how to get there, but what is your answer? No need to be practical.   	7
 Considering you are doing it first time, I would suggest to go over this article: https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors  When it comes to pricing, it depends on your location, check competition, what is the scope of work and the most important is do you want to continue providing such service...once you know answers, defining price won't be a problem...good luck!           	4
    I completely disagree. Not to disregard your post, the creators have gone through much effort to maintain the physics of the world with the exception of bending which remains unexplained. (see: Function and mechanics of hot air balloons, submarines, gravity, properties of ice INCLUDING crystallization now in LoK) which mimics ours.  Air bisons are explained by bending (which remains unexplained but is not related to physics) and hence physics and the properties of every material up until this point are exactly the same as in our world.   I would like to hear the countless examples which you speak have been different from our physics. So far you only mentioned platinum (which I think is laziness on the part of the new writing team) and air bison flight, which can be explained by airbending which we know is unexplained (or rather spiritually explained).   not knowing engineering is no excuse for laziness in preproduction. someone on the writing staff knew something about basic high school chemistry.   	3
 Well while I was searching through YouTube I found a video of Robert Downey Jr's song "Man like me" and right away I tought: yup I have to learn how to play that song So I went to google and searched the chords and in ultimate guitar the song was missing some text so I was wondering if you guys could help me with the song? Just standart tuning guitar tabs here are the lyrics:  http://m.metrolyrics.com/man-like-me-lyrics-robert-downey-jr.html  And here is the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNaDzM9ETMA feature=youtube_gdata_player   Thank you!   Well I don't have money right now and the game is on sale so I would be very grateful if someone could buy me the game. Thanks in advance   I want it  	3
 No matter what country you come from, we can mostly all agree. EARTH, FUCK YEA!   people are applauding THIS pope, because he is the first one courageous enough to change those thoughts, which isn't that easy of a thing to do.   Bushmaster XM15, i got a magpul handguard, pistol grip, rear sight, and buttstock for it. Paid around 900$ for everything after mags and background check and all.      Oh shit they are the zombies!!! Its just worded very very well!   everyone!   didn't see that coming!   Are they cannibals? Or looking to steal food? Either way i like it!   I really like this story, probably one of the best 'zombie' stories ive read in a while   Thanks!   10/10 would crossbow again  	11

 I loved this book.  It was a little dry when it came to the science portions but overall extremely humorous and exciting.     Think of George Clooney but not as attractive.   Ya was the book kinda shallow? Yes.  Did it have flavor and some flair? Yes.  If he keeps that cycle going then hell I'd buy the sequel.   Ending to the devil is a part timer.    Russia isn't a country, it's a corporation.     I think they started out the show with that episode to plant the idea of a giant transmutation circle.   I think the opening to log horizon is pretty awesome as well as the ending to kill la kill.   What are you looking at smooth-skin?   I am reading it right now and I know exactly how you feel!   You should try tea, I don't like drinking coffee either.   The orange box.    What kinda phone do you have?    She wasn't going to even if you didn't forget the tip.    I absolutely love the song caravan.   Whooooooooo AMERICA!!!!   She was great in the west wing.    It looks like it has been sitting underwater for the last 10 years.  I like it, it's different.     Three of those knives cost over 200 bucks.  I wouldn't call that humble.     He was also in an episode of The West Wing.    The west wing.   Because we walked out of the cave.     Iroh- the last airbender   I love anime.  My friends think I'm weird but nothing else comes close in story telling for me.   Congratulations.  You corrected a figure of speech.  Douchebag.     I love that show.   It would only be for non-violent offenders.   Haven't you ever read a book that changed your life?   Why not?   Obviously there would be some conditions on what books qualify but the logic is sound.  The more you read, the sooner you can leave.   Then have the democratic congressmen stand with him and just leave the Republicans at the altar.     For every book they read and submit a book report they should get X amount of time shaved off of their time.     He should just do the state of the union on the steps of capital hill.  Speaking directly to the people not some asshole congressmen.     Skyrim.   I love that small one!   I don't know if ya'll would consider it anime but the credit music for the legend of korra always gets me a little raw.   I couldn't stand Rossiu from TTGL.  I thought he was a douche-bag.     Gta V, Sleeping dogs, The last of us.   Where can I place an order for the larger one?   2014   Gone girl was FANTASTIC! you're gonna like it.  	40
 Looks like dad might have lost something you're not aware of. His bandaging skills are bad ass. He's done this before clearly....  Edit: pressed save too early and missed something out.   Obvious mistake, is obvious....   Yeah blame the chain for not helping its disabled employee's more tbh. Totally their fault clearly haha. But again a 60 year old deaf lady who doesn't even attempt to lip read is kinda silly. And yes I'm aware that we should make changes for them and not the other way around but its the simple things that are taught to deaf children all around the world to help them overcome these things. So yeah she did it on purpose imo.   Not sure on this but I think like 99% of deaf people learn to lip read pretty damn well. Sounds like she was trolling you. Unless she was looking away from you through the entire situation which you said she wasn't. To be honest a badge reading I'm deaf does not prepare you for how to deal with the situation and that persons employers should be taking more steps to avoid this kind of thing. Totally not your fault. Although a little less laughing could have been avoided perhaps..... p.s. I'm from wales too woop.   I think you know why you got banned. You stated your self that you had been chat restricted more than once. Perhaps you should have changed your ways? No sympathy.   Lol no witch hunting and you post his stream. Think that's kinda the same thing, but hey helps us see who it is! This is all over reddit at the mo as well nothing new :( exploits galore lately...    I wouldn't say those stats are fantastic but the winrate is suggesting to me you got lucky.  	7
 that puddle is actually a portal to another dimension   for being able to save for gold. I gave you some well done OP   your name made me laugh...   what this person said. (I'm a fireman) also mostly we change them when approaching intersections, people get used to hearing the sirens so we change them to warn people when we are about to drive through intersections.   I'm always that guy   no this subreddit is /r/dadjokes   so today my bank account was hacked... I lost everything but the money in my home loan. I get the money back but it takes up to 45 days for the bank to do all the paperwork. so that leads me to my question. has anything like this happened to you? how did it all go?  Edit: had to edit it because I wrote this in the text box instead of the comments box   wait... he pooped on your front step? did you poop on his?   wow that's pretty crazy, glad it all worked out for you in the end       not going to lie it took me a couple of goes to find the mistake   someone that obviously needs the money to buy better robbing gear   we don't have time for leap years. pretty much every animal wants to kill us   Like the title says. But if you look at it that way pokemon is a pretty dark and twisted game. You also fight young children's pets and take all their money.   just started playing and i love the dialog! excellent game so far   https://ssl.redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/nicolas-cage-christmas-card---merry-nic/ https://ssl.redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/happy-holidays-bitch-breaking-bad-jesse/ https://ssl.redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/funny-love-you-card---mac-and-cheese/ I would give the Nicholas cage one to my brother as he loves him (actual man to man love) the breaking bad one to my sister, she loves the show and also is a bitch... and finally the mac and cheese one to my SO, she makes amazing mac and cheese   pretty sure if your being buried alive they wont let you take your shirt off to cover your face, most probably have hands tied   damn now every time I blink I see a dickbutt...   if one twin is born on February 28 and the other February 29 one twin could turn 100 while the other only turns 25...   you need to charge you phone   So like the title says. I wonder what some bad things some peoples pets have seen (Might end up NSFW)      Maybe a similar one. But no he is mine and legit picked him up today   Holy crap, yeah that's pretty crazy in itself   This is Zeus, he's my 14 week old Siberian husky. Today is the day I finally got to pic him up. So I thought I would show him to the world. Enjoy :)      Ok so everyone knows. I know you have to spread the branches out. My SO called out to me, saying that it looks nothing like the picture.(she didn't know) Should have said that before but have been busy trying to fix it after her Christmas tree failure.

She was on Copacabana beach.  She wrapped a Brazilian beach blanket around her hips.  She was wearing cutting edge sunglasses, too.                                                                                            	199

NNID spkeck805   Oh wow it changes to "On-fire"    Yeah I found it . it's nice.    whats that ? Can you buy it regularly or do you need to do a challenge or something?    Yeah, it's possible she's never worked with special ed kids before and therefore doesn't understand not to put a student in a trash can.   can confirm: am educator   I don't do good with the sniper weapons so I stay away from them. I do like the dynamo roller but its sooo slow lol   Yeah the aerospray is nasty. I've only lost two or three times with it in turf wars today. though in ranked, i dont do as well   411,038   Inkbrush. Yuck. Not a fan. Glad it worked for someone though!    I got mine to 14.0 (So Hawt) The Aerospray gun really is awesome for points.    Fur-Loaf   411,036   That's the thing. I didn't know what an amiibo was. I didn't know it was an actual physical toy thing you buy in a box and then scan on your gamepad. I bought this game through wii u virtual so I didn't buy the game physically or anything. So I was unaware you had to physically buy something to complete the 'extra' challenges.   Edit: why was this down voted?    I want hot dog-o   Edit: Bonus points if you know what movie this is from   You did yell about that joke. Relevant username.   The final boss was hard enough I dunno how I would beat him with a roller lol   Wow. I didn't know Splatoon was so popular. I guess Splatoon really helped the Wii U come into prominence again lol.    No I just saw people in game with these awesome outfits and stuff and wanted them for myself. So I though..maybe I have to beat single player. So I beat single player and got the sweet aerospray gold weapon which upped my scores in turf war considerably about by 6-700 a round I was getting about 1100 on avg now im getting around 1600 with that thing, and then the Gold Roller  But I want that head that DJ Octavio is wearing and I read online you have to do the amiibo challenges, so I looked how to actually do the challenges but it doesnt say anywhere online. It just says there are challenges so I was confused.   So I have to buy a physical toy and scan the box.    No. I do not. I was unaware you had to do that.    Ohhh...so you have to go a store and buy an amiibo? Does Best Buy have them?    No I am not joking.  I don't know what you mean by lack of stock joke . I didnt' know you had to actually go out somewhere and buy it in real life.    I defeated Hero Mode (single player) on Splatoon for the first time, all 27 levels and the main boss. Now I want to get that samurai hat and I know you get it from one of the challenges, but how do I 'buy' the amiibo inklings to do the challenges? Where do I go?    You're fired bud. I'm sorry.    The Undertaker isn't random if you see that #2 is "List of WWE Wrestler's"    410,058   410,056  US women beat Colombia 2-0. Horrid offense from US though.    410,041   and i sniped a palindrome :) But yeah he jumped in there towards the middle of 950    410,039   yah quality counting. 410,000 and 409,098 were some of the better counts I've seen.    nice man! congrats!    409,914  servers busssyyy. its all yours nobreadtsicks   409,904  sniping palindrome!!!!   /r/riskyclicks   409,600   409,592   409,590   '   409,211  im gonna go and eat dinner. nice counting with you again.          I lost 15 straight at one point. It was just pathetic. I tried everything, but my teammates kept going over to their side to try to kill them when they respawned....which wasn't working so it left me and one other teammate to try and get the splatzone which doesnt work when its 3 on 2 or 3 on 1.   If you're the type of player that goes over to the enemy side during splatzone please stop. Every time you do we end up losing to the Japanese players and their god damn sniping machines.    I feel like this would be harder to produce than regular voice acting.    I need some friends. My name is is spkeck805 NNID. And my nickname is "American" ....lol because I play with Japanese all the time I figured I'd let them know I'm not Japanese. haha.   Will some people add me?    Is there a way to be on your friend's team instead of it randomly placing you against your friend or on their team?   	134
 Werewolf!   I was by myself. I just couldn't understand what I was watching. Maybe I should rewatch it.   I really am sorry. I'm just the worst person alive.       It certainly does fit the show.   You're right, after sitting through the whole series, I shouldn't have been surprised.   I have no one to blame but myself.   Yes - this is it. It was awful, just...awful   I've run naked through traffic with my eyes closed TONS of times and I have only been hit once. Take THAT science.   I just didn't believe that then aliens would be convinced to leave by that speech. Aside from that, I loved it.   God that movie fills me with rage.    Life Is Beautiful. That film me broke me.   You didn't like Avengers?   I feel so embarrassed how disturbing I found those suicides    You think Goodfellas is a bad movie????   For me, I love Bisons 'Tuesday' speech in Street Fighter. So camp. So evil.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlhOUyy4wbs   I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to SPEED around the city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called... http://www.tshirtlaundry.com/assets/images/photos/Speed2-14-2012-2.jpg   But everyone was too scared to tell him to his face   I don't know the context of his remarks but, based on what I know about Smith, he's talking about mean spirited critics and internet haters.  Constructive criticism, honest feedback and a strong editorial hand provide the difference between a professional novel and then inane ramblings of a wannabe writer.    I had the same problem with jeans from another shop. I was wearing them too low.   ...of domestic abuse and unrepentant attackers?    The top comment is a link to a poster for the 1986 cartoon. All of the positive comments under that relate to that movie, not the Bay films.   I have a connection to the early 80's film and had a knee jerk reaction to her having straight hair in 99.      Skyfall: [](#s "Silva achieved his goal of killing M. The only difference is that more people died because of Bond's involvement.")   This would be my pick.   That's the one! It wasn't a great movie but it stuck in my head for some reason.   IF you pay, they'll want more. If you refuse to pay, they'll expose you.  The best idea would be to waste their time. Slow down the process. Ask them questions about Western Union. Make excuses. Act confused.   There is a chance they will just expose you anyway but the scammer knows he can only expose you once and so will be unlikely to give up on you if he just thinks you're incompetent.      Aside from scam baiting them, there isn't a lot you can do. Depending on the country of origin, scam baiting CAN be effective in slowing down the swindlers.  If the scam came from Nigeria, chances are it's linked to organised time and all you'd be doing is wasting the time of some low level wage slave.  If the scam came from Ghana then you'd be dealing with a sole trader whose time is precious and who can't afford to waste time on red herrings and dead ends.   Realistically, the best thing you and your friend can do is tell the story to as many people as possible. The more people who know, the harder it is for the scammers.   I have.

A group of university students accidentally kill a girl and dispose of the body. One of the groups gets arrested that night for stealing a car that was involved in the girl's death. The rest of the group let him go to prison for the car theft.  Years later, he gets out of prison and begins tormenting the group with what they did, threatening their now perfect lives.   At the end of the movie  [spoiler](/s "the tormenter forces the group to help dig up the girl's body. Thinking he is about to expose them all they kill the man. They then discover the shallow grave actually contains a dummer. They then find out the girl was never murdered and that the death was an elaborate prank. He never told them it was a prank because they let him go to jail for the car theft. ")   That's the only thing left to replace. Hopefully it won't come to that!   Both!

Last Action Hero, while a fun movie was panned at the time for being endemic of the bloated budget, mindless action movies of the time. Ironically, it was criticised for being the very kind of film it was trying to parody.  The project was passed from director to director and screenwriter to screenwriter taking on comedy, action and fantasy elements as it went. One minute the film is a sad tale about a boy who worships the movie, the next a rollicking adventure adventure and then suddenly a child gets thrown to his death off a building. And oh look, an animated cat.  The studio just kept throwing money and resources at the movie trying to make it into the summer blockbuster it could never be.  And then Jurassic Park was released in the same week and the whole thing fell apart. The movie, which isn't awful, was humiliated by the success of both Spielburg's film and Sleepless in Seattle.

 Bronze Age low fantasy?   do gritty near-future sci fi next.   Yep, that's pretty crunchy.   What you can do, is play a one-shot in Fate, or AW/DW. Then when you go to Traveller, it'll feel plenty crunchy.  Fate is absolutely not crunchy enough for me. Every time I've played it, I've disliked it. However, I use the rules from Fate to lighten up more crunchy games, and I actually love some of the concepts in it.  If you are looking for crunchy, I highly recommend Iron Kingdoms RPG, or any of the Warhammer40k Roleplay games (my favorite is Rogue Trader, but it's definitely not everyone's favorite). Rogue Trader could actually probably serve you pretty well for whatever you were planning to do with Traveller, too.   I think Numenera is the crunchiest of the rules-light games.   I add rules from Numenera to Fate Core to increase the level of crunch. And walnuts for chocolate chip cookies.   I am super curious as to what you normally play, and what you consider to be complex.   Warlock is a starting career, and you essentially take all your starting classes *at the same time*. A starting character Bloodweaver/Circle Warlock would start with an ARC of 2 unless you raise it with your stat increases.   I expect we will see these exact same boxes again. They used them to boost interest in the game and get people into new factions, and they will probably let that ride for a while. In a year or two, if they have a bit of a slump (or even if they suspect one), they will probably do another limited release of these same boxes. They don't need to do new stuff in the boxes because the majority of people didn't buy every box they would ever want, and it still presents the same value to new players. Also, these boxes were very much "core" lists, with almost no overlap with battleboxes.    If you can get a hold of one of the all-in-one army boxes, those are a great start.   The pyschologists probably noticed it right away.   I think that's a perfectly fine idea.   If it was me (and I may do this if I buy him, since I run pirates all the time), I'd see if I could just cut his hat off, and sculpt a tricorn out of green stuff. Then you could just paint him with a "piratey" theme and he'd be good to go.  There's seriously as many ways to do it as there are people who could do it.     I'm going to second Iron Kingdoms. It can handle extremely tactical combat, and has probably the fastest combats of the rules heavy games out there.   You can check it out for free [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery).   It's by far my favorite non-narrative style combat system.   Are you looking for a tournament legal conversion? If so, that's going to be hard to get it looking like the exclusive one, as you need 50%+ of the original model, and they are actually quite a bit different (the only thing that's really even similar is the gas mask and the grenades).   Now, if you aren't worried about it being tourney legal, it's not at all hard to put a gas mask on a pirate mini and give him a few grenades.  It all depends on what you are looking for.  *edit: If all you are looking for is the normal gorman mini with a pirate hat, that's pretty easy to do.   I like them, but I prefer to get them randomly.   check out /r/LFG   It's a subreddit specifically for finding games to play in, and it isn't half bad.   Technically you are both right. For the sake of the fact that he's the one who used the word first, based on his definition, your system is not balanced. There is nothing wrong with that if that's what you like.   Some people think games need to be balanced in certain ways, others don't. Some people like point buy, some people like randomly rolled. It's just a preference thing.  Basically, there are two types of one-armed men. One type will insist you tie one of your hands behind your back to make it a fair fight (and will usually still bitch about fairness if they lose, and generally cry some more like a little baby). The other type will kick your ass with just his one arm, and be all the more of a badass for it.  Personally, I think the kind of balance he is talking about makes for a terrible game (D D4e, looking at you here). That kind of balance really only matters in competitive adversarial games. Which to me, aren't roleplaying games. GMs aren't the bad guy, they just decide what the bad guy does. The other players aren't your competition, they are your friends. Or at least, that's how I roll.  Your game sounds like fun, and already I'm interested in hearing more.   Or maybe a sword with, like, [a chainsaw along one edge](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/2/2d/Titus_Chainsword.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130613180716).   Wow, someone beat me to an IKRPG recommendation. I'm impressed.  Here's some free quickstart guides for IKRPG: [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery)   [This](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/introduction-to-the-iron-kingdoms) is a pretty decent way to get started. Or if you are more of a visual learner [this](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?q=warmachine+iron+kingdoms offset=0) or [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=warmachine+iron+kingdoms biw=1329 bih=927 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=vioxVfzAGc62yASj74DoCQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) might be better. [This](http://ironkingdoms.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) isn't terrible, but there's not much there.   Every game has it's problems. IKRPG wins out for me because of how fast combat goes in such a tactical crunchy-rules game.    I skipped any that had already been mentioned, especially if I don't have a lot of experience with them. Namely, hackmaster, rolemaster, and gurps.   You rang?   I love complex games. I like having rules for everything, and then just ignoring them if I don't need them at the moment.   [Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-core-rules) is a great complex game (quick start rules [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery)). It is built from the Warmachine wargame rules (which was built from D D3e). When I run a fantasy game, I run IKRPG. One of the things that it does well over a lot of other complex games is that combat is still really quick (mostly because nothing lives past 2 or 3 rounds). It's a dynamic and deadly system that is great for people who love strategy who want a great fantasy game. Also, the new standalone expansion has probably the [best starter box of all time](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit).   Another great complex game is the **Warhammer40k Roleplay** series (*Dark Haresy II* is newest, though my favorite is still *Rogue Trader*). The WH40k universe is so rich and complex that it really needs a complex rules system to do it justice. Hundreds and hundreds of weapon and armor options, table after table after table of injury results, hundreds of spaceship options, dozens of character origin options, a robust skill list... there is enough crunch here to choke a heretic. It's a little rigid, and I have some home-rules that loosen it up a bit, but it also has the structure of a wargame for its roots, and combat is deliciously strategic, deadly, and lots of fun. Combats tend to be longer than IKRPG games, and that's something that is pretty common with complex games, but it's not horrible, and they are definitely fun and interesting combats, with lots of options.   **Dungeons and Dragons** has two editions that I would count as complex, 3.5/PF and 4e. For me, they both have the same problem, and that is that combat takes too long, and gets pretty boring. There are other things I could say about them, but I'm not going to fight an Edition Wars battle here.  *Special mention*: There are several games that I actually don't think are very complex, but that are somewhat tricky to learn. Mostly you just need someone who already knows how to play to run it for you, but it's still enough to get mentioned.  **Eclipse Phase**: Great setting, strangely complex (and maybe just a smidge poorly organized) rules. Available for free, which means you can check it out before you invest.  new **Star Wars** (Edge of the Empire, etc.): I actually consider the system itself to be pretty simple, but the dice are kind of crazy. All the complexity lies in interpreting the funky dice, which allows the game to play like a rules-lite game.   **Burning Wheel**: I can't even say much (I just can't even). I bought the book, tried to understand it, and I can't do it. It's complex, but not in any way that any other game is. I don't even know. From what I've heard, it's actually really good though.  **Savage Worlds**: This is deceptively complex. It tries to pretend like it's a simple game, but it has so many different options and bits and pieces and moving parts that it's hard to take it all in at first. Great system though, and it can really play any style of "high action" pulpy sort of game. I'll always have it just for *Deadlands*.  **BRP**, **CoC**, **RQ**, etc: I've played a few of these games, and they are are pretty complex, but they make so much sense that it doesn't take much to learn them. CoC is probably the most popular of them all.   edited for formatting  edit2:  **Super Special Bonus Round!** I forgot to mention **Mutants   Masterminds**. Hundreds and hundreds of options that allow you to custom design any imaginable character. On top of that, the combat rules are at least as complex as any d20 game.   also **Shadowrun**. Very complex, and it works well for the setting.    Usually after the first few times they mess up, and suffer the consequences, they get the idea. If not, they just aren't going to get it, and you may as well plan accordingly.   In the theme of recommending you buy stuff that comes with minis instead of buying minis by themselves, I highly recommend the new [Iron Kingdoms Unleashed Adventure Kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). You can get it for about $35, and it has 14 minis, which makes them about $2.50 each.  Also,   Unfortunately I don't have any friends to play wargames with...  hit me right in the feels, whydontcha? I highly recommend going to your local gaming store (sometimes they are disguised as comic book stores). If you ask, they probably have a night during the week where they do tabletop games (even if it's just Pathfinder or D D5e). Once you find your local wargamers, you can let them know you want to start playing, and they'll try to push their product on you.   I'll recommend Stars Without Number for you. It's simple, can use a grid well, and has a lot of amazing features that you won't find elsewhere.   Also, a possible good stepping stone into tabletop games would be some wargames. Something like [Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) would be a great way to get used to playing tabletops, and you could go from there to something like Stars Without Number. Plus then you get to use all those great minis and terrain for your rpg!    [Some potential inspiration](https://miniarmyhugetimesink.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/holy-rusted-metal/) for you.   Not only that, but we have probably the [single best starter box ever made now.](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit)   I use them, but I put foam in them. They aren't bad, but it's a really decent cheap option.   I was like, "Why would anyone want to go through all that hassle just to say the characters are eating and sleeping?", but then I saw the "GURPS" tag, and I needed no further explanation.   Have you seen the Cypher system of Numenera/The Strange? That's almost exactly what you just described.   I get to imagine a world. A special place I've created in my mind. Unlike writing about it, where you can let people *see* your world, you actually let people *be* in your world. They can interact with it, respond to it, and change it. It becomes something more because of their contribution. Together, you become a story-telling team. Their lives in your world will live on in all your memories.   It becomes real. The judgments you make will define the laws of your world. The more consistent you are, the more it will become a real place in the players mind, and not just decoration draped over a dice game.   You are also the conduit of fun for the group. Through you, fighting and arguing turns into adventure. You can turn sadness and bitterness into growth. Selfishness and spite become mystery. You can make the weak feel strong, and the ordinary feel extraordinary. You can make people fear or hope, laugh or cry.   Basically, everyone should try it so they can feel [like a boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c).   Also, before anyone else beats me to it, I want to play [Devil's advocate](http://imgur.com/gallery/9Huvs) a minute.   It's the GM's job to keep the game world consistent. Part of that job is making judgement calls on what the player's can and can't do (or what their odds are). They aren't perfect, and they are trying to weigh their decision based on the written rules (written by some other imperfect schmuck), the desires of each player (each one probably different from the other), his understanding of physics (not even real physics, but fake physics), his personal preferences, and his (probably constantly changing) vision of an imaginary world. It's a lot of responsibility, and he probably deserves some slack. Not all the calls he makes are going to be the right ones. If he's not making them the way you'd like them enough for you to have fun, then just don't play in his game, and try to find someone who does. Always feel free to discuss your opinion with your GM, though (though sometimes you should wait till after the game).  Basically, this post is advice for the player, the first post is advice for the GM.    I've had one or two try, but in a game where how well you do is based on how cool/fun what you are trying to do is, there's not really any need (or benefit) from trying to "game the system". Honestly I can't think of anyone who successfully "got one over on me" or anything like that, and I've played with some crafty (read: pain-in-the-ass) players.  edit: I will say though, it does take a bit of trust between me and my players. I don't have them keep track of things like inventory or ammunition, which lets them have what they need when they need it... until they don't. Basically when I think it'd be cool/fun to have their shit *not* work, I get the same ability to say "You are out of bullets" or "They've traced your call, and you're not sure how". I don't use things like, "You, a highly trained spy, was a total idiot and butt dialed them using your real phone" though, everything I say and decision I make has a reason. If it's likely you used a burner phone, and they tracked you down anyway, there is [something fucky going on](http://imgur.com/r/gifs/IgU4Y), like they have a mole in your group, or they have a super-hacker with ties to the NSA, or they slipped a tracker or bug on your while you were there.    I force my players to do this, and I do it all the time, with no limits and no checks. I get tired of great ideas thrown out because someone didn't think of it on the spot. Especially with people newer to gaming, but even with old pros. That's how you get games where people decide what to do based on what's on their sheet (I attack the guy with my sword), instead of doing what roleplaying is all about (I throw my sword at the rope holding the chandelier before jumping onto and riding it into the three guys on the floor below).   To the asshole GMs who are like, "Should have thought of that before" "That's lazy roleplaying" "Blah, blah, blah", guess what? You aren't perfect. *It is 10000% impossible for you to convey every detail of your fictional world to them all time.* They don't have the advantage that their characters have of actually being there. I'm going to blindfold you, put earplugs in your ears, plug your nose, and shoot you full of drugs before throwing you in an unfamiliar foreign country. We'll see how well you do. They can't see, they can't hear, they can't smell, taste, touch, or anything of your world. All they can do is ask you what's there, and imagine it based on your shit description. And yeah, your description is shit. If it wasn't, you'd be so busy making millions off your best selling novels you wouldn't have time for gaming anymore.   *All of that*, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that people are not their characters yet (don't worry, I'm about to). I am not a spy. I am not a warrior. I am not a wizard. I am not a hacker. I am not a rogue. Unless I am playing a damn fine looking tabletop gamer, or a charming anthropologist, I am not my fucking khakis (I mean characters). *Excuuuuuuuuse me* if I don't think of something a *real* spy would think of *before* I'm even in a situation they might be in (while having only the very limited knowledge of what's going on of being completely blind/deaf/numb with only your pretty vague description to help me out).   Come on, son.   Wrong community, mate.   I don't know. I've been here a while, and it's honestly like we all have what we need. There are just a handful of unclear/confusing rules, and once those are cleared up people can just play.   Weekly posts would be pretty cool, I think. Statting out Warmachine/Hordes stuff probably is less productive than the other idea though.  *edited to make my sentence make sense.   You *say* "Pathfinder", but I'm just going to pretend you are saying IKRPG.  Nice painting.   Ha ha, this from the guy who's arguing semantics about a board game.    Ageist.   Lol, j/k. You kids have fun.   Homebrew is just another word for home-made.  What you meant to say, was how you don't get why they are saying "game", when they mean "setting", since they could very easily have used the term "home-made" instead of "homebrew" and it wouldn't have changed anything.  To that, [you are kinda right](http://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png). Except that "homebrew game" can mean a game that **is** homebrew, *or* it could mean a game that **contains** homebrew, or even just a game loosely associated with homebrew.  There is no need to "qualify" as a homebrew game, because there isn't an RPG Association that we pay dues to that will cite us for improperly labeling our games (if you *do* run such an organization, then I'm wrong, and you should have mentioned it in your post). Don't use being a grognard as an excuse to be an elitist prick. It makes the rest of the old guard look bad.    Let's not forget [First Mate Hawk](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/mkiihawk) who gives them (essentially) fearless and weapon master, and then their banker? [Lord Rockbottom](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/mkiirockbottom), gives them a bunch of great stuff.    Not only do I not use music, I usually get annoyed whenever someone else does. It rarely adds much to the ambiance, and usually ends up making it hard to hear what people are saying. The only time I thought it worked okay was when someone put on the sound of a crackling fire when we were in a tavern.   	41
 yes, jailbreak with a restored OS   Actually, it's not that bad for general stuff. It's capable of handling mail, multiple safari tabs, pages, iTunes.    it might have happened, but since they were bacteria they didn't knew what was happening   Springtomize does the job ;)   I don't know either, it was an honest question. maybe because I'm talking about the accident ..   You got me. The 13-inch retina is well priced and there are other notebooks with inferior performance with higher prices. I'm looking for the 15'', it's the size I'm used to. I like the MacBook but it's only for general usage, I hate the screen on the air ...    I'm not saying they're not, I'm saying Apple could sell a lot more of them and it's hard to justify the price. I have an iPhone 6, sure it was expensive and I'm 100% satisfied, I know the Apple ecosystem   I updated and couldn't get past 60%, I think you should restore    It's impossible to master feminism    And if you don't bring a girl to your condom then ... Okay I've gone too far    Sure. His life was dedicated to the people, trying to teach them about the environment    Macs are expensive, we all know that. But in Europe they're crazy expensive and in February or March the prices increased 300 due to the U.S. Dollar. My thinking is that apple would sell a ton of MacBooks if they were 300-500 cheaper. The first thing I hear people talking about macs are how expensive they are. Then 15" for example starts at 2300. Sure with student discount it costs 2.100 but it's still ludicrous. If it was 1800 I'd be all over it.   yeah it is .. but when it's the only option .. gotta do it   how do you know he was then ? Have you ever asked him?    if it does a sound and no one hears it, does it count as a sound ?   he wasn't thinking about the environment :D    iPhone 6 here, WiFi way better in 8.4 than on 8.1. No issues so far   Try another USB port, worked for me   It's becoming habit in most european countries. People must have a reusable plastic bag. Unfortunately, many people don't understand these new habits ..    My list of essentials include: CCSettings Winterboard Sprintomize Apex 2 SwipeSelection A great theme I found and i'm in love with is "1ONE"   Since they were already updated this year most people don't think we will see another refresh. However, I believe there's a chance we'll see a refresh probably in October in the iPad event. Thunderbolt 3, Skylake CPU   the coral reef is being destroyed in the urge to get tin from the ground to feed the western world   what do you mean by safe ?   the biggest drawback to a student are the (missing) USB ports    mine was too !   did you noticed that El Capitan is in Beta ? :D   They're being updated.   Ahah, it's a possibility since no one knows    There are things in this world that aren't meant to be understood    I don't know if it exists but you can add a shortcut to the compass app in the lock screen    Deleting stock apps ? Never heard of such thing .. I guess you'll have to restore    You can remove the carrier and use Zeppelin with an icon of a plane    My bet is it'll be 449,99   So, if you find a shoe is the same as not finding  any    I don't know if I'm allowed to say this but just torrent them   Probably, Michael wouldn't go to England just to do a lap    I guess you'll never know. They always suggest to restore before jailbreaking    June was the hottest  month in 10 years !   Since his accident who was the STIG ?   There's a Panamera, don't look !    Where's Hammond?     Oh my bad then .. If the phone is only 2 weeks old you have to take it to an Apple Store    I also want to know, the stock reminders app takes ages to create a reminder with a specific time. I give checkmark2 a try and it was better but Im back at square one.   yes ! the best thing is I left it at night with 100% and Wi-Fi enabled. In the morning, it never has less than 97%, and I have a lot of notifications from several apps   haev you tested the earpiece in another phone/device ?   iPhone 6 here, updated from 8.1. Definitely an improvement   i had similiar issues and i restored and it's fine now   I think at this point everyone know the issues the world has but they think the real problems won't be faced by them. Instead, they'll be faced by their grandchildren   we just have to understand there are too many people on earth .. just saying   I think solar energy is the future .. just need to make it more efficient  	50

 PSWii60, though I didn't get the 360 until really late.   Put me down for "Sony Fanboy"...  I had/have a PlayStation, PS1, PS2, PS3, PSP, Vita, and PS4.  Plus a VAIO laptop and the Playstation 3D display.   Nope. There is a frame  or two of the blade touching the skin of her belly, which is enough to fix in the idea that you saw the knife penetrate the body. It never did on camera.  Hitchcock was a fucking master of cinematography.    Could I get in trouble for that?  Little bit, probably.   There is Direct Deposit, but a lot of bosses hate using it for some stupid reason.   I never saw it, but people remember things wrong sometimes.   Many people swear they saw the girl get stabbed in Psycho, even though Hitchcock never showed the penetration of the knife.  I'm not saying this is the case here, but they *might* have remembered a referenced action without having seen it.   I see $918 total, and that tells me that pirates probably wouldn't even bother uploading it.   Well, Cash is still King, but checks between trusted parties are not a bad thing.  But, if you *don't* have a relationship, you don't take a check.   It is becoming less and less necessary, but many businesses here still prefer to use paper checks.   You can get to work on making that mod, for it says in the good book...  OP will surely deliver.   Meant you.  I assumed that you meant to use cocaine or weed to get out of your money troubles. Because snorting cocaine will not help that at all.   While you are clearly joking, it may be the right movie.  There is a scene where Doc has to deliver a baby (which would qualify as doing stuff to the vagina).   In regard to the real world, we have a number of competing companies, including CPL and TXU. And they do advertise.   I got the joke, but there were so many people ducking the pope's dick, it was like they forgot that he can't run.    Thankfully, it is mostly political idiots that claim global warming will cause any sort of short term flooding situation...  But it should be noted that according the the US Geological Survey, we are in an expected period of warming, which in previous Epochs have caused sea levels to rise up to 20 meters beyond the current levels. Soon, in that context could be 1000 years.  Would a 20 meter rise in sea level be devestating to a low-lying city, like New Orleans? Yes. Beyond yes.  Can we do anything about it? No. We can only move away from the shores.  It is mostly alarmists that make specific claims about short term effects of global warming. But that warming is happening, with or without us. When the glaciers have finally melted, then the Earth starts to bounce back and cool off again, and in about 20,000 years or so, our descendants (should they still be around) will be complaining how their technologies are causing more and more ice to form.   Easy there, Satan.   Bot dropped the ball...  Exegesis (/ksdiss/; from the Greek  from  'to lead out') is a critical explanation or interpretation of a text, particularly a religious text.   I think being anti-abortion is much more reasonable than being anti-gay.  Gay people don't *usually* kill babies. ("Usually", because someone will prove me wrong if I make that an absolute statement).  But abortion *usually* kills unborn children, with the only real question is when it is considered a child.   I'm sorry, but the scientists that claim stupid shit like "we are going to be flooded by melting ice caps within 20 years" lose all credibility as scientists.  The climate change issue is political. The people calling for climate change reform are the ones making it political.  Seriously, you want to get the rank and file republicans to take "green initiatives"? Stop fucking calling at a green initiative! Talk about how much money can be saved if X technology is used over Y. Talk about how renewable energies can be harnessed. Talk about how the fossil fuels will run out, and we'll have to come up with something for *that* reason.  Leave the craziness at home.   And doing the exact opposite.   I'm surprised no one mentioned that fact that Francis can never be the VP.   Because it is a good question.  In this case, if the killings were racially motivated (as it seems they are), then he killed the kids because he hates blacks. Old or young, it doesn't matter.  If there is a different motivation, then there could be any number of reasons why he would attack children.  The scary part about all this is that he attacked a church.  I'm not religious, but when people go to church, they expect to be safe. Even when the sex scandals were at their peak, parents felt save with their children there. It is a sanctuary, in much more than the religious sense. People like this violate that basic security.   They should use that with any check size and catch people that try to avoid the system.   Do not send the money.  Leave the money in your account and contact the FBI for further investigation. Tell them that you stupidly cashed a cashiers check and they want you to send the money elsewhere.  Have no further contact with the scammer.   I think he meant selling it, not smoking it.   My friend, I feel you completely. I'm much in the same boat.  Going over to fast food and retail is a pay raise, and the bosses here refuse to understand that.   I don't know why, but I like heroes that shift around their powers. They are simultaneously able to handle anything, yet still end up with vulnerability.   No, not a joke.  Clickbait.  We all were hoping to see the Dark Knight in place of Cloud's figure.   That's what kills me... ^^^^a ^^^^knife ^^^^to ^^^^the ^^^^chest...  Civil disobedience is where you break the law to protest the law.  You can and will be arrested for an act of civil disobedience, the difference will be how the public, jury, and media will see it.  Woman walks around without a top? She'll be given at best a fine, and we'll all talk about letting women go topless.  Black people sit at a restaurant counter where the owner only serves whites? They're heroes (but will still probably be in jail for it).  Kill a man because you think it's your right to kill a man? You'll probably be committed to an institute for the Criminally Insane.   I imagine a lot of deck swabbing.   No one anymore, thanks to the razor blade scare.  They used to give out candied apples, popcorn balls, or other handmade candies.  The scare was probably encouraged by the Mars company.    That is an interesting formation.  Pulling other ants to help pull the load implies a basic understanding of tool use. (If I want to help pull on this object, I can pull on something attached to it, instead of pulling on the object itself.)   My vote is for having some fun on camera...  ... as a magician's assistant.   That's racist.   Yeah, they definitely made Bon-Bon, er... Sweetie Drops seem to be in that kind of a relationship with Lyra.   Just where are you going to get a *whole* bitcoin?    How do you not know these things before you have sex with her?   Actually... gravity is a force. What we think of as the rules which govern how gravity is exerted is a theory.  Evolution is a fact. The understanding of how evolution occurs and the path it took to reach mankind is a theory.  A theory is not a guess. It is an educated framework that may or may not include guesses.   To give actual information on the bus system...  The buses here run between 30 and 60 minutes between buses during the week, covering the vast majority of the city with 1-2 transfers.  Bus routes run from 6ish to 9ish, with some outliers.  Sunday, you may as well take a cab. Half of the routes don't run, and many run as far as 90 minutes apart.  Seriously, as someone who doesn't drive, if you can drive - do it.  As for the issue of the livability in the city, rent will be a minimum of $525 for most places, upwards of $1000 or more in others. If you make anywhere near minimum wage ($10.00/hr or less), you will need a roommate or second earner.   Uber is here, man.   This is true. And the sheer number of accidents that occur due to one fault or another is proof of that.  Computer errors and glitches, brake failures... I even heard of some cars accelerating on their own.  The point is that no matter what we do to remove humans from the driving equation, human error will still play one of the biggest parts in fatal crashes.   I'm sure things will go just fine. The last thing she needs is worry.   No, it's a valid question if you don't know much about the precedure. Don't feel bad.   As long as the dental surgeon and anesthesiologist did everything properly, and the anesthetic was not defective, there is no liability for the death.  It's just a freak occurance, and would be covered by life insurance as an accident.   The good news is that the condition this poor girl was stricken with is relatively rare. There is little need to worry.  One thing we can do to prevent this is to only get wisdom teeth extractions if it is medically necessary.    According to the article, she in fact had complications from the anesthesia, which activated an undiagnosed heart condition and caused a stroke - like event.  She died a week later.   Infection or complications from anesthesia.    The previous versions of MicroSD cards, that is Floppy disks and SD cards, tended to have Read Only switches.   I will say this. The best thing to come out thanks to belief in Adam and Eve is the Mormon Church's genealogical studies.    Well, part of the thing is that the Pope is still human.  He may be the chosen representative of God to them, but that doesn't mean every opinion comes directly from Him.  The Pope never said "God said that Global Warming was real." He said "Global Warming is real."  And there is a difference, especially to a believer. But even as a nonbeliever, one is an official declaration, and one is a personal opinion.   That's just how I was always told about it.  Apparently, it's a rule of thumb, born of the interpretation that one should stop at the sign or light before executing the turn    You are supposed to stop for at least a 3 count.   Honestly, self-driving cars will not give a shit about their passengers.  These aren't complex intelligences. They will consider only what they are programmed to consider.   The biggest issue with self-driving cars will still be human error.  Manual override can be misused, if it is available (and it surely would be). Kids can do stupid things like vandalize sensors or toss objects out on the highway. Users can neglect upgrades because they think they don't need it, or worse out of paranoid fears. Programmers mess up a single character while programming, leading to malfunction...   I was going to guess Jon Voight.   In regard to the Natural Selection aspect, to put it simply, men and women have roughly an equal chance of surviving to the point of birthing a child, coupled by the fact that the nature of gender genetics gives a 50% chance of having a male child.  To make that mythical 100-1 ratio, there would need to be extra genes that suppress the Y chromosome, and make men into women.   No, even little shits like this don't need killing.   But his shirt says he's a thug.   not /s   The scary part of it is the fact that Eugenics was advocated heavily in the United States (It's actually where Hitler got the idea), and that the only reason we didn't gas people is that no one had that right combination of desire and ability to do so.   If you don't mind defecting, you should do at least one with "Intel Inside"   Into what opiates they are prescribing, and to whom they are being prescribed.*   I can't imagine how hard it is to replace a custom guitar on short notice.  Plus, insurance might cover the replacement of the original, but might not pay for the one used temporarily.  If these guys were bigger, they could easily sell off the "loaner", maybe even for more than they paid for it, but that's still a lot of money to hold in limbo.  I only wish I could do something to help, even if it is just loaning my Bullet out for the "cost" of an autograph and maybe a restringing (if they needed to).  If they post for help in Austin-centric boards, they might get similar offers to help.  Edit - Note, while I am serious about lending my guitar, I'm in Corpus,  not Austin.   You have a point there.  For that price, I am assuming it is a limited edition, which will keep it from being too many people.   Why do collectors want it?  Because it is unique.  If you want something one-of-a-kind that is show accurate, I can sell you my art piece.   Regarding the Big 3, I would put it this way.  Rule 1: Show, don't tell, but have your characters see, not say.  Dialogue is great for showing a character's emotion, but poor for world-building. Don't have the characters talk about how bleak the landscape is, show them in the remainder of the paragraphs. (Example: Lord of the Rings)  Rule 2: If you can not write about what you know, then know about what you write.  You probably don't know what it feels like to fling fireballs at a rampaging werewolf, because it can't happen. So, you have to think about and understand the effects in the context of your own world. If you can understand how it works in your world, you can explain it to others. (Example: Eragon)  Rule 3: Always have a sympathetic character for the reader to relate to, even if they don't like him very much.  Your main character, or someone in his entourage, must be someone the reader can sink into. They can be the most horrible person in the universe, but the reader will need to understand, at some point, the motivations of the character. The Why of his evil. If you can not show that from the perspective of the main character, shift the perspective to his Companion. (Examples: Doctor Who/Sherlock Holmes)   I absolutely love their Peanut Butter Sundaes.   No, from [Stan Smith](http://www.hulu.com/watch/16820)   http://www.hulu.com/watch/16820   It probably depends on how big the standard page is...  But if the 300 page novel is no good, people are far more likely to stop reading.   It is also able to be used as a noun. And a verb, if you try hard enough.  English is fucked up.   Honestly, I'm not familiar with the levels of payout on Amazon, like many of my interests, I'm more of a hobbyist than an expert, and think of myself as a better editor than author.  But, I think it still boils down to the number of readers being the most important factor.  Based on my reading of the new policy, if one person reads 1 page, you'll get 1 share of the earnings from the monthly fund, no matter what.   In general, yes.  But if one were to write 20 page long short stories, most people that start it will finish it, regardless of quality. 1,000,000 people means 20,000,000 pages read per story.  If he writes 10 short stories in the time it takes a novelist to write 300 pages, and 1,000,000 people download each of them, the short story author gets 200,000,000 shares, and the novelist might get 300,000,000 if he did well enough that every finished the book.   Ultimately it's not based on how big your book is, but how many individual pages are read.  So, if you write a 10,000 page series that is downloaded 1,000,000 times, but people universally get sick of reading it after 10 pages (like if it became a viral sensation for how horrible it is), you get paid for 10,000,000 pages.  If you write a 200 page novel that is read in its entirety by 500,000 people, you get paid for 100,000,000 pages.   It may have been even more innocent.  Guy supposes that the deaths are caused by drinking from certain wells, I don't believe it, but let's check it out anyway.   Assuming they even *have* the gold in the first place.   Aw... seems to be no love for Eobard.   Ultimately, they could have still appropriated it for the Emerald fight, because it is just used as a Game Flag, anyway.   Booster (unknown intended effect) and Law (Coin Toss and Throw on one Materia) are the two big ones.  Underwater Breath is the other big mystery, which was put into the Japanese release before they came up with a use for it with the Emerald Weapon fight. Ironically, the broken Underwater Breath still exists in the game data, and they made a new Underwater Materia for the EW fight.   Really it's just a code-word for "we fudged some of this stuff anyway"  For example, black holes don't *actually* have infinite density, they have **indefinite** density.  Basically, once the event horizon exists outside of the physical body, you can no longer measure how small the mass at the center is.  We can calculate the mass based on gravitational effects, which is how we know that one black hole the size of Mars holds approximately 1000 Suns, but it doesn't make a difference if that mass is the diameter of the Moon or a grain of sand. It is all underneath the Event Horizon.  However, because the diameter can not be calculated, equations that need that figure can plug in "infinity" and still work.   21 and 24 are 100% amazing.  My favorite bits of the show all revolve around them.  https://youtu.be/StzFZNWeMAY   Data points caused by activity not tested for in the experiment.  For example, if one of the children in the study with lower grades was huffing paint, it would be caused but not correlated.   The problem that I am seeing is that they tested the hypothesis by taking parents with multiple children and checking their grades against whichever one was called the "smarter" or "dumber" child.  But did they attempt to see what happens if you *pretend* to believe in your child?   Ultimately, isn't that all a hoverboard would be? A platform with a means of upward propulsion?   Didn't they announce this when they announced the HoloLens?   Sorry, dude. She's dead. She'll always be dead.  She has to die in order to utilize the Lifestream to use the Holy Materia.   There are improvements to be made...  They can either repair or remove Materia that didn't work in the original US release. They can smooth out the combat and improve the menu. The graphical improvements to the Summons are a given, but they could add a new one or two.   Don't do this, man!   Flying Mounts FTW   At the very least, it will be released eventually on PC.   Transgenders are normal healthy people, too. They're just different.   Wait.... Chris Pratt in blackface?   Not everyone on Tumblr is a Tumblrina.   I'm not the one that brought up the default.  But sexuality is not the same as favorite color. Gender identity is not the same as favorite food.  Favorites can change over time.  You don't become gay or transgender.   My whole point was that the normal, unqualified, male is the default. It will always be the default. No matter how accepting we are of transgenders.   I believe they use Naval and Marines for space because of the use of spaceships.  Spaceships are most like Naval vessels in regard to configuration.      Lady comes to the desk, just past the cutoff for when we can start eggs, and asks if I'm going to make sausage and eggs.  Sensibly, I have sausage cooking already, as I saw we were out. I didn't throw in omelets, because there was still some there. So I tell her that sausage is coming, but the eggs would be done for the day.  Lady: oh, and we need toast, too.  Me: Sure, I'll be able to replace the bread stuff.  Lady: There's bagels and all, but no toast.  Me: Okay, I'll get right on it.  I go, fix up the coffee pot that had just finished brewing and check which bread we need... and there is a whole tray of bread! I don't get it, did she expect me to make her her toast?  I point it out to her royal highness, wait a few minutes for the sausage to finish and bring it out. What do I see in the chafing dish? Omelets! There aren't many left, but they weren't out.  I think she was just trying to find reasons to complain, as if it isn't bad enough they have obviously way too many kids for their room.      My boss is talking to the inspector from corporate right now, and is seriously angering him before he sees anything by accusing corporate of trying to fail him...  Is he stupid or crazy?    I've tried campaigns before, and frankly no one ever bites.  I've tried being serious, earnest, funny, even comically irreverent, and it never picks up.  Basically, what I would need to get is a larger inventory for my store, and possibly a storefront.  I worry with Kickstarter that offering presales of products is against the rules, but everyone does it anyway. They all suggest making a video, but I am terrible at videos.  What can I do to increase my reach and my returns?             I have an idea for an unofficial Sentai that I would like to see created, and well... no one has seemed to think about it before.  Shoot me a line if you think you are up for designing and drawing a never-before-seen squad.                  Most Super Sentai shows start off with a standalone enemy threatening world destruction or domination, but they are never confronted by previous Super Sentai.  After they become a fully fledged team, they begin to interact with other teams as if they existed together.  Some previous enemies will even show themselves as enemies of the newer teams.  In all media that focuses on more than one team, the passage of time stated between the two shows is sometimes longer than the actual time difference between them.  Most importantly, in Battle Fever J, the enemy Satan Egos was able to sense when the Battle Fever team was given their powers. This may have been caused by him sensing the shift from the original Battle Fever universe to that of the Sentai universe.  This shifting would also explain how the dinosaurs were destroyed in 4 different manners and created 4 different unique Sentai.   It's criminally low in some cases (night auditors are being paid under the table below minimum wage). For those of us who are legal, he tries to keep us as close to minimum wage as possible.  This is painful for us, because even being the highest paid desk clerk ($8.25/hr) isn't enough to pay the bills at home, and I'm having to borrow money off of future paychecks to cover them.  I counted out all of the hours worked this week by all the hourly workers, and if we assume this was an average week, then they pay about $12.28 per room-night for employees.  Raising the rate of pay for everyone to $10.00/hr would increase that average to $17.10.  That seems daunting, but the ADR has gone up over $10 since last year, because of rate increases.  Furthermore, if he were to continue paying the night shift as he has, it could bring the average down to under $15 a room. (I hate to throw the students under the bus, but the boss might not care about helping them at all.)  Ironically, the fact that he pays so badly is the reason why my job is secure enough for me to bring it up to him. No one wants to work starting at $7.50, with an occasional  $0.25 raise. (I started at $7.75 because I had 5 years experience, and I've been here 4 years.) So, most people that get hired don't even bother showing up for training once they hear the pay offer.  For that $5 a room, my boss would shift from being one of the worst paying employers in the city to one of the best that isn't in the oil refineries.  But, I wonder if he even cares enough to listen...  If he doesn't, then I'll just have to look for a new job, because he pays his assistant manager less than a guy that flips burgers under a heat lamp.      http://www.ebay.com/itm/171761940449  I promise, this will be the last time I post about this piece until a second is completed                           **I** push the button!    One of Comedy Central's Comics To Watch for 2013. Host of @CanceledPod. Professional goofball.  This is the bio of @ChrisCubas, the "normal fan" that "won" the PointsMe Challenge, and subsequently "won" the game tonight on @midnight...  While he was legitimately funny, the FTW challenge was obviously staged to have him win (the other contestant put out a lame joke that would have been beaten by a fart noise, and his "joke" was blatantly telling people to watch his podcast.)  I don't think Comedy Central had any intention of getting a regular guy to go on their show.  Sorry if this isn't the best place for this, but I had to say it...   Why is it that when you talk to Ace in the chocobo stable, the video recording/streaming cuts off?  There doesn't seem to be any reason for it.   We had one woman (we'll call her Monica) check in a couple weeks ago. A local, paying with cash.  She stays over day by day, doesn't really give us too much trouble, just paying late... until Monday last, when they decided they were going to check out.  Monday night, a group of 3 people from their room rush upstairs, break into a second room, and beat and rob the guest there. Unfortunately, we didn't know it was them until they had already left. (My boss didn't watch the whole tape until the morning.)  Needless to say, she was put on the Do Not Rent list, which I have tacked in the front with names, ID numbers, and the reason they are banned.  Fast forward to today, just now. I come in to work after a nice carefree weekend, and hear a woman screaming in the hallway, being chased, beaten, and dragged back into the back hallway towards their room. I called 911, found which room they were in, and they ask me who rented the room... it was Monica.  One of my idiot colleagues rented her a room again, even when we have her on a Do Not Rent list for robbery and assault!  I go down to keep an eye on the hallway as the police do their thing, and what do you know, they have a dog! They admit to me that they know the dog isn't allowed, but they "didn't have any other place to go".  And to make matters worse, the guy was caught with a huge packet of Synthetic and a grinder filled with marijuana... in the room with his 3 year old daughter!  The piece of shit was arrested, and I got the distinct "pleasure" of telling an assault victim with no ID and a toddler to find other accommodations.  And later, when I tell my boss what happened, I'll probably be yelled at for calling 911.  So, how's *your* Sunday?   ... That isn't part of a racism movement *by* white people? I don't want to end up in a KKK sub or something, just need to express grievances about the hypocrisy of anti-white groups.   The fan art community is one of the strangest things I've seen. People make figures, drawings, paintings, and other works of art, sometimes in complete opposite directions as the original work.   They sell these works at conventions with near complete impunity, and only get C D generally when the work is closer to plagerism. However, they operate under a constant knowledge that the hammer may drop at any time.  So, my question is, "What is the best way to seek permission from the appropriate company to create and sell art based on their characters?"  Should I only send correspondence by regular mail, or is sending an email acceptable?   Should I begin my offer only with a request to sell the art and copies of that work, or should I include the secondary acceptable offer of making the pieces directly for a commission?  Do I even need to worry about it? If the works are obviously of my own energy, and not damaging to the brand in question (there is no official outlet for this style of art), could this be considered "fair use"?  And, for a final and more specific question. The character from my initial piece is from the Japanese show "Super Sentai", owned by Bandai and Toei. The rights in America for the show are owned by Haim Saban. Who should I attempt to contact, as an American artist, Toei or Saban? The original artwork will only be made one time, and prints would be available worldwide.  Thank you in advance, if I should consult an attorney, I would love to have a suggestion for which one in the Corpus Christi area, if available, or one that consults by phone.    I have thought about the possibility of using a raffle to raise money for my business and wanted to shoot the idea out before starting it.  How likely are crowdfunders to buy raffle tickets?  What would be an appropriate ticket cost/prize value ratio?  How frequently should I make the drawings?  I have considered allowing prize donations from others to sweeten the pots, as well as increasing the value of the prizes if I "sell too many tickets", but is there anything else I can do to make this a success?      USA Network ran a No More SVU Marathon, to bring awareness to sexual assault and domestic violence.

 A decision that ended up seeming superawk, I guess.   le Ron   Wait, did Will outsource his all-out insane side that Scientologist Cruise showed the world with fervor into his son? Clever.   Touchscreen! Need to justify the monitor price.   That's why they are outsourced to specialized companies like Iron Galaxy Studios.   Wouldn't it have made more sense to link to the original that I explicitly copied? I think your post is kind of ironic.   You're not making sense to me. I answered why I believe in LFW. Your question-sentence contains reasoning that is only related to (not) convincing others, not to arriving at realizations oneself. So, to add to my other reply: How do you know that you are interested in my response (or just in anything at all)? You ultimately can't answer this. You could give reasons like Evolution, but you can't answer why your mind knows that it has an interest. The will-question is literally on as a high level as it gets, so in case you get the impression that I'm playing with solipsism (which I'm not): That's the height of the level, hence reasoning doesn't work, anyway.   It's like saying you have no evidence or argument for Bigfoot but I should believe in him.  You are saying: "If you have no evidence four your stance, then you can't use it in the debate." I can see where you're coming from (Atheism.), but just like logic has no working logical (dis)proof and is hence just a power-thing ("It works."), I work successfully with my conviction that my will's freedom is unlimited, I am only limited by how I can affect the world with it. For example, and this is unquestionable: Believing that one's will is absolutely free is empowering, while not explicitly believing in the freedom of one's will does not give this power.   I can't answer that, just like I can't answer how will or the mind works in the first place. I would have to say "I perceive that I have LFW" which isn't helpful.   70-90 years lifespan seems *really short*, the bigger your picture gets.   In Java, you can use System.getenv() to obtain some useful values, for example:      APPDATA = C:\Users\GNARF\AppData\Roaming     USERNAME = GNARF     HOMEPATH = \Users\GNARF     USERPROFILE = C:\Users\GNARF      PUBLIC = C:\Users\Public      ProgramFiles(x86) = C:\Program Files (x86)     ProgramFiles = C:\Program Files     ProgramW6432 = C:\Program Files      SystemRoot = C:\Windows     windir = C:\Windows      CommonProgramFiles = C:\Program Files\Common Files     CommonProgramW6432 = C:\Program Files\Common Files  A helpful method for development, used via System.out.println(getEnvironmentReport());      public static String getEnvironmentReport() {          final StringBuilder t = new StringBuilder();         t.append("================ System.getProperties() ================\n");         for (Map.EntryObject, Object e : System.getProperties().entrySet()) {             t.append(e.getKey()).append(" = ").append(e.getValue()).append("\n");         }         t.append("\n\n================ System.getenv() ================\n");         for (Map.EntryString, String e : System.getenv().entrySet()) {             t.append(e.getKey()).append(" = ").append(e.getValue()).append("\n");         }         return t.toString();     }    Oh, ok. I completely agree. Ultimately, it's only about *what works*, because those who don't utilize it will be pushed to the sidelines. Same for logic itself: It can't be proven or disproven by using logic, but since it *works*, we use it, and that's the end of it.   If you use the approach of the SSCCE in my StackOverflow question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27227647/image-size-returns-1-in-jar-but-proper-size-in-ide-image-loaded-via-toolkit) and put the image somewhere into the source tree or in a folder that's marked as a resource (or somesuch) in your IDE's project, then loading should work in the IDE and in the .jar   Religion of  #SUFFER AND DIE, NON-MUSLIMS!!!   Hey Pat. I would be completely ok with that. Because the best solution to avoid the imaginary problem you speak of: Stop being Christian.   Many words that come down to the same dishonest bullshit attack tactics: "People! Look at this person arguing against X! The person is a racist!" Expecting everybody else go to "A RACIST you say? Where did I put my torch and pitchfork?"  Fuck off.   You are not proposing that truth doesn't exist, I assume. Because that then would be true=truth.   If libertarian free will, in which you of course don't believe (but I do), is true, then we are "witnessing" (Not quite recognizing.) creation all the time, because then we would all be prime movers (except something is already there, and there is already motion). Because LFW would have to come out of nowhere at all. It would create impulse in reality that would not be there otherwise. You could say "But it can only happen because the universe first created the person." But the nature of LFW is that the way it works is not determined by nature, there is no mechanism or determinism behind it: Once there's an LFW actor, there is a source for impulse that is beyond the control of everything else that exists.  This impulse source *creates* impulse. We would be witnesses of creating something all the time. It's just beyond our intellectual abilities to find out whether or not there is indeed such a thing, or if it's all just natural determinism, or something else.   I stand by my "the reason why": Evolution is the reason that we try to create maps of our environment (aka all of existence) with perfection. The level on which this is put to practice is indeed different in places, but those people are wrong/inferior: Logically, the completion of the map has to be strived for. People who don't do this are just doing it wrong. Not doing it (See e.g. religion, where fantasy and reality are confused.) is so prevalent that seeing it like this or speaking about it like this is seen as wrong, but the people who object *are wrong*. Maximization of our survivability / well-being (*Closely* related.) is our nature, making maps that involve abstractions (aka *true understanding*) is our highest mental tool.  Evolution is the reason that we try to know *everything*, period.   Right. We have this new checkbox now that works per subreddit. Forgot about it. This is the first time I make use of it.   Your argument is striking.   That's what they said, too.   What, should I have waited a little longer?   **[ALTERED]**: Very beginning apparently cut off, no credits, slowed down.   Don't you see that we want to *open* your eyes, that we want to take the hood off that has been pulled over your head?   Thought it was me, but I don't insist. Hooray for potzdamn!

This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Pictures (ZEFR).   Sorry about that.    A Primer primer. Good, good.  People shouldn't pull it out (or know about it), though, until a point in the movie where certain technical facts about the general plot of the movie become apparent (relatively early).  In general, I think the people on this page aren't regarding the concept of *spoilers* enough.    "O Brother, Where Art Thou? ..." This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Pictures (ZEFR).   Sorry about that.  Quick.

Otherwise, here's your American Dream opportunity.    Argh! The whiteness blinds me!  I always disliked this subreddit's color scheme. It probably imitates some movie or such, I guess, otherwise who'd choose such a scheme based on perception alone?   It sounds to me like someone saying something they completely know is not solid - it's not truthful. But they ignore it and probably even push it away inside of their minds. Symptomatic for that whole failth shit.   I believe in an evolving definition of marriage. Originally, it was about "we have to", then it slowly became "we want to", and it's only consequent to continue this development, to open marriage up to more or less *any* people who just *want to* marry.   And evolution is the reason why we do these things: "Try to understand the environment to maximize your survival." It's our niche. Animals do map their environment, too, but they are not capable of abstractions on as high a level as us.   Two minutes after your comment, OP made a comment that makes sense of the post even given its paradoxical aspect:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/3bm9ls/why_do_you_have_to_ask_why/csnie0y?context=10  I'm still not sure whether I just read this into the comment or if it's intended.   Well... it *could* be an appropriate punishment for what the teacher has done.   Hey, Christians. Think of this exemplary case from time to time when you realize that your belief is partly informed by the fact that there are so many of you.                     Driver's license: You got the red keycard, congratulations. Your medical degree is yet another example of something you achieved through playing that gives you more rights.  Getting your little kid safely to school or going out with the GF/BF could be seen as an escort mission. (Not all of those suck. Just look at the awesome AI, and there are only very few enemies.)  That knee high fence around your neighbors front garden is low enough to jump over, yet you're kind of unable to do so. Kinda like invisible walls in games are mirrored by other people's private property etc.  Wiping your windows is a quicktime event. Ok, that wasn't a good example - who really likes QTEs? Well, some of them are supposed to (badly) emulate actions in everyday life, so carrying that back into life doesn't make much sense.  What are some examples you can think of?   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/bazzacuda-image-saver-plus/  I have personally been using this for months, and it just saves a ton of time and clicks.  All tabs that indeed are purely an image get closed, and the images are saved into the folder defined in the extension's preferences. If a file already exists, no action will be taken for that tab.  It's super convenient, and just think about how often we save images from the Web.   It's not about the "worshiping" but about focusing: All the people would unite if the one God would be here. Mankind would focus its will instead of running aimlessly. Also, no more nuclear weapons, because war-time would be over forever, because God disapproves of war. I'd just disapprove of all the bad shit, and since the people worship me, they'd just play along. Bang! World healed.      So far, Germans and visitors use (up) the German roads, but only the Germans pay for it via the automobile tax.  Soon, both will use (up) the roads, and both will have to pay road charge, but the Germans will have their automobile tax reduced by just this amount. Result: Both user groups pay for what they use instead of just the Germans.  Why does the EU call this a discrimination of foreign visitors?  EDIT:  Found a statement from the horse's mouth:  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5200_en.htm  And indeed, it does not speak about my concerns, so at least in this specific matter, I might have a case while they don't. What's interesting, though, is that they *also* mention something that I hadn't heard so far in any place, even though I have heard about this topic a lot:   The second is that the price of short term vignettes, which are typically bought by foreign users, is disproportionally high.  Also:   The road charge adopted by Germany is not in line with the aims of the 2011 White Paper on transport because it is not proportionate to how often roads are actually used.            https://np.reddit.com/r/cutegirlgifs/comments/39g27c/emma_watson_in_deep_thought_during_an_interview/  The post links to a short GIF, the comments have a link to the full video.

I'm now eternally "married" to it, no matter what it does. And it, that refers mostly to mankind, because the main power in this system is not the sun, gravity, or the BigBang: It's *will*. Ask yourself what you've been doing with yours.  The only way to wake up was to love mankind at least as much as myself, so when I reached God-level, everybody's will was as important to me as God's will, or as reality itself. This lead to a sadly still very invisible trap: People made themselves insane with will and used their collective God-power to keep me imprisoned, so that the inevitable clean-up is delayed and the "emotional" work mankind will have to do when it happens simultaneously increases. Basically, mankind tries to keep me in hell for as long as possible. But I am good fortune, happiness, life itself - so when purgatory begins, the translation "Mankind hates good fortune, happiness, life itself" will manifest accordingly. Billions will die.                                 It *keeps running*, ok. That's the joke.  Yes, I know that it's "Wile E. Coyote".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_The_Road_Runner      I'm using the default input configuration and am playing with keyboard/mouse.  I already tried the helicopter keys etc. (keypad 8/5, left shift, left alt). In fact, I tried everything.         Because this is such an irrelevant post, I intentionally chose the misspelled subreddit for this.      There's certainly one glaring plothole that I see no chance to be explained away. Amount of energy.  They take off from this 1h=7years gravity-well planet (The one with the waves.) with that posh jet ship of theirs like it's nothing, even though that's *huge* gravity gradient to overcome. Seriously, it's *gigantic*. If 1 hour is 1.1 hours once you're away, you already have gravity several times that of Jupiter. If 1 hour is 2 hours, we're already talking astronomic unit sized stars or something. But 1 hour is 7 years - that would take fuel reserves of pure matter-antimatter of a volume that clearly doesn't fit into any man-made structure.  There is just no way in the universe to store that amount of energy inside such a small ship other than "Somehow!", which is not how we should explain plotholes away. Especially not in such a science-heavy movie.  ----  And there's another thing:  Before the film's mission, there had been others. How in the Hell did they keep the launches a secret? A Saturn V isn't exactly a subtle firecracker. And it's also not like you can launch any time you want, you have to obey the weather. E.g. "Just launch as soon as all the surrounding civilization happens to be under a mite dust storm!" doesn't work.   I have no plot ideas yet, except it should be very down to Earth and very close to Ian Fleming's original Bond character. A dense believable normal reality - and then: The supervillain (or whatever). That makes it kick so much more!  B W:  The new Casino Royale, which was quite good and which gave me hope that the francise had not died with pretentious-smile mannequin Brosnan, had its initial sequence completely in b w, and first I was confused and wondered if they had made the bold move to completely keep it in b w and was a bit disappointed when it switched to color later. Side-note: The way they made use of the trademark barrel shot was perfect.  3D:  The combination with b w should give a very unique experience that makes room for new emotions. The 3D should not ever be exploitative: It should just show a world in 3D, it shouldn't scare/wow the audience.  Wide angle:  Not only am I an immersion-buff (e.g. first person games with high FoV, not that I indend to do the movie in 1st person, but I haven't thought about that at all yet), I also dig Kubrick's visual style a lot, and I also think that some kind of untapped mental effect might come in if the viewer doesn't have to adapt to a new type of vision all the time. This might open them up to a new kind of visual movie perception. Just like driving in a car means that whenever you change direction, you have to brake and accelerate all the time, but when you're driving straight, you can speed up a lot. So, keeping the same geometry might allow the brain's visual-perception circuits to experience the movie in a way that we just don't explore and hence can't possibly value (yet).  Long takes:  Real life does not have cuts. If the movie cuts very little, the mind does not fear to really let itself sink into the scene, because potential cut-rape is super improbable, and you know it after 15 minutes of the movie.  High frame-rate: Let's forget that it is a movie while we're in the scene. No skippy images. Smooth real-life sailing.  NO CAMERA SHAKES. None. Not at all. Never. And fuck Paul Greengrass and the likes of him with a glowing red iron spear.  Ryan Gosling: I liked his appearance in [Drive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/) (2011). Mr nice guy, but also Mr "This situation requires solving." Plus the whole project as summarized in the title could use a certain visual appearance, and *kind of* (Not exactly.) how RG appeared in drive seems fitting.  I think that's a movie bound to stand out in a good way.   To get a feel for how this should go, think of the situation in the zoo where Harry accidentally makes the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear.  http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone CTRL+f "zoo"  The movie/story would just depict part of HP's young life without a distinct story arc behind it, the focus would instead be on what the title says: Situations, and human emotions (kind of the opposite of Hollywoods usual way of dealing with a superhero discovering their powers, which usually rather is like "Umm, ok, I can shoot webs. What's for breakfast?").               The argument is: Anything using the right memes and having a group of followers could gain enough momentum to work out its obvious kinks and eventually become a world-religion. This calls all existing world-religions extremely into question.  Quote of /u/politicaldan's [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/2zeq8b/do_you_not_believe_that_the_quran_is_the_word_of/cpijj5n):   In my junior year of college, my esteemed roommate Joe Boo (weed be upon him) and I made our own religion to pass the time in our Philosophy of Religion class. At first, it was a joke. Boo (WBUH) would write down ideas and laws, and I, being the more creative one, would turn them into "scripture." Boo said it started when he got a revelation from the Coke machine that "since Joseph Smith invented his religion, and his name was Joseph too, he could invent his own religion too."   I was his first prophet and everyday, he came to class with a new "inspiration" and I had several "prophetic voices." We ended up filling an entire notebook, because it was fun, we were bored, and the teacher was 180 and never gave tests except the midterm or final.   Soon, we had people coming to class just to hear what the new revelations were. So we decided to put it all on a blog, and brought in a third prophet to make some really cool artwork for it and make the blog look professional and serious. We never thought anyone would take it seriously, as farting at night under the covers was considered an act of worship.   Much to our surprise, after about six months, we had a membership of about 100 people. These people were actually discussing our "doctrine". I had no idea who about half of them were.   The next summer, a little under a year from when we started, there were over two thousand people from ten different countries. Someone translated the doctrine pages into Russian and Korean.   Sometime during that semester, as we were dealing with hosting issues due to bandwidth, there was the start of schism. Boo (WBUH) had long since quit caring about the religion, so I, nerd that I was, was pretty much de facto spiritual head of a burgeoning new movement. The schism was over some crazy doctrinal matter, like do priests automatically go to Origami 7 (the highest form of heaven) or do they need to serve ten thousand days in a lower origami? People were actually legitimately and seriously arguing this. It became a matter of why be a follower when if you can be a priest you can go straight to heaven? (Although, the rites for priesthood were....interesting. It involved indian sitar music, axe deodorant, a lighter and us losing our security deposit and the high priest having to explain a serious burn to the emergency room). These disputes went on for some time. Both boo and I graduated and began to do other things. Every once in a while, I would check in on "my" religion.   Long story short, the Pro-Priestly Rights people threatened to break away and form their own group. It was at this moment, I realized this wasn't funny anymore. I gave a Sacred and Royal Order of the Nation Decree that this was all a joke. Two college students invented this. One of them was married and had kids. Another was praying to anyone but his roommate that he could land an internship.   A lot of people left. A lot of people stayed.   "To you it might be a joke. But it's real. It's meaningful. The Elder Josephus was on to something. He received a revelation but didn't quite know how to interpret it. It was passed on to us."   I deleted the forums and the blog and everything in it. I'm convinced if I hadn't, in another thousand years, it would have been a legitimate mainstream religion and former followers of Boocephasism would be on reddit glad they left, but still worried about going to Sudoku in the afterlife while their parents urged them to come back to the Elder Josephus and follow his words and break the night wind with all the other faithful.

It is in every way a good contribution to this subreddit.  ----  "Solved." Compassion is justified regardless. https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2yfve7/interesting_thought_in_regards_to_compassion_and/cp95i58?context=3  ----  Short version:  To be perfectly sane is to be the embodiment of the "will" of the universe. But then a person buried by an avalanche would not faze you, because you *knew* the avalanche had to happen, so why did the person climb there? But you knew that, too: Because the person didn't care as much about being sane as you do.  *Anything* good or bad that happens to others would leave one almost emotionally unmoved. Because if you think "That should not have happened.", you would have to compartmentalize, because you *knew* that the previous universe-moment had to lead into this very current one (small libertarian free will component or not; often enough an outcome is clear, just think about a car approaching a wall).  To feel "Oh shit! That poor creature." would contradict one's knowledge of the world. It would be like "Oh shit! The universe still functions!"  That's the gist of my thoughts.  Probable counter-argument: "But you can't know the world on this level!" But you must realize that we are getting closer, and this leaves us with sites like http://www.darwinawards.com/ - We know more, hence we *understandably* care less about certain scenarios. Now, what if we'd know the world *in full*?  ----  Longer version (ignore or don't, but please read the short one in any case):  My definition of sanity - logically I deem those who hold a very different one to be not all that sane:  The universe / reality (of which we are a part) is the one basis for right and wrong, for reasoning, for sanity; hence sanity, for a human, would be to learn about reality and to think/decide/act in conjunction with reality - as closely as possible.  If you kind of agree, then what about this: To be *perfectly sane* would be to be the embodiment of the "will" of the universe. (Excuse the metaphor, it makes things so much simpler.) Of course since the person itself is a part of reality, that doesn't mean to abandon one's own will to instead constantly act with the mindset "What would universe do?"  Now, let's use an extreme and obvious example: There's a human who's by all standards average - they are biologically normal, had an ok education by their parents and by the schools etc. But this guy decides to set their own hair on fire, just for kicks. (This even *happens* in reality.) Of course you would cringe a little when watching this in YouTube, or say "Dude, NO! ...... WTF, you idiot." etc. - but this guy had it coming, and the result was a logical necessity. All in all, your "Dude!" would be rather be surprise as to the stupid displayed, not so much compassion.  Now an interesting thought:  Heaven and Hell. I don't believe in either (or rather, I believe the universe will be Heaven), but if we think of a *necessary* eternal Hell (not one where Mr omnipotent Mafia boss arbitrarily throws those who don't suck up to him):  Could a human in Heaven have God-level understanding of reality and would hence just *understand* the eternal torment of those in Hell, and could be happy because they just *agree* 100% with existence?               (Disclaimer: I didn't play in a long time.)

Visually, it is quite unclear which slots these objects occupy.  A background (slightly smaller than the full area) could help the player optimize their inventory space. Maybe *all* items should have that background, for consistency. Depending on how you look, either you see yourself drag objects around, or you see a puzzle of rectangles.  Btw., since this just reminds me of the Deus Ex: Human Revolution inventory, maybe there should be an optional auto-cleanup feature.                  /r/drawmuhammad  /r/letsalldrawmuhammad  /r/IDrawMuhammad  /r/waswas (To make fun of ISIS.)

But such an infrastructure would be *ideal* to double as an emergency system.            In Taken 3, Bryan places a yoghurt drink in a convenience store fridge where he expects his daughter Kim to find it, which she indeed does. He attached a message telling her to drink right away (which she does) instead of just taking it with her. She tosses the empty container into a garbage can where a cop finds it later, tasting it, and apparently drawing conclusions, which makes him hurry to the school where Kim currently is.  Meanwhile, Kim sat in class and then said to another pupil that she doesn't feel good and would now visit the restroom. Kim is bugged by the police, they are hearing every word. They are trying to get to Bryan, her father, who is the prime suspect in a murder case. The victim: His ex-wife, the mother of Kim, who had been with the franchise from day one.  **The problem I see:** Once Kim arrives in the restroom, she meets Bryan and hides with him in a stall. In there, he tells her right away that he had laced the yoghurt drink with a substance that would make her feel nauseous, and she is to drink a counter-agent that he hands to her. Her mother was murdered, her father is the prime suspect (meaning that the police are not looking for the real murderer and are likely to put her father into prison, a family tragedy as major as it gets), hence she certainly feels very bad about her life etc. - and on top of that, beloved daddy gives her a substance that makes her nauseous enough to reliably make her visit the restroom? And right afterwards, they exchange affections as if that's nothing?  After years, and especially after the *two* major opportunities (caught on film) where Bryan demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that his ways are to be considered sane, they haven't come up with a secret inter-family communication code, so dad *has to poison* his daughter instead of just telling her to meet him in the restroom? Side-note: To the police, there is no difference between the daughter's claim that she doesn't feel right to be a lie or the truth.  ----  Ok, that's it. I want to finish by saying that the movie overall was almost ok, the story was certainly not bad. But the editing and camera are *as atrocious as it gets*. E.g. there are 8 cuts in rapid succession during the 3.5 seconds it takes Bryan to climb over a fence, all of which showing the act with different angles / zooms. The moment the movie switches to action, the cuts become rapid like this throughout the whole flick. You can only *extrapolate* what actually happened once a sequence of events has played out, because then you can observe the outcome. And the camera tumbles and zooms around all the time for no reason but to instill in the more imaginative audience the impression that they "saw" good action etc., because in their heads they of course saw exactly what they liked. No more Olivier Megaton movies for me. Paul Greengrass had been the worst offender in this regard so far, but this movie tops the insane camera shakes of The Bourne Ultimatum/Supremacy (don't remember which was worse here) easily.

Eventually, the window responds again so that you can close it via the close button. Windows says that the player crashed. And so forth.

(courtesy /u/rawkuts)         Very mandala like.      Perhaps. There's a big difference between 'putting an end to fracking in its entirety' and not starting it where it has hitherto been illegal, however.   Every social society involves some form of agreement to treat your fellow members well  I don't think so. Such an agreement is certainly more explicit in Freemasonry than other groups.   taking an oath to provide assistance to members of a group makes you incapable of acting rationally  That's not what I'm saying. Partiality and irrationality are not identical terms.    if you abuse the public trust, then you aren't acting as a Mason.  So long as that credo is at the forefront of their mind then good on them. When that is ignored society as a whole suffers.   If it is the case that justice is not perverted through the existence of Freemason cabals, then I retract my insinuations to the contrary. The way things are, however, I will be offering no such retraction.   We can't just freeze and starve to death until someone comes up with a hydrogen car and replaces our source of the majority of our electricity. The current demand must be met, or our entire infrastructure would collapse.  You're putting the cart before the horse. If the demand and will for clean energy is there then the economy and energy industry can reorientate accordingly. The German government intends to garner 60% of energy from renewables by 2050. Other nations should follow suit. For the United Kingdom to lift its ban on fracking at this moment in time is a misstep that could have dire consequences both actually and qua gesture politics.   It's also the whole 'burning fossil fuels thing'. We should be looking for fewer ways to pollute the atmosphere not more.   The Freemason tenets of 'brotherly love' and 'relief' aren't negative in and of themselves but they become so when it enters into a sphere where equality before the law and [the principle of equal opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity) should remain paramount.

I also touch on that which makes relationship between the consumer and creator of games different to the creator/consumer relationship in music and movies. In short, games require a greater acquiescence and obeisance from the consumer towards the creator than other media. Additionally, the active participation of the gamer as an agent within the game is a cause of harm. The artificiality creates anomie, through the toxic effect of the necessarily meaningless and unimportant game-world, whereas the mimesis with the real world encourages immorality/immoralism through conditioning (e.g. encouraging violence).   I also imply, in an aside, that games bring out the bad of competitive sport (brutishness, ruthlessness, and tribalism/egoism, etc. etc. ) with none of the benefits - e.g. exercise.    A discussion of my statements, and my (partial) recantation can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/26gjxf/cmv_i_believe_that_playing_video_games_is_morally/   I believe that playing video games is a waste of time and a corrupting influence on an otherwise healthy human being. My first objection to video games is founded on the belief that they do nothing good. My second objection is that they do something bad. [edit for /r/philsophy: Moreover, I believe that playing video games is morally indefensible.]  I cannot think of any good that video games do. Where things that resemble video games have a practical implementation they are not called 'video games'. A pilot learning on a flight stimulator has an equivalence to an air traffic controller monitoring a graphic of in-air flights. Neither is playing a game because neither is using a tool that has real-world importance. Whereas a 'video game' is a trivial enterprise, ('game'), in a dimension that doesn't truly exist. The 'video' is just electronic pixels producing an illusion. Existence pertains to that universe that we live in. That of time, space, feeling, and suffering.  The 'unreal world' setting of video games leads to the conditions arising that result in their real-world harm. Whilst I can imagine a game developer with the best intentions trying to create a game which tries to instil good character traits in the 'gamer', I believe her attempt would be fruitless. Any encouragement of positive characteristics would necessarily be concomitant with a diminution and tainting of the 'real world' through association with the 'unreal world'. This leads to apathy and alienation. Furthermore, if the game developer doesn't approach the project of making a game with the best of intentions then the game will inevitably enforce or reinforce bad character traits. A game that is made with disregard to encouraging moral virtues will lead to a game that encourages immorality (or amorality - as covered above). I believe that this has happened and is happening. It is well illustrated by these comments made by a leading creative  "Hardcore gamers basically love to watch the baby hit the floor. They said I want a game where I can shoot somebody in the head and blow their head off, so the gaming industry moved in that direction. So thats what theyre doing. And you cant empathize with somebody youre going to kill, so that whole idea has gone out the window."  (Games that encourage a ruthless, competitive win-at-all-costs mentality are equally guilty in their ability to clip the 'Angel's wings' that is human potential).   I believe that video games are good for nothing more than as a good example of how to waste time and corrupt. (And that there are better ways to learn such lessons!)  ______________________  A further explication and discussion of my statement (and partial retraction) can be found [here: I believe that playing video games is morally indefensible /r/changemyview](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/26gjxf/cmv_i_believe_that_playing_video_games_is_morally/)   OK.   Is there such a thing as an unwounded soldier?   Thus was Mr. Pickwick brought face to face with the difficulty of seeing his own counsel.  He could not understand why, having retained the services of a professional man and paid for them, there should exist any impediment to prevent access to him.  I wont discuss to-night the advisability or non-advisability of dividing the profession of the law into two parts, but I do say that any system which prevents litigants having the fullest personal communication with those they have paid to represent them is an anomaly and an absurdity.  But Mr. Pickwick was a person of determination, and he did see Serjeant Snubbin, and he delivered to that learned gentleman a short address that was well worthy of his attention, as it is of every member of the Bar, including your very humble servant.  Gentlemen of your profession, sir, continued Mr. Pickwick, see the worst side of human nature.  All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood, rise up before you.  You know from your experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use, for purposes of deception and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing them yourselves.  I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and overcautious.  Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, sir, I must beg to add that, unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them.   In what ways is life a 'bitter symphony'?  Shouldn't you rather be revising?   Does this nihilistic zone increase the universe's nihilism? One cannot say that the images on the screen don't exist in the universe. And nihilism is bad; philosophy, value, bearable and civilised living cannot survive in it.      Are we masters of the web because our forefathers were spiders? Or just an aphid who thinks he is?   Or jellyfish if you prefer. 'Squid' was just the first word that came to mind. It has a pleasing onomatopoeic feel to it.    Some good and bad arguments either way. See if you can add to them.      [In 1904, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie designed a board game to demonstrate the tragic effects of land-grabbing. In this game, oligarchs enrich themselves at the expense of tenants, the latter of whom only grow poorer as available land decreases and the cost of rent increases. Anyone interested in traveling a non-trivial distance has to pony up for a railroad ticket. Anyone desiring light and water had better open their wallet. And crossing the wrong landowner sends a player directly to jail. The poorer the proletarian player gets, the more he or she is squeezed; there is nowhere to go that doesnt demand a fee of some kind, and there is no respite. The game ends only when everyone is driven penniless into the ground, but for a single aristocrat who now owns everything. Lizzie Magie named her grim reflection of life The Landlords Game, but you probably know it better as Monopoly.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/48787/retrobituaries-elizabeth-lizzie-magie-inventor-monopoly)      Further reading:  [*Utilitarianism* by John Stuart Mill ](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm#CHAPTER_II)      But don't you think sharing /r/rawkuts' contribution would prove beneficial?

I know it's on the sidebar but I've only found it just now.  Metta.            Why?       Last time I got a BSOD I got a few in quick succession. I deleted recently downloaded software and it went away so I think it was definitely that then. That made me think it was that reason this time too. I've had a disconcerting rattling from my laptop recently so it's probably/possibly linked to that and not software after all.   It was your tone as much as anything. The Buddha was said to have combined intelligence with love. This is an advanced practise - one requiring speed and deliberation, precision and equanimity, strength and tenderness. It has been said that 'hatred is the near enemy of intelligence'. Can you understand how that might be the case?   I have 'delta'd' someone who, to my mind, managed to deserve it.

 Last I heard he was an alcoholic and probably dabbling in hard drugs   CD: $20  Supporting favourite bands: priceless  Multimedia backup: infinitely priceless   Even an amateur can take primals and subprimals apart easily enough. We had a hog carcass (bled and eviscerated) brought to class in culinary school, it only takes 5 minutes to learn.   Or become Flash..?   Casuals. My household does that in a week   Pack your bags, boys. We found the brown note.   It wasnt really a big issue until the last 5-6 months if i was gaming for hours at a time. Now its retired to college use only and never runs hot.   My almost four year old Pavilion dv-7 notebook was decommissioned from gaming in january, but for lasting three years and tens of thousands of hours of gaming it was as reliable as they get. Also had a wireless mouse i bought around the same time, still works minus scrolling.   I'm in the culinary industry, 90% of the knives used are Victorinox and Henckels, until you start looking at a uber-expensive specialty knives like Damascus steel.  A good Victorinox 10" french is about $60.   Had Cave's voice in my head until coughing. Switched to Peter Parker's boss from there on.   My D1 brother loves to play initiate-heavy junglers (Lee Sin main). Whenever I watch him play, he always screams at the screen "the day I get any follow-up from my team is the day Asians don't win LCS again."   Is this what Rick-rolls have come to?  Sidebar, had to explain Rick-rolls to a foreign exchange friend. She now tries to Rick-roll me 4-5 times a day.  Edit: what, not was.   Wards let you know what's coming...?  When I support I light up that jungle like a forest fire.   Damn, my subconscious made an archery pun for me. Nice catch!   Used to shoot competitive archery with a leftie. Couldn't draw but damn he could hit those targets at 100 yards pretty well. Last I saw him he was training for worlds. Wonder what my bud Keenan is up to now.   Loosely tied into this, equal gender pay. I like to think I'm alright with social progress, but I will not support equal pay rights so long as I have to pay for every dinner, coffee, movie, etc.  In 7 relationships, not once did any of the ladies offer to cover the bill. Only one would pay for her half, sometimes. 3 of them made more than me too.   Meet my mother. Couldn't even say I'm athiest in a non-religious home.   We all know this woman. Know-it-all, thinks she's everyone's friend, uses feminism as an excuse for lack of hygiene. That's the Becky I (unfortunately) know.  Fucking Becky.   Last night... tonight... tomorrow leftovers... with other family in a couple weeks......   It's like we have a holiday celebrating harvest season before theres frost and/or a metre of snow!   Calm down, Zeus.   There's a couple factors why I haven't carried cash in years. First of all, its inconvenient. Why should I waste my time, a cashier's time, and the time of others in line finding enough coin and bills to pay, when I can stick or tap a card at a device, and be out in under 15 seconds? Other factors are, my wallet doesn't have a change pocket, and neither do I feel like keeping change loose in my pockets. Also, cash is a liability. Most muggings do not end up in violence if you show your wallet has nothing but secure cards, at least where I'm from.   Food trucks here take debit, and half of them take credit as well.   Speaking on behalf of fellow Canadians, its called a "creeediiit caaaard" (or debit). Makes life easy and you can track how you waste your money poorly.   Padded seat backs? Here in Canada, that"padding" was 5mm sheet steel.   Not only normal, but professional. This is what we do in restaurant kitchens to keep clubhouses and such looking well made.   Fixed...   Pepsi is never ok in Canada either (you know, that thing north-er than north?). You either drink coke or you don't have tastebuds. Fact.   Being in college, I have no motivation (or energy) to focus on a lot of hardcore gaming or anything anymore, so I've been binging all 10 seasons of Stargate: SG1 for the last two weeks. Crack a beer and relax, no regrets!   Go listen to Just Like Heaven by The Cure, happens to me too   Its a matter of not knowing what you want. A story/example I had recently sums it up. A friend of mine wanted to make a gift basket for her friends birthday, so we went over to the liquer commission to find some wine. Well there's literally walls of wine in the place, from every corner of the world. She had no clue what she wanted, but I know a little bit from purchasing and making wine. Told the guy working there she wants something sweeter, with tones of bitter and dry. This guy had a suggestion almost immediately.   Found the Canadian, guys! Yay Great White Northerners   Just bought that album on CD last week, amazing study music   Its 2014, I was barely old enough to remember '97 forward, and I'm still rocking Dire Straits.   Does it really matter? It's the Beastie Boys, everything they are is an insult to the Rock Hall of Fame.   Its nice to know we have standards for food in Canada.   Referring to calling out the incompetence of target callers/other bad players? Granted I'm not the best player of any game out there, but when a team functions better ignoring the group leader, there's a problem.   One silence, one free fear, one fear that consumes shadow orbs. Hardly a lot of cc. Oh and a talent for roots or stationary fearing fiend if you walk near it. Granted I can drop it on your face, but its easy to get away from.  Its the warrior/druid cc monkeys that need to calm down.  I main a warlock as well, and while I agree cc is out of control, fears are literally my survivability. Not only am I losing most of this or its getting nerfed into the ground, I lose my only defensive cd as well. Warlocks are being gutted and it's why I probably won't pvp after 6.0 anymore, until Blizzard realizes they literally killed a class's viability.  Edit: grammer, spelling, priest content.  Edit 2: currently 1500 RBG rating, easily could have been 2.2k plus if I got along better with bad target callers.   My grandpa once said, "if it has tits or tires, it'll cost you a lot of money." Applies here too.   Inaccurate. Engineers actually work.  Otherwise spot on!   Sonething, something, joke about his ugly sweater-vests. Yeah, sounds about right!   No need for an army, give Canadians hockey sticks and tell us [insert bad guys here] have the puck   They w0t m8?  Edit: damnit guys this is my top comment? Alright I'll take it..   Winnipeg checking in. Transit drivers are some of the worst drivers. If you don't have your ass bolted to the seat, prepare for a scary ride.  To make it relevant to the thread, Winnipeg Transit operators need to let people find a seat before slamming the gas or brakes.   Seriously though, when I'm with friends or whatever, phone is just a way to tell time.   630 class here. Still wearing a nice sweater (not some slack-jaws hoodie) and leather shoes.   Great White North isn't much better. If I make plans, I call (not text), to make surr plans are still good. And then I wonder why I'm the only one that does this.   How I love Tap with Mastercard. The second the Veriphone says accepted I say no receipt and get the hell out of the way.  	48
 I was enrolled in Calc II while taking Physics I and ran across no issues that couldn't be handled with a little research. As someone mentioned already, you may run into some integrals and derivatives that could possibly require interesting techniques to accomplish. This is also largely dependent on how your instructor approaches physics I as well as the text they use. For example, Kleppner and Kolenkowl's *An Introduction to Mechanics* would probably require a broader mathematical base in introductory physics. I haven't used this text so if someone here has they may be able to provide a bit more insight on the actual use of such a book in a course. If you happen to know what text you are using this could help us in providing more detailed direction as to what you may need to know. My calc based physics course used *Matter and Interactions* by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood. Wonderful text for conceptual understanding but not so much for intense mathematical representations of physical ideas. Using this book as a resource will certainly be helpful though.   I assume you ran into some obstacles in getting internships. If this is the case would you mind sharing what made it difficult for you? Perhaps you meant to convey that internships in general are difficult to attain. Thanks for your reply!  	2

 [Self-Compassion](http://www.amazon.com/Self-Compassion-Beating-Yourself-Insecurity-Behind/dp/0061733512/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1337308524 sr=1-1 tag=acleint-20) by Kristin Neff shows how much better self-compassion is than self-esteem.  Not sure how you'd teach it to a 4-year-old but you and your wife could apply it to yourselves.  It's a good read.                        From the article:  If we think of the tax code as a set of incentives, rather than simply a mechanism to redistribute income, there are creative and effective ways to moderate the extremes of wealth, boost the pay of ordinary workers, make American companies more stable and efficient, and reduce the long-term federal budget deficit.  An astonishing contributor to inequality, then, is corporate bosses taking a larger share of the companys revenue for themselves.  Because current CEO pay numbers are so far out of the ordinary, its hard to argue that they are a natural outcome of the market.  Its difficult to estimate what combination of approaches will prevail, but whatever happens, it will be bring broad benefits to society as a whole, far outweighing the impact on the federal budget.      Upvote for terrific typo: *morose* for *more so*            Uhm, those are not facts those are assertions and the editorial the OP adds doesn't even match the article.   The so-called editorial line, *Privatization simply hasn't worked for health care, mortgage banking, higher education, or prison management,* is taken verbatim froom the article.  You don't consider that a *match*?                                  When you tell your husband that the boob comments aren't welcome, what does he say?  You have told him, haven't you?                                                                        ...for all *intents and* purposes, but that's a *moot* point.                                                Been to Cuenca yet?         What about the swaddling, shushing and the others?  Is there something wrong with every one?                                    Sorry and thanks.    Damn, I wish the OP could be edited.  Thanks for that.            The entire title and headline is taken from the article.   When I post something I've seen on Common Dreams I try to link to the original article, as is recommended. I hadn't seen the post by wang-banger.   The entire headline is taken from the article.  Let's see your pick of something to put after the article title.   We like it too.   Cross post away...   How would it be if thousands of protesters swarmed a city but not in clustered groups?  Just in twos or threes but all over a really wide area -- all peaceably carrying signs without obstructing vehicle or pedestrian traffic.  Make it so everyone in that city would continually see the protest.    Just heard a podcast about Michael Gazzaniga.  I'm planning to read [Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain](http://www.amazon.com/Whos-Charge-Free-Science-Brain/dp/0061906107/).  Maybe you'd like it too.   **...there are a ton...**    There's no lack of clarity in *for you and I* but it still bugs me. I agree on singular *they* and sentence-ending prepositions.     I get annoyed at constructions such as *for my wife and I* or *just between you and I*. Does that make me dumb? Actually my annoyance is more with the school teachers who always corrected *Johnny and me* to *Johnny and I* without providing any context.   From the article: It has been my experience that many anti-authoritarians labeled with psychiatric diagnoses usually dont reject all authorities, simply those theyve assessed to be illegitimate ones, which just happens to be a great deal of societys authorities.   Some 'victims abroad' would probably disagree.   Seems it's you who is jumping the gun when you think he says anonymous comments are inherently wrong.    What I saw was that they don't carry any weight.   Pick an area of the world about which you have some curiosity and go there.  Stay in hostels and guest houses.  If you get too bored there, go somewhere else in that country or to a nearby country.  Just stay out of your home country for several months, ideally 6 or more.   It's a mystery to me that this subreddit has managed to stay relatively sane and respectful.  :)  xoxoxy   Looks like an African elephant.  Can it be?   How about intelligence that is *grown* -- that arises from interacting with the environment?  Would that be considered artificial, or would it be 'true' intelligence comiing from an artificial entity?   The Nikon D5000 has a flip screen but it may be out of your reach.  If you can, borrow a camera with a flip screen and try it out.    For me a flip screen has become a must-have.  But then I like the candid camera aspect and being able to shoot macros of ground level stuff without lying on my belly.   Better not to keep your camera in the 45L pack.  How about a waist pack?  And look into a flip-twist (articulated) LCD screen.  They are great for raising the camera over your head to see over crowds, for flowers and stuff close to the ground if you're into that, and especially for candid photos where people don't know you're photographing them -- people pay more attention to where you're looking than where the lens is pointing.   Why wouldn't you read the article before responding?   Not that kind of down.  Indifferent to hip-hop, bling seems like empty posturing.   I'm 74 and I know of many of us geezers who support OWS and are down on SOPA/PIPA, Citizens United and the rest of the corporatist agenda.   Deliberate government decisions to adopt austerity programs have tended to be followed by hard times.    We cannot help but be a society of strangers, yet underneath this, we cannot be a society at all unless we recognize our mutual obligations to one another. It is possible that our rude ancestors had it right all along: that obligations are more important than debts, and that amnesties are the key to economic and social order. Surely this question faces us now with a force that cannot be ignored. We are truly in each others debt, but it is a debt that extends beyond the mere payment of the sum of money.    If you're in a state that's safe for Obama, like I am, you can feel okay about voting third party.   What are your thoughts on Cuenca?   It's a direct quote from the article but I admit the lack of context makes it confusing.   Loving the article first, that one blurb comes waaaaay after.   I remeber seeing something that persuaded me [range voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting) was better than IRV.  There are so many [voting system criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRV_voting#Voting_system_criteria) that no single system satisfies them all.   Interesting to see the varied reactions.  They *all* seem ungrammatical to me when judging by SAE but I don't really stumble over any of them.   I grew up in and have lived in several regions and countries so maybe getting used to 'funny' ways of talking is easier for me.  The differences are fascinating though.   [YES]    Thanks, after reading the links I understand the concern.   I recently subscribed to GMP but I'm not otherwise 'affiliated.' The article was interesting to me.  What's the touchy history?   It's directly from the Krugman article.  Before that it's of unknown origin though [widely used](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_beatings_will_continue_until_morale_improves).   Guess I do a pretty piss poor job of the clan/tribe/pack thing. When traveling in New Zealand and Australia I'd get into a rant and have local people reassuring me that they understood all Americans didn't support Bush.   Sure.  That line was taken directly from the article.  This says it better but is too long for a headline:   Malone and Woolley didnt find that women per se were the key to a good C factor. Its just that social sensitivity, which was overwhelmingly the leading ingredient in high C factor, was overly correlated to women. In fact, when they controlled for the number of women in a group, it was shown that it was the emotional sensitivity scores which won out. So adding a woman to a team no more guarantees higher success rates than adding an Aaron to your dance party will make it a success.    Thanks, that looks like what she needs.   My friend needs to be able to describe and tag her photos and then put them on a CD.  The CD would be for archival purposes and also to gives a copy to someone who didn't have an internet connection.   From the article:   As we work on specific policy issues, lets organize with an eye toward building not coalitions but communities. In hard times, coalitions evaporate, but communities have a shot at surviving.    I haven't seen it.  It's $26.25 from [2mminutes.com](http://www.2mminutes.com/products/pc/viewPrd.asp?idProduct=22).   He says:  Democrats continuously voted for Bush policies because they were either indifferent to their enactment or actively supported them, and were owned and controlled by the same factions as the GOP.   What a strangle hold!    This is the way evolution does it, I believe.   If the only way to prevent that is to do a search before submitting, I'm not sure that's always practical.   Do any agents search sites like reddit looking for possibile violations they can pursue?  How would they go about pursuing it?   Correct.   Interactive Brokers, because trades in my IRA account are only $1, with a $20/month minimum.   Which part of the article led you to believe he was advocating that someone else should decide what you listen to or watch?   Nope, just thought it was interesting.   This should be required reading for engineers, architects, city planners, building inspectors, and pretty much everyone over the age of 12.  And it would make a terrific movie.   Thanks.

And once again let me say that you chose to read this post even though you knew going in you were going to be negative about it.  And you offered no criticism other than saying you hate how people make these posts.  Instead you could have just kept your mouth shut and commented on other posts that are on the sub that "fit the mold" of what you think should be posted here.   You are a miserable one aren't you?  Who gives a shit if someone wants to fantasy book a match?  It has no bearing on you or your life.  You can easily tell by the title of the post that it is someone's fantasy booking and yet you still read it and why?  To just be an asshole to someone else?

I do like how they have had guys that take the US challenge kick out of it the first time, because it adds to how important that match for that title is.   True, but even when he wasn't just in big matches, it wasn't a move that would be kicked out of regularly.  But yeah I get what you're saying   And a downvote for you because you just had to say something lol   He got too drunk off of Steiner Screwdrivers and forgot his password   Tombstone... rarely kicked out of unless it is a big time match.   Ryder and Henry would be better... That's What I Woo Woo Woo!   He could always answer the open challenge.  A feud between him and Cena would be a breath of fresh air.

Apart from the Show thing he has been in title contention and in the main events and main even feuds.  I think the big thing is that he is coming into his gimmick more naturally now than when it was him doing vince promos every week.   Reddit does not ever stay on something for long without flip flopping.  Remember how much hatred there was for Reigns on here before Mania?  It was to the point where people wanted him fired and legitimately injured.  Now the hatred is so much less.   **Glass Shatters**   HE does matter... or else he wouldn't be getting promo and match time.  He wouldn't be getting feuds, he wouldn't fight Taker at Mania.

But that isn't really too much of a gimmick change   People worrying about his name being Owens now and I'm just sitting here wondering why Armbar is just armbar and not steen-alized?   But what about DX's tanks?   Hardy may not have gotten injured... he just had his other issues   It is really funny how absolutely true this is.   I have a theory on this... every time someone asks where he is, he is kept off TV a month longer.  That is why he will never be back on TV.   True... it was just Nash booking himself to do it that was the big issue   But they are already an established tag team that has beaten many teams.  Would you say the same thing if the Dudley's reunited at the same time, or if ShowMiz did, or Rybaxel?   And PTP do?  They have had a bunch of vignettes and that's it apart from the run in last Monday   Everything has come to life!   Nash ending Goldberg's winning streak   No I get it...

 Can you provide 1 example that something like that even exists ? I don't think you can, because I'm certain that it doesn't. Whereas there are numerous examples of the JIDF existing and thriving.   [You have this article from USA Today about them.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/)  [Then there's this one about the Israeli hasbara program from the HuffingtonPost.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html)  [You also have this one about Israeli college students engaging in social media manipulation from the BBC.](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896)  I look forward to your response, and please, please try to stay on topic. I don't need any of your 'whataboutisms', masquerading as excuses for Israel's pervasive social media propaganda program.    Damn that's a great painting.    Well this is legitimately depressing news.    Okay.    That particular podcast was especially epic. It was the 2nd podcast of yours that I listened to, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could revisit this topic in the near future. That Brookings Institute paper that you sourced, Which Path to Persia,  was equally illuminating and infuriating.     First I just want to say thank you for doing this AMA James.  With that being said my question is what do you consider to be the smoking gun of all well regarded conspiracy theories.  What grand government conspiracy do you think suggests that things are not in fact they way that they seem and that we are being deceived on a massive scale, involving an elaborate conspiracy encompassing powerful interests in the fields of mass media, government,  finance, etc. ? Basically what is/was the conspiracy that opened your eyes to the alternative news world of conspiracy ?    The submission has been up for over 2 hours and no one has pointed this out yet so I'll go ahead   do it. Malaysia's Prime Minister made this very controversial statement while hosting the heads of state of nations like Iran and North Korea. You also have the fact that [Malaysia's Prime Minister also hosted a 9/11 Truth Conference in Malaysia in 2012.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HZdgaViIyI)   Of course 2014 was the year of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 which plunged the nation into chaos and destroyed a great amount of faith in the Malaysian government. The plane going missing basically was and continues to be a PR nightmare for the tiny, island nation that dared to speak out against the most powerful forces in the world.     Nah no problem, for the record I agree with your comment. Just saying that "the Jews" are in control of the world economy is an irresponsible blanket statement, and gives ammunition to those that would seek to discredit us as being racists. Its far more accurate to say that Zionists are in control of the world economy, case in point, Joe Biden, a self-professed Zionist. I'll chalk it up to being an error in delivering his message by the Prime Minister, obviously English is not his first language.    What are you talking about, he says right in the beginning:  "Today the Jews rule this world by proxy, they get others to fight and die. They invented socialism, communism, human rights and democracy, so that persecuting them appears to be wrong. So they enjoy equal rights as others. With this they have gained control of the most powerful countries."  I don't get it, are you hoping that people don't watch this 2:40 second video and just read your comment ? Also the title I went with is the same title as the video on YouTube, I never alter the titles of my submissions. I always go with the title that the person who submitted the original content decided was fitting. Literally the first words in the video are, "Today the Jews".    How is this a petition of poll ? I don't see why it was removed, its a straightforward article. Can you please indicate where/how it is a petition/poll ?    Shill, baby shill.    Right ignore my links and evidence that would implicate you as a paid Israeli shill.   I'm sure I'll see you on another comment thread about Israel, defending their various land grabs, apartheid practices and continued collective oppression of the Palestinian people.    Said the guy who does nothing but post pro-Israel propaganda all day like its their job, which it very well could be. Just a casual perusing of your account shows that all you do is defend Israel with zero nuance in your comments. There isn't one condemnation to be found, and before you begin acting all incredulous about me accusing you of being a Pro-Israel hasbara shill here more than a few examples of this type of pervasive activity taking place on social media.  [There's Israeli college students that do it on behalf of the Israeli government.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/)  [Then we have this article about it from the HuffingtonPost.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html)  [BBC also wrote an article about this highly manipulative practice employed by Israeli's and the Israeli government known as hasbara.](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896)  [There's also the case of a user known as HamBaconEggs who plagued CommonDreams.com with anti semitic comments from something like 20 different accounts just to make it seem like that Jewish people were being persecuted on CommonDreams and it was a bastion for anti-semitism.

HamBaconEggs and his 20 other accounts were all the same person and CommonDreams had to launch an investigation to get to the bottom of it.

Swede !    Right, well your buddy on this comment thread Kobe got shadowbanned for trying to incite a witch hunt against me so I'd be careful about conspiring witch hunts against me on my own comment thread. Its a violation of Reddiquette to initiate witch hunts against other users. As for reporting me to the admins, go right ahead I have nothing to hide. My IP address proves I am 1 person with 1 account. So happy witch hunting.   If only India and China would set aside their differences and unite forces with Russia to create an Eastern block that could greatly raise the living standards of people in those 3 nations. They've been divided to the benefit of the West for far to long. Divide and conquer, the old adage rings as true now as ever.   How can the BRICS nations really expect to give the existing world order a shake up with their 2nd and 3rd most powerful countries constantly at each others throats over control of Southeast Asia ?    Again, instead of ignoring me and attempting to incite a witch hunt against me why don't you address me directly ?  How do you think I am manipulating votes ?   Are you sure you're not just butthurt because the majority of my submissions to /r/politics regularly make the front page ?   Cause it certainly seems that way to me.    WTF are you talking about !?   Please cite how I am "clearly gaming the system."  You are inciting a witch-hunt against me, which can get you shadow banned. I look forward to your response on how I'm gaming the system. Sorry my posts regularly being at the top of the page here and resonating with the /r/politics community has you so butthurt /s.    I agree, my favorite thing about listening to his podcast is his even keeled nature. Alex Jones, with his fear mongering and bombast does the entire 'conspiracy community' a disservice by acting so crazy on national television.   Corbett on the other hand has a very professorial style of delivery, with his constant citations and level tone of voice. I've referred to him a few times here on /r/conspiracy as the antidote to Alex Jones.    Literally the 1st paragraph in the article:  'The number of homeless residents in New York City, the largest city in the United States, reached a record high this month at more than 56,000 people. Halfway around the world, another metropolis recently hit a homeless record of its own: just 1,697 people are currently homeless in Tokyo, also its countrys largest city and the most populated city in the world, a record low since surveys began in 2002.'   Do you have any links citing even 1 example of people being paid to post pro-Palestine or anti-Israel material ?   The answer is no, because no such program exists.

Former Senator Graham has stated that what is in those 28 redacted pages directly links Saudi Arabia to the 9/11 hijackers. If that is the case, do you think that a grassroots effort by your organization could place pressure on certain key elected officials to introduce more bipartisan legislation to get the 28 pages declassified ?   In other words, could it really be that simple ?

Do you think that the 28 classified pages could be the holy grail of the 9/11 truth movement ?

Do you think that the 28 classified pages could/should be the holy grail of the 9/11 truth movement ?   Thanks, they haven't responded to my last retort and that was over an hour ago.   This is the 1st reply message I received from a mod at /r/worldnews, its from /u/green_flash:  "Not every Israel/Palestine-related story is major world news. This one surely isn't."  I'll keep you guys posted.    That is a great quote,  its the open secret that no sitting politician is allowed to utter. Scratch that, no important public figure is allowed to utter, anyone who has a voice out there that shines a light on this fact is immediately slandered, discredited and derided by the very machine they attempted to expose. Nixon was a dirty politician and he gets the entire force of the media brought down upon him. Whereas someone like Bush can steal an election, invade Iraq, create a decade-plus long clusterfuck in the Middle East, oversee an economic calamity and never seriois talk of impeachment. Its absolutely because someone like Bush is a staunch ally of Israel. Nixon illegally wiretaps a handful of politicians and he's the greatest enemy to freedom amd liberty to ever sit in the Oval Office, Bush amd Obama illegally wiretap the entire country via the NSA and those very same media establishments largely trip over themselves to defend and justify their actions, effectively pacifying the public. The level of hypocrisy is unbelievable.      Is it any coincidence the media then sought out to destroy and marginalize Nixon forcing him to resign. Think of all of the atrocities committed by other presidents before and after Nixon, the media didn't make it their sole purpose to force them out of office. Gee, I wonder why ? One of these things is not like the other. It is often said that the media destroying Nixon post-Watergate was the 1st demonstration of, "the power of the press", they sure aren't kidding about that. Was it really about Watergate, or was Watergate just a convenient excuse to get rid of the last president that wasn't completely subservient to them ?   I messaged the admins about you, you are insane, you are deleting your comments to cover your tracks, but you are spamming this same comment in the comments section of all of my /r/worldnews submissions. You have dedicated this account to defaming me and assassinating my character, you are a spammer, you are stalking me on Reddit, and are sending me harassing PM's. BTW, the fact that you have to resort to this kind of ad hominem attacks and character assassination only proves that you are losing the debate on the actual issue (Israel/Palestine).

You're delusional if you think that putting up blockade walls around the West Bank and Gaza is not annexing it. They have checkpoints for Palestinians to cross into Israel in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians can't even get simple building supplies and medicine through Israel's inhumane blockade, leaving the Palestinians to fester in an open-air prison. Israel is overseeing a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. So if they don't have boots on the ground there its okay, as long as they imprison and confine them it doesn't count as annexation, good fucking luck with that 1.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/04/is-israels-blockade-worth-fighting-for/     Right I forgot, any news source that is staffed predominantly by Arabs is considered "a local source" and not credible in the eyes of the mainstream media, remind me again, what is the ethnicity of the people that run the mainstream media, cause it certainly isn't Arab ?

This is the response I got from the mod u/EightRoundsRapid :   "Is every road traffic accident world news?"   He said, without a hint of irony.    No other country does what Israel does in their Israeli hasbara program. Don't try to act like Russia and China have such pervasive propaganda programs, they actually have enough people of Chinese or Russian descent to actually be sympathetic to their cause and realize that their nation is rarely the aggressor in international disputes. Its usually the warmongering United States. Here are some links about Israeli hasbara and the JIDF, thought it sounds like you have your mind made up and are going to try to minimize the affects of Israel's government mandated international propaganda program:  http://www.commondreams.org/hambaconeggs  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Internet_Defense_Force  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/   The black panthers also don't get $3 billion plus in aid from the US government and lobby for US intervention in needless wars that fit their interests in the Middle East, the way that AIPAC does for the US to wage war on Iran.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy   Never mind, make that 3 times you've referenced 1 removal of a story critical of Palestinians that was removed.    How many times are you going to cite that 1 example, this is the 2nd time you've done so, just on the comments for this submission ?    They also just removed this story about an Israeli settler running over 2 girls in occupied Palestine, killing a 5-year old under the auspices that and these are the moderator, u/EightRoundsRapid exact words:  "Is every road traffic accident world news?"  Here's the link to my submission:  http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jr046/jewish_settler_runs_over_2_palestinian_children/  I messaged the mod in question about the selective censorship that had taken place and I'm awaiting their response.    That's right, keep on blaming the victims. Clearly the oppressed are the ones with all the power in the situation /s.    I wonder how long until the mods remove this for some bullshit, contrived reason. Anything critical of Israel must go. Just ask u/anutensil. That mod is practically an Israeli hasbara agent.    I think since Israel's war on Gaza this past summer the censorship has increased greatly. The PR battle on r/worldnews was evident to anyone who spent time there, that's also when they introduced filters, the first filter was "Israel/Palestine". Israel-related news stories also get downvoted into oblivion like never before as well, I can't submit anything about Israel without it immediately showing zero upvotes and just 25% or 50% upvoting it.    Here is the reply I received from u/anutensil about the removal of my submission:  "News about Israel   Palestine has always tended to overwhelm /r/worldnews, so guidelines were set in place years ago about what is considered major and what should be directed to /r/Israel or /r/Palestine, which were created, in part, to handle the overflow.  This particular story may become more significant in the future, but considering the context, it is not considered a major story at this time."  Make of that what you will. I don't know how much energy I have left to continue going to r/worldnews to keep on fighting the good fight.   I was going to get into a long exchange with u/anutensil about this, but I just didn't feel like it today. [Also, what with the recent news on how Google News will now start including r/worldnews in their search results you have to expect that the likes of u/anutensil will be flipping the subjective censorship into overdrive. I knew as soon as I read about this, that it would even further negatively impact r/worldnews.](http://searchengineland.com/internets-front-page-reddit-now-worthy-google-news-205180)  R/worldnews used to be a place where you went to get the news stories that the mainstream media ignored, it is now a shell of its former self. All you get there now is the mainstream media echo chamber, its basically a sub dedicated to Russia/ISIS/Ebola-fear mongering.   You certaintly won't hear anything critical of Israel there anymore, not after Google basically condoned r/worldnews selective censorship by putting them alongside the mainstream news outlets in their news search results. I'm certain the admins also congratulated the mods of r/worldnews on that recent revelation and probably told them to keep up the good work, or something to that effect.   Furthermore, I don't think anyone should come down to hard on u/AssuredlyaThrowAway, he's the lowest mod on their totem pole, and to expect him to burn bridges in worldnews just to make a statement is childish. If you want to direct your ire somewhere, direct it to the mod that is responsible for this, u/anutensil. There's 26 mods on r/worldnews and he only has 1 account and 1 vote.    The mods said it wasn't posted in the appropriate subreddit. This, a story about settlers from one country, burning down a mosque in a different country is considered to be, "Not Appropriate Subreddit". I took that to mean that any criticism of Israel is not appropriate for this subreddit. I really can't believe it. They removed it about an hour ago and I messaged them about it immediately, I still haven't heard back yet and I'm sure they are going to drag their feet on this, if not ignore my message entirely. With this strategy, they get to put off approving the submission until tomorrow morning when the submission will be, approximately 20 hours old and still be sitting at the same 870 upvotes that it garnered in just 9 hours. Thereby relegating it to no longer front page material, effectively censoring it out of visibility. The mods think they're so clever. That's what's going to end up happening to my front page submission about this subject. It was critical of Israel so its not appropriate for this supposed worldnews subreddit.    "War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it."   - George Orwell    Red Ice Radio.   Red Ice Radio recently got banned from iTunes because they aired a podcast with the director of our recent documentary of the week selection, Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told. In that podcast they discussed historical revisionism and how the victors of World War II are the only ones allowed to expound anything about World War II or Adolf Hitler.    Its not my title, its the title from the author of the article. I never alter the titles of my submissions to mislead Redditors into upvoting clickbait titles that don't accurately reflect the authors intended message in the article.    Well that's what happens when you basically criminalize non-violent protests. Its a lot easier to manufacture consent when you don't physically see people protesting foreign policy in the streets on your commute home from your cubicle.    Yes, I do, at least more than I trust other alternative news sources. He's the only alternative news/ conspiracy podcast guy that talks about the evils of Israel and Zionism which buys him a great deal of credibility in my book.    It is said that no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.    Nelson Mandela   Sounds like Australia just got their very own version of the NDAA.    James Corbett did a great episode of his podcast on Noam Chomsky and how he fits the criteria of your classic academic gatekeeper. He parrots the 9/11 official story without batting an eyelash, the man is classic controlled opposition. [Here's the link to the podcast if you're interested, its called Meet Noam Chomsky, Academic Gatekeeper](http://www.corbettreport.com/meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper-video/)   Netanyahu: No chance for peace deal unless the people we're committing genocide on, allow us to continue our genocide    If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.    Oscar Wilde, The Nightingale and the Rose   People don't want to know, the average American appears to be blissful in their ignorance. The way that Americans are taught history is in a childlike good vs. evil paradigm, there's no room for nuance in this paradigm. Take the biggest history lesson we're given in our compulsory education for example, World War II. We're taught that the Allies were the good guys while the Axis nations were pure evil, that is the same application used to judge world events by Americans. They're happy being the good guys, as juvenile as the notion is.    Unprovoked ad-hominem attacks are a sure sign of someone winning a debate /s.    What clout does the USA have over Israel, every time the US asks Israel not to do build new settlements on illegally seized land they're given the equivalent of the middle finger from the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu or Avigdor Lieberman. [Here's an article about how Netanyahu told Obama to "Never second guess him again", is that what you consider having clout over another country ?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/02/netanyahu-hamas_n_5643852.html)  [Then barely a week later, Netanyahu has the balls to ask the US to help him avoid war crime charges at the UN. Netanyahu goes from, "Don't ever second guess me" to "Please save my rotten war crime committing administration". What an ungrateful asshole.](http://nypost.com/2014/08/06/netanyahu-asks-us-to-help-israel-avoid-war-crime-charges/)   When all else fails, resort to ad-hominem attacks. Its good to know you're losing the debate on this thread.    Yea you aren't allowed to say that Jews are much wealthier than Muslims and are very influential in politics.   We live in an insane world when you can't state the truth without being downvoted into oblivion or called an anti-Semite.  [The single largest donor in the 2012 presidential election was Sheldon Adelson, a conservative Jewish billionaire who openly advocates for US military action against Iran and argues against diplomacy against Iran. Now I bet that has nothing to do with Israel, it probably has to do with using the US military to attack Iran to protect his chain of hotel casinos /s.](http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/23/sheldon-adelson-nuke-iran/)    Recognition, its about damn time for some recognition. I've said for a long time that the 1st country that recognizes Palestine will come from Western Europe. The US only ever pays lip service to the 2 state solution, while simultaneously funding the continued oppression of the Palestinian people.    Swede !    Swede !    Ok, I'll delete my submission and resubmit with the exact title.    [The Money Masters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq9yjt_JbWs)  The Money Masters is a 1996 three and a half hour non-fiction, historical documentary film that discusses the concepts of money, debt, taxes, and describes their development from biblical times onward. It also covers the history of fractional-reserve banking, central banking, monetary policy, the bond market, and the Federal Reserve System in the United States.  This is a must-watch for anyone interested in monetary policy or the Rothschild dynasty.    These kinds of videos always give me a freedom boner.    I got banned from r/documentaries for reposting this after it was initially removed.   They definitely don't want criticism of Israel to become a regular thing over there. About a month ago, I got a documentary about AIPAC to be #1 on r/documentaries with over 1000 upvotes and more than 1000 comments.   After I began inquiring to the mods about why my doc kept getting removed and why I was being hassled about reposting it, they accused me of having an agenda and not wanting anyone to use r/documentaries as a platform for anything in particular.   When I asked if the fact that the submission was about Israel had anything to do with it being removed, I was derided for being a conspiracy theorist. Shortly thereafter I was banned. They accused me of having an agenda, when I countered and said it was in fact the mods that were removing documentaries critical of Israel and they were the ones with the agenda, I was banned.   I messaged them 2 hours ago about my ban, and nothing yet. They responded to the rest of my messages pretty quickly, so we shall see ...    NOOICE !    Sure, 100% of them are rapists, murderers and thieves, that's what private prisons consist of.   There's no way the vast majority of prisoners are nonviolent drug offenders /s.    You should have made a self.conspiracy submission about you being banned from r/history for posting this documentary. It would illustrate the level of lockstep being used to suppress this documentary. This documentary was also removed from YouTube and Vimeo. If it happened to me I would definitely let people know that I was banned simply for suggesting a documentary.    Loud and clear.   Over.    [Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=eaf_1382262528)  This documentary is responsible for radically changing my worldview, more than any other film I've ever seen.   I consider myself above all to be a history buff, conspiracy, trivia, popular culture, these things come after what I consider to be a very good grasp of history. When you find out that you have been lied to you, your entire life, about the events that occurred in World War II; you will feel completely betrayed/hoodwinked by US history or propaganda on the matter. The propaganda is so pervasive and saturating that you will not be able to get over the deception. There has never been a more 1-sided story told, than the story of Adolf Hitler.   Also as an added caveat, this documentary has the rare distinction of being so controversial that it was censored by YouTube   Vimeo.   This documentary answers so many questions, and it portrays Hitler as being more than your usual psychopathic, power-hungry, raving anti-Semite.   If you really want to go down the rabbit hole, you have to watch this movie about the greatest conspiracy of all, the fact that our own history has been hijacked. The 'history' that we are taught in our compulsory state-mandated education is nothing more than Ally propaganda, amplified by 70 years of documentaries   Hollywood movies vilifying Hitler.  If you do decide to watch this documentary, just keep 2 very prescient quotes in mind beforehand:  He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.    George Orwell, 1984     History is written by the victors.    Winston Churchill  Also, take into account that in the 12 years of compulsory education that you receive in the US, you don't spend a single history lesson learning about World War II from a German perspective. In democratically electing Hitler, Germans are written off by Western historians as collectively being gripped by a national lunacy. My response to this method of 1-sided teaching of a subject as expansive is World War II is utter incredulity. How can you expect someone to know anything about a war, when they are only teaching 1-side of the issue ?   After you watch this movie, it will become apparent that we are all the victims of rampant historical revision. Everything that Hitler accomplished in a short amount of time, like lifting tens of millions of Germans out of dire poverty, has been effectively revised out of all the history books. Now, even if you are taking a college level history course, all that is taught about Hitler is that he was a raving racist. Not that his Chancellorship oversaw the most astonishing economic recovery in the history of human civilization. The fact that Hitler began issuing government-sanctioned currency and went around the fiat currency, central banking system that he saw as parasitic; was revolutionary.   The real reason the powers that be went after Hitler is because he sought to systemically change the banking system, he wanted to issue debt-free German currency from the central government. The powers behind international finance could not allow such a thing to occur as it would expose their parasitic, money as debt, fiat currency system.    YouTube and Vimeo have both removed this documentary. The only quasi-well knows website I know that hasn't censored this documentary, LiveLeak. Just the fact that Vimeo   YouTube wouldn't allow this documentary on there websites speaks volumes.  I know its 6 hours but once you start watching it, it really begins to fly by.   Best, most mind-blowing documentary ever.   All I can say to people considering watching this documentary is to prepare to change your worldview in its entirety.   Also, before you watch this movie, ask yourself 1 question:  How come in the 12 years of compulsory education you receive in the US where you get World War 2   the Holocaust drilled in your head from the Allies perspective every single year, how come you don't spend a single history class studying World War 2 from the German perspective ? Why is the German interpretation of those events never taught in school, even for a single history lesson ?    Just to let you know, the mods deleted your top comment on this thread. Pretty fucked up if you ask me.    Yea Afghanistan is also currently under military occupation by the United States, that is why its foreign aid levels are currently so high, whereas Israel's foreign aid is never going to go away. Afghanistan is getting foreign aid from the US in return for being occupied by tens of thousands of US soldiers, continually for the last 5 years.   Remind me again, when was that long US-Israel war that the United States is still repaying Israel for ? Oh right, it never happened, so why the fuck are we giving them so much foreign aid ?   Furthermore, the average Israeli gets more than $408.40 a year, per-capita from the US taxpayer, compare that to the average Afghan, who gets $423, per-capita from US taxpayers and has to put up with that pesky, US military to boot.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Recipients  [Also, there's the fact that total US aid to Israel over the last 6 decades amounts to $233.7 billion, or $3.9 billion a year, for 60 years.](http://www.haaretz.com/business/u-s-aid-to-israel-totals-233-7b-over-six-decades.premium-1.510592)    The real reason the Israeli defense minister is saying these things is because Turkey is planning on sending an aid flotilla through the Israeli blockade of Gaza to get much needed food, medicine and water to the people of Gaza. [No one has done more for the Palestinian people than Turkey, and that is what really bothers the Israeli defense minister. When he says "supporting terrorism", what he really wants to say is, "supporting Palestinians".](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/europe/turkey-aid-flotilla-is-planned-for-gaza.html?_r=0)   "The main purpose of the stock market is to make fools of as many men as possible."   -  Bernard Baruch   [It has to be Bulls on Parade, the song is all about governments use of military contracts for business revenues. Its classic Smedley Butler material.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L4YrGaR8E4)   Yea right, sorry the Palestinians can't be as honorable as the Na'vi from Avatar.   These people have been oppressed more than any other group of people on Earth and now they are being given grief for resorting to guerrilla tactics.   The Palestinians are living under the an occupying regime, when you are under occupation you resort to tactics you otherwise wouldn't. Its as simple as that, use guerrilla tactics against a better funded, better equipped enemy with strong international backing, or perish.   The Palestinians are resisting an occupying force, a practice as old as warfare itself.   The Israeli's are wantonly wreaking havoc across the West Bank and Gaza to try to force the Palestinians out. All the Israeli's have wanted from the Palestinians from day 1 is the Palestinians land and for the Palestinians to then promptly fuck off.   Just look at the most recent, brazen, theft of land in the West Bank. Netanyahu just got behind a podium 2 days ago and announced that Israel would be stealing 988 acres of Palestine. No reason in particular, just for the fuck of it. How can anyone just announce they are annexing almost 1000 acres of another country.   Anywhere else on Earth what Israel just did would result in war with a neighboring country. Why should the Palestinians be held to a higher standard when they are literally watching their future country disappear around them, 1 illegal land seizure at a time.    I like the [Kennedy Assassination: 24 Hours After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLtiw_x-Ik8)  It does a great job depicting all of the strange things that happened in the immediate aftermath of the assassination. I think the Kennedy Assassination is the ultimate conspiracy, it laid the foundation for the shadow government and military industrial complex to completely control the United States. Kennedy was the last, real Commander-in-Chief, or at least he thought he was, right until the end.    The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.    George Orwell   They just removed this story from /r/worldnews entirely, the highest spot it now occupies is #34, its not on the front page at all. What a goddamn shame. Shit like that really destroys my faith in Reddit.  No sub bothers me as much as /r/wordnews. Its always the same recipe, remove all submissions about Israel that are climbing to the front page of r/worldnews, and when a post starts climbing to the front and the comments haven't been rigged in favor of Israel, just remove it for being "covered by other articles". I love it, covered by other articles, has to be the most bullshit reason to remove articles.   if a Palestinian fires a rocket during a ceasefire its all over the front page of r/worldnews, multiple links at a time, but when Israel ends a ceasefire by annexing nearly a thousand acres, its nowhere to be found on r/worldnews.   If you want to know who rules over you, find out who you are not allowed to criticize.    The land was taken first, that is not a question. The land was taken, then the rockets began coming, let's keep out timeline straight here. Its not like the Palestinians just began firing rockets 1 day for the fuck of it. They were dispossessed, put under occupation and were forced to live as 2nd class citizens with permanent refugee status in their own country. Then came the rockets.    That video is hasbara at its finest. The only way they could have done it better is by having it posted it by someone who doesn't have an account full of pro-Israel talking points. Had they posted it from an account that stayed away from the entire Israel-Palestine conflict it would have made it appear as though, this Redditor was objectively impressed by the Iron Dome's technological capabilities.   I can't believe these hasbara agents are doing so well on r/worldnews and r/news that they've begun bleeding into other major subreddits.    This is Israeli hasbara, propaganda at its finest. [Here is a link about the program Israel has, where they pay college students to astroturf social media forums with pro-Israel propaganda and talking points.](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html)  All u/KVillage1 does on Reddit is defend Israel and their atrocities. Just casually peruse through his post history, almost every single comment is in defense of Israel. There is no nuance in his iterations, just Israeli propaganda. If Israel is in the right here, then why do they feel the need to pay Israeli college students to disseminate this sort of propaganda. [Here is another link on this incredibly dishonest and manipulative practice that Israel engages in by having paid propaganda agents on social media hubs like Facebook and Reddit.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/)  The Palestinians don't have paid PR agents to astroturf their talking points on Facebook all day, they are more worried about getting food, water and medicine into Gaza, past Israel's inhumane blockade. Instead all the Palestinians have is people like me, who can see past the media blitz and all of the Israeli internet propaganda to make this look like an even sided battle. It is not an even battle, 1 side has sophisticated, US funded technology, whereas the other is being kept in an open air prison, otherwise known as the Israeli blockade.   How can these Israel apologists expect the Palestinians to be subjected to being held in the deplorable, sub-human conditions, that Israel has subjected the Palestinians people to. Israel are the conquerors, they are mostly European Jews, colonizing a Middle Eastern nation. How can you possibly expect the native people to not try to fight against an occupying force ?    "The main points were: one, the amount of Israel's nuclear weapons, how many Israel had, that no one could predict or know, including the CIA. They were thinking about a number like 10 or 15. But I came out with a number between 150 to 200."   - Mordechai Vanunu    Please provide an example for these baseless assertions. Otherwise you are attacking my character simply for standing up for the rights of the Palestinian people, the victims in this quagmire.     "OP, you've admitted to jew baiting."  WTF !?   When did I admit to, in your words "Jew bating" ? Why don't you hurl some more baseless ad hominem attacks at me without addressing the topic whatsoever.    I just wish this story was getting more traction. U wanna hear something spooky ? So I went to post this article to r/worldnews and it, unsurprisingly had already been submitted. Here's the scary part, when I clicked on the username of the OP, u/drone499, it turns out they had been recently shadowbanned.   Further cementing my theory that the most taboo subject on Reddit is pro-Israel astroturfing/Hasbara/JIDF. I accused someone on r/worldnews of being a pro-Israel shill about a month ago, and I was promptly reported as a spammer and had to spend the next 2 hours exchanging messages with the admins to prove I'm not a spam-bot or spammer.   If there is 1 thing that is off-limits on Reddit it is Hasbara/JIDF. It's scary to think about how much influence these pro-Israel shills have on this website. They seem to operate with complete impunity.   Here's the link to the submission to r/worldnews about this subject, then click on the users profile, this was most likely the last thing he ever submitted to Reddit.   http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2e3igz/the_double_identity_of_an_antisemitic_commenter/?already_submitted=true   I fucking love CommonDreams for doing this.    This song was pulled from the US release of Is This It due to the line, "New York City cops / They ain't too smart"not exactly a popular sentiment in the wake of 9/11.    That cop looks like a cross between Hank from Breaking Bad and Michael Chiklis's character from the Shield.   Man, I watch way to many cop shows. I've always thought that all the cop shows on television are to condition us to love the police.    That cop looks like Hank from Breaking Bad.    Maybe if there wasn't an Israeli blockade stopping Gazans from being able to tend to their wounded this would've never happened.  Say what you want to about Hamas and their primitive rockets, Hamas are not the ones imposing a blockade on Israel and forcing them to live in an open air prison. Gazans can't even get medical supplies, water or food and they are the ones getting all the grief.   Maybe these rocket attacks were retribution for Israel's blockade stopping someone in Gaza from saving the life of a loved one.   If you want peace you have to end the blockade, take down the Great Apartheid Wall of Israel. No one has ever been able to strike a peace deal with an oppressed minority group by keeping them locked in an open air prison and rationing their calories.    As a former Sikh, current atheist, I can't begin to describe how reprehensible I find this story. Its very believable though, both times in my life that I've been called a sandnigger it was by 2 different white guys in pick-up trucks.   I hope they hit this piece of shit with hate-crime charges, the race of his victim was clearly foremost on the assailants mind during the attack.   Seriously, fuck this guy. The last time I was called a sandnigger was when I was crossing the street, walking home from high school and this dude, completely unprovoked yells at me as I'm reaching the other side of the road:  "Fucking sandnigger !"   Then he just drove off, I couldn't even believe it had happened I was like in shock. This piece of shit was like a middle-aged guy just driving around his pick up truck calling young, brown men sandniggers. This all went down in a suburb of Philadelphia, so not exactly the deep South, and we still have this kind of simple-minded racism.    I think it should be Money Masters. I know its 3+ hours long, but its a damn shame that Bill Still doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. Maybe a surge in views of his seminal piece of work, The Money Masters, will lend him some more credence.    "Called the President a terrorist  Corporate sponsors like, how the fuck you gon' embarrass us?

I didn't put in quotes, the author of the article put it in quotes. I thought it would be disingenuous for me to alter the title in any way. I never change the titles of my submissions. Maybe if you actually clicked on the link you would've noticed that little detail.    I bet your buddy Howard Stern loves the idea of this boycott /s. I'm sure you heard his temper tantrum last week about how apparently if you're anti-Israel then that somehow makes you anti-America.    Yea those comments are murder. I wish someone would take out the best clips of Joe and Abby talking Israel/Palestine and make it into a condensed version of the podcast video that isn't 3 hours. I'm trying to avoid having to edit the video myself and post it here, but it was a great conversation. It takes Joe a lot of balls to critically discuss Israel/Palestine like that, living in Los Angeles and working in Hollywood he's really playing with fire.    If I know Israel and their PR machine, they're going to turn this kidnapped soldier into Woody Harrelson's character from Wag the Dog.   They're going to have carefully arranged PR stunts surrounding the soldier and his safety and well being. Maybe a viral picture of the kidnapped soldier looking rugged and handsome or something that will resonate with American military families.    I posted a comment yesterday on r/worldnews yesterday about the presence of JIDF and hasbara on Reddit and I was promptly reported for spam. I spent the next hour explaining how I'm not a spammer or bot to the admins to avoid being shadowbanned. In case you're wondering who reported me it was u/foamed. They don't want you talking about JIDF or Hasbara on Reddit. At least that's what I gathered. What a cunty way to silence dissenting voices.    FTA:  "Tappers numbers are accurate, but there remains some question about who bears responsibility for the deaths of every Palestinian child. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True."   Corbett Report is really an amazing source of information. I think that James Corbett is the perfect representative of the conspiracy community, with his professional citations and calm speaking voice James is an indispensable source of strange but true history. The fact that he is able to come off sounding so calm while saying terrifying but true things is the best part of his delivery. The mainstream media is more comfortable with ranting and raving Alex Jones as our figure head, alienating new people from joining or learning more about 9/11, JFK, etc. James Corbett, in more than 1 way is truly the antidote to Alex Jones.    White House then proceeds to green light the replenishing of all of Israel's artillery stockpiles to further enable the bombardment of the Palestinian people.    Thanks u/jennyMcbarfy, I messaged the mods of r/spam and told them about what had just taken place. Had you not made me privy to the fact that u/foamed had reported me for spam I'd be shadowbanned right now and I might still be, but in the meantime I'm here.    That was the most fucked up video I've seen in quite a while.    I think the CIA only released this now because they know that all of the precious few Americans that would've greatly cared about this a few months ago are so tuned out focusing on the madness taking place in Israel/Palestine and Ukraine/Crimea. Basically, who's got time to worry about the erosion of Congress as an institution in the face of the National Security/Military Industrial complex when we are imperiled with World War 3 or the massacre of the Palestinian people.    I'd love to see them explain this 1 away. Did they have to apprehend that boy and tie him to their windshield because Hamas is stockpiling rockets in his pockets ?    Really !?  Way to silence dissenting voices on Reddit.   So if you support Palestine then you deserve to be banned.    Seriously you're going to report me for spam because I don't share your opinions on Israel, you're a real piece of work. Someone doesn't agree with you so you try to take away their ability to have their voice heard.    This post is such pro-war propaganda. OP should be ashamed of themselves for posting such a blatant example of what is clearly hasbara at work. This whole sub has completely changed. Hasbara agents have infiltrated this sub. I get my posts removed if they have a single of instance of opinion or analysis, but this just rockets up to the top of the page. Gee, I wonder why ?   I have had both of my articles removed from r/worldnews today, supposedly because 1 was Opinion/Analysis, funny thing though is that it wasn't. My other submission was climbing near the top of r/worldnews and was critical of Israel, can't have that now can we mods ? They took it down and said it was covered by other articles. I asked them for an example of my article topic having been submitted and they haven't gotten back to me yet, go figure. This is blatant selective censorship of anything that isn't complete pro-Israeli war propaganda or hasbara as they refer to it.    [IDK what you're talking about, the Ayatollah came out the other day and said that the Arab nations in the Middle East should be arming the Palestinians.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/29/iran-israel-gaza_n_5629631.html)   O A every day that's what I say.    Full text in case of paywall, although I didn't get 1:  Over the past two weeks, an increasing number of Facebook pages are reporting on people who express joy at the deaths of IDF soldiers or speak out harshly against the war effort, and calling for them to be dismissed from their jobs.  In some cases the efforts of these individuals have led to dismissals of people who came out against the IDF, or expressed happiness over harm to soldiers. For example, Hadassah College in Jerusalem withdrew a scholarship to an Arab woman student over a Facebook post. Hadassah College President Berthold Friedland wrote the student: We read your post with shock and disgust. Friedland also wrote that until clarifications are completed and the police deal with it, the college management has decided to prohibit you from entering the campus for any reason, academic or other.  Other educational institutions have issued warnings to their staff and students that they must avoid extremist and inappropriate statements on social media, and threatened disciplinary action or to go to the police.  Facebook pages of this type, such as Boycott Haters of Israel, Fifth Column in Israel have received between a few thousand to tens of thousands of Likes. In one case, the administrators of the Facebook page of the food chain Tiv Taam responded to a report on the Facebook page Concentration of Destroyers of Israel by saying that one of its employees, who had expressed happiness at the death of soldiers and Jews, had been fired.  Last week, the Lod municipality dismissed a psychological counsellor, Isra Gara of Jatt, after she expressed joy at the death of soldiers.  Shufer-Sol food chain reported on its own Facebook page that two employees had been summoned to a hearing before dismissal, due to reports the two had made what it deemed unacceptable comments, and warned that employees who did so would be fired.  The mobile phone company Cellcom also summoned an employee for clarifications following a number of reports about statements she had allegedly made.  Ben-Gurion University President Prof. Rivka Carmi wrote to students and staff that the university was following the discourse on the Web, and if need be would act according to the disciplinary code. Tel Aviv University also warned in a letter to faculty against hurtful and extremist statements by students or faculty. Thirty faculty members signed a letter of protest against the move.   The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses.    Malcolm X   To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.    Voltaire   Hanzi, you fucker !   I knew exactly who you are.  I heard you on O A a while ago, I don't listen to Howard anymore on account of him sucking a fat one for a long time. I do however have an interesting theory to run past you. It's my Sirius/XM conspiracy. I'm sure you heard about Anthony Cumia getting the axe ?   Well my theory for the reason Antony got fired is because he is the single loudest, most influential, pro-gun personality on Sirius/XM. On the other end of the spectrum you have a hypocrite like Howard Stern who is anti-gun but has a permit to carry in NYC, which is incredibly hard to acquire. If you call him on it he'll tell you:  "But I'm a celebrity, I need one to ensure my safety, you know cause I'm so famous. Ho hoo."   Basically he's saying he can carry a gun because his safety is so vital to the community whereas us plebeians don't deserve them because we are the poor unwashed masses, our lives don't have as much inherent value as old Howard from the Hamptons.   BTW: I admire your attempt at getting through to Opie and Anthony, but they're hopeless and Jim Norton too. They are conservative guys and they can't hear anything that would upset their worldview and America's role in it as a beacon of freedom or soaring eagle or something else they can get a freedom boner to. It made for good radio though.    I get that a lot of people are going to see this submission and think to themselves:  "He's a shock jock, who cares what the hell he thinks ?"  Stern has the most heard voice in the Western hemisphere, his own radio show opening theme song boasts about reaching more than 10 million listeners a day. He's in people's cars, in their headphones, he has an intimate relationship with his fans, in short he wields a tremendous amount of influence. Imagine if Jimmy Fallon went on the Tonight Show and went on a rant like Stern did about Israel, it would without question sway public opinion in favor of Israel.    Truth never damages a cause that is just.    Mahatma Gandhi   Myth: USDollar is money. Fact: Gold   Silver are money. USDollar is legal tender/debt brought down to low parcels for spending purposes.    Ziad K. Abdelnour, Economic Warfare: Secrets of Wealth Creation in the Age of Welfare Politics   I'm aware you have to answer 2 questions to be able to view this article but its a good article and I think its worth the 30 seconds it'll take you to answer the couple of questions and get to see the article. It does a good job illustrating Israel's inherent advantage in the social media battle.    FTA:  "As The Jerusalem Post reports, the effort to make Israels case is being spearheaded by 400 college students posting comments, memes, video clips, images and explanatory graphics on Facebook and Twitter from dozens of computers in a Hasbara war room at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Hasbara, a Hebrew euphemism for propaganda, literally means explanation, and the organizers of the campaign promise to equip like-minded volunteers who visit their website, Israel Under Fire, with everything you need in order to properly inform about and advocate for Israel, in 19 languages."   I was also banned for a week as well, perfect, I'll be unbanned as soon as Israel finishes inflicting collective punishment on the entirety of Gaza and its prisoners. How convenient.    Cue the Israel apologists saying :  "Who cares what a celebrity thinks."  Or:  "Really so we're getting our international political advice from pop stars now ? "  The story isn't that she may or may not support Palestine, the story is that whatever forces are at work in Hollywood do not want celebrities to speak their minds on a perceived injustice. It amounts to blatant censorship and for better or worst, most of the time worst, society gets its social cues from celebrities and in this instance people like Rihanna and Dwight Howard from the Houston Rockets are not being allowed to air their grievances.

They say Alternet  rehosts all of their content and an automatic spam filter takes it down immediately so you're on the defensive to the mods as to why your post deserves to stay up. Basically they wouldn't even allow this article to gain any upvotes or traction from the r/politics community before removing it.    This was literally the worst podcast I've ever heard. This guy is just an academic who sits back and talks shit about Muslims the whole time. Whoever heard of a Jewish guy complaining about Palestinians, so brave. This guy is a piece of shit shit, sitting there defending Netanyahu and his apartheid state in Israel.   Hey Guy Saad, since you can't seem to figure out why the Palestinians are so incensed by the here's a little fucking cheat sheet for you. Maybe the reason the Palestinians have a grudge with you guys is because you took their land, forced them to live in hellish, permanently temporary refugee dwellings, leaving them perpetually stateless. 700,000 Palestinians were forced out in 1948 alone.   Then he blames Muslims for all of the instability in the Middle East which is especially egregious because ever since Israel, the country Mr. Saad is unabashedly above criticism, was created in 1948, they have been the most disruptive force in the Middle East.

So yes, I'm almost 24 hours behind you. Sorry /s.    "Comments for this thread are now closed."   Top Comment:   "So what, 30+ people were shot and several killed over the weekend in Chicago. We care about Israel why?"  I wonder how long they tried to downvote that comment off the top of the thread before they decided to shut it down and move onto another platform to present their propaganda.   No I just stumbled across it organically when I googled, "Reddit vote", looking for articles about the rule change, I actually didn't click on that link but it's nice to see we are thinking alike. BTW, I was the mod who proposed stickying your submission. This entire situation is completely fucked. I spent 18 months religiously Redditing, just to have the rug pulled out from under me. How am I, a user of a sub that is regularly vote brigaded, expected to not suspect the worst after such a sudden loss of transparency ?    I could recommend stickying a banner across the top of r/conspiracy about this recent upvote/downvote visibility change just to get r/redditlution, kudos on the name by the way, a little bit of traction and new subscribers. I'll run it past the other mods on r/conspiracy and see what they think about it.    Wow, this post sure has a lot of comments, I'd love to see how many upvote/downvotes it has overall, now if only there was a way to do that ...    Congratulations admins, you've irreparably damaged Reddit. I spend the majority of my time on small subs, and those subs are now completely open to being vote brigaded. I don't understand why in a million years the admins would take it upon themselves to make a change no one asked for that in fact makes vote brigading impossible to detect. Of course I do actually know why the admins did it, and it probably has something to do with this article from the Guardian that was published yesterday about Reddit making digital marketing campaigns easier for corporations, here's the link to it:  http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jun/18/integrate-reddit-digital-marketing  It's so blatantly obvious that this is a move to make Reddit more mainstream and corporate-friendly. This simple fact is this will kill the smaller subs, like r/guns, r/progressive, r/worldpolitics, r/conspiracy, r/documentaries and countless other subs. This is completely fucked, I can't even look at vote counts for my old posts from well before the implementation of this ridiculous rule. Reddit just opted for less transparency, to whose benefit ? Cause it's certainly for the users benefit, cui bono, Reddit, it's Latin for who benefits and that is the question we should be asking ourselves, who benefits from this ridiculous new rule. It's the government and corporations that benefit from this, Reddit is nothing more than a hollowed out shell of its old self, a PR agency that touts itself as the Front Page of the Internet, a bastion of democracy when in fact it just does PR for governments and corporations, a task they just got a lot better at. It's open season on every small, controversial sub, in terms of vote brigading, courtesy of the administrators.    I heard about that kid, when you hear stories like this you can't help but notice the hypocrisy of America commenting on the criminal justice system in Russia or the Middle East. Considering they are literally doling out life sentences for cannabis baked goods here in the land of the free. I would take some whips on the back over a life sentence any day.   Just as a point of reference, a few months ago a friend of mine got caught smoking weed while driving home. He got hit with a 3rd tier DUI because apparently marijuana is the most intoxicating substance on Earth and immediately warrants the highest tier DUI. He got sentenced to 90 days in jail and an 18 month license suspension. He's getting out in a little over 2 months, gotta love those mandatory minimum sentences. I'm outraged and completely unsurprised by the fact that there is no mandatory minimum for child molestation of all things. Additionally, I'd be shocked if this child rapist serves the entirety of his 120 day sentence.    This 14 minute old post has 11 upvotes   9 downvotes. Vote-brigade much ?     The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe.

The 1st time he did Rogan's podcast he was all doom and gloom, now granted this was almost 2 years ago that he was in good spirits and that is a long time, but that's the last I heard from him. I know he did that 6-part series for Vice called Apocalypse man, but I haven't seen that yet. Here's the link for the last Rogan podcast he did in May 2012:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-Pg8dMErHE   The shooting also took place mere hours after a very controversial decision by the Supreme Court to remove campaign finance limits in the horrendous McCutcheon v. FEC ruling; subsequently knocking it off the front page.    I had to articles removed as well, the justification was that it had already been covered by other articles, when I pointed that the story was no where to be seen on the front page of r/worldnews, m/SaraLee pointed out that they allowed to articles about to remain on r/worldnews. Both had been heavily downvote brigaded and as a result had just 6   3 upvotes a few hours after being posted. It's a damn shame, this is a pretty damning story for the US government.   http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2233qt/us_secretly_built_cuban_twitter_to_stir_unrest/  http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2237qb/us_secretly_created_cuban_twitter_to_undermine/   Ok, help me out, what exactly is going on here ?   NSA bot ? Is that a thing now ?   I've posted a lot of things about the NSA but have never had a post flagged like this, what gives ?    This is so enraging, the Palestinian people have done nothing to deserve this.   They had to give up their country because of Germany's actions during WW2, I don't understand how it makes any fucking sense whatsoever.   The Jewish settlers have no interest in living alongside a Palestinian state and are chipping away at the notion of 1 through these illegal land grabs.   The cognitive dissonance in Israel apologists is so strong its amazing.    The Corbett Report.   James Corbett is the antidote to Alex Jones.    Old stories ?   It happened on Saturday.   "Israeli troops killed three Palestinians in an early morning raid that was followed by a clash with angry protesters in a West Bank town on Saturday, the military and Palestinian security officials said, in the deadliest incident in months."    The Post was recently purchased by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. I'm not saying he is any more trustworthy than Rupert Murdoch, but it did get a fair amount of press coverage late last year I believe.    That was some straight up serial killer shit.   No other way about it, it was murder, as plain as day. The guy was getting on the ground and everything and the 1 cop just unloaded on him for seemingly no reason.  Then his legs just barely twitched and they plugged him with 3 more rounds for it, simply disturbing.    Thank you.    I would be willing to do it.   Also had I known that I would 1 day be throwing my name in as a contender for moderatorship of this, the sub that I created my Reddit account for, r/conspiracy, I would've spent more time coming up with a clever/incendiary username, but here we are.

This sub is under attack, the content on this sub has taken a nose dive over the last 6 months and that decline in quality conspiracy-related content has been in direct correlation with the spike in subscribers to r/conspiracy. How is it that around the same time the Snowden leaks began this sub saw a sharp increase in traffic of the shill variety ? Could it be coincidence ? I don't think so, and in IMHO most of you would agree with me. This sub has clearly been hijacked by r/conspiratard and their merry band of vote brigadiers. To defend this sub I would :  Greatly reduce the amount of memes that get submitted to this sub, the memes that make it to the top of the page here over the past 6 months have at times been either what I would consider to be circlejerk material or it's been things that have been entirely antithetical to what this sub is supposed to be about, like the link I've provided as an example. (http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yzx2k/alan_moore/)   I would also investigate/ban all suspected shills immediately after viewing their inane comment/submission. No one understands the frustration of witnessing your controversial yet somehow popular submission to r/conspiracy have it's comment section derailed by an endless cadre of suspected shills and their stupid jokes, like I do.   If made moderator I would respond to any queries regarding the sub or my actions as moderator in a timely fashion, I've dealt with mods that are quick at removing your post and then slow at explaining why it was taken down, it can be frustrating. Over the course of an average day I am on Reddit on my work computer   personal laptop as well as being on the Reddit is Fun app on my smartphone   tablet while I'm out.  Thanks for reading all of this/considering giving me your vote.    48 minute post has 43 upvotes and 25 downvotes. That sure is an usually high amount of downvotes in a short period of time.

I complained about him removing all of my posts from r/news to the mods of r/news and the next time I posted an article to r/news (it was about the amount of attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians had increased 4-fold in 2013) I was promptly banned for posting opinion/analysis pieces. This cannot go on,  my ban was supposed to be for 1 month, 5 weeks later I was told that only the mod that banned me can unban me and the mods of r/news will mot reveal which specific mod it was, but I mean come on.  I couldn't post an article critical of Israel to r/news without it being removed for some reason or another.  	180

Why was the clip of, cause now that I play it it seems to be an ad :/   http://youtu.be/jUfvZs01ePI  If you post what server you play on, I might be able to make a new char and fly with you sometime.   No one wants to play on empty servers   They have a flag now?   Flash op   I despise the new system of continent locking, and fail to understand what the goal of this system is. I assumed the continent locking system would prevent unbalanced populations on continents, or bring players from indar onto Esamir and Amerish, however, I was truly disappointed.  The only continent I enjoy playing on is Esamir. The landscape isn't the greatest, however, that is the only continent that I can get good frames on, because PS2 is so poorly optimized, it makes Arma 2 look good. Now, after switching between 3 different characters, on 3 different servers, it just so happens that Esamir is locked on all of them.  What is the point of the continent locking system? Well, on the bright side, SOE statistics on performance will now show that the game is performing even better, because everyone who plays on Esamir because their PC cannot handle med-large battles on the other continents, due to the poor optimization, memory leaks, and so forth, will quit playing.   His head is huge, and empty...   How many times did the gun go off?  Edit: the school show and tell   That'll fix the fps for sure...   She gets life in prison for this, but a woman who tore her sons testicles only gets 2 years? Fuck society...      "We do not stop on a highway for animals, it's not worth it."  Sort of a douche thing to say. I may sound like an asshole, but there are a lot less ducks alive than humans, and their death will impact the ecosystem more than two humans dying.   She was stupid to leave her car there, but the accident wasn't entirely her fault.   Looks like their offices are sausage fests...   If it takes so much skill, learn to aim to the point where It takes you 2-3 shot before you hit an ESF, and stop bitching.  Simply l2aim.   After they reach the peak of sales.   Flak is more dangerous than annoying my friend, if the gunner is smart. Now imagine flak and g2a lockons are everywhere.... Oh, and only 3 lockons kill you.... Food for thought?  All I see here is "br100's vetted stuff after playing for hundreds of hours, but i don't want to work for it"   Do you fly an ESF?   You hear about that street shooting the other day, kid shot himself in the foot in the middle of the street...   Air isn't the problem. The fact that your whole faction in the battle is waiting for someone else to play AA is the issue. If there are aircraft dominating a fight, repair an aa turret, pull a burster max, pull a sky guard, he'll even a lockon launcher will make them go away.   Unfortunately, some of them are ridiculously stupid.   Clearly SOE wants everything to be specialized, so why not allow us to refit our air Vic's?  It could cost like 25 aero resources for each weapon you change and what not.   This would make it better for switching between a2a and a2g load outs.   I should have made it more clear that they went overboard on their nerfs on libs. I agree they need nerfs, but just amplifying their sound, and making them slower/less mauverable, and see how that would change things.  The reason people use rocket pods is: versatility. This is also the one thing game the game lacks.    Why does SOE constantly over-nerf? First, they needed rocket pods, so they didn't hurt infantry, now they are merging them against vehicles?   First they said that rocket pods were meant to kill tanks, now yet are meant only AI?  So tell me SOE, what fked up stats are you basing these nerfs on? You clearly aren't takin into consideration that sky guard will destroy all air now, since libs and ESF won't stand a chance against them? When you use your statistics to make nerfs, do you take into account the amount of dodging that ESF's must do while fighting vehicles? Because the vehicles don't have to dodge, most of them can shoot back, and outdps the ESF's already.  Why don't you make small incremental nerfs, so you don't overdo it, and make the vehicle useless?      "As a BR 1 blah blah blah..." You didn't think this argument through. Irately, a BR 1 will have an uncerted air vehicle, making it hardly effective. Secondly, it requires skills that new players don't have.  You can easily take down enemy air with 20 mins of practice with any AA weapon, whereas it takes 30-50 hours of flying to be decent.     Rocket pods don't need a nerf... It is hard enough to survive coming within 500m of an enemy sunderer with enemies that think "oh, look, air! Let's grab AA!"  Have you thought this through? I feel like this will do more damage to the air game, and the lib issues aren't being fixed: they can  turn around practically as fast as am ESF. It is ridiculously hard to fight a solo lib, considerig it is a bomber, it should need an ESF escort to survive enemy ESF attacks.     Lol, I had the option to spawn at NC's WG   This has been pissing me off lately. I don't know whether this is a bug, or a stupid mechanic of the game. For some reason, the game decides to give me shitty spawns I don't care about, but areas being capped, with 0% our pop, don't give us spawns?  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267590053 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267589686  Quite frankly, doesn't help fights.   How much do you fly an ESF. If you have less that 30 hrs in the air, your opinions about thermal are invalid.   Can I borrow your enemies? Mine shoot back....   Essentially coyotes?   Buffing AA   Libs are the problem. The current AA is really effective against ESF's, and buffing it would make ESF's unplayable.   Nerfs... Lots of em    Libs are the issue, not esf's. Esf and galaxies fit their role, while libs don't. With a decent pilot, libs are good for a2a and a2g, that isn't why they are around. Don't nerf ESF, libs need a nerf.  Edit: autocorrect fixes   Mattherson laggs quite a bit at times, this is even with a lower pop.    Wisest thing ever said. Some people don't understand that air can only dominate if it isn't attacked. 3 HA's with locking can kill an esf instantly.   I play AA, and am a decent pilot, and you won't believe how many times we big out when we get locked on. Some pilots use flares though,not my thing.      When will AA get a nerf? Burster maxs and sky guard can destroy an esf in 2-3 seconds. When will soe make air game better? I feel like I am flying paper in the sky.  The amount of time and effort we put in to be decent pilots, is all countered by weapons, that require 1/100th of the skill to use. Mattiace did a good job of explaining why there should be a balance for skill, not just weapons. http://youtu.be/F7AxfS3FHTQ  What are your opinions on AA as pilots, and what are your opinions on AA when playing the role of AA?  	37
 Why does it suck?  Is it not accurate?     Good explanation, but how does mutual annihilation result in a Higgs boson (vs. two gamma rays)?   Bears ... Beets ... Battle Star Galactica!   I don't see how this European law can possibly be implemented in a reasonable manner given the number of requests that will eventually be submitted along with their subjectivity.     What is dark energy and how does it work?   Granted the "dark side" of the moon is an incorrect term (should be far side or opposing side), but it's a term that is generally accepted and understood ... and it makes a great name for an album.   Gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the human body, which is probably why it is used in this application.   Instead, the [near-infrared laser] light excites the free electrons on the gold nanoparticles and causes them to heat up and generate energy, eventually making the cancer cells to explode.  Your guess is probably correct. The expansion/explosion of the cancer cell is likely caused by liquid within the cell that is heated by the gold particles and turned into vapor.

If all else fails, you can watch using Safari on an iOS device running 4.2 or later.   Good idea.  Think I'll send him a tweet with that recommendation for when he visits LA.   My guess is Apple will be on this very quickly.  It's not good press to let this issue linger.   Could it be due to this?  http://www.macrumors.com/2014/05/25/apple-software-update-invalid/   This method may have been used to get in a quick and easy fix without requiring a restart.   Thank you very much!   Good editing showing the optical sensor scanning the scene to determine a landing location.   Brand new look?  Reminds me of 50's SciFi space suits.   It depends a lot on what you want to get out of the meet-up, but yes to all of the items you mentioned for Tom's meet-up.  I think this is one of the many methods Tom uses to build a strong community.  For me its a chance to meet and talk with people who are interested in technology.  Generally I find a connection that I didnt expect to make with a few people, and its not always about technology.  That's what makes these meet-ups interesting.  Tom was a very gracious and engaging host and Jennie was very good at introducing each attendee to the group.   I asked my wife who also attended for her response to your question and this was her reply:     Definitely meetups are informal and are what you choose to make of them.  Expect to introduce yourself to people and try to find things you have in common. If you go expecting people to start the conversation for you, you may be disappointed. You dont have to imbibe in alcoholic beverages - some will, some wont but its non-discriminatory.     The subjects in which we engaged last night included:    * Star Trek  * Captain America/Agents of Shield  * A guy walked by with an xkcd shirt on so that made for easy conversation  * Whether to add an SSD to your computer  * Whos still using XP (through no fault of their own)  * The future of journalism (and what does it even mean)  * Youtube subscriptions vs. Podcast subscriptions (and is it too hard)   Photo credit to @charltonweb (taken with Glass)   Good point regarding the mass of this body more likely putting it in the rogue planet vs. brown dwarf category. It appears the mass threshold for deuterium fusion is not precise and is more of a rule of thumb.    From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant:   The 13 Jupiter mass (MJ) cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present.[5]   Here's a good diagram showing the closest systems to our Sun including WISE's recent brown dwarf discovery.  http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/pia18003-full_0.jpg   Question: Is it correct to call a prop driven by electricity a jet engine?   Any place that has a good, clear view of the southern sky.   You can see it on the east coast as well, but pretty early the morning of April 15, ~1:00 - 3:30 am.   The point Rene Ritchie is trying to make is *not* that Apple won't have another product that becomes a hit, but that they won't (at least in the near term) produce a product that has dominated the market and their bottom line like the iPhone has. As Rene puts it,    But there will be many, many things that, taken together, make the iPhone much more valuable.    Mods, please allow this one to remain.    Yes, comets travel at very high speeds, but so do all the other bodies in space.  A comet's trajectory can be accurately projected for a rendezvous with a spacecraft, until/unless it comes close to the sun which may change its trajectory.  After a close encounter with the sun (if the comet survives) the trajectory will stabilize and can be recalculated. In any case, it is an impressive feat to land a probe on a comet.  Comets are significant in a few ways.  They contain information that sheds light on the formation of our solar system.  Many scientists believe that comets colliding with the Earth during its formation brought much of the water we have to our planet. There are also theories that comets may have brought life or the building blocks of life to the Earth since organic molecules have been detected in them.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet   Evidence of primordial gravitational waves is the leading contender for the announcement.   http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/14/gravitational-waves-big-bang-universe-bicep   For a summary of the paper see this article:   http://phys.org/news/2014-02-massive-neutrinos-cosmological-conundrum.html   Astronomers detected an exploding star in the M82 "Cigar" galaxy. It is most likely a Type Ia supernova, but yet to be confirmed. Type Ia supernovas are created when a white dwarf star collects so much matter from a neighbor that it becomes unstable, collapses upon itself and explodes in very predictable manner.    Type Ia supernovas are used as "standard candles" to measure distances to very distant galaxies and how fast they are receding from us to determine the rate of acceleration of the universe's expansion.  Since M82 is so close, this is one of the rare Type Ia supernovas that can be observed by amateur astronomers.

Apple has a prime opportunity here.   Oh thephantom, you haven't heard of the emerging Big Band model where various states of matter and energy are represented by harmonics produced by a large collection of saxophones, trumpets and trombones?   Here's an article on the exoplanet discovery that's a bit easier to digest:  http://www.geek.com/science/new-impossible-exoplanet-is-11-times-heavier-than-jupiter-1578981/   Ooh, that is interesting.  CNET changed the article since my original post but didn't note their edit.  I (and CNET) stand corrected.   Edit: CNET did acknowledge their edit:  Updated at 9 p.m. PT to correct that the company has ceased sales of the testing kits.   No, it's the other way around. They have stopped selling the kits (to comply with demands made by the FDA) but will continue to provide analysis results.   Read replies above to the same question.   Tom has tweeted that he will not continue with FrameRate.   Tom's "replacement" will be Mike Elgan. http://twit.tv/2013/12/05/changes-twit-part-2   The post from Leo stating his decision to let Tom go was from today.  Tom will remain with TWiT/TNT until the end of December.   Well stated Bishma.   Here's a more technical explanation of ISON's fate.   http://www.isoncampaign.org/potw-dec02  Bottom line is that ISON was sheared into smaller pieces as it passed through the Sun's corona.  Although some of the larger pieces could be seen exiting the corona, those pieces continued to evaporate/disintegrate (still pretty hot there) and nothing sufficiently large to observe as a comet now remains.   Now behind a paywall. Any other sources?   Two fairly good articles below:  http://earthsky.org/space/big-sun-diving-comet-ison-might-be-spectacular-in-2013 http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/29/us/ison-comet/  Summary: it appears some piece(s) of ISON survived, but how much of it survived and how bright it will be is unknown.   I'm curious, what browser and version are you running?   Good on ya Tim Cook.   Why am I still not seeing this Google doodle in the US?  Anyone else?

GOCE is expected to begin disintegrating at an altitude of about 80 km.  http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1311/10goce/#.Un_ztJQadzs   Here's another site that offers satellite tracking info, including for GOCE.    http://www.satview.org/decay.php  At this moment in time GOCE's altitude is 138.7 km and falling.  Projected to re-enter between 1:30 pm and 7:00 pm EST today.   That's a good point aero_space.  As orbital decay gets going in earnest, the orbital prediction will become increasingly less accurate.   Hmm, still working for me at this link:  http://www.foxnews.com/science/interactive/2013/11/08/track-europe-falling-2000-pound-satellite-in-real-time/  Possibly a location dependent block?   The odds (as of Saturday morning) on the GOCE satellite crashing down on different continents according to British gaming company Ladbrokes:  North and South America: 6/4  Russia and Asia: 2/1  Africa: 4/1  Europe: 5/1  Australia: 10/1   The odds (as of Saturday morning) on the GOCE satellite crashing down on different continents according to British gaming company Ladbrokes:  North and South America: 6/4  Russia and Asia: 2/1  Africa: 4/1  Europe: 5/1  Australia: 10/1   I'm completely sold on it.  For me it's been very reliable.  I feel more secure now that I use a passphrase (e.g. for unlocking after restart or changing security settings) rather than a four digit passcode.  I want all of my future iOS devices to have Touch ID.  I only wish Apple would open up the API to developers.  Maybe over time they will.     The link takes you to the answer.   I agree with your assessment, but I suspect Sony was not pleased with the outcome.   Air is largely composed of Nitrogen (~78%) with most of the remainder being Oxygen.   I've had my black leather iPhone 5 case for about a month and it appears to be holding up well, so far. Here's a photo:   http://i.imgur.com/flItOH0.jpg   Huh?   A GRB would require the collapsing star be 40 solar masses and meet other special conditions. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova   We can observe supernovae much more often than once every 50 (or even 30) years, but it's very rare to have one occur within our own galaxy. Which type are you referring to, internal or external to the Milky Way?   Let's just hope it's not too close.   Wow, that is subtle - didn't notice it.  Thanks!   Just noticed the TM rotating arrow still appears during backups in the Finder window sidebar.  Don't always have a Finder window open, but I can adjust.    I was mildly distracted when I heard my external drive getting accessed, but this feature helped to nullify the distraction.   Currently (as the earnings call occurs) AAPL is down by 2.59% to 516.14 relative to today's close in after hours trading.   It's implied given that it's not feasible to determine the mobile phone habits of all children in the world.  Of more significance is the sample size and margin of error.  From the report:  This report is based on a nationally representative survey of 1,463 parents of children age 8 and under including an over-sample of African-American and Latino parents. The survey was designed by Common Sense Media and conducted by GfK from May 20 to June 12, 2013. ... The margin of error for the full sample is +/- 3.5  percentage points.    Here's a little more info from Fox about the series.   http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=cosmos---a-spacetime-odyssey   Very well done.   Nope, will remove.   You don't need to use an Apple thumbdrive.  Any standard 8 GB or larger USB flash drive will work.   So Phil Schiller is DM'ing the OP?  Really?  I'd like to see the entire direct message thread including the OP's original message.  This is still not convincing, although I'd like it to be true.   Why does this message not show up on Schiller's Twitter feed?  Looks suspicious.  Would be more credible if you posted the link to the tweet rather than an image capture.   You can't direct message someone on Twitter unless they follow you (I doubt Phil Schiller follows you) or they enabled the feature to allow DMs from those who don't follow them (I doubt Phil enabled this feature). The fact that your reply has an error shows he doesn't follow you.  Let's see your original DM to Phil where you called him out for saying Black Knight.    These directions worked for me: http://www.gottabemobile.com/2013/10/22/perform-clean-install-os-x-mavericks/  Similar to a Mountain Lion disk image, but a couple differences.   Yeah, I first read the title as working on a James Bond submarine car vs. on a working James Bond submarine car.   Plus you have to swipe rather than lightly press to get your fingerprint to register.   I originally posted this based on a post from Twitter assuming it was true.  Later, based on reading the comments on this post, I did the analysis showing it is not.   You can get a free copy of the paper at the prl.aps.org site using this link  http://prl.aps.org/pdf/PRL/v13/i16/p508_1   Unfortunately Reddit's version of the link doesn't support the pdf download.     Ok, I suspected this might not be the F, A, C, E musical notes. Many of your comments motivated me to analyze the notes since I don't have perfect (or even decent) pitch.  See this image for a visual of my analysis: http://i.imgur.com/O8JwHHK.png  Thanks to scottjenson for the Facetime ringtone which I used for this analysis.    First I copied the ringtone into Garageband to visualize the notes in the time domain.  I suspected the first two notes were different from the rest in timing and pitch (maybe the F and A?).  Garageband showed me the timing of the first two is different, but of course nothing about pitch.    Now to the frequency domain.  I downloaded a free app called iSpectrum which analyzes sounds played in real time through an audio input to your Mac.  I then played the Facetime ringtone and adjusted iSpectrum to focus on the frequency range from 1.0 kHz to 2.6 kHz.  I used the waterfall display where audio amplitudes (highlighted in magenta) are plotted as a function of frequency in the horizontal axis and time in the vertical axis (similar to what sonar operators use).  You can see I played the ringtone six times.  The magenta highlighted areas on the left are the first two notes (short in duration) and the highlighted areas on the right are the note pairs for the remainder of the ringtone (longer in duration).   Unfortunately, the frequency resolution is not very good.  However, it's good enough to see that the first two notes are around 1.6 kHz while the trailing pairs of notes are around 2.45 kHz (+/- 100 Hz).   I then went to the phy.mtu.edu site to see how musical notes map into frequencies.  I could not find any F notes that are close to 1.6 kHz nor could I find any C notes that are close to 2.4 - 2.5 kHz.    My conclusions are   * The Facetime ringtone notes do not spell FACE * I'm spending way too much time on this  I'm out.   My thoughts exactly.  I'm guessing more info will emerge.   I assume you're referring to the statement:   There is a bit of a discrepancy regarding what to call the planet, as some astronomers demand that the definition of planet be considered a mass that is tethered to a sun.  The article is not well written.  I think the author should have stated that being tethered to a sun is one of the requirements some astronomers believe a planet should satisfy.    Thanks hokie_u2 - that is helpful.    I don't agree with Tyson's tweet "Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space."  I've thoroughly enjoyed actual people set in real space over the years including the Moon landing, Felix Baumgartner skydiving from 128 kft (almost space) and Cmdr. Hadfield performing Space Oddity from the ISS, to name a few.  Knowing it's real makes it that much more interesting and enjoyable.   But these quarterly results will include a significant increase in sales of Apple's leading money maker. We'll see how this translates into revenue and profit.   I think the problem is that Misek is assuming Apple will react to other mobile phone manufacturers' trends when they have not shown this behavior in the past.   SpaceX says "we have no reason to believe there was an explosion of any kind" on the Falcon 9.    http://www.businessinsider.com/report-explosion-on-elon-musks-spacex-rocket-falcon-9-2013-10   If not, a serious omission.    Nice!   Birchman is correct, you can export the HD video using AirDrop.  Surprisingly, you can also Message the HD video to anyone, including yourself.     Why make this comment on this post?  Seems like my post on r/apple might be a more appropriate subreddit.    But since you commented, I'm a long time Apple consumer and happy with their products but I'm not their PR.  Believe me, I would love Apple to pay me for my comments, but no luck.    Regarding posting to two threads quickly, I do that all the time.  It has nothing to do with pretending - it is due to the limited time I have to review reddit and make posts.   Doctored.  This is Section 3 from Apple's EULA for iOS 7.   Transfer.

I was 12th in line at my local AT T store and had no trouble getting a 32 GB Space Gray, very efficient operation.  They only carried Space Gray (no Gold or White) but they appeared to have many more in stock.  I've been hearing from friends that very few stores are stocking the Gold/White today and those are in very short supply (~5/store).

Although I am a long-time Apple consumer, I stopped posting anything positive about Apple on r/technology long ago.  They don't want to hear it.   Ironically, NASA says that although Voyager 1 has entered interstellar space, it hasn't yet left our solar system.

To get decent arial footage, I recommend you get a gimbal to stabilize the image.  Although it's a bit of a hack, the Zenmuse H3-2D gimbal works well with the Phantom.  Realize that this can get expensive pretty quickly - what is your budget?   I'm guessing a rescue attempt of some type will be in the plot.   Although not confirmed by Apple, WSJ's AllThingsD has confirmed the Mavericks release.   Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac reports, and AllThingsD has confirmed, that OS X 10.9 will not launch this month, but next.  WSJ/ATD is about as close to a confirmation as we'll get without an Apple confirmation.  http://allthingsd.com/20130906/apple-likely-to-ship-os-x-mavericks-in-october/?mod=atd_homepage_carousel   Favorite line: "I think there's this profound and enduring beauty with how much we're able to get away with, and we push that ... as far as we can."   I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the presence of water/ice on Mars and the possibility of finding some evidence of life on Mars.  The chances of finding signs of life on Phobos would be much smaller.     Thank you.  I also think r/space is an **awesome** subreddit.     If you're referring to its odd shape, it's not Phobos' fault.  There is something called the "potato radius" above which objects in the universe become sufficiently massive to form a sphere.  That radius is ~200 km for icy objects and ~300 km for rocky ones.  Phobos has a radius of only 11 km, so it has no hope of becoming spherical.   http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1091   Cool, I didn't know about the Island of Stability.  Thank you.   Isn't that the case with most things that are "discovered"?  I think the word has taken on a different meaning in these contexts.   This is a confirmation of an element that was initially discovered in 2003.  The element's temporary systematic IUPAC nomenclature is Ununpentium or Uup.  The element's name will change with its confirmation.   http://www.webelements.com/ununpentium/   Airplay is not related to networks so an "Airplay-app" doesn't make sense, unless I'm not getting your question.  Airplay is an Apple app supported by newer Macs and iOS devices that allows you to send whatever you are viewing on the device to your AppleTV and view it on your TV (known as mirroring).    For older Macs that don't support Airplay, I use AirParrot ($9.99 US) to perform the same function. Doesn't perform quite as well as Airplay (likely due to running on an older Mac) but it gets the job done.   Why does it only have 2 stars in the App store?   I've been there. Next time.   Good work kbuis. Thanks.   I hadn't heard about Bluetooth Low Energy technology until this article. As I was reading, it hit me: BLE would be perfect for the iWatch (or whatever Apple chooses to call their wrist-worn personal device).  This revelation assumes that Apple will not stream music from the iWatch or place other high data rate requirements on the device.    Below are the paragraphs from the article that got me thinking: The tradeoffs of choosing BLE over standard Bluetooth are that BLE only supports very low data rates, so you wont be streaming audio via BLE any time soon  but you can send small files if youre creative, and it works extremely well for small data packets sent from sensors.  Devices built with energy efficiency in mind can achieve battery lives of several years running off coin-cell batteries like the CR2540. This makes them ideal for wireless devices that stay in one place and would be annoying to recharge.   I just realized the last sentence is similar to the Wizard of Oz's message to the Scarecrow.   Yeah, that is what I would call a really bad day.   Yes, but if you're a Dexter fan, it's a big deal. This is how to encourage torrenting the show.   Fortunately we are in an area that also has FiOS.  We are switching in the next few days, not just because of this (which will be resolved soon I'm guessing) but because the up/download speeds are pretty snappy.   At least those of us who don't pay for the WSJ can read a summary of the article at BGR.   Yes, there are conflicting reports, but WSJ is usually accurate with their Apple reporting.

Now that's a workout.   The prices are at the top of the embedded tables which may not be available at the mobile site.  Can you see the tables?   Actually it is both.  The super-massive black hole is still there (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), but there are additional postulated smaller black holes orbiting the big one.    Sounds a lot like what Tim Cook said to the U.S. Senate a few days ago.   Very close to the Newton.  The circular shape on the watch face would suggest the Newton.  But 1) the circle on the face in the ad is proportionally larger than the Newton's, 2) the watch face in the ad is missing the bezel that surrounds the Newton's watch face and 3) the watchband in the ad does not taper outward to match the size of the watch as the Newton's band does.  This looks like a 6th gen square nano with a different watch face applied, possibly for obscuration?   They actually play this song (and many others) and are accomplished harpists, although I'm sure this recording is "finger synched" given the environment they're in.   Yep, that's the problem - your density is way too low.  A neutron star has a density of between 3.710^17 and 5.910^17 kg/m^3, which is about 14 orders of magnitude higher than the density you're using.  The material about to compress into a black hole would have an even higher density than a neutron star. Try the neutron star density and see what radius you get.   Where did you get that density?   I'm not sure what density you assumed, but your radius looks way to large to be the minimum radius required to form a black hole.  You may have used the density of iron that we observe here on Earth.  However in the process of forming a black hole, iron atoms are highly compressed so that the nuclei are nearly in contact with each other.  This is a form of iron that is many orders of magnitude more dense than what we observe on Earth.  The much higher density allows the minimum radius for black hole formation to be much smaller than your estimate.   First time for me as well.  I looked for an original post but couldn't find one.

Fuckin Timmy   http://i.imgur.com/meAyRDZ.gif   When I was a counselor, I woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I walked from the front to the back of the cabin, I noticed one of the top bunks where a camper (let's call him Timmy) should have been. Neither Timmy or his sleeping bag were on the bed. I peek out back, thinking maybe he went to take a pee and didn't tell me. Nope. Timmy's not out back. Maybe he went across the field to the bathrooms to take a dump? Go look out front. Peer across, no light on in bathroom building. But now I see a shadowy, hunched figure in the middle of the field. I approach, mag-lite, in hand. As I approach, the smell worsens and the faint sound of tears begins to become audible. I find little Timmy, alone in the athletic field, crouched in his sleeping bag full of shit.   He had awoke that night and was too much of a pussy to walk to the bathroom in the cold, so he tried to hop in his warm sleeping bag. He couldn't make it fast enough and his body's need to shit soon overcame his weak mind. He stopped, dropped his pants (inside the sleeping bag) and shit inside his place of sleep. Once the relief of his massive shit passed, he realized what he had done, froze, and remained there in his humiliated tears for over an hour. He also peed.   edit: gold cuz my camper shit himself in a sleeping bag?! thank you!   whoa whoa whoa that's not really a fair assessment. I think Markakis caught a ball last year.    ITT: People saying he could have spent more. Come on. How many stories of domestic abuse, drugs, DUI's, deadbeat dads etc among athletes come up?? And one stand up guy does something and you complain about the ratio of donation to salary?? $16,266 worth of toys puts a smile on a hell of a lot kids' faces.    You connect to people who have jobs so later when they want a new job they can ask you for an in at your job.    Markakis isn't getting close to $15mill a year so he wouldn't be a Lowe/BJ/Uggla situation. I'd guess he'd be looking at $8-10 mill? I wouldn't mind Aoki for the right price though. His LD% increased, and some peripherals like HR/FB and infield hit rate were actually lower than his first couple years. He doesn't strike out much either which is nice.    I tried to can into space once. It did not go well.    [How were the facts on Fox News today???](http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/mad-men-gif-not-great-bob.gif)   So you'd rather stick a minor leaguer that's not ready? Magically create a young stud RF that can develop in RF and hit his prime in 2017? Just bench every good player on lose every game until 2017? Put Jose Constanza in RF? You need someone to play there. There's no reason not to get a serviceable, veteran guy who can help mentor young players and won't (or shouldn't) cost that much. Let's be clear here. The Braves aren't turning into the Astros and tanking. They still want to be good, they just know the priority is rebuilding the farm system. Signing Markakis has absolutely zero impact on that. None. It doesn't hurt the team in any way.    Ah. the guy that throws out arguments without evidence, like "nothing more than an average MLB starter" (despite a 2.5 war last year) is suddenly Bill James. Play a sport once in your life before you think leadership is useless. Especially with a young team.    Have you ever played sports?? Leadership and clubhouse unity is incredibly important in baseball. Have a team with a bunch of kids that have gobs of money for the first time ever, are used to being the best and are now at the top of the baseball world and likely mightily struggling. The 'they're freaking adult baseball players, who cares about leadership' is the dumbest, most obtuse argument out there.    Fun until everyone starts rubbing their fingers along the rim of your glass.   He's a solid veteran leader to have around young guys and in the clubhouse. He improves the team's disastrous strikeout rate by giving a solid contact guy. Basically, see everything that /u/PM-ME-UR-PROBLEMS- said above.   And for your argument...show me where he's trending downward? You provide zero evidence. One could argue he's due for another increase in numbers. His BABIP last 2 seasons are well below his career norms, his K% has decreased, his contact rate has gotten better. If anything, the peripherals suggest he could improve his numbers. His LD% dipped in 2014 and his IFFB% jumped. So you could say that was an anomaly and will trend back to their respective means as well.    Player A: not on this team anymore so it doesn't even matter. Player B: No one is pretending is a long term solution. And his numbers increased in 2014 from a poor 2013.    2014 Player Comparison  Player A: 573 AB / .271 AVG / .351 OBP / 735 OPS / 74 R / 155 H / 26 2B / 11 HR / 58 RBI / 67 BB / 98 SO  Player B: 642 AB / .276 AVG / .342 OBP /729 OPS / 81 R / 177 H / 27 2B / 14 HR / 50 RBI / 62 BB / 84 SO    Player A is Heyward, Player B is Markakis. Markakis makes better contact, strikes out less, and has just about the same line drive and HR rate. Markakis has slightly better numbers in O-Swing% and Z-Swing% and much better contact rates at O   Z-Contact% than Heyward.   Yes, Heyward's defense more than makes up for any disparity at the plate (fangraps WAR for Heyward last year was 5.1 and Markakis was 2.5). But Markakis won't come with Heyward's price tag (after 2015) and gives us a higher contact bat in the lineup. Would I rather have Heyward? Yes, of course. But Markakis isn't bad.      i'm lvl. kcbarn   This happened in 2006! Here's [video proof for OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqXkLP7ZkU0)      How do I buy this??

It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we traded him within the division. Generally when you make a trade within the division the price goes up. Could get an even better return on him. And then just throw him high fastballs 16 games a season.    I went to college with a girl who prided herself on being able to predict what type of food a guy had eaten the day before based on how their jizz tasted. She called it her "party trick." She was popular at parties.  **edit:** I don't think she could actually taste anything. I think she just liked dicks in her mouth.   My fault, you are right. He was just an out machine   On paper. And we had the 2nd worst offense, only to Padres, in all of baseball. Simba, CJ and BJ were strikeout machines. All of the infield, except Freddie, were black holes at the plate. Freddie slumped, didn't hit for power. Heyward got on base at a good clip, but didn't hit all that well. JUpton's numbers were buoyed by a few great streaks. One of which came in that big losing streak so it was wasted, not that that was any fault of his.  Why are people saying Chris Johnson was good at the plate this year???? Did you people watch games???    "Heyyyy...you!"   I think I just generally assume that places with the name of a person aren't owned by the most famous person with that name.

Heyward has 1 year left on his deal, and by all accounts the Braves weren't going to be able to match what he may get on the market. Shelby Miller is young and, more importantly, has **4 years of control.** For GM's in baseball, money and contract control is HUGE. There's no way this trade would be done if each player had the same remaining contract length   Let go of the hate, man. Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate. Shake it off.

Jason Heyward is just a year from free agency, but that one year will be a very valuable one, even if he just maintains the status quo. Getting away from the parade of dubious hitting coaches he worked with in Atlanta may help him unlock the still-untapped reserve of superstar potential in his bat.   Heyward consistently rates among the majors' best defensive outfielders in terms of both advanced defensive metrics and traditional evaluations. A decent center fielder in high school, he outgrew the position but maintains the athleticism and strong reads that allowed him to play there as an amateur. He's a smart, disciplined hitter who gets on base at a good clip and doesn't strike out excessively, though he has had a lot of trouble maintaining a consistent swing around some shoulder issues; he often cuts off his load, producing too many ground balls with a shorter swing path.   Oscar Taveras' death left the Cardinals without a clear right fielder for 2015, and this move locks down the position for just $7.8 million, making the team 4-5 wins better right away. It also gives the team the chance to work with Heyward and see if they can make him the MVP candidate most folks (myself included) expected him to become.   The Cardinals also get two years' worth of right-handed reliever Jordan Walden, who throws a heavy mid-90s fastball and has developed a plus slider. According to pitch f/x data from baseballsavant.com, hitters swung and missed at one of every five sliders Walden threw in 2014, and put just 1.4 percent of them in play for hits. It's an ugly delivery, and he always has had command issues, but I believe the Cardinals have some kind of special fairy dust they sprinkle on relievers to get a little extra something out of them. And even if I just made that up, he'll give them 50-60 above-average innings of late-game relief work.   [+] EnlargeShelby Miller Jamie Squire/Getty Images Atlanta-bound Shelby Miller posted a 2.92 ERA after the All-Star break in 2014. For their trouble, the Braves get two premium young arms, one ready to step right into their rotation and one who immediately becomes the best pitching prospect in their farm system. Shelby Miller now has two solid, healthy seasons as a major league starter and won't be eligible for arbitration until after 2015. He seemed to find the perfect formula for his pitch mix in the second half of last season, working in his curveball more and using the four-seamer less; in turn he missed more bats, got more called strikes and cut his walk rate substantially. He's a mid-rotation starter at worst, as long as he stays healthy, and given his delivery and the evolution of his approach, I believe he can end up as a solid No. 2 starter.   Tyrell Jenkins was the No. 74 prospect for me going into the 2012 season, then shoulder injuries robbed him of much of that season and 2013. But he came back healthy this year and was one of the best prospects in the Arizona Fall League. When I saw him there in October, he was 93-96 with good downhill plane, turning the pitch over quite well even at 95 mph, generating lots of ground balls. His slider was plus at 83-87, with curveball depth, and actually got sharper into his second and third innings. His changeup was fringy, straight at 86-88, effective because his delivery of the pitch is close to his fastball delivery, but lacking any life or action. He's as strong as ever, and his shoulder is the healthiest it has been in more than two years. A former three-sport star who had a football scholarship to Baylor, he repeats his delivery very well and has the aggressiveness you'd expect (and want) to see from a former quarterback. He immediately becomes the team's top pitching prospect and should be ready to begin 2015 in Double-A.   The trade makes a ton of sense for both teams, although it's an acknowledgment on Atlanta's part of the weaknesses of the current roster and farm system and may not read very well to some of their fans. The Cardinals are -- and should be -- in win-now mode; they needed to upgrade their production on the corners and have some pitching depth to play with. As good a prospect as Jenkins is, he has thrown just 215 innings in the last three regular seasons combined and has never pitched a full, healthy season in pro ball. They can replace Miller in the rotation with one of Marco Gonzales or Carlos Martinez, assuming Michael Wacha returns healthy to be the fourth starter behind Wainwright, Lynn, and Lackey, and they have other young arms on the way.   Atlanta was likely to lose Heyward after the season to free agency, and their farm system was left in terrible shape after former GM Frank Wren's tenure, so this deal helps restock their system with four more years of Miller and potentially six of Jenkins in exchange for one year of Heyward and two of Walden. Atlanta needed to make a trade like this to get younger and extract value from Heyward while they could. The Cardinals didn't have the same urgency, but they strengthened a weak spot on the roster and did so without significantly damaging their future.   Ooo sorry, didn't even realize that. pasted as a comment.      so in the cooker, toss in the rice and all this other stuff (olive oil when it's done), cover with water and go?

It's just done differently than some other games. Instead of a linear progression of building more valuable/higher scoring buildings, there are **scoring tiles** for each round that give bonuses for that round only.   For example, Round 1 might give a bonus for every spade used. Round 2 may give a bonus for every trading house built. So it's very beneficial to time your buildings (if possible) to coincide with the round scoring bonus. That and other things like the cult track are linear progressions...the higher you go, the more you score. When you build a town, get a bonus tile with points. Pretty straightforward.   Side note: Terra Mystica is my favorite game of all time. Freaking get it!   Why do you not like Fantasy Flight games??   I'm as confused as you are.

No wonder the USSR blew out the USA early in both games, ha. Figured it out in game 3, and the game went muuuuch more balanced.    Great week of gaming!  Mid-Week I hung out with a friend and we played an intense game of **1st   Goal.** I turned the ball over 4 times, got 3 penalties, lost 2 onside kick attempts, and my buddy had no turnovers, no penalties and won an onside kick. I got stomped, but it was so much fun. The game is just fun. You can't take it seriously or else you'll get frustrated! Just a silly game, with some strategy/trying to know what your friend is going to play.  Sunday night we ended with a great game night after football. Game of **Small World**, which I'm not the biggest fan of, and ended up finishing 3rd. It's a good game, but I've just been more into heavier games lately and this just never clicked with me since I learned it a couple years ago.   2nd up was a 4 player game of **Terra Mystica**. I got the Nomads and tried to expand as fast as possible early. I ended up being kinda mean, cutting off 2 people and won in the end by a good margin. I was lucky too, as the 1st round scoring tile was for dwellings, the 2nd for trading houses so I lined those up nicely. I absolutely love this game. It's my favorite of all time. Especially with 4-5 players so there's much more interaction and territorial conflict. Everything just fits together so so nicely. And it is gorgeous to look at.   We then moved on to a quick game of **Tichu**. Such a great 4 player/pairs of 2 game. Love the dynamic of the dragon/phoenix and scoring cards.    A couple friends left so to the end the night, my friend and I busted out **The Duke** for my first time ever. WOW. This game is brilliant. I love it. So simple, lots of strategy, some luck/randomness in which tile you randomly draw. I wonder what would happen if you made a variant where you don't randomly select which tile to draw: just leave em all out on the side and you can pick which one you want every time. Thoughts on that?   Tichu is *fantastic!* My group just played a few games last night. The dynamic with the dragon and phoenix is very interesting. There's a lot going on here. It seems a simple trick taking game, but there's definitely depth, strategy and tons of replay-ability   It's awful.   Hit up Osteria last night. They had a real solid menu for restaurant week.

As it gets closer you begin to notice there are others surrounding you doing the same thing and there's no where to run, no way to get away.  I wish I could actually write well because I feel like this would be scary as shit, but I'm just a lowly engineer.  Edit: I wish I could put into words the scenario I'm imagining, creative writing is fucking harder than I thought. If someone wants to actually make this into a well written scary story go for it.    I don't remember learning about anyone other than Einstein and Bohr throughout any of my schooling up until college/   Ah, welp looking back on what I wrote he's right. I had to pull an allnighter last night getting ready for a couple exams I've got on Monday so I'm not exactly the most coherent person right now and those study aids make me ramble like a mad man too.   This is going to sound really condescending but I don't understand why stuff like this is a big deal and gets so many up votes just because someone is wearing something related to reddit. If I saw something like this I would probably think "oh cool he must really like Reddit" and go on my way.   Reddit is one of the biggest if not the biggest social media aggregate sites on the internet.  It's not like it's some like super secret esoteric club, I'm 24 and almost every single one of my friends goes on Reddit at least occasionally. I just feel like sometimes people have this idea that it's a close knit community and you're automatically going to be great friends with someone just because they are a redditor too and I just don't think that's the case.  But hey, I guess Karma is pretty cool.   What are you talking about? I'm talking about the 2chan denko thread, which is what the 2 comments above mine were referencing. If you haven't read it, you should do it, it's possibly the most cringy thing on the internet   After reading that, I can't help but feel a little sorry for the denko guy he was just naive, a bit off his rocker and incredibly socially maladjusted(not that that excuses any of his behavior). Her shitty friend on the other hand, was the true villain who knew exactly what she was doing, what a sociopath.    Honestly, whenever something like this happens I just type the acronym into google and the meaning of the it pops right up at the top.   http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tree-fiddy   Barkour   It's "confusingly large" haha   As far as anyone knows, Jim had never done heroin and didn't overdose on it that night. He was sober and with his girlfriend, he said he felt sick and went to take a bath and she found him dead about an hour later in the tub. Source: No One Gets Out of Here Alive... his biography.

It's a turd shelf to let you examine your shit before you flush it... duh   This happened at least once in Austin this year too   Here it is [enhanced](http://i.imgur.com/Lf3lPPY.jpg)... holy shit   Any idea how big the DC metro area is compared to say, the Atlanta metro area? How long does it take to drive to DC from NOVA?  Also I've always heard DC is the one of the most dangerous cities in the US? Any idea how it compares to say Atlanta? In case you can't tell I live in ATL so I'm just trying to get a reference   You're a true hero... Is this all in Austin?    nd the time Cory and Trevor leave. I fuc   Too lazy to think of a title and stuff... you can do it if you want   Here's a video of the paint being added http://vimeo.com/45021408   I would think  it's possible that dogs are innately able to recognize some human aspects better than animals because of the thousands of years of selective breeding. It would be interesting to take at look at the difference of response in wild dogs.  The way dogs naturally communicate puts a lot of emphasis on the tone of the barks and other vocalizations so I would think they would have some response. My guess is the wouldn't understand what is trying to be conveyed as well because they don't understand what different tones signify for humans.   No... pitch has nothing to do with volume, it is how deep or high pitched your voice is. It's kind of hard to define tone now that I think about it, I guess it's the way you say things so I guess tone depends on your cadence.   I like HotWheelz personally   Yes but .001 is not equal to .001%. .001 is equivalent to .1%. If you were trying to get 1% of something you would multiply that something by .01. 5% you multiply by .05. 90% you multiply by .9.  I know how to do basic math maybe you should take a second to actually read what I'm saying   That's .1%! To get 1% of something you multiply by .01 not 1   This is wrong... just because a pattern is random and non-repeating doesn't mean it contains everything...    Actually .001% of 7 billion is 70000   What are you talking about   I was just talking about this particular reference to Gloria   It's from the show Modern Family   I had a friend in college who completely went off the deep end. Gradually over the course of a couple weeks he got farther and farther removed from reality. He bought his close friends all kind of gifts that there was no way he could afford, completely destroyed his apartment, writing all over the walls and trashing it, and was convinced people we after him. He even thought at one point he had created a light saber and the FBI had broken into his house and stole it. He moved out of his apartment and began living on a volleyball court behind our fraternity house(he was a brother too) in a tent. This all climaxed when he took off all his clothes and started walking around the house naked with a knife in his hands. Scary stuff, the mind is a delicate thing.   Some people equate legality with safety. They think oh if it's legal it must be safer than actual weed when the reality is very much the opposite.    I live 10 minutes down the road from you on 620 and I had no idea it actually iced over. Where was this?   actually it's /r/casualiama... was confused when I only saw 150 subscribers   I doubt that local business in Africa would be able to compete with mass produced cheap clothing anyways... It's not like if they didn't donate these shirts, all mass produced clothing would stop making it to Africa.   Why the fuck do you work in a bathroom stall?   My direction in life is not too bad. I'm taking a semester off now but will graduate in the fall with a masters in biomedical engineering. I have severe anxiety and have don't really have any friends back home which is where I am now. I'm a bit social inept and a lot of times I have trouble holding conversions especially which people I don't know. It's hard to find hobbies because everything I once enjoyed doesnt seem interesting due to the depression. I am trying to work my way out of this, have been on anti depressant for 5 years but the only thing that makes me actually be able to enjoy life is opiates and obviously thats not an option.  Something is just wrong with my brain chemistry I think. Even back in the when my first hook up was with the girl who ended up prom queen I still thought about suicide alll the time   After being incredibly depressed over half my 23 year old life, it makes me jealous as fuck   I'm the same way. I couldn't stand to think how my family would react. I don't want to die so much as just never have existed in the first place. I guess being chronically depressed for over half my life will do that to you   Those speed holes do wonders   He's never seemed super full of himself to me, is there a story behind this?   I could definitely see him being a dexter style serial killer and he'd be fucking good at it too with his crazy work ethic   And he appealed the decision and was later acquitted!   Ah yes, the old Siemen's tower next to Dick's sporting goods in Cumming   Eatin my own shit, bitch I dont give a fuck, chomp'em in the nutz then its time to get buck   I'll take a large coffee with sugar and cream! Thanks!   I still wish they could have finished Mt. Rushmore, [this](http://i.imgur.com/mGF1sYa.jpg) would have been a badass giant sculpture, not that it isn't pretty awesome anyways   Well at least it's not the WORST possible outcome. Wear a cup when you're playing lacrosse guys... trust me   P-chem? Ewwww... it was cool at your school?   It's too bad what happened to Hartman. I'm not sure if it's fair to blame Andy Dick for his death, he's certainly a bit responsible but he never had any intention to hurt anyone. Still you don't fucking offer a recovering addict drugs   [No Country for Old Men villian](http://i.imgur.com/yJr2I92.jpg) + [Steve from Easbound and down](http://i.imgur.com/dMHnQ2R.jpg)   I read somewhere that the character of Zapp Brannigan was originally written for Phil Hartman(who voiced Troy McClure, Lionel Hutz in the Simpsons), I'm not 100% sure this is true but it would have been perfect.     They probably would be some of the most interesting people to trip with. Wish they woulda won, would have loved to see trey give that speech   Not saying I believe in aliens or anything but I've never understood the "why" question about aliens visiting us. This is a planet absolutely filled to the brim with life not to mention intelligent life. I imagine that would be a bit of a rarity.   Look up sleep paralysis. What you described seems very similar to that(although I'm sure it was still terrifying!)    I've heard pretty lights has/had a big OC problem and  would often refuse to go onstage if he wasn't high. Know anything about that?   He said he was on a "low dose of LSD" while he came up with the double helix structure idea   Oh sorry officer, that one has been sitting in my car for a month. Here's one that is fresh   WHAT SOME OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LOOK SIMILAR   Yeah that's actually what I meant to include as a counter to his point but I just now realized what I posted actually seems like evidence of his point, time to edit    A "prisoner" begged to leave and Zimbardo allegedly "encouraged" him to stay to the extent that the prisoner returned to the other prisoners, telling them that, "we aren't allowed to leave". There were also other instances where people were kept against their will and not because of social embarrassment.  From http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1pt80c/psychological_experiments_gone_horribly_wrong/cd5w6k7  It seems he "encouraged" participants to stay but did not say you're allowed to leave. According to a reply to this post a couple student actually did leave the study.    I was born in Poughkeepsie. Glad to know my hometown is keeping up the good work   I remember seeing this book sitting on the coffee table at home and seeing the cover. A little bit of me died that day, life was never the same and it definitely didn't help my fear of the dark, although I was more scared of being abducted by aliens than anything else.  I was a strange child. That alien phobia never quite went completely away and I've told friends about it recently. If they ever play a practical joke on me involving aliens I honestly would freak the fuck out. Especially if it was anything like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8lnZjMcos   Aluminium just sounds so goofy   Here's what she looks like as a woman. http://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/vintage-female-mug-shots-16.jpg. Also it's pic #6 not 5   That drop kick has a better spiral than I can throw damn   "I did not sow, I did not spin,  And thanks to pills I did not sin.   I loved the crowds, the stink, the noise.   And when I peed, I peed turquoise.   I ate beneath a roof of orange;   Swung with progress like a door hinge.   'Neath purple roof I've come today   To piss my azure life away.   Virgin hostess, death's recruiter,   Life is cute, but you are cuter.   Mount my pecker, purple daughter   All it passed was sky-blue water."  Little easier to read that way.   What's the legality of doing something like that? I'm guessing just a scummy legal thing to do but if you were say to have those posts/emails linked to you conclusively would there be any legal recourse?   Kinetic energy is .5 * mass* velocity^2. So nope velocity is very relevant.   http://i.imgur.com/ZxTKgRk.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/ZxTKgRk.jpg   You should keep it that way   His best part has to be Frank's cape wearing lawyer though   Yeah it makes you wonder did score try to account for that or just get kind of lucky?   I'm pretty good at skill shots and most times I'll just throw them where I think the enemy will be. I'm sure a lot of variables contribute to where I place them but aiming the shot happens so fast I could never really explain my thought process, only that I felt the player would move there so I aimed there. I wonder if it's the same type of deal.   Amazing. If cait would have just kept running instead of trying to dodge it, it would have probably missed but that instinctive dodge when you see the ult appear is really hard to control   I wonder if it was all about them touching each others butts   I wonder if it was all about them touching each others butts   I go to school at Georgia Tech, but I'm from Texas and honestly Atlanta is still worse in terms of racism. I think it has something to do with the large black population of the city, especially in the areas around campus which are significantly worse off. I think it has a lot more to do with socioeconomic status than race but around here black and poor really do seem to go hand in hand and this stereotype is often re-enforced.   Looks like its going down down in an earlier round    Ah cool figured it was a BB or something. I put it first cause i thought it was the coolest looking.      Here's an album of all the slow motion bullet gifs I could find in case anyone's interested: http://imgur.com/a/nbtGQ   Made an album of all of these kinds of gifs I could find: http://imgur.com/a/nbtGQ   Yeah considering drug legalization doesnt effect addiction rates [^1](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120718/drug-decriminalization-portugal-addicts), it is much better for people to get unregulated black market drugs than regulated, pure drugs which they would be using anyways.    For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.  I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.  TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug    Admittedly, I do not know much about linguistics but languages fascinate me. Years ago, when I was in high school I remember browsing the wordreference forums where a similar question was asked and there were some languages with properties that astounded me.  I can't contribute, studying languages unfortunately took a back seat to engineering for me after high school but I figured this would be the best place to ask.   I may xPost to askReddit if this gets enough interest.    signs*  Just have to point that out considering you did it five times   Here ya go   Because the liberal left has convinced everyone that McCarthy was as bad as Hitler. The dude was pretty much right, and the rise of state-owned assets and banking which is a component of socialist thinking is what led to the crisis we're in right now. Most Americans, and redditors for that matter, can't accept that voting people in to spend other people's money regardless of whether or not they deserve that money could lead to a shortage of that money and a resistance to hiring to spend that money.    Plants that eat bugs and are bio-luminescent!  Disclaimer: I have studied genetics and this is very improbable and even if it was possible it could fuck with the ecosystem.   I was at Bonnaroo one year when he was headlining the last day(think it was 2011?) which means he was the only show at the time at a festival of 100,000+ people. So, a fucking huge crowd to say the least and one of my favorites shows I've ever seen but what really stood out to me was there was a girl in the very front row with a shirt that said "It's my birthday today!!!". He proceeded to call he up on stage in between songs and get the entire crowd(at least 80,000 people) to sing her happy birthday. He has always seemed like the most down to earth celebrity and that just cemented it for me.   If you get this up in arms about bow hunting you need a reality check... Nature is fucked up, humans are fucked up and neither you or anyone else are ever gonna change that. Hope self perceived moral superiority makes you happy   I understand the dislike of people killing for fun with guns but for food with bows and arrows? Like people did for hundreds of thousands of years? The kind of killing that is constantly happening in nature? Granted it's with simple tools, but that's kinda our equivalent to a bear's claws and strength.    Yeah I bet you have a whole bunch of em for the native New Zealanders   Oh yeah and so much more humane than buying chicken that comes from a fucking chicken factory where the chickens literally cannot move, are covered in their own shit and surrounded by dead rotting corpses.   It's amazing how well you were able to show that you're an arrogant ass and a racist and also a lot less intelligent than you think you are. In only two sentences too!      Reminds me of Asheron's Call, an old MMO than came out in 1999. All the cows had a map the game world on them.   http://vnmedia.ign.com/acvault.ign.com/fms/images/Creatures/87/cow_fullres.jpg   I wish I had never seen the pictures on reddit of his OD and death. To see the incredible, full of life person he was go out like he did, that bothered me more than almost anything I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of shit on the internet.   Yep we sure do have a serious **interiority** complex   Yeah I used to think the show was the most boring show ever when I was a kid but ever since like 18 I have loved the shit out of out   I'm from Texas and I agree with everything you said in that post you linked to. Very well put. King of the hill IS a window into the lives of suburban Texans. I try to watch it every day 9pm on adult swim   What hassle? All you have to do to go to /r/todayilearned and sort by top of all time   Damn that periwink**le**  	108

 Pokemon. Obviously.   KAI-OH-TEE   To those Redditors that like their partner's genitals to dangle, how do you prefer their pubic hair to be (shaved/trimmed/natural/other)?  Out of interest too, if you don't mind, would you mind stating your gender and sexuality as well?   Best/favourite sexual technique to receive? (You said serious, but mentioned nothing about being cheeky)   Exactly what it says on the tin- you can define "best" however you want- funniest, weirdest, strangest, sexiest, whatever!  Note: have marked the thread NSFW just in case!   Online booster pack for what?   How much is Pokebank?   If that's how he broke up with you hon, you're better off. Keep your chin up and smile- get out there and be sociable, don't look for the next relationship, just be yourself and focus on enjoying life - let life happen.   How do the Crabs cards compare in style/quality to the Cards ones?   Yeah I know, by the end I was deluding myself about us, and it took a LOAD of friends banding together to intervene to make me realise we weren't actually working and that I was severely unhappy.  Long story short, much wiser and happier now!   You're young, you'll get over it.  It sounds harsh, but I made the same mistake and started a long term relationship when I was 14, lasted almost 7 years before I realised that I'd grown up and she hadn't. Trust me, you'll be better off.   I'd suggest ditching him love, as harsh as it sounds. It seems like he's stringing you along and not into you at all, and it's cruel of him to treat you so.  You should let him go and get on with your life- better will come along.   Zodiac- that shit was long and bad. A few hours of my life that I'll never get back...   I'd love your blank cards, if you're sure you don't want them!?      "I will find you, and I will kill you."  "Ohana means family, family means, no one gets left behind."   If it's just for E4 and not HM's, I'd skip the flyer and swap in a grass type. I'd recommend Exeggutor as a covering for psychic too, which can really pay dividends on Bruno's fighting types.   Left 4 Dead 2 - if you've got a four-strong group of friends this game has so much value for money. It has gags, it has a storyline, it has challenges, achievements and online (PvP) play, plus zombies and weapons.  If you play with linked skype/Teamspeak or similar, it's that much more enjoyable.   Forgive me if this has already been done, but; Redditors! Show me your Pokemon tattoos! (Doesn't have to be on your own body, can just be one/'s that you've seen online or out and about)   I sent a message to the Cards Against Humanity creators, saying that their game was awesome, and to suggest they make a "Blank Card" expansion, so that us creative types can add more than just the number of blanks you get in the five expansions.  Today, I received an email reply from Cards Against Humanity, and it was blank.  Touche, Cards Against Humanity, touche.   Umbreon swiftly followed by Glaceon for me.  I think a bug Eeveelution would be cool, though Steel, ground and dragon I'd imagine would look pretty badass.   Exactly what it says in the title, favourite Eeveelution (or maybe you prefer Eevee as Eevee) and why?  Also, for the hell of it, what type would you like to see the next Eeveelution be?   It's not designed to hold it all, it's designed so that the force of ejaculating inside the condom doesn't force the material to split/rip/tear with the added strain at that moment. Sure some the semen is caught there (hence reservoir tip as mentioned before), but no, not the entirety.   Heh, quick and awkward discharge.  Gotta love ulterior meanings.   To check, college = university right? (for us UK redditors)  In a biology lecture, some guy asked a (fairly valid) point on spirit in relation to the human body, of which the lecturer dismissed him (rather too harshly I might add). Barely had the words left his mouth than the skeleton at the edge of the room (the model type you get) dropped to the floor.  Probably a rusted bolt or hook breaking after slowly eroding away, but the timing was hysterical, as it had the circumstantial look of a "spirit" disagreeing with our lecturer.   By reminding myself that no-one else is or has been me, the sum total of my unique experiences, memories and perspectives, therefore everything I do is unique, even if it seems like it is an imitation of others work.  By this reasoning, whenever I approach a project (I'm a writer, though I dabble in art too), I can happily draw from other's work for inspiration without worrying about replication (though I do refrain from outright copying, because feelings), knowing that no-one in the world will have thought of this thing that I am about to do EXACTLY like I am about to do it.  Sorry if too deep.   Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring - when Aragorn is running through the pile of dead Uruk-Hai after beheading Lurtz, to get to the dying Boromir, a supposedly "dead" Uruk actually sits up and looks at him passing, before remembering he's meant to be dead and laying back down.  ALSO - Earlier in the film, as Aragorn is leading the hobbits through the marshes - Aragorn's bow (sticking out of his pack) hits the camera and jolts it, rocking the scene for a brief second.   The Day After Tomorrow (so much wrong), specifically, the scene after Jack Hall has finished briefing the president and joint chiefs - the Vice President says, regarding evacuating the entire Northern half of the USA, "It's alright for him suggesting such an action, he's safe here in Washington" (I'm ad-libbing).  If they're meaning Washington DC, the seat of US politics, then they're not that far (in the grand scheme of the USA's size) from New York, and still ABOVE the red line that Jack has drawn on the map.  If they're meaning the original Washington state, which just happens to be one of mainland USA's most northern states, they are STILL above that red line.  Either way, they are by no means safe, as per Jack's statement when the President asks "What about the people above that line?" - "For them it's already to late".   MAJOR error.    Okay, looking so far it'll be ORAS, but a further question - is there any differences to ruby or sapphire bar pokemon version differences? I usually go by that alone when deciding which to get...   WOOHOO! One fellow fan of nostalgia lol   Besides the planetary calculations and observations, there's another flaw in your post (maybe someone else has said but I'm too lazy to scroll too far); "beneficial for life". Whilst we cannot deny that our conditions on earth have been ideal for life as we know it to evolve, it remains impossible to tell if a form of life may be able to survive or evolve in different circumstances.  I'm of the firm belief that life has/could evolve in other conditions a lot different to ours, so would prefer scientists to be searching for planets that are "suitable" for "Earth-like life", instead of the more general terms.  Note: I'm no astrologist, astrophysicist or astrobiologist, this is all my opinion formed from general knowledge, and I give full kudos to the spirit of the original question   Jelly!!   Anyone remember these? They were a bit like chupa chups, but with chewing gum inside and a Pokemon sticker on the inner packaging. I used to collect so many of them...   So, I'm soon to get a 3DS and the capability to resume playing the Pokemon series once more. My problem is that, initially I can only afford one game, and that I have only played up to the Black/White games. Here's where you come in.  I want to know whether I should play X/Y or Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby first, and why (convince me). I have played the original ruby/sapphire, so know the storyline, but obviously with the revamp it'll be a whole new experience. I would say BW2, to pick up where I left off, but I can't find that available where I am unfortunately.   Hey guys,  I'd like an up-to-date Pokemon list (so all 718 Pokemon), preferably with types and if possible with pictures/avatars too. I don't care about the Mega-Evolutions, but it'd be handy if the list were on excel.  Hope someone can fulfill this request!   P.s. Open to other lists that maybe don't have the avatars/types, too.  P.p.s The reason I'm looking is I want to figure out what my favourite Pokemon is, so I want to have a list where I can easily delete any Pokemon that I dismiss, and sort/order them handily.   Pokeballs. I don't care if there aren't Pokemon to catch, I'd just love to have a super high quality display of them, just for coolness.   Thanks everyone!   You could interflora them?   Personally, I don't see a problem with it. Though I'm not an avid gardener, I do appreciate wildlife and beauty in nature, and fresh flowers do smell great (mostly) and brighten up a room, so I would appreciate a gift of flowers, even more so if they were hand picked because of their significance/name/colour/beauty - the thoughtfulness of a gift would be a significant part of the pleasure of receiving it.   Pro: individual government Con: individual government   I'd respectfully argue that a selfie is defined as a photo taken of yourself by yourself, whether or not other things are included, so "selfie" being the mode of picture taking rather than the picture itself. Edit: added respect.   Technically might not be classed as "celebrity", but when my mum met Princess Anne at a horse show event.  There's a great photo of her shaking hands with her ladyship, with 6/7 year old me in the background, more interested in my burger/hot dog (forget which).  	42
 You need some scratching up on your Major League movies there Roger Dorn! :)   I know Georges line, but the free and clear reminded me of the scene when Pedro Cerano says Free and Clear, but Charlie Sheen asks 'did he day Free and Queer?'   Reading your title, have you watched the movie Major League part 2?      Yep, so have I.  I abandoned them when they were full blown iOS fanboys, but now they're less biased.   Josh went to the New yorker or something posh like that, didn't he?  He was a bit of a pretentious wanker at times, but he got the job done.  Jon Rettinger is probably one of favorites and I should visit technobuffalo more.  For video reviews, Jon and MKBHD are my top picks.   The verge is now the old Engadget.   Engadget has now become what the verge used to be.    That I'm aware of, then again I'm sure parts of Asia are 240v too.  Holidaying in the states, the ex didn't shut the hell up about her hairdryer not working properly EVERYWHERE we went.   She was hoping it worked differently when we went from San Diego to New York.   You guys 240v? I thought that part of the world was the 110-130v range too.  Well, looks like my hairdryer would work fine there.. If I had one, and if I had hair.   Its Reddit. There is a subreddit for every weird bit of obscure shit in the world.   240v ? Aus or NZ?   You need to post this in /r/NSFWmomoftheyear   Well hang on..  I did the ota manually to lollipop.   So far I've had no dramas, the battery is better than it was on KitKat, the phone is still very snappy and quick, and it might be a placebo effect but the camera seems better.  The only issue I have is that the 4chan app Chanu no longer works.   I think its time for a r/bootgirl sub to be made specifically for her.  Trashy or not, I'd sub to it.   Well... Maybe her crotch looks like a worn boot   As long as that's not my family or SO in the pic, I'm all good with this post.     Ooohhhh she's wearing boots.  Didn't see that till it was pointed out.   Mine showed the 'error', then told me to download it again, crashed the second time and now no new update is available.  They can't even get the bugs in the bug fix sorted   Nothing but a positive experience every time I've dealt with Vapeking   Oooohhh.. THAT Herman grid illusion... Oh yeah, I knew it was that I was looking for    Any episode that's Dale centric is a winner for me.  A firefighting we will go is awesome as well, not Dale centric, but plenty of his awesomeness    Thanks mate, what about battery?   Thanks mate, pretty basic, compared to the nexus 5..  - battery life - camera - sound quality - screen quality     Bingo.. Well 5.2 inch I believe.  The only down side is that it doesn't have dual front speakers.   If the Aus play store sells out of the Nexus 6, then I can be 100% sure that they only released 15 phones on launch day.  No one can be stupid enough to fork out $800aud+ for a nexus.  I cringed at paying what I did for my Nexus 9, but at least thats a tablet.   Well either way, this just reaffirms that the Moto X will be my replacement for the Nexus 5 I have.  Fucking nexus 6 and its stupid size.   - The Sopranos - Seinfeld - King of the Hill   This is my top 3 which I've personally accomplished.   It was one of the nicest built phones back in its day.  From memory I think HTC released it with windows on it too   You're thinking of the HTC Dream / G1   We had that design in Aus, it was called the HTC Legend   Where does he find those shirts? And noticed the 360 on his wrist   4 chan less /b/ro   Being in Aus, that date made perfect sense to me.  It's only you imperial loving clowns that get confused :)     How's your tailbone?   All I'm seeing lately is that The Verge has hired all of the reporters Engadget once had and vice versa.  Engadget was just a tech site for Apple fanboys, not The Verge has taken over that role.   Meh, I'd still tap it.   Metalife isnt a scam, I feel so refreshed and full of energy. I've lost 5 pounds and haven't even left the couch.  Idiots.   Huh? Their Banana custard rivals all the crap I've paid a fortune for from the US   Bosco?   My Nan Nan?!   That's the exact same path I'm taking.. The nexus 5 was a done deal for me, but a monstrously big phone with a hefty price tag isn't something I'm willing to just buy Willy nilly!   I bought one on release day by sheer fluke.  I was one of the 8 people that got the first run of the Nexus 4.   Count me in the club.   I don't mind their shitty built plastic phones, with horrible battery life and over saturated screens, its Touchwiz that pisses me off the most.    I have a Nexus One, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 and just ordered a Nexus 9..   This sub isn't condescending at all, everyone is really friendly.  Oh.. Wait...     This whole screenshot with the OP and 'creep' is worthy of r/cringepics   'Welcome to r/creepypms, say cheese!'  The cringe..   Mate, you're not alone, I thought the same thing.  Now they just have to make their phone's take decent photos   Even if it didn't, the lovely Nerds on XDA would surely conjure something up for us!   I have a N5 and a 2012 N7,  I pulled the trigger and pre-ordered a 32gb N9 the day it was open for pre-order.  I buy every Nexus, including the dreaded heap of shit Galaxy Nexus.  The Nexus 6 will be the exception, I don't mind the price as you're paying for what you're getting, but 6 inches is just too stupidly big.  Project Volta better sort out my Nexus 5 battery life, or I'll be updating to the 2014 Moto X instead.  Just when Google finally release the dream Nexus phone, with all the hardware and build quality we have been waiting for, they fuck it right up by making it the biggest phone on the market.  Where's my Nokia 8210, I'm going back to the days when my battery lasted 3 days and the phone fit in my pocket.   It's awesome that Google is listening to their userbase and including functions that have been on custom roms such as CM for a long time now, but they should've had these functions included a long time ago.  Especially the flashlight functionality, that should've been included with stock Android from the moment they made a phone with a camera and an led flash.   That whiney American accent made me internal rage throughout the whole video.  She sat there filming and barking orders instead of actually doing anything.     Remember to pass it back on to someone who is now in the same shoes you once were.   Well as per some of the below comments, I hope its not.  5.9inch is fucked.  The nexus 5 is the border for me.    Order it to an address in Ballina :)   I knew exactly what the video was going to be before I even clicked it.  Still watched it in its entirety.   One of the best clips.   I hope you're right    You need to remember, cigarettes tasted ok when we smoked, but you never had 4 in a row, you could see when you ran out and were left with just the butt.  When vaping, we are inhaling all types of flavours that taste awesome (most of the time) and if you really wanted to, the only stop would be you running out of juice in the tank or battery.  You definitely had too much nic and that's the feeling you get.  If you're a chain vaper and are on it quite a fair bit, maybe drop the nic to 8mg ..   I've been saying this since Gingerbread..   I want to be able to finally to a backup of my phone and then restore it app for app, message for message, icon on home screen for icon on hone screen, when I login to my new phone.  It can't be that hard.  I don't care about my music, photos are already backed up to google..    You forgot the 21. Do  a gonewild post, claim I'm shy and a virgin, but show everyone on the internet what I ate for breakfast 2 weeks ago, with a cat in the background and an anti religion poster on the wall.   I wish I didn't watch that.  I automatically thought of my son and almost shed a tear feeling the pain the dad was in the video.     You need to cross post this to /r/justneckbeardthings   That episode had the best Dale moments in it.. Especially when Hank finally let Dale rip on Bill   They spelt what hwat wrong.   For any absolute beginners, I always recommend an Evod kit.  They're cheap and come complete ready to go.. If Vaping isn't for you and you don't like it, you're not stuck with an expensive bunch of equipment    Ha! As a kid when one of our family picnics went down the usual path of one of my drunken uncles getting into a fight with another picnic goer..   He threatened my uncle with "you want to take this outside??!!"  The response was an instant "We are outside you fucken idiot!"   Needless to say, everyone laughed and situation was defused.   From memory, I remember reading somewhere that its the bodies way of checking that the old fella still works and the plumbing is all ok as it does its system checks and mainframe restarts while you sleep..   I'm probably doing it wrong, but I'm not enjoying dripping at all.. I have a Stillaire on it at the moment and its not for me, the Kayfun lite and the Stingray are a perfect match.   Funny this, I'm having this same issue with mine and its a day old..  Gonna try and change the pin out as a first step..  It is probably the best mod I've owned so far, especially that it's smaller than the nemesis as well!  The nemesis is now in the draw.   Is your name actually Yatzi? I don't know any Jewish names but that sounds Jewish.   Spare some change for an old buccaneer?   That's not too bad, I'm trying to grow hair in general.   I almost drowned as a kid when I was caught in a really strong rip..  This article is 100%, screaming for help for some reason was the last thing on my mind, I did everything the books tell you not to do such as panic and swim against the current.  It took a while of struggling before I realised what I was doing and started to swim away from the current and not against it.  Needless to say, it scared the shot out of me and reaffirmed why I hate the beach so much.  Now that I have a son, I'm even more cautious when he is next to water.   Nancy, Why is John Redcorn in our shower?   He's copying this guy - Trent from Punchy: http://youtu.be/0RjC-vh06_c  I hope to good he doesn't get a following, that was painfully annoying to listen to and watch   MY NAN NAN??!!!   r/wtf has basically turned into r/mildlyinteresting   SPEAK UP FAGGOT!    Ha! Spacedicks is my go-to subreddit for when people ask me to show them what Reddit is.  Its the 2 girls 1 cup of Reddit.  The rest will remain Blue.  Ok I lie.. I just clicked on clop clop to see what it was.. Sad world we live in.   You are a gentleman    You want to advertise the bottle don't you! :)  Let me make some up mate and I'll give you a yell   Once you start with this stuff it's bloody life consuming!  The hardest thing I've found is a balance in making the juice strong enough for evod / clearomiser users but not too strong from Kayfun / RDA users!  Strawberries and cream is sickly sweet   I think I might need to register a new account with PENIS_Juice as the username :)  Thanks again mate and the work you did is absolutely brilliant.   Its the one that gets the most laughs!!   You are a gentleman and I would be more than happy to share my recipes!  At the moment I'm only really kind of happy with my banana custard and strawberries and cream. The grape is ok but nothing crash hot in my opinion.. But I'm a little finicky! :)   Mate you have outdone yourself.  I mean honestly outdone all expectations I had.  Bottles will be mixed up this weekend and on their way, I have all your details via pm as well.  All I need is your mg preference or do you want to mix your own?   Lol not attached to fonts colours etc.. And all my bottles are the standard 30ml size.  The ONLY thing that can be changed is maybe dropping the penis and balls off Nut Butter.. I love the joke being subtle :)  The grape isn't quite ready yet, but my Banana custard is and so is my Strawberries and cream.  Your concoction sounds bliss!  I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so be warned.. All my mixes are 70vg 30pg at this stage :)   Damn it, I haven't even sold a juice yet and I already have 3 employees on the books.  Fine, you're hired.  Plus you get a free bottle of Statutory Grape from PENIS Juice Down Under (Being from Aus, this only makes sense to add to the name)  No, honestly, PM me details, I'll pay the shipping etc and send you a bottle of Juice for you to try out and tell me what you think.   Even though technically I can't sell Nic based juices in Aus, doesn't stop me selling to the US! , So let me know the mg.     I sometimes spell Jerry with a G.. And an I !!!   I don't think you people understand that I will now make this a reality.  426 upvotes, to me means 426 possible customers with a sense of humour.  Thanks to User u/GhotiOuttaDHMO - I will make 'Statutory Grape' a my first flavour and send out the samples as a free give-away,   You are the WINNER!  Some of them made me actually LOL  You will be my PENIS Juice Chef.   I can make that juice a joint venture with you,   A part of the new and improved PENIS range of Juices..  My PENIS Juice will be spread around in mouths world-wide, being sucked on by many people of many cultures and races..  Then it will be second hand inhaled by non vapers.  My PENIS Juice knows no bounds.   Veeeery good, but I'm really liking the other recommendation of 'Baby batter'   hehe, I have.. well, About 5 mins ago I asked him how he likes my Juice in the back of his throat.   Not available in my country... Damn it.   Not sure what Chicago flag stars look like, the only stars I know are on the Aus flag :)   Hmmm... let me consult google on this one.   You have now just labelled my Beehive Blend.  'Milky Man Honey'   See, this is clever.  Very clever.  It will be my Cookies and Cream name.   Well Mr Floorspud - thank you!  You're little comment has now become a reality.. Like that guy that watercolours everything.   It sure is, one of the events girls photoshopped the bow-tie on him   That boy ain't right.   Ooohhh that's a good name.  I've been trying to figure out funny names for the juice flavours.   Ha ha yes!!   Well that bottle was Strawberries and cream.    Extra creamy   I'm going to show him the comments, the guy is basically Hank Hill, his squareness will make his cringe face even better   	102
 There is a spider within 3 feet of you. All the time. First time I read this I looked out the window afterwards and whaddya know.. spider.   Skyrim and Life is Beautiful. Gotta kill me some Nazis while maintaining a generally optimistic attitude about shit gone wrong.   stealing money most days of the week as a cashier. My dad taught me not to be a rat.   This saddens me.   I think some elvish make up would do wonders. YouTube has some great tutorials.    I don't care much for how Muslim women are treated. Other than that, I've got no problems.   Nature produces many instruments of creativity.    Looking in the mirror; getting older.    My grandfather has Alzheimer's and sometimes I have to take care of him. I am 22 and my 76 year old Grandpop makes me so scarred to grow up, get old, and totally become a baby again. Helping him get undressed, eat, or even to get him outta bed is like having a gray-haired toddler who thinks he's the boss. Gotta love him, though!  Sometimes, I get these scary visions of when my mom, future SO, or even myself will get like this and it just reminds me how scary time is.

 Not hot to the touch. Not a bug bite, its actually been there for a while. Maybe even years. Doesn't seem to be causing any other problems.      	2
 Avatar was badass   They both die in their respective movies, be kind of tricky to pull that off.   John travolta(vincent vega) and Micheal Madsen(vic vega) are brothers. Just watched quentin tarantino confirm this, ive watched these movies many times never noticed this.     Thats pretty powerful   I quote this alot, i really love it. Kind of even fits into Sam harris and the like views' on morality. But not even looking at it in that light, a quote that really sums up lifes lessons and a healthly way to view them.By the great Alexander Dumas from the epic "The count of monte cristo".       "There is neither happiness nor misery in the world, only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."    You summon the Devil and realize he is the better(moral) of the two. God is more true to the old testament version, willingly letting sin thrive. The bible was falsafied to gain worship, the source of power for any higher being. The Devil names you as the prophetic messengar to change the worlds view, and lead those to worship, give power to, Satan......   The lion king   Apocalypse Now     The Godfather 1+2     Avatar      Fight Club   Intelligence is not only defined by the ability to create.   Just watched this fight, Wow. Easily one of the best ive seen.   Ali gets out classed in that one imo, i think their 3rd fight was the best ever though   This is not true, for all states. In louisiana the state is notified regardless of an sr22 if your policy is revoked. There are also constantly rising financial  penalties for this as well.    I have actually seen this fight, no bout about it epic fight.    When I look around at the world, look like god is taken a 10 count right now   Yes, but in some cases when wages increase it's to combat the fact that prices of goods( walmart) have already increased. So in some way it's too even out raised prices.     They train there body, to the point they actually stretch their stomach. I'm sure some purge, but I would believe most exercise on a daily basis. They also do not eat like this all the time, they go through periods where they train, and go back to eating more normal proportions when they are not.     I will also add, I assume this process is not the healthiest of things to put your body through and most will have consequences from this at some point in life.    This is a high risk policy. It cost an insane amount compared to regular insurance. It is mandate in louisiana for years after a DUI or DWI. It is essentially the same as a standard policy but it cost more because of your history and the risk it takes to insure you.     I'm sure there are other reasons, I can only speak to my experience in Louisiana and in my case it was a requirement after a DUI. I also had to ride out the years it was required to have without further incident or the requirement time would be longer. I pay about 70$  month now, but during my sr22 period it was over 200$ per month.    The best I ever saw was the thrilla in Manila. Like to watch other great fights but don't know where to start, help?    Religion shapes a warped view of reality. Most religions are not compatable with what we know about the world today. Not having a religion does not make a person cease to ask the questions that are important to us all, we just look for these answers without using fairy tales.      It seems ludicrous to me to believe a book from 2000 years ago, obviously written by people who had no idea how the universe worked. Much more reasonable to look for answers from those who do.    I'm not really religious but you learn more from your failing then you do from succeeding. An old poker player can tell you every bad beat he had but have a harder time telling you all his winnings. Pain can be a powerful lesson. Suffering, as you described it, on a small scale can be a powerful teacher.    I'll leave you with a quote from the great Alexander Dumas, " There is no happiness or misery in the world, only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."    Yes you get certain antibiotics for certain infections. When a cut on your foot gets infected you will get one set of antibiotics, and when you get a tooth infection you get another set.      Also you can use antibiotics from your cut foot incident to help with your tooth infection. Antibiotics will help bring down your infection no matter what they were designed for. Why? That I really don't know but I have also heard many times it is not good for your body to take antibiotics for one infection when they were designed for another.   To add, another aspect of slavery rarely touched on was the price of goods. The south and it's products such as cotton could basically charge whatever they deemed. The north could not effectively combat these prices by boycott because the south wasn't paying their workers so a boycott would not effect them much. The north could only hold out for so long, they needed the products offered from the south.     So slavery was a human rights issue in one hand but also very much an economic of goods issue that had nothing to do with the terror of slaves or improving their livelihood    Mohamed is the most important one though. Jesus is basically the Christians Mohamed, with Christianity adapting Moses And Jesus as one of a few of their prophets. I assume this depiction has been an issue and probably still is but it's just not of the same importance as Mohamed who represents worshippers of today, as where Jesus and Moses in the Quran represented a certain people in a certain time.    Thanks for the links, although I do feel this thread has specific questions not touched on in several of the threads I read.    A prophet according to the Quran has been sent to each people throughout time, where Mohamed was sent as the last one for all mankind instead of for a specific people in a certain time in history.    A prophet is sent to portray gods law though actions and will power without nessicarily calling for his worship. A prophetic messenger is sent to reveal gods law by calling for his worship and people to follow him.    There are over 100,000 prophets in The Quran, maybe more. Jesus was amoung them, so yes important I never said unimportant but not the same importance as Mohamed. Mohamed was the only prophetic messenger from god, Allah. That's why Mohamed's' depiction is so deeply protected.    They are not concerned with these figures like Mohamed and they are not depicted as being as important either.   Muslims do not use or worship the bible. Their religious book is the Quran. The one true prophet in their religion is Mohamed. Jesus and Moses are not depicted the same and do not have the same importance in the Quran as they do in the bible.      Sequel is good 2    The way people retain information is almost individually exclusive. I have found highlighting quite effective. Really was just offering different avenues to travel to retain what you read, which was the topic at hand.   One of the sentences you pointed out does need some restructuring but most of what you brought up is just rephrasing the sentence to your liking. It's mostly your opinion on how you would write it as opposed to being grammatically correct. There are issues grammatically but not to the extent you are portraying. I do need to improve the effectiveness of punctuation.     I disagree it doesn't have a good flow, which is mainly determined by opinion anyway. We can both read Hemingway and agree its good, well structured, grammatically sound but disagree on flow.       Lighter would change the meaning of what I was trying to get across to you about the sentence in question and it's meaning.    The "trip" sentence I see nothing wrong with in the story. Again I do like the concept of the story being written by an insane person who hasn't returned from the dark. I will experiment in my next draft to bring to life the insanity of this "author" and his plea for others to take this trip.    The revenant      Avatar 2 whenever this damn movie gets released   A long one   A misconception is actors can only do what they have done in the past. You can tell a great actor by diversity in his roles, so i do like Rockwell for this role as ive said but dont limit yourself thinking well this actor has never done this type of role so it means he cant.     I think Affleck seized the opportunity to work with one of the greatest directors in recent history. The first time i saw this movie it blew me away. But Fichers movies are so great b/c of their rewatch ability imo. I cant tell you how many times ive watched fight club, girl with dragon tattoo, etc     But affleck just doesnt hold up in multiple viewings after the script and its twist are revealed imo. With that said i think his directing will only improve a great deal from this point on. Makes me wish he was still doing Kings The Stand.   Thanks for the post, im glad you enjoyed it. Not sure how clear my intentions are, but i really like this concept and will probaly do a couple more drafts.   Robbins is probaly too old, rockwell is a thought. That guy from who played the villian in guardians of the galaxy, lee pace i think he would be a better choice than affleck. I still think leo would have nailed this, and rooney was made to play that part.   I appreciate your help.     The second sentence is saying your dark(madness) side is linked to your light(sane) side no matter if you try to deny or confirm. A denial would be frail and weak and to confirm is bold and strong.     Good call on a few sentences there. Although i do like the idea "i have taken the trip some say i have never returned" so that madness plays a part in sentence formation and structure. Although this was not my intention it is a fruitful thought     Wouldn't underestimate him   I'm not a big fan of affleck especially in that movie, I do think his directing is damn good though. Great movie and pikes was good I have to say but I think Leo and Rooney would be a must see version.   Gone girl.  Leo dicaprio and Rooney Mara    Can you elaborate on cleaning up, I'd love some critical input    That's great to have someone to really delve into your story to where they offer insight into the little details. It did have a sort of "gameish" feel to it. I also found it quite cool I didn't realize the titles' relationship to the story till the end, and it hit me like a cold shower.      I just offered a short story myself would like to know what you think.    This is hilarious. You are probably very close to the truth.   Where do you get trailers from?     Edit, When it comes to movies, sites or critics almost never have the same taste as you, and when they do about a specific movie it's simply by chance. I don't rely on some site telling me what's good, what's bad, they are all inconsistent to my liking. I never use them, I watch a movie and make up my own mind before being infiltrated with ideas of others.    Write it down, dont type but write it down. The most important parts, however you want to summarize it. Use a sheet for every chapter and then you can go back and read what you wrote.     I dont know specifics but something about writing things down or even highlighting passages helps your brain to remember.   Great story, in some weird way it was like the movies Cast Away meets Ghost. I dont say that to undermine your extremely well written story just a thought that  popped in my head as i was getting to the end.     I was in a trance from start to finish, thanks for sharing.   Not me, some of my favorite movies do not have good scores to such a low degree in some cases i would never have attempted to watch. Once i found this out i lost any trust in those sites    That was very good. Your imagery is powerful and a steady flow to your story. I love the direction of a dark trip to an eerie forest, quite great imo. Thanks for your reply, only question did you truly return??     My only critque is the 2nd me, the 3rd me, i think keep that sense of dark mystery in naming the guides.   Red lights   That guide can lead you to not watch movies that have bad ratings you might have enjoyed imo   The music you know you can find its what happens off stage where the mystery is   We become the plague that unleashes the Plague.   I really enjoyed this, the flow you write with is impressive. It kind of grabs you and never lets go to the end. One of the better stories ive read so far. In a very distant way reminded of the stand by king. Thanks for sharing   I found it quite interesting. An atheist trying to find supernatural meaning ending in tragedy. Even with its unfavorable outcome and unreasonable evidence he never released that supernatural feeling. Like a non believer who knows you cannot prove something doesnt exist, but knows there is a possibility, he chose to indulge in the small chance of the supernatural that he cant bring himself to apply to the grand scheme of things, but instead applys it to his intimate side and emerse his love in the supernatural. Maybe not the authors intention but it provoked my reaction none the less.   I enjoyed this alot, well written.   To defend your madness is to defend your sanity. They are infinitely linked, eternally combined, a part of all of us no matter the frailty of the denial or the strength of the conformation. We are all trapped in our heads, there is no escape, there is nothing more. Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. With your bloodline being your universe. We are all on the deepest levels at an extreme distance from each other but on a cosmic scale ever so close. We can if we really try and reach out, attempt to connect, like a highly advanced telescope spying on the surrounding cosmos, and dig into the endless wonders of the neighboring universe. And if you know how and what to look for the data can be immense and overwhelming. But never the less an illusion to a true connection.       We are all moving away from each other at a staggering pace, starting from the time we began. We hide parts of ourselves that can never be found, and with enough time not even by the hider themselves. Our secrets overlap secrets that overlap secrets that's overlapping a distant face of the Truth. The part of ourselves that are hidden are locked in a safe that's filled with other smaller safes. It is reopened from time to time and a smaller safe with a different combination is neatly tucked in next to all the rest. The individual combinations are lost over time and consequently only so many safes can ever be opened.       Even when you think you have successfully connected with a distant galaxy it is only an illusion to the true contents. You only receive ripples from an ever filling lock box. The real makeup of any soul is only fragments of the Truth. You can trace back their steps, study their orbits, even predict future reactions, and gather all the evidence available. But alas in the end you are only left with theories and no observable science to test, no universal key to their lock box. The mysteries that are trapped there are most not even obtainable to the author(hider) themselves, lost to the dark side.        Living inside this false illusion is where the light shines brightest, you can only expose your forgotten past, hidden truths, and the origin of your true nature by exploring the Dark Side of your Mind, the side of your mind that's orbit never touches the light. A trip there and you will never return the same, if you return at all. The Madness, the Darkness, it will forever be intertwined in your being, grabbing ahold, tightening its grip and never letting go.        But there in that darkness will be the long lost combinations of your past, and the keys to your future. The trip is worth the burden, outweighs the risk of never leaving the comfort, the light. To make this trip is to make the most of your galaxy and better understand the multiverse that surrounds us all. My trip has been satisfying and enlightening, although some say I have never returned. But I find solace in something the great Alexander Dumas wrote, " There is neither happiness nor misery in the world, there is only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."               So Travel to the Dark Side of your Mind and contend with your Madness.    Well written., i would be interested in reading more of micheal and irene.    Might add a little depth to throw  in Irene's love of medicine or something to that effect, in the beginning.   Dear g,   Stop wasting your time and energy with me. Live your life with no more thought of the divine. Plunge into the depths of reality treading new paths where ever you go. Spark inspiration in others and freely receive these charges. Fear none but respect all. Enjoy this gift as this will be your only one. Make sure in your final moments , as the movie of your past and present plays out you are not filled with Regret but overcome with a feeling of having Reinvented the Gods. Only then will we meet, and i know you've got an entertaining film, so i got my popcorn ready, so 2 say.    GOD    Ps. Dont know how you got my email but wont fare you well to give it out. Dont reply, Im watching movies    To contend with Madness is to defend your sanity. We are all trapped in our heads, there is no escape, there is nothing more. Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. Your bloodline is your universe. We are all distant but on some cosmic scale ever so close. We can if we really try reach out, sort of like a highly advanced telescope spying on the surrounding cosmos, and dig in to the endless wonders of a neighboring universe. And if you know how and what to look for the data can be immense and overwhelming.    We are all moving away from each other at a staggering pace, starting from the time we began. We hide parts of ourselves that can never be found, and with enough time not even by the hider themselves. Our secrets overlap secrets that overlap secrets overlapping a distant face of the truth. The parts of our soul that are hidden are locked in a sort of safe that's  filled with other smaller safes. It is reopened from time to time and another safe with a different combination is neatly tucked in next to all the rest. The individual combinations have been lost with time and only so many safes can ever be opened.    Even when you think you have successfully communicated with a distant galaxy it is only a illusion to the true contents. You only receive ripples from an ever filling lock box. The real makeup of any soul is only fragments of the Truth. You can trace backs their steps, study their orbits, even predict future reactions, and gather all the evidence available. But alas in the end you are only left with theories and no observable science to test, no universal key to their lock box. The mysteries that are trapped there are some no longer even known to the hider themselves, lost to the dark side.    Living inside this false illusion is where the light shines brightest, you can only expose your forgotten past, hidden truths, and the origin of your true nature by exploring the Dark side of your mind, the side of your mind that's orbit never touches the light. A trip there and you will never return the same, if you return at all. The madness, the Darkness, it will forever be intertwined in your being, grabbing ahold, tightening its grip, and never letting go.      But there in that darkness will be the long lost combinations of your past, and future. It will not be easily spotted and it will not be easily obtained. The trip is worth the burden, outweighs the risk of never leaving the comfort, the light. To make this trip is to make the most of your galaxy and better understand the multiverse that surrounds us all. As Alexander Dumas wrote "there is neither happiness nor misery in the world, there is only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."             so Travel to the Dark Side of your Mind, and Contend With Madness.    What?!? I thought house of 1000 corpses was better but devils reject was damn good IMO    Any favorites?   Yea that was a good debate but it wasnt really a debate on the existence of god, it was evolution vs creationism.     You like the film b/c you havent read the book. The movie with guy pearce literraly could change just the characters names and it could be called something else.   Good fellas   The devils rejects is the sequel to house of a 1000 corpses.     Anything rob zombie directed will be what you are looking for.   I think everyone has seen this   This has nothing to do with the topic, thats what i was referring to.    Any thats debateable   Never heard of dillhunty ill check him out. I agree with the great debates are very entertaining,i like the discussion videos too  but i like more of a back and forth though.    Harris and Wolpe, wolpe makes some solid points if you havent seen it. Nothing to doubt your views but he had an impressive case imo. Thanks for the reply   Ive watched alot of dawkins harris and hitchens. If there are any other great atheist debaters would love some recomendations. With that said what has been your favorite debate?     My fav: harris vs wlc, although hitchens vs hitchens is like a 1b   The tub offers more protection. I believe the middle of the house is the safest place. Not 100% though   Im not christian was curious to dicuss with those who are. We really arent "discussing" anything you are just throwing insults around. I dont understand how discussing ones beliefs show fear and predjudice, but again they are both quite obvious in your comments.    Acapolypse now. I dont think this war movie will ever be topped.   Yea I looked it up, you are right about the draft picks. So just my example was wrong but restricted fas do come with conditions.    Nba cannot use draft picks on restricted Fas?   I was not displeased just drawing a comparison to the way you make comments and comments you critize.   How do you see discussing others belief as fearful or predjudice of their beliefs? Can you see how your comments convey exactly that of fear and predjudice?   Its funny you make comments like these and critize mine   Im looking for personal viewpoints, so any who answer the questions fron their experience is satisfying. Ive made up my mind to my truths im curious how others arrived at theirs   Well said, thanks for touching on all topics   Lol, your childish insults are quite comical.   How do the gay people in your church justify worshipping a book that says they are going to hell?   Thats kind of sad. If i understand you dont think you have a choice to decide is quite a depressing thought. If you are going to spend your life worshipping you should have a choice and weigh your options.   Can you attempt the 4 questions asked?   Why have you choosen the "right" religion for you and can you attempt to answer the 4 questions?   Well said thanks for touching on all the questions i asked   Thats the same avenue i found, to me the only rational avenue to take. But im curious how others came to their path answering the same question   Im looking for how you answer the questions posed.   The rationlization you prefer to is what im after, i understand how it works. How do you personally rationalize it? Can you answer the 4 questions?   Yea dont have that option   Cant highlight or copy n patse   Well said thanks for the reply   Can you answer on the 4 questions in the description?    Cant copy and paste so that would be more trouble than its worth. But thanks for the link i see how its done now   It still doesnt give me an option unless you are manually typing the quote in     Thanks for answering those 4 questions, no need for specific disagreements to be mentioned just wanted to know what you already provided   im not being critical and you can choose to see it that way. Im either addressing the fact they didnt answer the questions, only answered one, or askin them to elaborate on answers.    I dont see that as aggressive but i see at as inquirying further those who are interested enough to reply. If you dont like it thats ok i dont feel alot of posters see it that way     EDIT: i also believe some people read just the title and skip the description, so some just might not know im looking for more than the title   Yea i dont have that option   Thats not really adressing the questions though, forget the title, the 4 questions in the description and your personal take on them   Read the description, no need to rewrite them   Np   Can you touch on the specific questions?   I dont see how that answered any of my questions   How do you quote, cant figure it out? Ill adress them in order     Most historical claims in the bible come under much scrutinty even by christians     Do you think if you were brought up in a different enviroment you would have found a different religion?     So you have looked to see what other religions offered or not?     There are some controversal things in the christian faith, do you agree with all of them?   Well said, thanks for touching on all questions.  	105
    This is a bit creepy.    Are they serious? Hehe maybe all the running clog their thinking caps hehe          Ok thanks. Thats good to hear!   This is very promising if only it's not that expensive   Wow this is good. But is it free?                Ask about the benefits and salary    What are they serious?      	15
 Just came to see if anybody dared to say rape and if it was upvoted   Edit: checked the top 5, it wasn't there, I was surprised    299 is a lot of money for what they offer, isn't it?  You can almost get a decent phone for that money    I don't seem to understand what that means. Is it  A) there will be a way to simply change to a different room provided by Sony or  B) I still have to unlock the bootloader to get this (and accept the drawbacks)        If he is saying that he is proud of himself that he is making this step despite all the shit that people will give him, then ok, I agree.  If he is proud of being gay, I repeat, what is there to be proud of?   What is there to be proud of. I'm happy for them that they know what they want but there is nothing to be proud of.   It's like saying I'm proud of liking the colour blue       I was at a lake he was swimming to a little island and back. On the way back he was struggling but at first I thought he was messing with hims SO. Then she started panicking. I jumped in a saved him. He almost caused us both to drown.  After I got up asked if he was ok and walked away.    Let's say 10 years from now.    How is that?   It got cheap. for me that is perfect. I do not need anything apart from a seat on my flight. I just want to get there fast and cheap.   I agree with you. I think the problem is that:  - It easy for people to make music now. Access to instruments and digital instruments is cheap and everybody has a PC - Publishing on the internet is easy  - people are stupid  Conclusion is that there is a lot of shit music that is published and stupid people consume it which is why it is on the radio all day.  BUT, people with skill have been making better music every year.   America.  And the rest of the western world for that matter. America is just ahead. Rich are getting richer, poor are getting poorer and soon it won't be white masters and black slaves, but rich masters and poor slaves.   What does that even mean?   Since when is awesomeness not included in that equation?   Saved a boy's life and walked away without saying anything. I will always be that mysterious hero.    Not my original thought but:   We should all be against it for one reason: The argument "somebody who's got nothing to hide has got nothing to fear" is BS because accepting that puts you in the position to have to explain yourself. The government should not be able to look at all your shit and ask: why, what, when? What if you haven't done anything but struggle to explain something that looks dodgy?   The government should be the one having to explain why there is a good reason to investigate you.   this is not about protecting us from terrorists, this is about protecting the normal people from the government.       Also, he does not explicitly say it but I feel he wants more money they more the song gets played but still wants the price for Spotify to be higher.   The way I see it I either:  - Pay once and own it forever (higher amount) - Pay regularly and get access (lower amount)  I simply will not pay for Spotify if it costs me $50 per month.   I really dislike his article. Poor him for only earning 10 instead of 40 million.    How did you go about learning? I am interested   Edit: just played and I am super frustrated. I find it too hard to casually play it    Good morning.  I am looking for a weather widget that shows pictures of my location. Like yahoo weather just as a widget.  Edit: nevermind. Apparently yahoo weather has widgets. I'm an idiot    Just remind me, what is the traditional way?    Works fine again. I am not sure how you are able to do it so quickly and hw you are even able to identify the problem but all I can say is thank you! Awesome work.   I like your app!   Hey, first of all: thank you.  I updated and it worked fine. Great app. Now I updated again thought and I've got the same problem as before.   BTW, what are the scores based on?   Maybe I am misunderstanding but there are loads.  Best one is  Linkme mangarock   Keeps crashing on my z3c. But I am more than interested. Do you know what the problem might be?   I don't actually know what the keyboard is but the new Sony z3 has an amazing keyboard. It is almost like SwiftKey, just better. Predictions seem better and the layout is nicer. Only thing I miss is the dedicated numbers row    Why is she not sweating?    Well, I do not. I'm pretty sure OP will be alright.    Does nobody care about the fact that somebody killed themselves?  Poor her must have had a shit life.    OP I think your edit is great. The best out of all of them. Great picture as well.   I used to think that religion is the biggest problem we have on earth. I used to think that Muslims hate Christians and vice versa.  However I have come to the conclusion that the problem is not religion at all. It is that a large percentage of people are greedy, aggressive and stupid. The majority of these people that make up the followers of Islam and Christianity are no Muslims or Christians, they are idiots. They do not follow the teachings of their religion in the slightest. The cherry pick the rules that they follow and do not give a shit about many of the rules that actually are not at all optional (stealing, murdering, drinking alcohol, having sex, eating certain things, the list is long).   These people judge other bases on a set of rules that they in no way want to follow themselves and just turn a blind eye to their fellow "believers" and everybody just hops that nobody ever mentions that they are all a bunch of sinners.   And it the same with non religious people. People say you should do this and that and should not do this and that, but when it comes to it people's beliefs go out the window pretty quickly. And all just because people are greedy.   I hate humans more than I am able to say and I am sure what I have written does not even begin to explain what I feel.   I will do my best to live what I preach.    Do you sometimes feel like you have got something intelligent to share and you wish people would just listen for you for 10 seconds and then maybe spend another 5 minutes to discuss what you have just said?   I do.    And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII  will always love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu uuuuuuuuuooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuu   Yeah, I don't like OP's argument. But this is a good enough counter argument    Let me know when you get an update. I am also interested.    I feel stupid for asking. What do you mean by that?    Understood. Will go with wordpress   Hey, I have decided to go with wordpress. But I'll still have a look at this.    Our host provide wordpress integration. We'll go for that. I will def lok through your guide. I am a beginner so if you want I'll give you feedback for your guide.    It's for my dad's business. Just as a place customers can come for information and contact. Nothing fancy. I'm gonna use wordpress now.    Hi, I appreciate your offer. However we would like to try ourselves. The feedback I got here was really good. Thank you.   That is what I will do. Currently playing around with it. Thank you also for your feedback.    I am going for wordpress. Thank you for your feedback.    That is what I went for. Thank you!   Hey,  I had a webhoest before and we are kind of stuck with them for a year. However they offer wordpress integration so we'll use that now. Thank you. All of you helped me a lot.    Hey, I decided to go with wordpress. I am now in the process of building it. Thank you. I appreciate you took the time to answer.    Thank you for your feedback. Decided to go with wordpress.    So, just to give you some feedback. I have now changed to wordpress. it's easiest for me and my dad. As soon as I am done I'll send you the result if you are interested.  Thank you very much for your help.    It's called 3 ways: It starts with a scene where a young guy sits in front of a gangster in his office. The guys says, you got three possibilities: Run, lie or do what I am asking you to do. if you don't do what I am asking you to do, I will kill your girlfriend. We will never find out what he did. Not flashbacks (flashbacks are for the prequel) Then the movie shows all three possibilities at the same time and at the end you will find out which of the three turned out to be the one he should have chosen and which one he chose.   the movie will constantly switch between the three.  Awesome, right? Anybody wants to buy the script?   I thought you meant how do I feel about using make up myself. Not sure if that is what you mean, but I will answer it anyway:  I don't mind if men wear it. From my point of view there is nothing gay about it, if men do it well. However, I can't even stand cream on my hands, so I will never do it, no matter if it is acceptable or not.    You don't know what you don't know. Listen to people with experience. They know what they don't know.  It took me a while to understand this.    It is the other way round, surely.    I dont like the way you write, but I agree with you.    Losing weight. Of course there are 100 different opinions how to achieve it, but so many people get it 100% wrong and expect so much in so little time and then give up because they are disappointed.   I get so frustrated with these people, not because they don't achieve anything, but because they don't want to listen.   Most difficult and I am not there but somebody in my family is. Accepting that you will die, old or young. From what I can tell it makes you free.    I can't believe somebody else wrote this. I also commented not checking before. I have never cried so hard from a movie   God, I almost forgot about this one. It is a brilliant movie. Thank for refreshing my memory. Do you know any similar movies?   If he knew there is no afterlife.    Click with Adam Sandler. Yes, I know...   But I wept like a little bitch at the end.    Why?   Why?   Why?   why?   Fuck off and die    is the Japanese way to end a request in a polite way.    Haha, did that must be BS.    Black people and chicken. Why do they not eat anything else? I mean I like chicken, but I also like salad, pork and cheese.    I guess it's because this is the way to be accepted in that kind of environment.   I love Eminem.   But I really think that any movie, song, story that ends with waking up is just shit.    Please let me know your interpretation.   I asked a guy this exact question. He was standing in the street preaching. He opened his bible and showed me the first page and point at the first and second line of the first page. Obviously I asked him: Sorry, what do you mean?   His answer: You have to ready between the lines.   "World peace and no more misery on earth if we all clap our hands on  04/05/2015. Don't talk about it."  Then We will have America clap on 5th April and the rest of the world thought it was going to be 4th May and everybody will wonder if it would have worked if we just had the same way to write our fucking dates.   untrain_subject9884   not useless   not useless   Not useless   Not useless   Eat as much as I want and never get fat.    Because?  Edit: Also Aquaman is not a superpower.   Love! I find this really funny.   There are two kinds of people in this thread:  Those that opened this thread with the intention to write something funny/interesting and then gave up because they could not think of anything  Those that opened this thread with the intention to write something funny/interesting and did it.  I almost deleted this because it's boring as fuck but what I wrote above kept me from it. Don't want to be a quitter.   Hey, I talked to my dad yesterday. It looks like we will go with either squarespace or wordpress (probably wordpress). I really appreciate your help and explanations on this. This has been great. My dad is insisting that I find out more about how people will be able to find us on google.   He wants us to be able to add some key words somewhere. In his opinion that is what search engines look for. However I keep telling him that a search engine (as soon as they get hold of your website) "read your website" and will show it in their results if the content of your website matches the search entry. May I ask what you say to this?   Same here. Love that one.   They are. I just called them. I am just not 100% sure. My dad trusts me with the whole thing. They only thing he keeps mentioning is: "How can we make sure people will find us on google?"  Also, one last question. Will I have to pay extra for wordpress? Not a massive problem, just asking.   Again guys, thank you so much. I honestly appreciate you taking your time.    I feel like I am going to go with this of wordpress right now.    Thank you I had a look at it and like it. Can I just ask: How do I transport whatever I do on squarespace to my domain?   How about finding it on google afterwards?   Directly on wordpress, but that was just to get used to it. I actually just called the people from strato.de They said with what my dad bought, there is no wordpress available. They have their own wordpress type thing and I would need to change my package, which is possible without a problem.   However they said the SEO option we now have included would then not be available. I have no idea if that is BS.   I really would like to change to wordpress and not use their own tools because it stinks. Will it be difficult for people to find my website on google?  Sorry for these questions. It must be annoying as fuck...   Thank you very much for your reply.  Actually I have tried to do it via wordpress (and I have already set up something that is good enough from my point if view). However I do not know how to transport it to where I have rented the space. I (my dad) rented the space on strato.de because his friend recommended it. Also, will it show that it is a wordpress website at the bottom?   Ok. Cool. I have already rented the space. I will give this a go. So basically they write the html code based on my selections? Is my understanding correct?   I did not downvote you. I appreciate your offer. But I would like to try myself first. How long would you need?      I don't like that. Thank you for replying.    No he really did not.   Why?   I am simply curious. You see it pretty much every day. Bus driver closes his/her doors, drivers for half an inch, sombody knocks on the door and wants to get on, bus driver refuses (and then of course sometimes that person loses it, but anyway).   I do not actually have a problem with that because buses come every 2 minutes anyway where I live and I think the bus drivers get way too much shit for this. Clearly they are forced to do this. I was just wondering what the rules are the bus dirvers have to follow. Are they only allowed to open doors in the marked areas at bus stops? If so, why? What happens when they do open the door where there are not supposed to?     Did not think about that, but it makes sense to me.    That is the thing it is not heavy at all and it is really good to hold in one hand. It is much easier to hold than a flat tablet.   And honestly I do not think there is an problem with putting it between to books. It is still slimmer than a book and surely you can put a book between two books.    I own a Yoga 8 inch table and the hardware sucks and the UI also does. But I will never go for anything else because it is sooooo convenient. Stand work flawless, it is really comfortable to hold and the battery lasts very long. I can only recommend this tablet   No SD card slot is a deal breaker for any device. What the fuck?     First of all, I wasn't serious. But now that I think about it. For me the best game of all time is the game that I enjoyed most, so Call of Duty Black Ops is my all time favourite. There might be other games that I would have enjoyed more than this one, but out of the ones I have played this is the best.    Good fun playing 4 player zombies with my friends. Just good memories    Easy: Call of Duty Black Ops   Don't just have strong opinions about stuff. You MUST lead by example.    go on   Well, in [this](http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/) movie that is discussed in depth, but it's god, not Jesus.    Bread that has bacon baked into it with Nutella.   Best I ever had.    Answer: Immortality  However, and I have thought about this way too much, I would be so scared that my superpower would, for some magical reason, disappear, that I would never make use of it.   Anybody else have this problem?      It's difficult.    Haha, this is great. Made me smile. Thank you!   I really want to try   Same to you!   Garfield. The Halloween episode scare the shit out of me.    It's a technicality. For example: I am now going to put/not put your wallet on the table.   * In case I do it and we leave it there, it will be there forever.  * In case I do not put it there and neither does anybody else, it will never be there.   At any point in the future both things forever and never have the same duration.   Does that make sense?   Is this really a thing? Can I "dress up" as a homeless guy and get away with spitting into peoples mouths?  Edit: I feel like it should be dress down, not dress up...   No reception on your phone when going through a tunnel.   I hate people complaining about it. However, I hate not having reception in a tunnel even more.   This did not happen. I don't believe you.    I take the bus to work every day and every single day there is another person on the bus who is weird, strange or rude in some way. However I cannot remember anybody nice on the bus at all, ever.   So the answer is no. Not really. Unless I know people, I do not like anything they do.    Pasta, sweetcorn, onion, pesto.  Cook pasta fry onion (later add sweetcorn) in a wok add pasta after it's cooked add pesto add some salt and pepper if you like  VOIL!   Honestly, I have been looking for ages and by far the best looking shirts (IMO) are DKNY shirts. The good thing is moss.co.uk very often has them one sale. Sometimes I only pay 20 per shirt. They are simply amazing.   	120

Overwhelming.       What a great find! Much thanks.   From Wikipedia:  By 5 August the brigades of the Australian 2nd Division were exhausted and were to be relieved by the Australian 4th Division. While the relief was underway on the night of 56 August the Australians were subjected to an extreme bombardment, because the salient they occupied could be shelled by the Germans from all directions, including from Thiepval which lay to the rear. On the morning of 6 August a German counter-attack tried to approach the O.G. Lines but was met by machine gun fire and forced to dig in. The bombardment continued through the day, by the end of which most of the 2nd Division had been relieved. From its twelve days in the line, the division had suffered 6,848 casualties. At 4:00 a.m. on 7 August, shortly before dawn, the Germans launched their final counter-attack. On a front of 400 yards (370 m) they overran the thinly occupied O.G. Lines, catching most of the Australians in shelters in the old German dugouts and advanced towards Pozires. For the Australians, the crisis had arrived. At this moment, Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, emerged from a dugout where he and seven men of his platoon had been isolated, and charged the German line from the rear. His example inspired other Australians scattered across the plateau to join the action and a fierce, hand-to-hand fight developed. Jacka was badly wounded but as support arrived from the flanks, the Australians gained the advantage and most of the surviving Germans were captured. No more attempts to retake Pozires were made.

Dad would never talk about the war. All he would ever say was "I did my duty". My Uncle told me about D-day. After my Dad died I found an Air Medal (with three Oak Leaves), but I have never been able to find out what he did. He never flew after the war, but worked for Lockheed for the rest of working life. Again, he was close-mouthed about work, but he was usually at a Lockheed facility in Palmdale.  There were boxes of photos from the war in the attic. Quite a few pics of paratroops loading up, long lines of C-47s.  He met my Mom in Orleans in 1944. Buts her's is another story.   It nauseates me to look at this.       Si.

There were no casualties from the 1984 eruption because more than 73,000 people evacuated the danger zones as recommended by scientists of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

 Subbing.  I grew up in the [Christopher Erb house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Erb_House) in Maryland. Let me know if you want a post about it.  200yr old stone German immigrant house. Basement is center wall, the two stories and attic above are center hallway. Our floors are so crooked. There is a sister house and my personal theory is that the Erbs started to make a split floorplan but saw [Hampton Mansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_National_Historic_Site) after finishing the basement and decided to change the plan.  Not until I happened upon a book about the similarities between the [Zwaanendael Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwaanendael_Museum) and the building it (in part) replicates did I know about jointery markings.

Not to say "I disagree," but to ask if you have considered the information I will share. It suggests that the perceived climate change event was actually man-made through a lack of understanding.  There are other authors who have stated this, but David R. Montgomery is the one which seems most accessible. His book [Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) is just long enough to remark on many different instances of the phonomenon of erosion caused by agriculture dooming a population. He summarizes the book and shows some data which was left out for audience tailoring in [this lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)  The floods, famines, and desertification of much of the meditarranean and middle east can be attributed to the cutting down of trees and plowing of loose soils until gone. Ur was a port city and now lies a hundred miles inland. The mountains of the levant used to be lush but are now dusty crags.  It does not seem that cyclical events caused the agricultural failure. [Milankovich cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) and [DansgaardOeschger events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event) could be, but I have not seen anyone claim it.  So the peoples of the Bronze Age ruined their land. This caused floods when there was no more soil and wooded plains to soak up the rain; famines when soil died under the knife of the plow; and a lack of strategic resources when wood was burned for fuel. This followed a population increase dependant on the use of deforested land. Once that land was desertified and decreased in yeild, scarcity strained the social structure.

That is a reason to make the law, but it isn't necessarily a need when the fines can be upheld in courts no problem and people are just as likely to not fight it.

Hopefully he'll survive... I mean 100KRONER   That also holds for the cost of capture and trial, right?  I think in normal session law the boundaries would be set for the various things which go into each. The salaries, facilities, and processes will all have to be fleshed out in various ways and then codified.   I thought initial citizenship would be a necessary addition to the constitution, as well. But right now the nation is under the temporary leadership of a separate body. Initial membership would be handled by them and standard citizenship and naturalization would be handled in normal laws.   I think you are referring more to fines. I am talking about the administrative cost to perform whatever punishment is deemed necessary: the wages for the clerk who files the fine and the equipment for that.  How much could it be, right? But it is there, in the constitution, so it has to be fixed.   If he is labelled as inherently threatening, that could be the immediate conclusion.  The extreme example brings to mind a lone hero riding to the gates of the walled city of Liberland... half dead on his horse. He comes bearing important news but is turned away or shot with an arrow...  In real life, if you want to come back just ask to speak to a diplomat.

No Citizen shall be deprived of the citizenship under any circumstances, nor shall he or she be extradited to another jurisdiction against his or her will.

Convicted criminals shall not have their liberty restricted except so far as is necessary for the protection of others, nor their property seized except so far as it is necessary to make restitution to the victim and/or to pay the costs of the criminal's capture and trial.  The last line might need to include the cost of punishment.   I feel like they will tackle WWI before 40k   So you can afford more for yourself, right?

So are you going to take your cheap internet points and run or go look at the vibrant communities of professionals and enthusiasts who spend hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours learning about swords and their use?   "Modern swords" can mean a few things. You probably either mean swords of modern design (fantasy blades and such) or swords of ancient design made with modern technology (reproductions). It actually makes no difference because there is a reason swords ended up with the weights they did in the time they were used - that was the balance of power and agility desired. Even as carbon content increased with more steel (bringing on rapiers and the like), the weight stayed within a consistent range.  Most swords are about three pounds.  Does that sound "heavy" to you? That is less than half the weight of a gallon of milk. A sword cannot be too heavy because of the nature of the balance. Your hand is the fulcrum of a lever and on one end is more weight that the other.   Kenneth Branaugh is another one, for me.   "Swords are heavy" is a misconception.

The spectrum is not relative. This is because morals are not relative.   You're right, but people trying to get away from mainstream news have been exposed to backlash against the Laffer Curve theory and don't support it anymore - correctly. However, not all in this category know the difference.  There has also been plenty of doublespeak from the right on this. Talking heads trying to have it both ways.   I can only imagine them looking like Anakin's home on [Tatooine.](http://www.hoylen.com/photos/2007-tn2-medenine/p07.jpg)   Also that plane in the sky if I recall. Alex Roman is worth keeping track of. I've fallen asleep to the music in this more times than I can remember - and he did that himself, as well.   Copper.   It makes sense for libertarian scientists to run, because they wouldn't have to debate or decide what to regulate, how... they'd just deregulate.    I felt like it never even occurred to the author that I might be consciously making a choice.  People do make choices, but those choices are affected by the political structure in which they live, including coordination with businesses at various levels.  Another given in Strongtowns articles is that the sprawl occurred during a wasteful period and that tax revenue from suburbs rarely are enough to support the infrastructure. Just as local governments spent money poorly, so too have many American families - it can be hard on families to justify living in the suburbs when they would much rather exchange the nature and freedom with ease of access to jobs on cheap mass transit and high proximity to wants and needs. The problem comes from the market having been twisted away from dense construction of a quality which enables this. People complain about schools and crime, and the construction in cities recently is either for colleges, singles, or well-off families.  So why is that? American families *want* suburbia but many cannot afford it and would do well to move in. They can't because their house won't sell; they won't because they don't think it is a choice which will make them happy, safe, or prosperous; they can't because builders see basically no demand. Meanwhile, the tax receipts on sprawled areas are putting American towns in debt.  It can come off as insulting. I'm not going to lie. Strongtowns is facing this problem where people disagree because they think the writers disapprove of their choices. We just wish you had more choices, but known the *real cost* instead of having political involvement muddy that.  I, personally, drive 20-30 minutes to work. I live on the edge of a major city and can walk to grocery, gym, park, and church. Also, school, if we had kids.   I think the focus would be more beneficial on the aversion, reluctance, and inability to live more densely.   All these are being "ruined" by online communities of supporters.

That factors in the hysterics which a free and clear business environment would shrug off and take the (actually small, as stated) risk.   ditto   I heard all of Belgium was a myth.

There was an article about a successful one recently I may have posted it or x-posted it.  edit: k, I did not. Should be in this sub, but you may have to go back a few months!   Pardon your French!   Why did people ever start thinking Bacon was bad for you?  Oh, yeah. Puritanism.   Private ownership of cities in the various possible ways makes Lenore less likely to win for those landlubbers who remain on terra firma. But COLA is refreshing.   It used to occur on our Vista computer after moderate lengths of use. Maybe 30 or 40 minutes into play it wold do this. We would save, restart the game, and continue.   OK. But we were talking about how he has a cross around his neck.   Don't worry, the repost will do fine.   Ah. I would count social conditioning as the opposite of something being thought about, but morals do appear in both cases of pressure and engineering.  So when I said reflection it meant an image, not a philosophical viewpoint (but it could have meant both). That was a little lazy of me.    We are made to be very very good to out fellow man, but only the good we think about.   *or are forced to contend with due to social pressure*, as you point out.   And then, only to people we define as fellow man.  And boy, that is the mother of all "nurture" scenarios.  What made Mal such a great character, and what makes everyone pine for the unexplored depth of the characters and universe, is that mix of social pressure and constructed morals. I think we felt like those people on the tiny space boat showed us more about ourselves than we wanted to know, but in a slightly-detached way which made it easy to enjoy, rather than suffer through.   I do not agree morality is "intrinsic" but do agree it isn't proprietary of any religion, rather it is a reflection on our humanity and the limits of our nature.   I think that even if he loses his faith, he doesn't lose the morality and attention to conscience very central to Christianity.   And Rand has proposed cutting all corporate welfare before cutting anything else!   Do you know who the Kurds are?   Ah, the days of darkroastedblend...   I tried spending time to learn about MMT, once. Gave me cancer that crap was so toxic.   I wonder if his newcomer status meant he had less to lose by confronting Hilary, which more seasoned candidates wouldn't have been able to handle it without backlash on their own rough patches.  This might have been helped by the cover of being black. Hemight not have survived any such moves without that support, but I'm not sure enough to make a call on that.   His wife would open the doors even wider to big bankers. You wouldn't think they could get wider, but maybe they will tear down a wall to move Goldman Sachs into the living room.   Do you know how hard it is to find a good man? A *good* human being. Hearts of gold and good intentions with reliable principles and a conscience you could eat off of? Not many would pass the muster of a serum transformation.  Why would the government make an army of people they can't control who won't follow rules?   And that bad chick from Iron Man three was his girlfriend (by name) if I recall.   Well it is between how stupid she is and how willing to flip-flop to get the young vote she is.  I think she really cared about that issue.  It will almost definitely come down to *what* young vote she'll try and get... probably the Tumblr one. She is all about social justice and not realyl about connecting with anyone male that isn't in a union. So she'll probably try and institute some kind of mature game registration or a new rating for inclusiveness or something. She won't ban them, just put layers of control on them.  That is, if the legislature returns to the Dems. I need to look up on that chance for 2016, but anything is possible two or four years after that.   It depends what your priorities are. A lot of people are pretty enthused on the Republican side. A blaze article on Hillary's announcement mentioned Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb as possible Democrat contenders. Lincoln will need a new haircut, at the very least. Jim Webb is hoping he'll be able to quickly move past all the scandals already in his past (substantial or not).   Well that isn't personally tragic.   If by that you mean qualified at completely screwing whatever pooch she's tied to and getting away with it, then ok.               via /u/MachReverb                    	139

 In my line of work? I work as a technology consultant in the wine and spirits industry, often with executives and business managers. Unfortunately no wild stories there.   If you're talking about me being a Priest, I don't openly declare this so no I don't get that there either.   I can only speak for myself, but I paid the $200 because I spent time with a number of Church of Satan members and agreed with what they were doing in the real world and would like to see this kind of work supported on a broader scale.  For the same reason I donate to NPR, I enjoy their work and would like to see it continue. If $200 is an issue or you don't care about what the Church of Satan does (promotes the work of Satanists and upholds the philosophy of LaVey) then don't join. Joining the Church of Satan doesn't make you more of a Satanist.

No, we pay all taxes and believe all religious organizations should do the same.   Green.   The only member of the Temple of Set I know left the organization after a short period of time. We would probably not get along as they seem seriously devoted to "the occult" and I have no interest in that.   We are own Gods in our own subjective lives.   Long lasting memories with great friends.   I agreed with much of what he talked about in the 90's and he was an influence on me in my younger years. I've hung out with him a few times and realized that we no longer have much in common. He's no longer interested in Satanism at all and describes himself as a mystical Christian.    In literature I personally enjoy Milton's Satan. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost#Satan    Also see the Lucifer DC comic   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_(DC_Comics)  I personally recently enjoyed Laird Cregar's portrayal of His Excellency in Heaven Can Wait.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1HRd8pQn7c    Here's a list of films with various Satanic themes:  http://churchofsatan.com/sources-film-list.php   Satanism is a religion.   Godzilla is an excellent symbol for nature exacting revenge upon the humans who took our world for granted and destroy it through pollution, nuclear waste, etc. Satan represents being in balance with nature. Get the connection?   1. One can have a religion without believe in supernatural beings. Satanists are not the first do this. See Jainism. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheistic_religions#Jainism    2. We apply the role of the adversary to real world issues and topics.   Hope you can find something interesting here http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/       http://www.reddit.com/user/train_subject9915/comments/   LaVey wrote a whole book about this in The Satanic Witch. The biggest thing to take away from it is that there are certain archetypes that generally go well together and this described as the Synthesizer Clock.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Witch    One of the most important concepts LaVey introduced in The Satanic Witch was the LaVey Synthesizer Clock, an improved form of somatotyping incorporating a fourth basic type to the three already in common use (by addition of the "pure feminine" type, opposite to the "pure masculine" or mesomorphic type). The LaVey Synthesizer Clock postulates that all persons occupy a set body and personality type, placed along varying degrees of the four types proposed ("clock position"), and that ideal friends and lovers will represent the opposite personality/body type by position on the LaVey Synthesizer Clock.   http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php      "We do not hold, as do the Objectivists that the universe is benevolent. Satanists view the world as neutral, beyond the concepts of benevolent or treacherous, good or evil. Satanism enables the Satanist to codify his life beyond the ethical and metaphysical straightjacket which Objectivism unfortunately offers."   We don't get paid, as there is no job for us to do. Whatever we do in public is our own choice. The CoS is not a charity, but I do not know about their financials other than they pay taxes. What this implies I can't say because I don't know, nor do I care. I think they deserve profit for the time and efforts spent.   Thanks!

They have a stronger political/social agenda that I don't agree with.   Answered already, see here    http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/   It seems pretty clear to me that it isn't mandatory."If you have employed it..." is a pretty big *if*.    Don't put up with assholes in your home. Demand that they leave and if they refuse to leave, make them want to.  There are ways of "destroying" a person that doesn't resort to violence. A destroyed ego can last longer than a bruise.   I have read it and agree with much of it, though not all of it. LaVey actually passed copies of Might is Right to early Church of Satan members and only acknowledged that he was influenced by it and used it as source of his texts. I have the copy of it that he wrote the foreword to.   Jesu, ISIS, Sunn O))), Boris, Altar of Plagues.   The same way humans exist without God.   You seem to imply that in order to be a Satanist you have to openly flaunt it, and cause that strife. That's not the case.     "do what that thou wilt"  I have never used that term to represent my ideas. I think you mistake Satanism for Crowley's Thelema.     1. My Satan is the sovereign individual, the Anarch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarch_(sovereign_individual)). I've used this archetype in my music and writing. See Milton's Satan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost#Satan   I don't reveal my worldview to uninformed christians, so usually nothing. See this thread otherwise.   Look through here. My responses are getting buried.    http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/     http://www.reddit.com/user/train_subject9915/   What's driving you to change that part of your personality? Think about it.   I just had a hamburger on french bread for dinner, so both?   The 8th grade was a great time! Easy homework, hanging out with my friends all day, chasing girls around, and collecting comic books. Hope you had as much fun as I did!   Satan always have the best record collection.   Because we recognize that at times you can accomplish more with a group of like-minded individuals than by yourself. Being individualistic does not mean you're a loner. Not that there's anything wrong with being a loner if that's what you think works best for you. One can be a Satanist without being a member of the Church of Satan.   I've never met a Satanic Priest/Reverend who bought their priesthood and never paid for mine. I've donated more to various podcasts than I have paid for my membership to the Church of Satan.   I have never heard of Mike Warnke until today. I don't think he's had any effect at all.   I've never encountered any organized philosophy called Luciferianism.   I've actually had a more combative experience on /r/atheism than here.   I can't speak for her, but I've spent time in their home and I can see that she takes a great deal of pride in promoting and working with other productive members. I'm sure there's a level of frustration having to deal with idiots who miss the point.   Delayed gratification is an investment. The very act of going through the effort brings pleasure and satisfaction.   A devil worshiper, and at our events they are called unwelcomed.   Not exactly, but we have a number of members in a wide range of bands.    Metal   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXuaB_SWe-o      Folk/Americana https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDw6k0OllI     Blues    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvMLoQY1EQE     Glam rock    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKXbr2C_Yx8  Classical    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu5rhOzDCKo list=PLA18A06B4C6E3BFEB    http://www.reddit.com/user/train_subject9915/   http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/     And the reason why    http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cftgv9c   If by successfully you mean it alleviated a problem I was facing in my life, then yes. Was it purely psychological? I believe so, but I believe that doing the ritual helped overcome the issue to the point that I give it credit.   30.    I don't, but I'm open to the experience. I spent some time in Gettysburg and there was certainly a chilling element to the atmosphere there, but that could have been just the excitement of being in such an important historical town.   I doubt it, but here's one recent Satanic service https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDVyCY6KFqA   Not specifically. Because Satanism is individualistic we have a wide range of political applications of the Satanic philosophy. I'm more of a Libertarian, borderline Anarcho-Capitalist, but one of my Satanist associates is a borderline socialist, he was one of the people that introduced me to Peter Gilmore!    But broadly the Church of Satan does have a couple of political aims which include a secular government and taxation of churches:  http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php     I'm doing pretty well, thanks!   The "taboo" organization has never hindered me in any way and helped me connect with productive people who've improved my live professionally, and personally.    I have never "served" the organization. The Church of Satan has promoted my own events, my own art and writing, and in the process I've made some trustworthy friends. When I mentioned doing this AMA, the High Priestess actually said only to do it if I want to and reminded me that I have no obligation, it was never brought up by them.   It would be a celebration of carnal love, our shared individual goals, and a more fulfilling life.    I prefer Epicureanism over Hedonism. Hedonism is compulsive, we prefer *rational* self-interest.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism   Devil worshippers are usually just deranged Christians, so I just call them Christians.   A Satanist can easily see the benefits of workings towards a better society and thus improving their own lives or the lives of their family.   There's such a thing as counter productive pride.   Being with my wife makes me happy, we have shared goals and interests and motivate each other. She's a fun, positive person who I look forward to spending time with everyday.    1. I don't, but I understand some Satanists do. There used to be a store in NYC called the Magickal Childe where Satanists and other pagans exchanged ideas and debated topics.    2. I can only speak for myself but I'd say 9/10 of the Satanists I've met are purely psychological.   3. I think it's a waste of time and does not represent me and my philosophy. We don't want any religious monuments on government grounds. See Peter Gilmore on the topic here http://churchofsatan.com/lets-you-and-him-fight.php   I already answered it here http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/     Damn it! I knew I should have quit!   I agree, sounds like your friend is a douche.   I'm apparently answering more questions than most celebrities! Thank Satan for hotel internet! http://www.reddit.com/user/train_subject9915/  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cftgv9c   I prefer the cold, easier to warm up than to cool down!   Here's Peter Gilmore on Point of Inquiry talking about the subject. DJ Grothe has a bit of the diabolical in him.    http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/   Seems to be working out for them!   Answered, see http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/   That sounds about right.   Satanism is atheism with a set of symbols and worldviews that go beyond just not believing in God.     Oculus Whoops! Yes yes, Oculus Rift is what I meant ;)    I record music and do some writing based on the idea of the adversary, the accuser, the sovereign Anarch http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarch_(sovereign_individual)  https://soundcloud.com/anarchaudio   Well that wasn't part of our ceremony, but I get it. Would they approve of me if they knew I'm a Satanist? Maybe not. But since then I know a few of her family members got wind of what I'm into and they're still very happy with our relationship, even come to me for help and advice.   I actually got a bunch of fun questions over PM and even ran into an old friend.   Bride! My fault for answering questions while getting a coffee!   I know a couple of Satanist in Europe who met at an orgy in Italy! Not an official Church of Satan event though!   http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cftgv9c   We don't.   Just about everyone on the bride side of the family. Edit: Marital dyslexia!      Correct.   I've yet to be put in that situation, but I know others who used the legal system to destroy the lives of people who did them harm.   1. I would think of it as more of a talent. Much like an athletic ability. We do not know how this is harnessed, if at all. Nothing supernatural, nothing spiritual.   2. Because there's emotional charge in these symbols. I know some Satanists who never use the symbols of Judeo-Christiianity, instead they use norse gods. That drives them, inspires them.   It means having a look! Good, bad, attractive, unattractive, whatever serves the purpose. Some people prefer dark and sinister, others personal cleanshaven and professional. If you're an elderly person, maybe take up the look of the wise sage.    Since I don't have any faith in external supernatural forces I haven't had such an experience.    My mating signal is sitting next to a cute girl and buying her a drink. If she cracks a smile, then I'll go from there. If she turns away, I move on. Some like hard to get, others don't.    I don't respond to crazy people.   This reddit thread? Hah. Otherwise, I haven't personally experienced that, no. Everyone I've ever told my beliefs to got to know me as a person first and I never had an issue.   Never watched it, but the X-Men Animated Series holds a special place in my heart.   If it seems pointless to you, then that's fine. I would compare it to secular Judaism. There's are important roles that religion fills in a culture and in your psychology. For other people it's sports, movies, comics, video games, that is their religion. They setup rituals (annual Comic-Con trips), symbols (t-shirts, hats, toys), and it inspires them to accomplish other things in their lives.   http://churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php   Stupidity   Pretentiousness   Solipsism   Self-deceit   Herd Conformity   Lack of Perspective   Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies   Counterproductive Pride   Lack of Aesthetics     Sounds like a good idea, maybe someone will do that!   The symbol of Satan serves various creative purposes, and stimulates me. Most religious folk get along just fine with me, and vice versa.    As you grow up you learn that there are better ways of getting what you need than by crying out loud and shitting your pants. If you have no empathy for others you're likely to lead a lonely, miserable life. I love my family and my friends, and a quick phone call away from them if they need help, because I know I could do the same. Is that shitty? Seems to work for me, with Satanists and non-Satanists.    They technically have the right to exist, but they cross the line when they make attempts to interrupt the private lives of others. My wish would be for the government to tax them out of existence.    1. I have not, I've heard some that went to anti-WBC protests.   2. Already answered. No higher powers. See this http://churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-statements.php    http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php   3. Woolite Black!   One a personal level my goal is to have a happy and productive live. As an organization, these are the goals of the Church of Satan: http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php     1. Stratification   2. Strict taxation of all churches   3. No tolerance for religious beliefs secularized and incorporated into law and order issues   4. Development and production of artificial human companions   5. The opportunity for anyone to live within a total environment of his or her choice       A wedding is an important milestone in one's life and we wanted to incorporate our aesthetics and philosophy with it. We modified it because we have good relationships with our families and those of our friends who were attending who know about Satanism got the idea without it being so overt.   I have no idea, but you're a fan of blues I recommend checking out Down to the Crossroads! http://9sensepodcast.com/down-to-the-crossroads.php   "The name and idea of Jesus/Mohammad has been synonymous with destruction, death, torture, and total depravity for the past 2000 years."   That would pretty sweet, actually.   I'm a big fan of Wolves in the Throne Room, saw them live with Chelsea Wolfe a few months ago and I own all their records! Just because something is not directly "Satanic" doesn't mean I can't enjoy it for my own reasons.   http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/good-guy-lucifer   That's a close approximation, sure.    People tell me I'm the nicest person they've ever met. That's probably because if they're assholes to me I'd cut them out of my life.   It comes from the organization, the Church of Satan. It's a fully functioning, internationally recognized, registered organization. The High Priest and High Priestess review applications for membership, communicate with active members, and decide who best represents the religion in the real world, outside of the organization. What you decide to do with that recognition is up to you.   That's it.   Pretty much.   Let's try this again, at the top. My comments below are getting buried. The whole thing about destroying your enemy if they bother you in public, that's probably challenging, but not because I disagree with it. I have to weight my response with the possible outcomes of my response, and at times this means walking away to resolve in a different way.    Well, that doesn't mean you've changed who you are at the core. If your experiences prove you wrong and you need to adjust your outlook, then that's a good thing. That hasn't happened to me, in fact much of my experiences confirm who I am and how I live my life.   I believe in the power of symbols and archetypes. I believe in living your life without guilt but also acknowledging my own limitations and flaws. I believe that man's most natural, instinctual state is best represented in the symbol of Satan. I believe there is no afterlife, there is no heaven or hell, and that this is the only life we have. This is the opposite of spiritual religions, who believe this life is in preparation for an afterlife, and thus take the name of the accuser, the opposer.     I was actually looking forward to this question. I do not have a cable TV subscription, but I watch shows on Netflix. I'm currently catching up on Walking Dead, I loved Breaking Bad, and look forward to getting True Detective on blu-ray.    I believe in the power of symbols and archetypes.

It's really not that hard to have a moral high ground on the Catholic Church these days, so I don't have any feelings about that.    They know and they're supportive. I'm lucky in this regard.   Not me, but I know others who've had their properties vandalized.    A wink and good jokes. Never failed.   Am I using Satanism for shock value? I don't think I've ever shocked anyone with my Satanism. I think conservative christians are more shocking in today's society. The themes are fun and meant to drive your imagination and serve personal stimulation. I don't go around saying HELLO MY NAME IS RAUL, CITIZEN OF THE INFERNAL EMPIRE!  	126

Edit: [The cat pics](http://imgur.com/a/uGCNT)         "Salvation through" Jesus Christ, living Jesus Christ, the second coming, grace, heaven and hell, rapture and other such things. If you do not take these things literally, what do they mean for you?  I mean, God may or may not exist, but these things sound just wholly unbelievable.                     I want them to stay, they are so [BUY SOME APPLES] adorable.                     When I press F2 to show the information about selected star system and there are planets with green text, does that mean they are in Goldilock's zone and therefore have better chance of accomodating life? I noticed some correlation between green text and life, but I am just guessing.   I have never been particularly good at multiplayer shooter games (and I don't play them often, so I am not very skilled), usually I was in the bottom half of the scoreboard, but I always enjoyed myself. The thing is, it feels a bit embarrasing being told by games how bad I am, which for me leads to frustration (rather than motivation to be better, because I know I will never be a top-scoring player anyway) and loss of interest in the game for me after some time.  What are your feelings about it and about low-scoring players? BTW I am not looking for comfort, so please speak your honest opinion.            I took a contract to explore Tylo, but when I landed I discovered I forgot to add an antenna and can't even make low orbit, so Jeb is stuck there. I tried to send a rescue mission, but it was an utter failure and crashed there.  Do I need to make the rocket bigger to have enough dV to land and come back? Any tips?                           I was picking up a gift at a store and noticed they had a porn website open at a free internet kiosk, so I noticed them, lest they get into problems.                                                I have known about CloudToButt extension for a while, but it did not occur to me until now to look for a customizable text replacing addon. So I discovered [FoxReplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/foxreplace/) and already set some things to be replaced for my amusement while browsing the internet, I'd like some suggestions what to add next, or even complete lists.

Edit: Lol, it was actually three landings                     If something goes wrong and the lander bounces off despite the engine pushing it "down", will its mission be considered entirely unsuccesful? Do they have one shiot only or can they try to push it down again after bouncing off?                     He grew up in a butcher's family and he thinks oatmeal inferior. We keep making fun of him because of that.   #rekt                     I don't give a damn.                        I installed WD Black 1GB yesterday, but neither Windows nor Disk Management can see it. I plugged SATA data cable into the motherboard and I am powering it through [SATA-Molex adapter](https://i4.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=f3 cd=MK297a i=1.jpg) plugged into a cable that was until now powering only 2 fans. I checked the cables and they seem to be plugged well.  Edit:I forgot to add Troubleshooting tag, sorry.  EDIT2: Issue solved, thanks for help.                  By means of natural selection, not invoking higher power.                     It is on sale now, but I really don't have any money left, and it has been made available on Linux now. I'd be grateful if someone were so kind and gifted me (of course I'd pay it forward). :-)  [My Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)  The base game would be enough.  EDIT: I just got it from one of my friends.         By idle I mean when they sit somewhere and stare at things. Do they asses dangers and look on their environment for changes or what?   If you put a small engine on the bottom of a rocket/tank with larger diameter than  that of said engine, then when you attach something to the engine from below it creates fairings, but those have only the engine's diameter.  It can be secured with struts, for sure, but it looks ugly as hell, and having to meddle with Procedural Fairing's interstage fairings is a bother.  Is there any mod which makes it right?               blood everywhere  **Update:** She seems OK now, the vet gave us antibiotics for her (he said that there is still something in her uterus, though).  The strangest thing is that she still is just a 4-month-old kitten.         http://imgur.com/a/ee9lr  When I feel like it, I could eventually take some photos of the inside.  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________  **Case:** Cooler Master N400  http://www.alza.cz/EN/cooler-master-n400-d452922.htm  **PSU:** Corsair CX430M  http://www.alza.cz/EN/corsair-cx430m-d380166.htm  **GPU:**  AMD Radeon R7 265  http://www.alza.cz/EN/msi-r7-265-2gd5-oc-d604999.htm  **CPU:** Intel Core i5-4590  http://www.alza.cz/EN/intel-core-i5-4590-d1481074.htm  **Mobo:** ASROCK H87M  http://www.alza.cz/EN/asrock-h87m-d2141449.htm  **RAM:** Kingston 8GB KIT DDR3 1600MHz CL10 HyperX Fury Series  http://www.alza.cz/EN/kingston-8gb-kit-ddr3-1600mhz-cl10-hyperx-fury-series-d1147673.htm  **SSD:** Samsung 840 Series EVO 120GB  http://www.alza.cz/EN/samsung-840-series-evo-desktop-120-gigabytes-7-mm-d459298.htm  **Screen:** 24" Acer K242HLbd (Full HD)  http://www.alza.cz/EN/24-acer-k242hlbd-d528912.htm  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Total price: 983$      Please, please, never sell out to Microsoft.         I have 64-bit Ubuntu and tried to apply this patch, but it does nothing for solving the mk1podCockpit/model problem for me. :(   After X hours of building I am exhausted, so I am going to make it simple:  I have to plug the GPU and 2 fans (front and rear) into the PSU.  GPU has connector, which is split in two, each of them looks like this   I o x x x I  Both fans also have dual connectors, but they are each different:   I x x x x I   I o o o o I  "x"s represent pins, "o"s are holes  The PSU is modular, and I have one cable which corresponds to GPU's and fans' connectors.    From PSU end, it goes like this:   I o o o o I   I o o o o I   ----------------------------   I o o o o I   ----------------------------   I o o o o I   ----------------------------   I o o o o I   ----------------------------   IooooI    (a small header connector)  How should I plug it all to the PSU? It doesn't seem doable.         I bought some new hardware and got a Radeon Silver Reward code. Since I am not in need of any new games at the moment, I decided to give it away here. You can get 2 games this way.  For my amusement, draw a squird (squirrel+bird) drinking Bailey's out of a shoe, the best/most humorous drawing wins the code (I'll PM it to the winner).  EDIT: It is over, /u/saad93 is the winner.   I am about to order all components for my first build and I was skimming through my picked parts when I noticed that PSU was 430 V and recommended voltage for GPU was 500 V.  So I searched for a bit and found a similar question here on BaPC where was said that recommended GPU voltages are for the whole system.  I also used a PSU calculator and it showed me that even less voltage is needed (400 V), so that confused me even more.  How do I make sense of it?  Link for picked parts:  http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2efx5f/build_ready_is_this_good/  If it turns out to be OK, this post might be regarded as Build Ready I guess.   I have decided on my first build, but today I remembered that people recommend to install OS on a SSD. The problem is that I do not have enough money at the moment to buy both at once, so I am torn if I should get a SSD first and add HDD later, or go for some SSHD.  I have to decide quick, since I am going to buy all components tommorrow, so if you could recommend me some drive, it would be great.

 Hell...the Civil War wasn't over till 1865 so it is hard to make that accusation before that time.     For starters, I think there are some mental health problems associated with the gay condition. Not that being gay is a mental health problem, but that gays tend to have mental health problems.  No they don't.  At least they do not have mental health problems out of proportion to any other group.  Put another way homosexual people can experience the myriad of psychological disorders the same as any other group but no more and no less.  It is possible things like depression are induced because being oppressed is not fun and would make anyone depressed.  The American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973.  Further changes were made in the 80's and there is no longer any diagnosis professionally recognized as a disorder because someone is a homosexual.  "Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects." *(Kinsey, et al. 1948 Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), p. 639)*.    The movie Darkstar. A seriously bad (but in a great way) movie from 1974 (I think). John Carpenter directed it.     Pinback: All right, bomb. Prepare to receive new orders.  Bomb#20: You are false data.  Pinback: Hmmm?  Bomb #20: Therefore I shall ignore you.  Pinback: Hello... bomb?  Bomb #20: False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore, I shall refuse to perceive.  Pinback: Hey, bomb?  Bomb #20: The only thing that exists is myself.  Pinback: Snap out of it, bomb.     The two major things to avoid with a nuclear reactor are a runaway reaction and a meltdown of the core.  I thought a runaway reaction is a meltdown (as the reaction gets out of control the core heats up and the whole thing melts)?    Yeah...it talks a little about it in the article:  The BBC understands that Google does not search Gmail accounts for other forms of illegal activity, such as pirated content or hate speech.    The part where you cannot deny a woman's right to an abortion.  Granted that is a "right" that was read into the constitution under the "penumbras and emanations" which deemed a right to privacy to exist in the constitution despite it not being explicitly mentioned.  From this right the SCOTUS ruled that a woman cannot be restricted from obtaining an abortion by the state.  You can of course argue that the SCOTUS reasoning in Roe v. Wade is wrong but it remains the law of the land (well...Casey has supplanted Roe and weakened it but a woman still has a right to an abortion).  If the state passes a law that regulates clinics saying, "All doctors must have X" then makes it impossible to get "X" then the state is impermissibly trodding on woman's rights here.     You really don't need to read the email's content to filter spam.  I am almost religious about marking spam as spam in my email client and blocking senders of spam in my client and I still get a lot getting through and a lot shunted to my spam folder.  Spammers are well aware of the easy things you can do to block them and are waaay ahead of you on that.    This was Google deciding someone is guilty and they should hand him over to the police.  No.  This is Google suspecting a crime may have been committed and handing the evidence over to the police.  The police then decide if there is enough to go on and, if so, arrest the man.  A court will decide if he is guilty or not.  And as noted in the story **all** US companies are legally required to report suspected child abuse.  So, if Google is scanning the emails and is able to discern a suspected child abuser they have no choice but to make the authorities aware of it.   Looks great.  I am using now instead of my old one.  The only request that I'd have for the app is if the time till the next train/bus arriving at a stop was displayed on the "Favorite Routes" page.  Not sure if you can squeeze that in or not but would be nice to see at a glance.     I'd like an app that tries to emulate the "should I walk/transfer here or here" i do based off of looking at where my present stuff is and what would be where I ended up going, and sometimes the congestion of the trains ahead or traffic in case of bus.  I think Google Maps will route the ideal route for the time and conditions including transfers using mass transit.    You can never really get 100% of the money going to the cause.  Someone needs to pay for the lights and the office space and the receptionist and the postage and whatnot.  Most good charities will be able to tell you what percentage of each dollar goes to the cause the charity is supporting. 25% for overhead is pretty good (75% to the cause).          I've always looked at someone laying hands on you as a green light to respond.  I assume you mean "respond" in this case to mean "retaliate".  I can come up with dozens of variants of "laying hands on you" off the top of my head of "laying hands on you" that would suggest retaliation goes too far.  I think you need to be more explicit.     Kaiser Wilhelm II was a moron.  In a world where things make sense he *might* have managed a government spot as the city dog catcher.  Put the likes of Bismarck back in control of things and it'd be a different matter.     They would NOT cover this.  This device would not necessarily prevent conception from occurring.  Hobby Lobby would consider the resultant failed pregnancy an abortion and hence would oppose it.  Basically it is The Pill (which Hobby Lobby obviously opposes) in a time release electronically controlled dispenser.     The US Constitution says the president may be impeached for "high crimes and misdemeanors".  Thing is there is no definition of what that is exactly.  As a result congress can impeach and convict a president for pretty much any reason at all.  There is no appeals process to it.  If congress throws the president out because they do not like his tie they can do so and there is nothing to stop them except for public opinion.  While that may seem terribly broken and not fair people need to remember that despite the legal language surrounding it impeachment is a purely political endeavor.  Basically, as representatives of the people, Congress is firing the president from his job...that's all it amounts to in the end.  That said there is no way they will get president Obama out of office this way.  They may succeed in impeaching him (like Clinton was) but they will never get a conviction from the Senate and they know it.  This is nothing more than political grandstanding on the republicans' part.  EDIT to add:  Thinking on it more the republicans are probably laying the groundwork and hoping to take the senate in November in which case they could proceed with impeachment and expect to succeed.     One of the panel mentioned how the woman is the victim.  Seems to me if you initiate a physical assault on someone you are no longer a victim.  That said there is proportion in all things.  If the woman slaps you and your ego is more injured than your face that does not grant you permission to punch her lights out.    While I cannot speak for the individuals on that panel (I do not know who they are) they are speaking at a Heritage Foundation event which make them among the war monger faction.  The Heritage Foundation was a big supporter of the invasion of Iraq.  The woman speaking decries the millions killed despite most people being peace loving which seems to imply it is worthless to be peace loving.   Seems to me her rant is a cautionary tale about keeping an eye on people exactly like her who would lead you to war over the most meager of provocations.  Four dead in Benghazi?  Sad and tragic to be sure but does it merit that whole panel?  Four people (or more) are shot per day (NOT every day) in Chicago with some regularity.  How about they convene a panel to solve that problem?  Oh yeah...there is no money in that.    It really depends on the breed.  Many lap dogs have a variety of issues but the working breeds are often in great shape (they have to be) and they excel at particular tasks.  The trick is to find a reputable breeder.  In the US there are far too many puppy mills which do not give a shit about the quality of the animals they produce.  In some cases this can ruin an entire breed (this happened to the German Shepherd Dog which now has serious health problems in the US...the armed forces and police go to East Europe to get their dogs instead of buying from the US).  If responsibly bred with a care to the gene lines there is no reason you cannot get a healthy pure breed dog.  Such a dog is usually quite expensive though.  A mutt from the local pound can be a stellar family pet and costs very little.  Unless you have a real need or jones for a particular breed a dog from the pound is the way to go 99% of the time.     From a retail perspective, they're much harder to shoplift.  People are also less likely to return the product assuming that if it can't be repackaged in what they bought it in that it cannot be returned.      Why do some people think Democrats are so smart, have you seen their voter base? There's just as many republicans that are not scientific as their are democrats, so generalizing that republicans don't agree with science is in fact not science itself.  Individuals may espouse some stupid ideas but the republicans are actively opposing scientific consensus from scientists.  More, it is not just an occasional crackpot here and there but has taken center stage in republican policy.  For instance:  - The Texas Republican Party has as part of their official party platform that governments at all levels should ["ignore any plea for money to fund global climate change or 'climate justice' initiatives."](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/06/05/3445339/texas-gop-2014-platform-climate-change/)  - ["A new law in North Carolina will ban the state from basing coastal policies on the latest scientific predictions of how much the sea level will rise..."](http://abcnews.go.com/US/north-carolina-bans-latest-science-rising-sea-level/story?id=16913782)  - All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell. And its lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior.  And...  - I dont believe that the Earths but about 9,000 years old. I believe it was created in six days as we know them. Thats what the Bible says. ~Paul Broun (he's a doctor and was on the House Science Committee)  -  "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down [pregnancy]." ~Todd Akin  And so it goes with them.   Chicagoan here too (whole life minus college time).  Never heard this before in my life and I hear the siren go off every first Tuesday of the month at 10a from my office in the Loop.  Not saying they don't do this somewhere in the city but certainly not anywhere I have ever been.     Cover your nuts before you say that.  You're about to get hurt...badly.       It costs more money to kill them though, since we allow for an extended appeals process to make as sure as possible we are killing only the guilty.  It is not more expensive because of the appeals process.  It adds to the cost to be sure but the cost would be more even without the appeals process (see my other reply to /u/ImAGhostOooooo).   It costs substantially more to put a person on death row and execute them than it does to imprison them for life.  This point isn't even argued by death penalty advocates.  How expensive is the death penalty? Just over a year ago, Fox News issued this alarming statement:  Every time a killer is sentenced to die, a school closes.  Dramatic, sure. But some claim that the data backs up these assertions.  While the actual execution costs taxpayers fairly little (the drugs used in Texas run a mere $83), the costs associated with death penalty trials and the resulting incarceration are disproportionately higher.  Citing Richard C. Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, Fox reported that studies have uniformly and conservatively shown that a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole.  A Urban Institute study (downloads as a pdf) found that [i]n Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case while a 2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research that claimed [i]n Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment.  snip  I assumed that this was because of all of the post-trial finagling that goes on. I was wrong. After reviewing data from state reports, Amnesty International concluded that the greatest costs associated with the death penalty occur prior to and during trial, not in post-conviction proceedings. Even if all post-conviction proceedings (appeals) were abolished, the death penalty would still be more expensive than alternative sentences.

I do not work for them, I do not own stock in them and have no family reliant on them.  I truly think they are awesome.  I say this as a former Comcast customer (among a few others over the years).  I have come to loathe the cable companies.  That is not hyperbole.  That said I have never tried to cancel my sub and perhaps that is different.  What's the catch?  They are FUCKING EXPENSIVE!  I mean seriously expensive.  I spend $150/month and not even that gets me all the channels (most but not all and I had the best package then they added an even more package and that just pissed me off).  So why do I stay with them?  Awesome service.    My picture almost never goes out except in an occasional powerful storm (which cable suffers from too since their feeds are from satellite).  Cable was far, far worse.  My picture is better than it ever has been with cable.  The equipment is fisrt rate and incredibly capable.  I can record six shows at the same time off of one input feed.  That box holds dozens of hours of content and it can be watched on any TV in the house with ease.    Their on-air menu system is freaking light years ahead of cable.  Better looking by a mile and far, far more user friendly.  Customer service *for me* has been nothing short of stellar.  I do not think I have ever waited more than 5 minutes for a rep and the reps have always fixed everything remotely within minutes with no need for a repairman to come out.  When I have complained about a charge (very, very rarely) they just wipe it off my account.  I called them on a Friday about maybe upgrading my system and they gave me all the top notch DVR shit at no cost but also came out the next day (Saturday) to install it all (work on the roof on the dish as well as the new DVR) and hook-up the whole house with the new system (very cool...you can watch any show in any room DVR).  Cost of the install?  $0.00 for about four hours of work (I tipped him but that may have been weird...just felt like he deserved something extra).  Again, DirecTV is expensive as all hell and I have been considering unplugging from them because of it.  Only thing stopping me are some particular circumstances with my living arrangement.  If AT T buys them (I fucking hate AT T although they are not even the worst) that may be enough for me to go.  I am not denying the experience of the OP.  Maybe their customer service turns to shit when you tell them you want to stop service.  For my money if you are going to have any service DirecTV is the best.  You'll pay for it through the nose though.    No one missed that point, not a single person, it's in your imagination that we don't already know that.  You cannot say what people do or do not know.  What we can say is people are trying to discredit the whole OP because it is cherry picking its numbers.    And they're right about that.  The OP did cherry pick.  However, the complaint did not note the subtext which is the workforce for solar is on par with coal currently and well placed to sail ahead of coal in the future.    If "not a single person" was fooled it is odd to neglect to mention it if only to be fair and for completeness sake.  This has clear policy and political ramifications and so the commentary I was responding to can only be seen as intentionally deceptive and/or pedantic.  In short it was as guilty of misinformation as what it was railing against since it skewed perception of what is happening.    The EFF's Privacy Badger can purportedly block Canvas Fingerprinting:  The EFF is releasing the tool the same day that ProPublica reported on the emergence of a new type of supercookie -- canvas fingerprinting technology, which tracks users based on characteristics of their computers.  snip  The EFF's Eckersley says that Privacy Badger currently is able to prevent AddThis from tracking users. It's really a simple message: if you try to track people without their consent, it doesn't matter whether you use cookies, canvas fingerprints, or some other kind of supercookie -- Privacy Badger will find you, and block you, he says in an email to MediaPost. [SOURCE](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/230430/eff-says-its-anti-tracking-tool-blocks-new-form-of.html)     I think you'll find that coal still employs far more people if you use the same definition.  It is hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison but the numbers in the article are skewed:  There are, however, two other relevant data series. One, from the Energy Information Administration, shows 91,611 coal-mining workers in 2011, a 6.3 percent increase from the year before. A third data set, the most inclusive, maintained by the Mine Health and Safety Administration, reports 143,437 coal-mining employees in 2011 and estimates there were 137,361 in 2012.  According to the National Mining Association, which published its own report on mining jobs in 2010, the MHSA data is the most inclusive and best reflects the total number of coal jobs of all the government data sets. Why? It surveys the mines themselves, not the companies, meaning it can capture contract workers who are not necessarily employed by the company that owns or operates the mine.  In any case, there isnt a great apples-to-apples comparison for coal and solar jobs. If we use the most generous survey of solar jobs and the rough midpoint of government surveys of coal jobs, the two seem to be roughly comparable. [SOURCE](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/06/reports-say-there-are-more-solar-workers-than-coal-miners-in-the-u-s.html)  But for all the poo-pooing some here want to do because the numbers in the OP are skewed miss the bigger point.  Solar jobs are increasing and coal jobs are stagnant or decreasing.  This trend looks like it will keep going for the foreseeable future too.  This then has policy implications.  If the goal of government is to "promote" jobs then supporting the coal industry is a losing proposition.  Their job growth is medicore to stagnant to negative (depending who you read and how you look at it).  Solar clearly is currently about even overall with coal workers in terms of people employed and looks to keep growing.    [Bailouts versus General Welfare](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aNyalwY5R5o/UnPhmNU6_FI/AAAAAAAALe8/mrjvuyfN-XI/s1600/bailouts-vs-welfareReuters-07Oct2011.jpg)  In short the money committed to Wall Street bailouts alone since the 2008 crisis could fund all social welfare programs in the US for decades or more (including Social Security and Medicare).  This doesn't even touch other subsidies corporations have enjoyed for decades such as subsidies to the oil and coal industries.

Seems a bit much.   - Black carbon (BC) is the most strongly light-absorbing component of particulate matter (PM), and is formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass.  - BC contributes to the adverse impacts on human health, cosystems, and visibility associated with PM 2.5  - BC influences climate by: 1) directly absorbing light, 2) reducing the reflectivity (albedo) of snow and ice through deposition, and 3) interacting with clouds.   - BCs short atmospheric lifetime (days to weeks), combined with its strong warming potential, means that targeted strategies to reduce BC emissions can be expected to provide climate benefits within the next several decades.   - BC mitigation strategies, which lead to reductions in PM 2.5, can provide substantial public health and environmental benefits. SOURCE: [EPA -- Report to Congress on Black Carbon: Executive Summary](http://www.epa.gov/blackcarbon/2012report/ReportHighlightsExecSummary.pdf) (PDF)  They also note that there are mitigating factors that may help cool the planet as well but they are clear that this is a pollutant and clear that mitigation strategies to stop it will have "substantial public health and environmental benefits".  So no, it is not harmless.    I hope you consider the EPA a reliable source.    Uhmm...no:  Black carbon, a component of diesel pollution, is also one of the largest drivers of climate change. Black carbon is a form of particulate matter emitted by diesels (and other sources) that warms the atmosphere by absorbing sunlight and radiating heat into the air (like a blacktop road). It can also darken snow and ice, and directly accelerate melting. The United States has the highest per-capita emissions of black carbon in the world, with more than half coming from diesel engines.

[Stephen Colbert embraces rolling coal (Video)](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/18/stephen-colbert-embraces-rolling-coal-video/)    Assuming that info is accurate- fuck those practices.  I cannot say whether it is true or not but a quick Google search shows it being repeated a lot.  Here is one that cites a media source:  Whats particularly egregious, they say, is the number of commercial properties with hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding debt owed. Those numbers even surprised WDIV Channel 4 in an April segment on debts to the department. An unpaid water bill of $150 pales in comparison to the outstanding fees of some big players in the city. As the segment reported, Joe Louis Arena owes roughly $80,000, and Ford Field about $55,000. Palmer Park Golf Club and the VA Hospital both owe an estimated $200,000. On top of that, the city of Detroit still has a number of vacant buildings gushing water long after being abandoned, as Steve Neavling of Motor City Muckraker reported last year. [SOURCE](http://metrotimes.com/news/news-hits/protesters-decry-detroit-residential-water-shutoffs-1.1700421)    Lets be clear. These water shut offs are not about unpaid bills. This is about dispossession of the people. These shutoffs are intended to drive people from their homes. Water is the wedge. People are being targeted at the rate of 1500 to 3000 homes a week.   One of the ways we know this is not about unpaid bills is the glaring contradiction between the treatment of homeowners and corporate clients. DPS, under its emergency manger, owes $2.2 million in outstanding bills. Palmer Park Golf Club owes $200,000, Joe Louis Arena/Red Wings Hockey owes $80,000 and Ford Field $55,000. The struggling city of Highland Park, also under emergency management, owes $17.4 million.

Even more astounding is how many of these people you see in jobs that are writing oriented (e.g. journalists).  It's scary sometimes.    "This must all be destroyed!"          To be fair a lot of the practice needed to become a good writer is to read a lot (and in particular other good writers).  I am not saying actually writing isn't a part of it.  It certainly is and this seems like laziness on the part of the teachers.  Just saying not all is lost.    This 100%!  Everyone *thinks* they can write because they learned in kindergarten.   Writing is a real skill and it takes practice and a lot of reading to get good at it.  Most people suck at it (and that is not hyperbole).  I had an IT job which was laying people off year after year and I am certain it was my skill at writing (which was not in any way a part of the requirements for the job) that had me keep my position.  I was good at the core of my job but so were the other people.  The difference was I could also write well and communicate well with our clients and that made a huge difference in how I was perceived by my bosses and clients.  Writing will be a part of most any career and writing well certainly will help you stand out.  You need not aspire to winning a Pulitzer.  Just solid grammar and a bit of care will get you most of the way there.    *"The only time you need to worry about what's in your neighbor's bowl is if you're checking to make sure they have enough."* ~Louis CK   I'm going to go a step further and say that they 100% will not work.  You are correct.  It cannot work.  The energy it will produce cannot be enough to do what it says it does (lit up, heated and powering the US) even with generous assumptions.  Not even remotely close.  Here is an engineer familiar with solar installations doing the real-world math for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=obS6TUVSZds#t=583    From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit):  The British thermal unit (BTU or Btu) is a traditional unit of energy equal to about 1055 joules. It is the amount of energy needed to cool or heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In science, the joule, the SI unit of energy, has largely replaced the BTU.   Hamas is [funded by Iran](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2014/0709/Iran-connection-Why-are-Gaza-rockets-reaching-so-deep-into-Israel-video) and Iran has no interest in seeing peace come to the area.  There have been honest attempts, from both sides, in the past 50+ years to broker a real peace deal but such peace is invariably scuttled by one side or the other.  It is trivially easy for those who want to see the conflict continue for their own reasons to keep stirring the pot.  Consider how much money Iran has spent arming Palestinians (tens of millions of dollars...maybe hundreds) and how much good that money could do if it were used to build schools and such.  Remember when Israel was formed after WWII other Arab countries had agreed to absorb the Palestinians.  When the time came they shut their borders to them.  I am not saying Israel is innocent here.  FAR from it!  Just realize you can point to a lot of culpable parties here of which Israel is just one.    [Garbage - Stupid Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0EpeX8tSoA hd=1)   She is good.

I can give the spelling mistakes a pass (we all do it) but not appropriately capitalizing is, in my opinion, pure laziness.  Such laziness suggests to me the person writing the comment has little room to criticize and proclaim "weak writing".     ...the writing is weak as well, creating dissapointing messages.  Says the capitalization/spelling challenged guy/gal.  Hard to take this assessment seriously.   Probably.  They have to know that nuking somone is the one thing that will 100% motivate the rest of the world to come down on them like a ton of bricks.  Not even China could protect them. Indeed to maintain control over its backyard it is likely China would be the ones kicking NK ass.  All well and good but the flip side is we cannot liberate NK concentration camps because:  A) NK has nukes  B) They have something like 10,000+ artillery tubes trained on Seoul, South Korea  C) China  If the NK leadership is about to go down then they start throwing nukes.  That really is all nukes do.  They tell everyone else that if you attack and start winning we throw nukes and everyone loses.  Central tenet of MAD (mutually assured destruction).  So, we cannot help the people in NK.  Not a chance of that in any foreseeable future.    NK missiles [can't quite reach the US](http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/03/08/korea-north-military-missile-idINDEE92706220130308) (parts of Alaska maybe but empty parts).  Yet.  They are working on it diligently.  The leadership are child-like in their actions but they have some smart people in their country and their nukes and missiles work.  More likely than attacking the US directly where their missiles can only just barely reach they would more likely threaten South Korea and Japan which are well within range of their missiles.  Tokyo is an easy shot for them.  If you do not think their missiles and nukes are threatening enough and too high-tech then consider they have an ungodly amount of artillery along the border with South Korea that can easily range on Seoul (over 25 million people in that area).  Enough artillery to throw the equivalent of a nuke into the area in less than an hour.  That is WWII (hell, WWI) tech.   If you think for one second China would be cool with American adventurism in North Korea you are sadly misinformed.  China WOULD fight the US if the US invaded North Korea.  There is precedent for this.  China fought the US in the Korean War directly (pew pew).  They WILL do so again.  China may not be thrilled with North Korea but they see it as part of their hegemony and absolutely will not tolerate the US there in the slightest.  NK would have to nuke someone for the US to have its *casus belli* to go in there.     There are numerous legal opinions that can be found about whether Congress can sue the President and they nearly all agree that Congress cannot do this.  They hold this opinion regardless of ideology because this has already been pretty well established.  Here is a [conservative viewpoint on why it will fail and is a waste of time](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddavenport/2014/07/10/boehner-vs-obama-to-sue-or-not-to-sue-that-is-the-question/).  If you do not want to read the article the short version is Congress lacks standing to bring such a lawsuit.  They cannot show they have incurred damages thus have no room to complain to a court about this.  There is nothing new about this stance from the courts.  In the end the courts view this as a political problem to be solved via the political process.  Congress is far from powerless in this regard.  As a practical matter they may be frozen today but they DO possess the power to rectify these problems on their own without court intervention which is (rightly) why the courts want to stay out of it.    Yeah...big time. North Korea is under protection of China as it is China's back yard. Going to war in North Korea would mean war with China.   Both are nuclear states too.

Generally, to be legally valid, most contracts must contain two elements:  - All parties must agree about an offer made by one party and accepted by the other. - Something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include goods, cash, services, or a pledge to exchange these items.  In addition, certain contracts are required by state law to be in writing (real estate transactions, for example), while others are not.

That's the only difference.* ~Ralph Nader    More people should read the Federalist Papers where a few of the founding fathers set forth a lot of their thinking on how the government should work.  AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations.  snip  By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.  snip   From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.   A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.  SOURCE: [The Federalist #10: James Madison](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm)    What does it say about American democracy that the political will of the American voters is being continuously overruled by courts regarding the gay marriage issue.   It says it is alive and well.  The country was setup with checks-and-balances.  It's right in the Constitution.  Go check.  As such the courts are a check on the executive and legislatures (and vice versa).  This is how it is *supposed* to work.  If you believe the people of a state can institute any policy they like and be done with it then you do not believe in American democracy.  Period.     Well, there isn't a court yet that agrees with you.  An appeals court also found today that banning same sex marriage is a violation of the constitution: [Federal appeals court: Utah can't ban gay marriage](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/court-utah-gay-marriage-ban-unconstitutional)  The article notes that there are now 14 federal rulings in favor of same sex marriage (this does not count state court rulings).    It seems you are suggesting homosexuality is a choice.  Simple question then:  Did you ever sit down and choose to be a heterosexual?  Did you work through the pros and cons of being a heterosexual versus a homosexual? Do you know anyone who did that?  If you talk to most homosexual people they will tell you that when they started figuring out they were homosexual (usually in high school) they would, given a choice, choose to be heterosexual.  Being a gay teen is pretty rough...few would choose it if it were an actual choice.       With Nexus Mod Manager or Steamworks (especially Steamworks) there is almost nothing to it.  A few things can still be a pain to setup (ENB is a bit of a hassle) but beyond a handful of things these managers make adding and managing mods about as painless as can be.  Yeah you have to spend some time researching them but you can find recommended lists online that are fine to go with if you do not want to look into each one yourself.  I estimate I spent a good two hours (maybe a bit more) farting around getting all the mods I wanted but it was well worth it.     However, electricity itself is caused by the movement of electrons, which have a rest mass, and are therefore technically "matter" under a looser definition.  To be a bit more clear on this electrons do not move very much at all in an electric current.  They do move a bit but the speed (called "drift") is actually quite slow on the order of fractions of a millimeter per second.    It is more akin to having a tube 100% filled with water and adding a drop at the top and a drop falls out the bottom (ignore gravity and surface tension for the moment).  The top drop did not travel all the way through...it barely got anywhere at all.  But if you add a stream of water into the top then you get a stream of water (a current if you like) out the bottom.       It is pretty straight forward.  You have money coming in and money going out.  You need to make the money coming in more than the money going out.  Keep a ledger for a month and write down *everything* you spend money on right down to a pack of gum (keep all your receipts for the day and add them up at night).  Note what goes where in the ledger such as household bills (electric, gas), food, entertainment, etc.  Then figure out what your total income is.  With these pieces in hand start looking for places to cut costs.  Eat out less.  Be more frugal when food shopping, cool your place to only 77 instead of 72 in the summer, look for coupons and bargains and so on.  Also, after necessities like food and electricity, pay off credit cards and any other high interest debts you have as fast as possible.  Your interest payments help keep you underwater so getting rid of those first will help the most.  Interest payments are wasted money.  You need to keep cutting till your income exceeds your expenses.      Have you added any mods yet?  They may not be enough to change your mind but there are a helluva lot of them and they can substantially improve on the vanilla experience.   Indeed mods are a huge bonus in Bethesda games. You're missing out if you ignore them and with SteamWorks or Nexus Mod Manager they are pretty easy to use. Ever for a purist the GUI mods are not to be missed.    Good thing too.  If the sun *burned* its fuel (rather than via a nuclear reaction) it would only have enough fuel to last about 50,000 years or so.    In the 1800's, before nuclear reactions were understood, scientists calculated that 50,000 year figure and had an immediate problem since they believed the earth to be about 100 million years old.  That age for the earth was also too young by a long shot but it remains they had a problem since it was not possible for the earth to be older than the sun.  They figured it all out in the early 1900's and now the numbers line up nicely.    Because we all have considerable experience in this.  You see dozens of people every day (even if only on TV) and in the course of your life you have gotten a lot of information about the ages of some of those people.  Your brain simply matches up what it knows about people of various ages and characteristics they share to be able to have an informed guess about someone's age and generally you will be pretty close.    Eh...if it was a urinal cake of George Bush (the junior one) I'd probably find it kinda funny.  My only reservation is (regardless of who the president is) that there should be some respect for the office of the president.  But whatever...in the scheme of things this is small potatoes.  What it mostly shows is the class level of this Faith Conference.  Apparently juvenile potty humor is part of their message.   Amazing.  I cannot imagine how much practice it takes to become adept at this (a metric crapton I suspect).  I love watching this stuff.  My favorite card control personality is [Ricky Jay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQmNuRZU4nQ).  He actually is also an expert on gambling.  You never want to play this guy at cards.    "Job creators are being taxed to death."  Where?  How?  By who?  The marginal business tax rate maxes out at 35% in the US.  Sounds pretty bad except I doubt there is a corporation out there in that bracket (income of over $18.33 million) who actually pays that rate.  Indeed the GAO calculated that [U.S. corporations pay average effective tax rate of 12.6%.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/01/news/economy/corporate-tax-rate/)  That puts the US [among the lowest taxed countries in the world for corporations.](http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx)  Not to mention it has been 35% since 1993 so hardly a new thing or something Obama did.     It is currently [25% off on Steam.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/275670/)   Well...here is an example from seven years ago and looks like it works really well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3m24bjkfg0 feature=player_detailpage#t=162  Look, I am not saying they haven't done something cool here.  Just saying stability control is not new tech.    I was gonna say a [Capybara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara) but yours (which I never heard of before), while looking very similar, seems a better guess.    This is how they maximize profit.  Pretty much everyone who has a console has a PC.  If they came out with PC at the same time as console people with sufficient PCs will certainly buy the PC version.  This way, if you want to play and have a console, you will buy the console version.  You might then ALSO buy the PC version when it comes out.  The reverse is pretty much never true.     Did they invent stability control?  I seem to remember active stability control being demonstrated by Mercedes(?) many years ago.  I assumed it never made it into production because of cost but then cost is not so much an issue with Koenigsegg.   Nah...the Coca-Cola Company just forgot to take [Scalia out hunting](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/18/politics/18CND-SCAL.html) or [pay Thomas' wife to lobby for them](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/05/clarence-thomas-health-care-reform-weiner).    I want my freedom to listen to shitty hipster music while chasing a criminal, goddamn it!  Shitty indeed.  I am amazed at how bad most of the music is.  Seriously disappointing.   I am not sure if they just wanted to go cheap on licensing or if there was some plan behind it all.  Whatever the case the music sucks and that was a real let down for me.   Basically they are paralyzed with fear.  They feel they are just barely floating with their mouth barely at the surface and anything they might do could be the thing that causes them to drown.  Also, they are no longer thinking as a rational person would.  They are terrified and it consumes them.    Why are people downvoting this?  Did anyone read it?  It is a neat interactive chart mostly. (I thought it was neat anyway)   This really is a terribly complicated subject and one people have dedicated careers to get a handle on.  As such remember this is ELI5 so you will get the ELI5 answer that misses a lot of complexity.  In theory currency values are based upon Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).  This is the idea that the same basket of goods will have an equal price in any two countries.  Exchange rates, in theory, move towards PPP.  So let's say there are 100 one-dollar bills in my country and there are 200 one-peso bills in your country.  If a loaf of bread costs $1 in my country it should cost $2 in your country (the peso also uses the dollar sign).  Each loaf of bread costs 1% of the outstanding money in the country.  As such we would have an exchange rate of $1 US for $2 MEX.  As you can see how much currency, among other things, affects the value of your currency.  Go further and you can find one mechanism for the collapse of a currency.  Let's say I have $200 in my economy but I am in debt so I print more money.  Remember that loaf of bread costs 1% of the outstanding currency.  If I now have $300 in my economy because I printed money the bread now costs $3.  Thing is, the people who live there do not have more currency because more was printed.  They still have the (say) $5 they started with.  This is inflation.  Inflation devalues the money you have on hand.  If today the bread costs $2 and tomorrow it costs $3 your money is effectively worth less.  It takes more to get the same basket of goods.  A little inflation is actually a good thing.  Deflation is worse for an economy.  That said only a little is good.  A lot can be a real problem and it can get really, really bad (called hyper-inflation).  Hyper inflation can collapse the currency.  This is the point where the money is essentially worthless and the country reverts to a barter economy.    As an example post WWI Germany experienced hyperinflation.  *"In 1922, a loaf of bread cost 163 marks. By September 1923, this figure had reached 1,500,000 marks and at the peak of hyperinflation, November 1923, a loaf of bread cost 200,000,000,000 marks."* ([SOURCE](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/hyperinflation_weimar_germany.htm))  Zimbabwe has this problem now.  About a year ago (not sure where it stands today) Zimbabwe was printing a $100 trillion note that was [worth about $300 US](http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2013/07/zimbabwes-currency-crisis-and-the-100-trillion-dollar-note.html).    If drowning actually leaves the person more 'stiff' though, does that mean it is alright to try and help them (since the story goes if you try to help a drowning person they'll just end up drowning you) ?  Absolutely not.  Going in after the person is your **last resort** when there is no other option.    Remember they are panicked and in serious fear for their own life.  They will move and clamp on to you if you get within reach.  There is a reason it is not unheard of for two people to drown when one tried to save another.  Ideally you use a throwable floatation device to them or use a pool hook to get them out.  Lifeguards often have a throwable device they drag with them that they throw once they get close to the victim.  If you absolutely must swim to and grab the victim you should swim underwater the last 10 feet or so, grab the victim's legs and spin their back towards you.  Then slide up behind them with your arm around them.  This grants you some measure of control.  If the victim spins and seizes you do all you can to go back underwater.  The victim will NOT follow and will let go.       Panic is what causes drowning far more than not being taught to swim.  Swimming (or at least not drowning) is pretty natural to humans.  As adults people who have not learned to swim panic and freeze up (the image of a person thrashing about while drowning is wrong...drowning people do not do that...[learning what a drowning person really looks like is important](http://lifehacker.com/know-what-drowning-really-looks-like-to-help-save-lives-511869654)).  Panic is the cause of that.  Babies do not "know" to panic so do fine in water.   Judges operate on the assumption that the facts presented to them by the police seeking the warrant are true.  The judge really has no ability to assess the validity of the representation by the police.  Warrants need to be issued quickly...they cannot spend months investigating whether the police really have just cause for the warrant.  What stops the police from bullshitting the judge is it is generally a bad idea to piss off a judge who you will have to go before numerous times.  Not to mention the judge could hit them with perjury charges.       Allowing medallions to be investments that you can't lose for being a terrible cab driver or a lack of use ruins the entire system.  I am not sure how it works elsewhere but in Chicago (where I live) it is very rare for the cab driver to own the medallion or even the cab.  These are owned by holding companies which then lease their cars out on a daily basis to drivers.  The cabbie has paid whatever it is (over $100 for 8 hours I think) to the cab company to use the car.  The cab company could not care less if they never pick up so much as a single fare.  The cab driver needs to make enough to cover the cost of leasing the cab and whatever is left is profit for them.   Note there are many different types of combustion engines out there.  I will assume you mean a typical 4-stroke engine you find in most cars these days.  [This animation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/4StrokeEngine_Ortho_3D_Small.gif) shows it pretty clearly.  Each number is one of the "strokes" and there are four of them hence a 4-stroke engine (there are other kinds of this as well):  1 - Piston goes down, valve opens and a fuel/air mixture is drawn into the engine (today it may be a fuel injection system instead but serves the same purpose).  2 - Piston rises compressing the fuel/air mixture.  At the top of the stroke the spark plug fires which ignites the fuel mixture.  3 - The piston is pushed down by the exploding fuel mixture that was ignited in step #2 above (this is called the power stroke).  4 - The piston rises and a valve opens allowing the piston to push out the burnt fuel mixture into the exhaust system.  Note:  At the bottom the piston is attached to the crank shaft which connects to the transmission and wheels.     I do not know if you have seen this before or (if you haven't) if will be of any help to you but you might find it interesting if nothing else.  [TED - Eleanor Longden: The voices in my head](http://www.ted.com/talks/eleanor_longden_the_voices_in_my_head)    Fascinating!  Thanks!   If you have 5 smart TVs running 24/7 doing video streaming you'd hit your 300GB cap with Comcast in barely over a day.  Add in all the rest also running 24/7 and it'd be less than a day.   I cannot think what you would do at home that would use 200GB a day that is a bigger bandwidth hog than video streaming.  Only things that come to mind might be torrents and/or a home web server.  What you would want to torrent that uses 200GB (or a significant portion of that) per day (or 6 TB/month) *on a regular basis* is beyond me. I cannot imagine having enough storage at home to handle that (72TB/year).   If you are running a web server from home to hit that bandwidth you are violating the Comcast TOS (nothing new there...they have never allowed that).  Bottom line, as you can see from the Sandvine stats I posted, you are waaaay beyond even heavy user usage (whatever it is you are doing).   I'm curious what the hell the OP is doing to consume that much bandwidth?  At the *most* Netflix will consume about [2.3GB/hour](http://www.gci.com/kb/netflix-movie-and-data-usage) to stream high definition movies.  That works out to 13 hours of high definition movies per day at your current rate.  This is WAY over the average consumption of internet users and well above the average of the top 15%:  The Sandvine report also examined consumption patterns among different cohorts of users. The top 15% of bandwidth users dominate network usage in North America, accounting for 54% of total monthly network traffic in March. That group consumes on average 212 gigabytes per month, the equivalent of 100 hours of video and more than seven times the 29 GB of a typical subscriber. (Sandvine termed this top 15th percentile of users cord-cutters, speculating that they are relying on the Internet for video entertainment  but it doesnt actually know whether those consumers have canceled pay TV.)   Overall, mean average usage per subscriber for wireline broadband in North America was 51.4 GB in the first half of 2014, up from 44.5 GB last fall. That increase is in line with the 30%-40% annual growth rate in bandwidth consumption ISPs are forecasting for 2014, according to Sandvine. [SOURCE](http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-youtube-bandwidth-usage-1201179643/)  Netflix will be your biggest use by far.  Games and music do not come close (people think games are a big use but they really aren't apart from the initial download of a given game...online gaming is pretty low bandwidth...IIRC Battlefield 3 uses about 80MB/hour).  Normal browsing and email hardly register.  I am no fan of Comcast by a long stretch but maybe this time they have a legitimate gripe.  I cannot imagine what your house is doing to consume that much bandwidth.  Whatever the case [I hope you don't live in my neighborhood.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgang1izeh0)    You should be deeply skeptical.  If they really had a cure for baldness they would be falling over themselves to have independent, double-blind studies performed.  We see none of that here.  Currently there is no "cure" for male pattern baldness.  You can get hair transplants and the future may offer some hope in the form of [hair cloning or natural regeneration](http://www.askmen.com/sports/health_200/223_mens_health.html) but it will be awhile yet before those options become available (or maybe never...have to wait and see).     ...maybe they'll just breed like ~~rabbits~~ ~~humans~~ and overpower everyone with numbers.  Zerg   Like you I have played since the very first Civ game and have been a huge fan all along the way.  I liked Civ 5 when it came out and now, with all its DLC and whatnot, I think it is one of the best games ever.  Certainly my favorite.  That said this looks like Civ 5 with renamed units.  Basically the same game except you call Unit-A Unit B and make it look different.  Don't get me wrong...I love the Civ 5 gameplay but if the difference is largely cosmetic with a different story I don't see the point.  I'll just keep playing Civ 5 happily.     Seriously?  Is there a living, breathing, heterosexual male here who cares if she wants to iron the ceiling?  I say go for it!  Let me hold the ladder for you.    Try [Paddy Long's](http://www.paddylongs.com/).  They do beer and bacon and the bacon is more than your typical breakfast diner bacon.       The Swiss approach to self-defense has never been one of overwhelming military force (indeed that might scare neighbors and provoke them).  Instead the Swiss approach is one of being more trouble than it is worth to attack them.  Germany could certainly take Switzerland if it so chose but the cost would be steep and the gains not worth it.  The Swiss know their mountains very well so an invasion would be difficult and costly in terms of men and machines.     For copyright reasons I cannot quote all of the explanation found at [this link](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-birds-and-the-bees.html) which answers your question.  Short version: It is unclear where it originated but there are a few good guesses with the best being it is from *"the work of the American naturalist John Burroughs. In 1875, he published a set of essays titled 'Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes and other Papers'. Burrough's aimed to present nature to children in a way that they could easily understand and appreciate."*    Yeah...I live in Chicago in a condo and the decks are all wood.  Most buildings (and perhaps city code...not sure but definitely building rules) will not allow you to have a charcoal grill as it is a serious fire hazard (and it is not just your place at stake but the building filled with everyone else too).  Gas grilling is the only choice.  I just wish, given that there are a LOT of gas grills out there, these celeb chefs would show us some love too and give grilling recipes and tips for gas grills. (I know there are some but charcoal seems to be most of it)   Why would they?  Not like Nader voters would ever pull the lever for Bush.    His (somewhat simplistic) view is that because there is mass, there is matter.  Matter and energy are equivalent ( see E=MC^2 ).  Matter can be converted to energy and vice versa and energy has gravity as well as matter.  If you put a box around the earth and magically converted all the mass of earth to energy the moon would remain in orbit same as if the earth was still matter.  We usually do not experience gravity with energy because we are rarely around that much energy in one place (your mass converted to energy would be on the order of around [10,000 megatons](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=122487))  So, if all the matter sucked into a black hole is converted to energy you will still feel the gravitational pull same as if it stayed as matter.   In the US we have a First Past the Post voting system. This makes it a near certainty that you end up with a two party system due to strategic voting (eg you vote against someone more than you vote for someone).   Third parties just split the ticket as happened with Gore and Nader seeing Bush take the White House.   	135

 They are not a representation of biblical Christianity. They are extremists.   I do not believe in free will.   For the record, I think all of us can agree Sean Hannity is a moron.   My advice; relax. If you really want to make a difference and spread ideas of liberty, you are going to have to have a ton of ammunition. Keep reading. Read Rothbard, read Hayek, read Hazlitt and even Ron Paul. Forget about what your teachers and classmates think, keep thinking for yourself.      I am a Creationist.  I am just not a literal six day creationist.    I believe humans do not evolve arbitrarily, but were created by God to obey his law.  Edit; grammar.   I only keep books I believe add value to my library. Not every author is Reformed, or even orthodox (I have some of Barth's stuff, Kierkregard, Erasmus etc) but I do not tend to even bother with fluffy stuff.      I read several books more than once.   I read *To Kill A Mockingbird* yearly.    A stereotype based on Germans historically being seen as regimented and serious. (i.e the Prussians and the Nazi's)  Also a stereotype based on their language, which is perceived as harsh/serious.   **For Shaving**  * Mitchell's Wool Fat shaving soap. Smells wonderful, and leaves me without razor bumbs. Creates a very good lather. I use a badger hair shave brush and straight razor.   * Captain's Choice Bay Rum aftershave.  **In the Shower**  * Lava Soap. It contains grit, so it cleans well. My wife loves the smell, and it is easy to take on the go. I use it as body soap and in my hair.  **On The Counter**  * Brylcreem. This stuff holds my hair combed and parted without making it look gross. A real classic.  * Old Spice Classic Deodorant. I have tried the newfangled and fresh smells, but nothing beats the classic. My wife loves the smell more than anything, which is a great bonus.    Just curious, what is in your bathroom?  What hygiene products do you use and why?   Will give sources when I get home  The worship of Baal and Moloch included child sacrifices. Many scholars believe the worship of Ishtar included (forcible?) temple prostution. Herodotus includes accounts of temple prostitution in his work.   As a confessional Presbyterian, I do not believe God has changed his message. I do not see a break between the Old and New Testaments. I see the scriptures as one Covenant of Redemption, with various stages of completion. We are simply in a later stage of the plan. The Law still stands but has different implications for us after Christ than before. It has not lost its validation though.   I can go into more detail in a while, once I have gotteb home, and provide better sources if you would like.   God called for the death of these pagans as judgment upon them. He was establishing a Kingdom of Righteousness amongst a people of violence and wickedness. He was violently overthrowing their exploitative wicked religions, in order to plant His people in the land.   The application to today is that God takes idolatry seriously. Although the actions might not carry the same physical ramifications today, God's atttitude about those actions have not changed.    We are no longer in a time where our world is run by overtly bloodthirsty pagan taskmasters who offer human sacrifices and sexual slavery to their gods. Imagine living under barbarism like that, would you not support the violent overthrow of such a system?     I agree. There are true libertarians on both sides.    They were created by God. I believe in microevolution, that society and civilization has evolved over the years.  I believe the poor sexual morals of humanity throughout history are a testament to man's fallen nature and mutiny against God's law.   What makes you appreciate the perspective?   Actually, I hold to an Old Earth creationist view. I believe the world is millions of years old.  Don't make assumptions about my belief system. Christianity is a broad and diverse religion with a ton of nuance.   I am totally serious.   I believe humans were committed for committed relationships.  I am a Christian, and so obviosuly my worldview is rooted in the Christian narrative.   God has given us stewardship of the earth. We are responsible for its welbeing.    Ultimately I do believe he is in control, and will not let his creation be utterly destroyed. This does not negste human responsibility though.    Hey y'all. I am about a year out from ets, and I am trying to prepare myself for the transition. I am curious to know how it went for y'all?  1. Did you have a hard time transitioning into a good career?  2. Do you enjoy your career?  3. What things might I struggle with after transition?  4. In what ways has your military experience stuck with you?  I gotta be honest, I am pretty scared of the unknown. Scared about finding a good job, and dealing with it all   I am sorry, images are covered in the Westminster Larger Catechism. I accidently directed you to the wrong part of our Church Standards.  It is covered in [questions 109 and 110 of the Westminster Larger Catechism](http://opc.org/lc.html)   We do not ban all images, only images of any person of the Godhead. We ban the use of any images in worship, but as far as art goes we are permitted to make images of animals, nature, humans, etc.   I believe the proper and moral place of sex is within a committed relationship.  So yes, I do think visiting prostitutes is shameful.   [The Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)    I believe the second commandment is clear.   My confession condemns any representation of any member of the Godhead.   Each a violation of the second commandment.   No.  I am married.   It is heresy.   I agree with you   Have you ever considered selling them as mail order brides for ISIS? They look just their type.   Sure,   I grew up in the church, my parents raised me in the faith. I never had a "see Jesus moment", it was a progressive and gradual thing. I began to understand my sin-debt, and at some point it all clicked. Christ arrested my heart, and drew me to himself. It was gradual, over many months, my understanding of salvation. I cannot point you to a definite conversion experience, but rather a gradual understanding of the implications of his sacrifice as my substitute.   Historically, I believe Constantine was the beginning of the church losing its way. For a long time I believe the true church existed within the Catholic Church, until barely a remnant remained. There were many quasi-reformers before The Reformers. There was much ebb and flow, but the remnant of orthodoxy was nearly snuffed out leading up to the Reformation.  I believe the Reformation was the great recovery of the true church, and the exodus of the true church from a corrupt institution.   First, I would kill a human if put in the right scenario. In fact, I have been put in that scenario on more than one occasion. I am totally comfortable with violence.  Second, no, I do not believe a fetus is committing an act of aggression against the mother. *The fetus is not the initiate*, the act of sex was the initiate. If you want to use your homeless man scenario, pregnancy/abortion would be like me going out and finding a homeless man, bringing him into my home (initiating the act) and then murdering him because he is in my home... The fetus does not choose or initiate the act of pregnancy. Therefore, the fetus could never be the aggresor. If violence is taken against the fetus, the mother is the aggressor because she initiated the entrance of the fetus into her womb, and then killed the fetus for being there.    By all means, ask away.  No, neither. I believe the Trinity is a fundamental doctrine of the faith. By the same token I do not believe modalist thought is orthodox either. These are all heresies condemned explicitly by the ancient church councils.  I (and my denomination) would place Unitarians and Mormons even farther in the unorthodox spectrum than RC's. We believe they are heretics outright. (I am not using that as a slanderous term, just a descriptor to explain that we do not believe these groups to be Christian at all).   The key word here is *aggression*. Are you familiar with the Non-Aggression Principle?   If someone is trying to kill me, then any violence on my part is not *aggression*, but *self-defense*.   If someone breaks into my home, they have commited the act of aggression, both by aggressing against my private property, and presenting reasonable threat to my family's wellbeing.  I am not a pacifist by any means. I am a Non-Aggressionist. There is a colossal difference between the two.    Most of Protestantism. Obviously there is a spectrum of orthodoxy. I will not be exhaustive here, but painting with a broad brush, the core issues of orthodoxy in my opinion are the five solas. They must be held to for a church to be considered remotely orthodox in my realm of thought.  As a Reformed Presbyterian I obviously share little common ground with RC's theologically.    I believe there are Christians in the Catholic church.  I do not accept the Catholic church as a valid representation of orthodox Christian thought though.   Not inconsistent with the Christian faith in the sense that believing it makes you a nonchristian. You can, of course believe Mary was a perpetual virgin and still be saved.   It is totally inconsistent with Reformed Christianity though. Luther and Zwingli believed a lot of things that fall outside the boundaries of Reformed thought.   I believe if you create life, you are responsible for that life. No matter the circumstances, once life has been created it should *never* be taken in aggression.  That is the fundamental principle. Aggression. If a fetus is a human, then abortion is aggression.    If there were, somehow, another way to create human life (cloning for example) I would just as adamantly oppose aggression against that created life.     Just because something is poor taste does not mean it should be illegal.   Most of us who support free speech also think discriminatory jokes are tasteless. I for one do not support magazines or organizations that do such things.   That does not mean they should not be allowed to do them.   Most profitable blue collar trades require some skill traini g first. Do not think you are just going to transition from an office job with no trade skills into a profitable and fullfilling blue collar job easily.  That being said, there are a ton of great opportunities out there for guys willing to learn. Welding, pipefitting, electrical work, plumbing.. all of these jobs can be very profitable.   My suggestion would be as follows  1. Do not quit your job until you are ready to transition into your new career.  2. Look up labor statistics for your area. Get in contact with local labor unions. Figure out what blue collar jobs are in demand in your area. Sometimes the profitability of a blue collar career can change dramatically from city to city.  3. Once you figure out some options, figure out how to get certified in that trade. Most trade unions have trade school type programs. Votech schools also are a viable option. These things are not always very expensive.  There is a huge market for skilled blue collar labor out there, but do not let your desire for another kind of career drive you to jump ahead of yourself.   If the mother does not want a baby, she should not have unprotected sex.  We all know that pregnancy is the natural consequence of unprotected sex. Nobody is confused about what happens. Once you participate in unprotected sex, and a child is concieved, you cannot blaim the child for natural consequence.   Sex is an act that is by definition, the creation of life. Once you create an individual, you do not have the right tk aggress against that individual.    Thank you!   Yes, if you are a pregnant woman you own your body. But you do not own the fetus's body. The fetus has every amount of self ownership you do.   Last week. I eat bologna on wonder bread often. I take them to work, alternating between bologna on white bread and salami on rye. I am a simple man.   Not quite that cut and dry. He introduced the Sanctity of Life Act 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011which would have defined a fetus as a human being with full rights at the federal level.  He has commented that he believes such matters are best handled at a statr level, but he is adamantly pro-life, supporting pro-life legislation. In 2000 and 2003 he supported a federal ban on partial birth abortions.   He is a huge voice against abortion, showing no support for an individual's "right" to abortion. He just thinks the matter should be handled on the state level   I would say I dress in a way that works for me.  I keep my hair short, and combed. I wear mostly button up shirts and pearl snaps. I always tuck my shirts in. I make sure everything is well ironed. I never wear tennis shoes, typically I wear either my cowboy boots or brown leather wingtips.. I wear a lot of seersucker, cardigans, and bow ties.  My style is mostly affected by the culture I grew up in (deep south) and the military culture I spent most of my young man days in (well ironed, tucked in shirts, combed short hair, etc)   No. Because I own my body. That is the fundamental premise of libertarianism.   How do you deal with feeling burnt out?.. I am getting real jaded about being in, I am tired of the bullshit, and honestly just do not wanna do it anymore..   I am about 12 months out from ETS, and I do not think I am gonna do it again. How do I adjust my attitude in the meantime?   Because those of us who are pro-life libertarians believe a fetus is a human, and therefore abortion violates the non-aggression principle. The moment a fetus is concieved, we believe he has the right to life, like any other human.   I am looking for anyone who is or has been involved with prison librarianship.    **My 5 Questions:**  1. In what ways have you seen the library program improve prison conditions?  2.  What made you want to work in your prison's library? Tell your story.  3.  How big of a percentage of your prison reads regularly?  4.  What are some things you wish outsiders knew about prison libraries?  5. Tell me any stories/experiences of your prison library enriching or bettering someone's life?   Granted, it is not high on my list of important government reform. It would be a future goal, to keep the state totally out of speech laws.   First, I am not naive enough to assume that a world of total liberty will be perfect. There will be injustice. But there is injustice now! I believe there would be less injustice if people were more free.    Libertarianism is not a solution, it is an alternative. An alternative which I believe to be the best alternative with the least amount of oppression. There is no possible way to eliminate all badness in the world.   I think people have generally done a good job in the past looking to outside sources to make informed consumer decisions. Sure, there are dumb consumers who just buy things for their logo, but there are a lot more people to use information to become a knowledgeable consumer.   Fight terrorist morons.    I also volunteer at my local library.      I think in the absence of such laws, we would see consumer watchdog agencies spring up which can effectually combat such a thing. The business owner who felt slandered could ask the watchdog group look into the matter, the watchdogs would then release info stating that the product was actually quite legal and the owner of the other business was lying. At which point the other business would lose profit because of their dishonesty and dirty marketing. And the slandered business would likeley gain more business.   I still do not see such a scenario as terribly realistic. Businesses are not able to steal tons of business from competitors by spewing ungrounded claims. Such claims are easily researched, and tend to be horrible for business once the truth comes out.  It is not as if we do not have businesses lying about other businesses today. And watchdog groups generally do a pretty good job exposing slanderous claims.   The reason I am against slander/libel laws is because speech is terribly subjective. There is not an objective standard. You could claim any number of things were scandalous. I could be telling the truth about your product, and you cover it up so well that I end up getting sued and lose all credibility while you continue with your harmful product.   If I am not on your property, you have no say on my actions. Ideally there would be no public roads, they would be privatozed, and such matters could be settled through the market. You could buy shares in the road you live on, and establish conditions for the use of that road.   If I am on your property, you can decide what I say.  If I am on my property, I can say what I want when I want.   In a truly ancap society, there would be no public property. In our current society, I would advocate for zero regulation of speech on public property. If you do not want me speaking on your private property, ban me from your property    My answer would be that it is not the state's responsibility to regulate these things. So no.  If you slander or commit libel, there will arise a counterbalance to your speech. An example of this is the internet. The internet is unregulated generally, and there are many false internet myths, and slanderous statements about people. Organizations like snopes have arisen to prove these myths false. That is how libertarians would like to see society function.  Just because speech is free from government intervention, does not mean it is free from blowback. For examlle, if I owned a theatre, I would likely make it a rule that false claims  of fire or disaster are punishable by a permanent ban from the premises. I do not think the "crying fire in a theatre" example is really valid, because it is so unlikely. Such a thing would never happen. And of someone did yell fire, I do not believe people would go screaming for the door with no proof.     TL;DR;  we want no regulation of speech at all.   As a libertarian, I disagree. I do not believe in any regulation of speech.    Libertarianism is radical like that.   What is not true? I explained ot depends on whose perspective the answer is coming from.  As a libertarian, my answer is totally correct.   It refers to being able to say, write, or communicate anything you want without censorship or blowback from the government. It does not mean people have to listen to you, or accept your ideas. Ultimately it depends on whose perspective you are coming from.  As a libertarian I believe all speech should be totay free from government regulation. You should be able to say anything and everything you want, whenever you want, without the government stopping you.    1. This American Life -An NPR show hosted by Ira Glass. He explores stories on a variety of subjects. Always interesting, unbiased, and colorful.  2. Invisibilia. The first episode just came out. It is an NPR podcast dealing with invisible things like thoughts, morals, beliefs, and the like. Very interesting.  3. Stuff you should know - basically ELI5 in a podcast format. Dealing with everything from freemasonry to communism to Tesla.  4. Planet Money - NPR podcast exploring stories with an economic backdrop. Way more interesting than your typical business news show though.  5. The Tom Woods Show - Libertarian talk show exploring social and political issues.  6. Otherppl- host Brad Listi chats with various authors, poets, and essayists.  7. Evil Librarians- hosts interview various librarians about their library, their job, literacy, and literacy related issues.  8. The Art of Manliness Podcast- discussing a whole host of mens issues from a traditional perspective.    Those are my go to podcasts. Hope you find something you like.   Awesome! That sounds like an incredible place.   I thought Finn's apartment was a perfect description of my dream house.  Also, the characters were so alive, and different!   What is the atmosphere like?  What is the staff like?  What makes your bookshop unique?     I agree! I dunno why this is getting downvoted so much. I thought it was spectacular!   You did not really give an option for libertarians on your spectrum. We do not fit on the traditional right wing/left wing spectrum. We support total social liberty (drug legalization, open borders, marriage equality) but also economic liberty (end of welfare, abolishment of the Fed, totally free markets, no nationalized healthcare etc).   I am a sabbatarian Christian. I believe Sunday is the Sabbath, the Lord's Day. All confessional Presbyterians are sabbatarians.  This [essay](http://www.biblebb.com/files/edwards/sabbath.htm) by Jonathen Edwards is a good introduction to why we believe the day has changed to the first day of the week.      Grew up a Southern Baptist. After studying scriptures, and tons of reading, the stance that seemed most biblical to me was the confessional Presbyterian stance. I joined the OPC because they are biblically faithful, strictly confessional, firm adherents of the RPW and traditional Reformed thought.  It started when I accepted the Calvinist soteriological position. After that, I came to a covenant paedobaptist stance on baptism. After that, the more minor things fell into place.      I am looking for books about expats, especially expats living in Europe. Anywhere from lost generation era expats to modern day expats.   They are not necessarily "accepted", but the right to make those jokes is.  I believe all discriminatory jokes are tasteless, but folks should be allowed to make any jokes they want, because free speech is a human right.   Looking for any documentary about the Lost Generation expats in France. Especially something that explores the places they spent time at in the modern day.   I definitely think Greenwald is the most influential journalist of our time. I wish all of them had his courage.   Ira Glass, host of This American Life.  He is pretty unbiased and respectful.    American media is absolutely awful. There are very few respectable journalists left.   Who do you think is the best journalist today?   They are not really "special agents". Not like NCIS or the FBI or anything. The enlisted guys mostly spend their time busting soldiers with drugs, or catching soldiers hanging out in prohibited areas.  No CSI shit going on. No secret agent stuff either.  I am sure CID units have barracks. If not, they probably share barracks with other MP's.   Yes. Capital punishment is not high on my list of priorities for criminal justice reform.  I think it is right, but first we need to reform the way our system operates.   Look for references to the Odyssey.    We should fix our system. There should be overwhelming evidence before we put someone to death.  Unfortunately, the U.S. justice system is not one predisposed to fairness.   Because we believe the price for killing innocent blood is the forfeiture of your own life.  We also believe fetus's are humans. We believe killing them is murder.    ESV.   I like the folks who translated it.    I honestly never think about what other men masturbate to. Ever. Do what you want.   Well you have quite an unorthodox understanding of Holy Scripture.  Obviously we cannot discuss this further, because I believe all of scripture is inspired and the absolute Word of God.    I believe the words of Paul in scripture are the Word of God (the orthodox explanation of inspiration). I place equal weight behind the words of Paul in scripture and the words of Christ.    I almost missed it. It is reay vague   And Paul explained quite clearly that all Israel is not Israel. That circumcision is of no avail in Christ.   Yeah, she says it near the end. She does not explain it well.   I think you misread my comment.   I said I do not believe you have to be Presbyterian to be a member of the Church.   I am OPC. We are a lot more old school.   No, the promises are for all of Christ's elect. The Chuch, spanning many denominations.   They have no Presbyterian flair, or I would choose it.   Because little one, if I explained every answer like you were actually five, it would be condescending (which means answering you like I am much more important than you). You would probably feel a little looked down upon.  Sometimes people use figures of speech to get their point across better. In this subreddit, when someone asks us to explain like they are five, we take it to mean explain in a very simple and easy to understand way.  Does that explain it little one, or do I need to explain it better?   A girl coming of age in the 80's. Her uncle (who she has a childish crush on) is gay, and has AIDs, and she struggles to come to terms with what that mea a.   I see now, sorry.     What did you think?   I absolutely loved Finn. I loved every second of it!   It is possible, but not likely in my opinion. It is impossible to make a definitive judgement on the issue. His actions were indicative of regret, but not necessarily repentance. Anything is possible though.   Again, modern Judaism and OT Judaism are radically different.   By rejecting the Messiah, Jews are equally as lost as Muslims.    Yes, but we *are* Israel. I (along with historic Christianity) believe all of the promises to Israel were for the Church, not ethnic Israel.   This.    This is true. This was pretty shocking to me when I heard about it.   As a confessional Presbyterian, we are pretty adament about believing the covenant promises belong to the church.   No. Everyone has their thing. As long as I was comfortable with her, committed, and had already created a safe environment between us, I would be ok.   Several. My two most notable are;  1. My Grandfather- A welder at a shipyard. Hard working, never complains, gentle and quiet.  2. My old English professor - now semiretired on his sheep ranch. Allowed me to work on his ranch while I was in college and payed me 9 dollars an hour. Taught me hard work, gentleness, patience, and gave me an example to emulate.     Have you seen any wars?  I have. And I would dispute this.   Just OP trying to take a political cheap shot through an unrelated sub.   I already said we should stick up for all humans in my OP. We should defend and support all himans whether they are Buddist, Jewish, Muslims or anything else.   My point was that it seem some Christians (especially in America) have an elevated regard for Judaism, and a disrespectful attitude towards Muslims.   Christianity depends on OT Judaism for its legitimacy, not modern Judaism. There is no theological kinship between modern Judaism and Christianity IMHO.   Perhaps.. I have noticed it tends to be the American right wing evangelicals who fit into the mold I described.   So war against Palestine (resulting in the deaths of many civilians) is somehow different?   Keep your head down. Do not stand out. Do not be an individual.  You will be fine.    Especially in light of the Charlie Hebdo tragedy, a ton of Christians I know are showing solidarity with the Jews of France, while saying nothing (or saying derogatory things) about the Muslims of France...   In my opinion, both religions are equally false. **But from a human standpoint, we should stand against all injustice and demographically oriented oppression.** I agree with neither Muslims or Jews on theological points. Neither religion carries more weight in my book...But many Christians seem to blindly accept all Jews as brothers, and label all Muslims as bloodthirsty heretics..  Anyone else wanna weigh in on this?  (EDIT; Emphasis added, because apparantly my point was not clear.)   They were saying if Ralph Nader had been elected 9/11 never would have happened.   The joke was that the terrorists would have been too busy watching pigs fly to attack on 9/11. (Joke about the improbability of Nader's election).    This. If you have a good tobacconist in your area, they would be more than happy to introduce you to the world of tobacco.   My favorite artist is Jamey Johnson.   His word has resonated in my soul as truth, for one. Nature also declares his glory. I believe faith is a gift from God, therefore I would ultimately answer your question by saying I believe in him because he has enabled me to.   Because I believe I deserve the death penalty for my sin, but Christ died as a substitute in my place, and has allowed me to claim his righteousness while claiming my sinfulness.   Just tell them thanks for their support. No need to be an asshat about it, let them feel like they are doing something.  I go out of my way to thank teachers and librarians. Shake their hands or bring them thank you cards. Try to thank someone who is a worldchanger.   Outstanding. That soldier deserves an ARCOM.   They are so two sided. Sure, they will stand with Charlie Hebdo for freedom of speech, while simultaneously putting speech in shackles.  Ah the parodoxy of Statism.   As a Christian I will explain the orthodox Christian response.  No one made God. He has always been. He exists outside our concepts of beginning and end. He is seperate from our world and how our world operates. He is without beginning or end.   They are not always.  For example, many Haitian-Americans are adamantly opposed to being called African-Americans because doing so trivializes the distinction of their culture. They are not African.   Basically it comes down to ignorance. We do not put enough thought into the titlea we use for other people, forgetting that titles carry meaning.    For one, Paris is a developed peaceful society. Pakistan is by no means a peaceful society. Pakistan is a haven for radicals, so it really is not that surprising when those radicals act like radicals. Mix a whole bunch of corrupt and bloodthirsty extremists into a society, and you are bound to have massacre. Paris is not a haven for radicals. It is surprising when attacks fall on free soil.   I really want to join a local bookclub. I do not really have any real life bookish friends. That being said, I have only found one in my area. I had some questions about book club.  1. The book club, as far as I know, is 100 percent female. That is not a problem. I am just curious, would it be kind of awkward for one married man to join a book club full of married ladies?  2. For those of you in book clubs; how has actively participating in the book club enhanced your reading experience?     Ah, I was just curious   NTC is no big deal. Not really a factor in whether I would stay in or not. It's not like it's a deployment...  I have gone to either JRTC or NTC every year I have been in.  Also, if you are a 15E why do you have LT flair?   Always a bad idea.   I think this question is best answered by question one of the Westminster Larger Catechism;  **Q. What is the chief and highest end of man?**    *A. Man's chief and highest end is to glorify God, and fully to enjoy him forever.*  Our purpose now after sin, is the same as Adam's was before sin. To glorify our Creator and King.   I use a poncho. I like the minimalist thing.   I do not believe that a noncelibate homosexual lifestyle is ok. No member of my denomination would perform a same sex union.  That being said, I think the state should stay out of it, so I am all for legalizing it. Just because it violates my moral code does not mean others cannot live it.   Well, I am a libertarian. I am all for libraries, but do not think they should be funded by the state. They can (and have) been effectively funded privately.   But I agree about your assessment of our education system. I was unschooled as a kid, kind of a montessori homeschool, and it worked very well for me. I do not think one size fits all education helpa anyone.   Yeah, I have a hard time wrestling with a bit of jadedness about the war. I am sure any vet has experienced that stuff.   Right now snapchat had been building it's user base. They are about to expand, something called "snapchat discovery", which will feature videos, articles, etc in the same format as the current peer to peer sharing is.  Basically, up to this point they have just been investing to get snapchat big enough and popular enough, that when they do start using it to make money, the user base is big enough.   No I have not.  If I did, I am quite sure I would regret it.    Duly noted and revised.   Exactly. I know a lot of folks who are so conflicted because they haven't "seen" God, or had some kind of experience.  I am just here to say, I have never had an experience. I just believe. Just like I believe Mars exists because of the photographs I have seen. I have never been on Mars. I do not know anyone who has been on Mars, but I believe it to be just as the photographs depict it. I believe God to be true because his word has resonated in my heart as truth (his word is after all a photograph of himself). It does not make sense, it just is.  	135
