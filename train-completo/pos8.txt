I really should start limiting my budget. . .Looking through the replies only a couple have as much or more than me, which is probably not a good sign.   I don't a single one of these minus Saga in trade form. . .   Comixology is having a massive sale on Crossed. I was wondering which runs are worth getting.   Well to be fair many states just require you to be 18 to be able to serve alcohol.   If they put as much work into their movies as they do their comic books (as in I can't find a single issue I dislike) then I can't wait for their movies.   It is kinda how everyone jokes Batman's power is that he **is** Batman.    Yea thats the Beowulf I am thinking about.   Not to mention overwhelming the wallet.   Did Beowulf ever show up? I kinda sorta remember reading a Beowulf feature in the New 52 DC presents that involved Camelot.   Spaceman by Vertigo.   And in Eureka7 there is a character named Stoner. . .   Hopefully Del Toro can be a producer at least.   Nope you are not alone.   Exactly. Post Convergence isnt New 52 anymore.   There were also Futures End One-Shots of most titles, but very few linked up at all to the main weekly and for the ones that did it wasn't anything significant.    I think it may still be a possibility since isn't DC dropping "New 52" post-Convergence?   How about plastic man? Could be like a rival Kirby or something. . .   So did anyone else notice similarities between Locus and Fifty Sue? Their powers seem very similar. . .  On a side note: The last time we see Sue she has entire DNA vault in her possession. So would it be possible at some point she decides to join back with Cadmus?   It did sort of have a set up for Justice League 3000. We get the explanation of how Cadmus is having DNA of most Superhumans.    Is Gemworld ever gonna have a new series?   **NEW 52 FUTURES END #48**   A decent setup of what is to come.   I want Babs and Jason to be a thing :/   This was my first Doctor Who Comic and I surprisingly enjoyed it.   **DOCTOR WHO 9TH DOCTOR#1**   There was an Anderson Psi-Division mini series IDW finished not too long ago. I really enjoyed that one.   That doesn't bother me one bit. I guess I will check it out.   Well the Vertigo Quarterly went for this much.   How is this series? I've been thinking of playing catch up.   I didn't see that coming regarding who Wells is/was. . .   Yea man, when you hit that Speed Force...it is like you become a part of something greater than yourself.   ...but Sandman links up with Lucifer. . .   2nd to last issue...can't wait to read it.   Gonna pick up issue 15 forward tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up!   I thought I read an article a year or so back stating they had to redesign the Batsuit somewhat because there was an issue of mobility. . .   I really enjoyed it and they did a good job character building. I lucked out and my LCS still had one copy left, but I am not sure I added to my pull list so I have to get there early tomorrow. By the looks of it you can still get it at IDW's website.   Evangelion was one of the first Anime I watched :3   I ended up getting Wonder Woman, Batgirl, Batwoman, and Supergirl from this sale. I enjoyed them all, but Batwoman had several 2 page spreads that at times made reading difficult.   Make sure to check out Lucifer. Also a good series.   * Batman Eternal #52  * Convergence #0  * Names #8  * New 52 Futures End #48  * Blood Queen vs Dracula #2  * Project Superpowers Blackcross #2  * Citizen of the Galaxy #2  * Neverboy #2  * Amazing Spiderman #17  * Cyclops #12  * Return of the Living Deadpool #3  * Spider-Gwen #3  * Uncanny Inhumans #0  * Doctor Who 9th Doctor #1  * Lady Death Apocalypse #3  * Puppet Master #1  It is gonna be an expensive week ╮(╯▽╰)╭   Umbral is a favorite by Image.  Citizen of the Galaxy by IDW #2 gets released this week and I really enjoyed the first issue.   Hoping Shadowman is a main player in this one.   When I found out that you can take college courses, while in high school, for credit towards both, I was a little pissed off. It would have saved not only time, but also money.   It is mostly single issues, but they are pretty fast in releasing volumes. As for the Scribd service, I am not sure how they have them on there.   I really enjoyed Rai, Eternal Warrior, and Shadowman. The latter have concluded, but Rai is ongoing. Honestly, I havent found a Valiant comic that I do not like yet and I've started most of them. Check out Scribd for a near complete collection of Valiant comics in digital form. Occasionally Valiant will have a Humble Bundle.   Just waiting until the Tula Lotay Art Book drops on April 1st. I really enjoyed the comics she has been a part of and would love to get something like this of hers.   Since I don't mind digital, Marvel Unlimited is an excellent resource. Even if it is single issues at a time.   At the end of 2013 Google play had a **massive** sale of N52 trades, which is actually what got me into comics. Like 3 or 4$ each. Just keep checking there each week to see if anything is on sale. One time they had The Walking Dead Compendium (Yes the huge collections) 1 and 2 for less than 10$ total.   Definitly the Death: Deluxe Edition. Excellent stories about Death of the Endless (Sandman Mythos). It is such a good deal for all it has.   Ohhhh this may explain why Supergirl Vol. 2 is not on the play store.   Is it on Netflix or Hulu yet?   I figure it is a 4:1 shot a BvS trailer (even just a teaser) debuts with the Avengers 2 movie. I mean would DC really give up such an oppurtinity to advertise on one of this year's biggest releases?   I sure wished I did, but I am one of those souls that must read every series from the beginning even tho I consider jumping in at N52 not a bad start. Considering I started with comics in December 2013, I don't think I will ever catch up.    I am trying to decide between Wonder Woman, Supergirl, and Batwoman. Might go ahead and do all three, but the other titles such as American Vampire and even Fables and Ghost are hard to choose from. I might just have to go by a pages/cost ratio to decide.  Either way, I **highly**  recommend the Death: Deluxe Edition. I have the physical copy and it is still a such an amazing deal on such a good story collection (even if you are completely new to Neil Gaiman's Sandman and the Endless Mythos) that I am considering buying it in digital form, which at just 1¢ a page is a massive steal.      Considering Image is way faster than DC/Marvel in getting their trades out after the last issue in it, I am not surprised.   I second Outcast. Apparently the series Weaveworld is pretty good, but have yet to read it despite picking up the first trade (good luck finding this one, it was released in the 90's).   Haven't really been following the tourney....but why no Valiant series? Is this just the Big 2 plus Image and Dark Horse?   This is beyond tragic. My LCS does 15% discount with free bags. I occasionally order from Midtown, but I like to keep going to mine because I like the people and enviroment.   Is your store at least going to attempt a digital retail conversion?   So much this. Half the time I forget about a spoiler by the time I get to reading a comic. Of course, half the time I don't get to the comic until Thursday or the following weekend.   I just read Vol. 6, which had Ramadan in it, last night and i really enjoyed it. The story was interesting and I sort of want to read into middle eastern lore after it. The fact Iraq was/is still a war zone is a humbling fact 20 years after this issue was published.   Have it on my pull list, but can't get until next week:(  Been loving it so far.   Like /u/bliffay said it originated from the Lil B fanbase. He is a somewhat underground rapper (I don't he is signed and is still independent) and has a huge presence on the internet. I remember he released a 100 track mixtape once for free. I don't really follow him tho. . .   Finally, it seems, Vertigo is getting consistent love.   I have about 5 issues to read of this series, been buying them, but havent read them yet. . .   I need to order this. I've been following this series via trades and have absolutely loved it.   It is on my pull list, but I can't pick it up until next week. I have to save my money for a Tula Lotay Art Book that is releasing April 1st and I suspect the shipping is gonna be a bitch. Enjoyed the first issue and can't wait until I can read this one.   I'm with you on this. Tyrese, I think would make a decent GL.   My LCS usually gets me the variant cover for titles that I have on my pull list. Occasionally, I will get them from Midtown comics and they will generally have them ready for pre-order.   Valiant relaunched a couple years back (they were around in the 90s) and practically all their titles are excellent. If you want comedy, Archer and Armstrong or Quantum and Woody are great series. If you like mythical/magical, Shadowman is decent. Eternal Warrior is about one of the most prominent characters in Valiant and is contained in two trades. Can never go wrong with X-O Manowar with it being pretty much Valiant's flagship title.   On current series not yet in trades: Ivar, Time Walker is fun and you don't need to know too much about the Valiant Universe, but it definitly will help make connections.   Keep an eye on Humble Bundles, I managed to get a good chunk of Valiant trades for not very much. Or perhaps check out Scribd since Valiant has a good amount of digital issues in this service.  Also /r/valiant   I think Shadowman should at least have one or two vols in the middle of Quantum and Woody so you have some background for the heist, even if it isnt a real crossover. . .   Wounded Rhymes, easily.   I love the free digital version. It lets me sell off issues I don't want so I can buy a couplw more.   Lykke Li features always brighten my day.   She's done a couple collaborations with rappers. One of my favorite is Gifted with Kanye and Santigold.   He was stuck holding a beam that would otherwise crush Aunt May.   Lykke Li easily.   What do LCS get from me putting down my Marvel Code redemptions at their store?   I rumble when I yawn and cant hear anything half the time.    Sadly so much so.   I highly recommend this series. The artwork is great and the story actually moves along at a good pace.   Sandman  XMen Apocalypse  Star Wars 7  AntMan   Suicide Squad  Fantastic Four  Avengers2  Deadpool  BvS  Green Lantern     Didnt Dwayne Johnson confirm he is Black Adam?   So much on the trade release. Image gets it right in this regard. I hate having to wait for the next DC trades after so long.   Free Digital copies with the purchase of physical copies.    Make more Netflix Series.  Live Action JLD.  Give Klarion a better run.  1 event maybe 2 a year.  Crossovers not nearly as much or as long.  Not make trades come out several ARCS after the fact. Kinda like how Image does what? Like a month after the last issue in a trade.  DC Unlimited.  Make Humble Bundles for at least older comics.  Make sure Elektra actually lasts for a decent run.  Make flagship issues longer with "shorts" in the middle. Like a Batcow short story in Batman.  More easter eggs and no more white borders. We need more art to look at while reading.  And an all New Crossover between the universes.    Ivar Timewalker is an excellent series that is only a couple issues in, if anyone is wanting something easy to jump into by Valiant.   I must have missed the news on a Bloodshot movie. Sounds awesome.   Save 20$ for their next humble bundle. Im still only about halfway through the ones they have had.   I imagine the gap will close, but once we get closer to the movie in December it will grow again.   This album is always first in my library whenever I get a new device. The first line is so unexpected and the album just continues to deliver.   This seems like a pitch for an excellent Dave Chappelle skit, if that show still existed.   I've been playing Pixel Heroes on android. All the nods to pop culture is entertaining.    The last issue was so hard to understand. The art is still pretty good.   I think it was the 07-08 school year.   If he was class of '14, I don't think he would have had the pleasure of knowing Moretta, sadly.   The integration was in 1955 and was the first in all of Dallas.   For the Non-Catholic/Secular Private schools we also have St. Mark's and Hockaday.   What would Mr. Moretta have to say about this?    Ursuline is also the Sister school of Jesuit.   If anyone can figure out the BB suit it'll be Tim.   This was my first thought. Of course I mostly DVR because I work at night, however, it is nice the days I dont work to watch the shows live.   Can we get a quality post tag?   But then again the title does say Unlimited Budget...  	103
 What is the point of posting this? Seems like kind of a dick thing to do. "Hey look at my dad, he's crazy." I find the posting of the video sadder than the actual video.    Can you just post the comment? I'm pretty sure the comment I see at the top isn't the one you're referring to    I felt the same way about my Canon equipment until I started trying to lug it everywhere:)    I got an X100 for this purpose (now have an XT-1 plus 27mm pancake lens). I carry it everywhere in my purse.  I shoot documentary, lifestyle, street, "every day" life type of stuff so I don't find it hard to fit it into my life at all. I also love road trips and I'm all over the place in the summer, so of course I take my camera with me.    Have you tried a casting call via model mayhem?   I feel that way about the 27 - perfect for me as far as not having to move when I put the camera up to my face. I wish it was at least a 1.4, 1.8 or even 2 though.  They are coming out with a 35 f/2, maybe they will one day do the same for the 23...   I have the XT-1, 18-55, 35 and 27 and am thinking about picking up the 23. I shoot at 23 a lot on the zoom, and the 27 is close enough and a great lens, but it's not a 1.4. I'm just wondering if I'll even use my 35 if I get the 23... it's such an awesome lens, but not as versatile. I find it a tad too tight in some situations. I could pop the 27 on there but I shoot at night a lot and 2.8 won't cut it.  I do use an adapted Sigma 24mm but it's a 2.8 and flares/loses contrast like crazy in strong light.   I wonder sometimes if I should just skip the 23 1.4 and get the new 16mm 1.4 that's coming out... seems like a better complement to the 35, but I don't really shoot that wide.   They might want to check the photographer's contract. It's very common these days for a pro to have a clause that they are the ONLY person taking photos at the wedding.   Totally agree.  I love dogs. I fucking HATE dog owners. And yeah, Richmond is definitely the worst in my experience. I live near Bryan Park and can't take my dog there because of all the assholes with off-leash dogs. My dog has been attacked in the past and does NOT react well to off-leash dogs. Through no fault of ours now we can't go to any parks because I don't know how she is going to react. Granted, I won't be liable if she flips shit on an off-leash dog, but I hate dog fights and I don't want to deal with that, or her getting hurt.   I hate dog owners.   Or other people could just control their dogs and put them on a leash, so leash aggression doesn't become an issue with off-leash dogs.  My dog is leash aggressive. It actually is very normal. Leashes really screw up normal dog-greeting behaviors. Not to mention they are leashed and can't get away. Imagine if you had a collar around your neck and a leash and a fellow human rushed up to you suddenly, out of nowhere, someone you didn't know. More than likely you are going to instantly be on the defensive. Hell WITHOUT a collar/leash, someone does that shit to me, they are probably getting punched.   You should be able to change that in the options and stretch it to 21 days.   Last year I started a self-portrait project. The whole point of it was to focus on my "imperfections" that I once hated and accept now that I'm in my 30's. Pointing out my flaws that make me unique - as opposed to the millions of selfies that are posted everyday where people only show their best side.   I've recently decided I want to learn how to use my flash off-camera finally, so I invested in some basic equipment. I live alone, no kids, so for the time being, my only test subject is me. So I'm coming up with more self-portrait ideas to figure out this whole lighting business.   I post these on my Flickr, Tumblr, and Facebook just like any other work I do. But I start to wonder if I'm just perpetuating the whole culture of narcissism that I hate. I'm a decent looking woman, not a model by any stretch but I can take a good photo of myself. I would hate to think that people might assume I'm just taking "selfies" because I'm obsessed with my looks... like I assume about most #selfies on Instagram or wherever.  I envy Vivian Maier...    I absolutely love this Kroger. The people watching is the best in town   It's a tough spot but at least you're trying to rehome her in a responsible way   Can't help (my dog is the same way unfortunately, though I'd love for her to have a buddy) but just wanted to say, you might want to look at getting a male dog as a companion for your other dog. Females can be, well, bitches to other females in the same house.   laughed out loud...   Exactly. You could say parents are selfish for wanting to bring their own children into the world when there are so many orphans out there.    I would rather be "selfish" and childless than selfish and have children. I see plenty of the latter and I grew up with it too. No thanks.   Absolutely no advice but I am having the same problem. I'm working on getting my skills up with self-portraits first.   " half the time I feel like a slimy creep, who's goal is just to ogle attractive women through the lens."  I'm confused by this comment. Are you saying that you think people think this about YOU, or that YOU think this about yourself?   There are a LOT of perverted guys out there who use cameras as an excuse to look at hot women naked. Just check out the Model Mayhem site. Assuming you are actually not one of these people, just act in a professional manner.   Link isn't working for me (could just be my work proxy).  Amazing photos coming out of this mess though. CNN has some good ones today too.   Pregnant much?  Two of my pregnant friends have mentioned mad cravings for pickles lately. Just going out on a limb here   I would hope so but it doesn't make much sense to me if it was sarcastic. Why go to the trouble of writing the note? Unless there is some back story here that's not being said.    That note seems extremely petty and stupid. I've had issues with neighbor kids but it was them screaming at the top of their lungs bloody murder. This doesn't seem extreme enough to warrant being an issue...   As I sit here trying to choose the $800-$1000 camera lens I'm going to buy next, once I max out my IRA for the year.        If you are just in it to share with the world, and don't really pay attention to feedback or restlessly track your vote counts, maybe you are getting what you need already.  Good point, thanks.    Would argue this should be classified as kids being jerks, not the animals. They were banging on the glass.       Of course you got downvoted, as I will with my other comment.   People need to mind their own damn business. If this lady had been seriously injured or killed when some sh*t went down in this SWAT situation, everyone would be up in arms trying to sue over that too. Mind your bizzness and get the hell out of the way of the police, especially during a SWAT situation  	29
 Same here. I really need the money to personal expenses and to help my mom, but I feel just like you. I had a job for a while and it was a really bad experience, not because of the job, it was just my anxiety. I quit and went to a psychiatrist, got meds but they didn't work, so I stopped. That was 2 years ago, I know I should looking for a job, but I just can't. I don't know how to live. I don't know why we are the way we are. Sometimes I think and get scared what would I do if I didn't have the support of my family. I really don't know.., I don't know what will be the end of this.   	1
 This sounds lame but its actually awesome: How does magic work?  In the film industry, we have to know exactly how to make people swallow things they know aren't true. How does time travel work? The flux capacitor. Nobody asks how the flux capacitor works. But bring up "unobtainium" which is essentially the same story MacGuffin and everybody cries foul.   It's super interesting to see what bullshit phlebotinum people will accept, and what people have so much trouble believing. For example, I'm working on a pilot about lawyers, and at great expense I had a civil tort attorney fact check the script. But audiences weren't buying...the truth.   Dude, I need this speech right now.   I'm doctoring a script right now by a guy who knew nothing about APD. And I'm having a hard time because...I know next to nothing about APD. Is it true that some feel remorse or is this just more manipulation? The story centers around a kid. I know that the character can't be technically diagnosed with APD until he's eighteen, but he's hurting animals and other kids. How would a school therapist respond? How would the conversation with the parents go? Is there a protocol?   Thanks in advance. Also, any personal stories that you can divulge without sacrificing someone's privacy would be extremely appreciated. Especially something related to an APD patient's parents.   I would give anything to give John Oliver a high five.   The slowest movie in the universe is called Jean de Florette. But it is so freaking worth it. If you can just make it through the literal five hours from the first movie until the last scene in the sequel, and I'm not sure you can without shooting yourself in the head, you will be happy you did.   That's an unfair comparison. I can turn my cell off or adjust the privacy settings. By design, if I subverted this theoretical GPS system I would be stealing.   Do you really want a company GPS tracking everywhere you go?   FADE IN on a dingy dive bar.  VO Guy: In a world where no famous person's slutty pictures are safe, one man will stand up against corruption.         LA. We once had a thriving public transport system. When the government put it up for auction, the car companies bought it up and tore it down. Now we all drive cars.  Not exactly creepy. But still a dark, dirty secret.   Best of luck with your production.   The DMV uses the income from registration to offset the expenditures of building new roads. If you gave registration power to a company, the physical process might move quicker, but you are guaranteed less roads. In fact, what would be the incentive to pay for any roads at all unless you could charge people in real time for every drive on every road? Are some roads of social value that cannot be determined by the market? Does this not necessarily give monopoly power to one company every time you want to drive home from work?    The post office, but that's no big secret. We keep it open not because it's more efficient than FedEx and even though we lose lots of money on the program, but because certain communications are an absolute right like the ability to pay your taxes. In that context, "better handled" makes the question ambiguous. The problem gets even more complicated when you ask it like this: If a business were to "handle" a service for the reasons that a government would, would it still be a business at all? Can a business be a business if its fiduciary duty is secondary?    Depends.  Subtler time dilation techniques are more often used for this cheat. Take for example moving from an interior to an exterior. Diagetically, the story could progress from night to sunrise, but it would be especially helpful to production/operations if you could start the day at sunset and continue into the night. So you just shoot the first shot early at sunset and take a wee break until the sun goes down for the next shot.  But it sounds like you are trying to do something a little bolder. First, one of the dead giveaways to playing in reverse is actually sound, but I imagine you would be severely under cranking so you could get the "sunrise" in real time so that wouldn't really be a problem. (I'm assuming that by WS you meant you're pointing directly at the sun like some sort of intro into Africa lol.) But a sunrise means nothing unless you can see the horizon, and that means necessarily seeing part of your environment. That might not be a problem if you're shooting something static like a desert or something, but cities have cars. For example, a more subtle screw up would be not to watch out for trees. When the wind blows through them, there's a natural falling motion that follows the acceleration due to gravity that won't translate into reverse.  One last thing, if your setting is more urban, watch out for lights. When the Sun goes down, lights come on. When the Sun is coming up, lights are already off.    As a cinematographer, we play on this illusion all the time. With the exception of direction (re: one is west, one is east) the two are indistinguishable, especially at the hour known as "golden time" where even directionality is obfuscated.   Long term. By most estimates short term is only about two minutes long.   But the powers that be are studying people with certain disorders that make them unable to encode data from short term to long term and interestingly they start to forget things long before the two minute mark.    I like the rebel EOS series, but they haven't really had anything new since the T3i had the fold out monitor, so go back a few generations and buy for a discount. But the rule of thumb is that if you have any sort of budget at all for cameras, invest in the glass instead of the body. And pick a side. I like Canon, but there are lots of options.   	15
 Good to hear some appreciation. Most of us owe a lot to our parents. But Most of do nothing but speak negatively about them.   I couldn't help myself either!    Part of a parent's role is to protect their children from disease.    why would anyone want to see a cartoon child character naked?    Genius!    why thank you :)    Get a job, move out.    How old were they?    I'm a Mum and if my kid was getting laid, as long as he's being responsible about then he'd get a thumbs up. His Dad would have a little 'lets make sure you're being careful talk. I'd be glad it happened under my roof and not in some alley way or behind the bike sheds!    My thoughts entirely.    Why were you so angry? He's experimenting, it's completely natural. A parent's job is to guide and educate their children. A discussion about it may have been the better option.  Punishing like that can encourage them to try other sneaky ways and taking the ds away will only encourage him to find something else!    Well it seems you are better of without them. Being gay isn't something you choose, it's who you are. If they cannot accept their own son, then they have no right to call themselves your parents. I hope life is much better for you now, after a rocky start. Try not to hold a grudge. Think about the future and don't hold on to the past. Learn from it and move on.  :)    That's what I have. There's a water garden and night garden too.   I have it on my pc and it auto saves and picks up exactly where I left off next time I play.   I recently got the game and have to agree, it's addictive. But sex is more fun. Shame my boyfriend redditor is too busy playing Star craft .. .   This is my fella and I dressed up as dead Bonnie   Clyde. What do you think?      You probably deserved it.    Do you really think it's appropriate to reply to someone with such disgusting language if you consider them to be a minor?   Actually MOST lizard's tails do not grow back, in fact most of them die a few hours after losing their tail.    That's funny, due to the fact that in one of your previous comments within another post-you called yourself a bi-sexual. I guess that means YOU don't exist.    Because you're a dehydrated spunk bubble!   I've had a similar encounter with visplaneoverflow and cannot understand her need to be so malicious. In response, she is nothing but a dehydrated spunk bubble.    You are nothing but a DEHYDRATED SPUNK BUBBLE.    {school age me}  Work harder-you can do it} {17-18 year old me}LEAVE HIM, before it's too late. If you stay you'll lose your future daughter.    Being a bitch is not a very nice trait either.    Jealousy is not a very nice trait.    Are you male and are the tits you're talking about man boobs?   They like being massaged with oil or moisturiser   Somebody tell how to make the link smaller lol!

I think pretty much every teenager, whether male or female does the same, of course using there personally preferred sprays. I have a gay friend {23 yrs old} who insists on wearing celebrity perfumes by Brittany Spears etc, but not just one. He uses at least 5 at once. He smells like a brothel! Everyone tells him, but he never listens. Bleugh.    No problem.  :)    Then get out there and make new girl friends. Widen your social circle and then you'll have friends to enjoy things with.  If you're THAT desperate to have a boyfriend, remember lads rarely get subtle hints. Be a little more  flirtatious in a verbal manner. Also . .buy the dude a drink. Men are sick n tired of having to buy us girlies drinks. He'll be pleasantly surprised. :)    You made me giggle. 'hung like a moose'   OUCH!    tut, you're so romantic!    My S.O now.  Sometimes I get scared. I don't know if I want this lifestyle yet. I'm only 24 with a mortgage/pets/3 year relationship/planning a baby./6 year old daughter.  But then you snuggle up to me and everything is okay. I hate it when you're angry. Not because you're aggressive or anything, I just like to see you happy. I do my best to make you happy, I don't always succeed though :(  Although I have my fears etc I know one thing is true. I LOVE YOU.   I've never met a man with such an honest heart. You're loyal, affectionate, you stand by me through thick and thin.   My daughter adores you and tells me more than she tells you lol. Although she thinks you should do more housework, hehe  My family think you're awesome and that makes me proud, as if I wasn't  already!   One day I guess we'll tie the knot. Even though I'm scared for the future, I still look forward to being oldies walking down the street holding hands and talking about how ridiculous religion is or about quantum physics lol.    I LOVE you more, I love you most, forever and always, your girl. xxx   p.s sorry guys-having a soppy moment, psst NO ONE TELL Redditor Mr Poletski about this! :P     To the ex {my first love}  You will never know the pain and suffering you have caused both our daughter and I. Why on earth a 23 year old man wanted custody of a little girl I had no idea. Now I do. Control. But what you don't seem to realise is, she sees it. She knows. Every time she's here she cries because she doesn't want to live with you or your rancid wife. She was nice when I first met her and I was happy that you had met someone who understood you and could show you the best way for our daughter.  But she changed and became snide like you. Her  brats do nothing but bully our little girl. How you live with yourself, I don't know. You even live on benefits because you're too lazy to work. Such a great role model for 5 children.   One day either in court or when she's old enough to choose with her feet, our little girl will be where she belongs. With her Mum. She'll have a Father figure who she'll be proud of. Not some scum bag Steve with no job who is both physically and verbally aggressive. You may have 'control' now of me and her, BUT you WILL lose it and you'll lose her. Rot in hell.    Get to a doctor. NOW!    you mean deodorant?    I concur!    Thank you. :)   Wear high heels. On toes or even better-drag it down the front of their shin. Trust me it fucking hurts and teaches them a lesson-if a bouncer gets involved tell him calmly that it happened accidently as he rammed into you. :)  I used to do it when I worked in clubs. As soon as I left the bar some chav was grabbing my bum, so I just back stepped and put my heels to good use. I ended up getting well known for it-after a few weeks no one dared touch my behind!    21!!!  You have AGGGGEEEESSSS  until you need to start worrying about being 'forever alone'.   'They' say that you shouldn't even be thinking of settling down until you're in your mid 30s.   Spend time with the girls and just have a laugh. Maybe even a few 1 night stands {just use protection} Have fun and enjoy life. I'm 24 and have a 6 year old daughter. I love her to bits but strongly regret not waiting until I was older and wiser.   I've missed out on so much like travelling/clubbing/working full time etc. Leave long term relationships for oldies and get out there and enjoy life :)    I grew up with a clinically depressed Father who suffers with panic attacks and loads of other stress related things. The situation that your daughter was put in, is something I experienced a lot. I also had to deal with my Mother venting about having to deal with it and how hard it is.   It's good for kids to know their parents ARE only human. However, it puts a lot of stress on her because the person who she depends on most suddenly isn't strong and that's scary.   I'm glad this is isolated and I hope for both yours and your daughter's sake, you make sure it doesn't happen again.   Pick your self up for her. By her witnessing you NOT allowing it to control your life and determined to beat it-you'll be showing that when there's an issue, you CAN pick yourself up and start again. A valuable life lesson.  Good Luck, be strong. :)   I grew up with a clinically depressed Father who suffers with panic attacks and loads of other stress related things.

Awesome film.    She lived to a grand age, be proud!  	59
  It's kind of strange, you said most of what has been going on in my head, and a lot of our situations are similar. It's really frustrating and you want it to all go away, but it won't. I don't know how to cope with my problems yet, so I can't give any advice, but one of the main problems I have is that I feel completely alone. So just to let you know, you are not alone, because there are other people who feel the same way  	1
 And that is why I am getting out of here. They deserve better, I deserve better, he deserves nothing from us.   Thank you. Every day I come back and read my posts, and every day it feels as though someone else must have written them. How could I have let him treat me like this?    I agree. And after my therapy session today, I can see that even more clearly now.   Oops, I kind of skipped over his body. Something else caught my eye :-)   I am lucky to have an M S and a Waitrose where we will be living. But I think realitically it will be Tescos and Asda for a while :-)  He really will be missing out on so much. Our youngest is only 4. More than likely he will not remember his Daddy living with us.   Thank you. I am trying to tell myself that, and I am trying to believe it.  But it is hard when I think of all the pain I am going to cause my babies.   I am consulting with a solicitor in the UK. I am also going to be applying for fulltime residency of the kids. This is pretty much the same as the old term full custody. He has already agreed to give me full custody so that he does not need to be constantly tracked down for counter signatories on everything when he is in different countries, but I am prepared to fight for this if he starts to make things hard.    Thank you. I was trying to find a way to explain how I felt and you have made it a lot easier.  I am trying to make sure that when we leave, I have enough money for myself and the kids for at least two months. My parents have already said they will make sure that I do not get into financial problems, and I have lists of resources I can acess as soon as I have a date to fly back.   Thankfully the company he is out here with are incredibly helpful and I known that if I contact them, they will at least pay for our flights back. I have asked him to contact them as he is obviously the employee and it is his responsibility to contact them with stuff like this, but he has not yet. If he has not done it by the end of the week, I will call the DC office myself. I know the guy there and I know he will do all he can to support me and the kids. I also found out that under UK law I am entitled to half his pensions savings to date. I really don't want to screw his pension up as it is not a lot anyway, but if he decides to start making things difficult I will take him for all he has.  Sorry for sounding harsh, but the emotional pain is getting to me tonight. Realizing what he has done, and how he is treating me, I am glad I see my therapist tomorrow, I certainly need to vent to someone,   I gave him the therapy ultimatum. He didn't turn up. That was the day he truly broke my heart because I realized that whereas I would do anything for him, he was not prepared to feel uncomfortable for an hour listening to advice that could help him save what he was loosing.  I suffer with a joint condition that causes me to tire easily and I am usually in pain. Despite this, I have never stopped him from doing anything. In the last two weeks I have had uncontrollable stomach pain. I have been dosed up on Percocet and antinausea pills. He told me it was probably stress and all in my head. My Dr diagnosed that it is either an inflammation of the lymph nodes in my stomach which make you feel like you have appendecitis, or old surgical scars are sticking together inside my abdomen, and pulling in nerves causing pain. I actually asked my Dr if it was all in my head, and he was shocked that someone had even thought to tell me that.  I think he just doesn't want the day to day responsibilities of being a husband and father. He wants everything to go his own way, on his own terms, and exactly when he wants it to happen.   Thank you. It really does feel as though I am 'waking up' to be able to see what he is doing.  I still feel conflicted, but because I never believed he was the kind of person to treat me like this. But I guess the further I take myself from the situation, the clearer things become and the more I can focus on the kids and my needs.   I agree. And if anyone else was in this situation I probably would have told them to get out a long time ago.  But time, love and percieved security do strange things to you.  Now I am waking up and taking back my life, and ensuring my kids are safe, loved and happy.   Thank you. I will.   Lol @ supermarkets. Is it wrong that I am looking forward to a nice roast dinner at my dads house?  It sucks in so many wats, you are quite right.   This is why I love you all here in this subreddit. I can write down my crazy thoughts and feelings, and no one tells me that I am being silly. No one puts me down for expressing myself. I can get my thoughts in order, and great advice and support at the same time.  I seriously doubt he will do much in the way of housekeeping. I honestly suspect he will just hire someone to come in and keep the place clean enough for him.  I have already told him that if he expects the kids to visit over here, then either I or a family member will be coming too. It is way to much to expect the kids to cope with something so big. And he will not cope with them resenting him if they do, or not listening to him etc.  And to be completely honest, he would still do his gaming, just like he does now. He will lego avengers or lego batman on the playstation and they will play that whilst he does his own thing. That is what he does when I keave them with him now.  How much of a fool am I for letting this go on for so long just because I love him?   Unfortunately not. I really need the time to ket the kids finish this term at school, they have worked so hard towards end of term treats and performances and I dont want to take that away too.   The time will also let me get two months of my own wages together for money to take back with me. I can also get on the list in that time for council housing. It takes time to do things properly and I am prepared for it to be incredibly hard.  If things get abusive here, I have somewhere to go with the kids to see out the time. If he cannot handle himself with dignity and respect, he can go stay in a motel.  Now that I am the ine making the decisions, I feel stronger in a way. I also know I have the support of friends here and in the UK.    The plans are coming along for us to go. I am arranging accomodation for me and the kids, temporary at first and living with family, but I am also trying to get us our own little place.  I have felt for a while that he sees them as my kids for the most part. They are his kids when he wants something, or they are being easy to look after. But given that they are 4 and 7, a boy and a girl, they are rarely easy to look after :-)  He wants all the glory with none of the work.   So many people have said he wants his cake.   I agree. But when you have done everything to keep someone happy for 14 years, it is hard to stop yourself from always saying yes.  The more I write here, the more I see that he is manipulating me emotionally. And it hurts so much that someone I love with all my heart, someone who promised to love me forever, would do that.  I know that the kids and I deserve so much better.  I just need the sanity of the people here on r/relationships to see me through until I can get back to the UK. Hopefully all will be arranged for us to go in the next 12/14 weeks. It seems like a long time, but there is a fair amount to arrange, and I really want the kids to beable to finish their school terms here. My daughter has a school play at the end on term and she has been rehearsing for it since Xmas. I can't take that away from her too.   I understand your question.  Yes, things keep on changing. One day he is loving and kind, the next he is ignorant and mean.  One day he wants us to stay together and try to love me again, the next he won't even look at me.  He is playing with my emotions I know and I am trying to stay strong,  Writing in the subreddit gives me a kind of clarity. I go back and read my posts. I read the things he has said and done and it kind of makes me more resolute in my beliefs. It reminds me why I am making these plans for a future without him.  He has been stringing me along on a hope that he will suddenly fall in love with me again. But the more it happens, the more I realize that he is manipulating me.  Please don't hate me for still holding on to hope. Hope is failing now. But sometimes it is easier to reach out and embrace that shred of hope, just so that I can pretend to feel loved for a little while.  I am trying to put up and emotional wall between us now. If I don't let him in, he can't hurt me as much, can he?   Thank you. It is hard trying to figure things out. Thankfully I have r/relationships to give me good advice and a sounding board to try and get my thoughts in order.  I also have a friend here who has made herself available pretty much 24/7 to let me rant and rave, just trying to figure what a 'normal' relationship would be like.   I am seeing my therapist tomorrow. She usually lets me get my emotions and anger out and then we work on building my self confidence so that I feel comfortable in my descisions,  It would really help if he would accept that talking to someone other than me would help. But he refuses to talk to friends, family, a counsellor.  I cannot fix him anymore. I have to put my kids and myself first. Even if it hurts.   I am so scared that by leaving him I will be making a huge mistake. I am scared of everything to be honest.   Everytime I write an update I end up realizing what I am writing. I see what he is doing. But he has me doubting my own mind so much that I am questioning my own mind and actions. Am I overreacting? Am I reading what he says the wrong way? Am I expecting too much or the wrong things from him? And so it goes on.  I will be leaving in 12/14 weeks, once all the arrangements are in place. Even though it hurts like hell, I am starting to see that I deserve more than this. The kids deserve more than this. It just kills me to have to do it.   Exactly. He has no idea what he wants, but will not accept help to work on this. He wants everything and nothing at the same time, and it is everyone elses fault.

It has now been three and a half weeks since he intially told me that he no longer loved me.  We have talked and talked, but I am becoming more and more confused by his attitude toward me, the kids, the future.  He is swinging between being very open emotionally, talking things through in great detail, what he feels about us moving back to the UK. Then the next day, he is grumpy, ignoring me, neglecting his time with the kids, flaking out on plans to do things with the kids. One day he cannot do enough to help out, the next I am having to ask him to come and say goodnight to the kids because he can't be bothered to come upstairs.  He dedecates most of his time to playing on his PC and working out. Just saying that makes me realize that he is still such an adolescent. I don't think he has ever lost the mentality that he is his own person and he can do whatever he likes. Yes, that was true, but I believe that when you have children, you have to have a balance in your life towards what you give to your family, and what you give to yourself.  He told me the other day, when he was in a bad mood, that he feels that he has to support me too much (an example was having to come and get me when my car broke down) and because of my health problems he feels he has to look after me too much. He told me that I was living my life like I was in the 1950's and that men aren't expected to look after women like that anymore.  He seems to have neglected the fact that I work full time, look after the kids for 75% of the time on my own, he goes out at least twice a week for social stuff, and that tomorrow I am having to run him around because his car broke down! Yes I do have health issues, but I have had them since we met, and they are actually much better now than when we first got married!  I had to apologise to him earlier this week, because tomorrow I need him to miss his games session after work because I have therapy and I cannot get anyone else to have the kids (it is around dinner time, so kind of hard to arrange pick up and drop off).   I feel that I should not be having to apologize for going to a session that was the only one left this week when I booked it two weeks ago. I asked my therapist to reshedule, but her calendar is full and she really wanted to see me this week. He has know about the appt since I made it, but at no point did he offer to come home to have the kids.  He keeps asking me to stay. But not as a couple, as two people living in the same house who have kids together, but no relationship. He keeps telling me how much better it would be for me and the kids to stay. He says I could save up money from my job before moving back, the kids wouldn't have to move etc. And the more he says it, the more I feel like I am the bad guy here, taking the kids away from everything they know and love. Yes, I could do that. But is it worth the pain?  I keep feeling so confused about what is the right thing to do. But how can I stay? If I could be sure that everything would be ok and stable for the kids, then I would. But on days like today, I can see that this is not a healthy environment for me or the kids.  I am starting to feel that he is manipulating me to make me stay. To make me feel guilty for hurting the kids by moving. To get rid of his guilt over the choices he has made. To make me the bad guy making the descisions.  I really feel he is forcing my hand here. And it is really starting to affect my ability to judge things properly. I no longer am sure that I can make the best decision for the kids. What if I am making the wrong choice and ruining my kids lives because of this?  My friend was over today and saw for herself how he can make me feel bad for wanting something for me and the kids.  I asked him if he had arranged a lift for the morning (he is prone to forget stuff like that) and he told me no, he would take my car 'if that was ok' and just do a half day to get home. I told him that I had plans for the morning with the kids, and he told me that he 'only needs it for half a day' . He just had no concept that he would be making me and the kids stay home when I had promised to take them out. I told him I would drive him in and out, and then he started demanding to know what time I would pick him up as he 'had to look after the kids for me'. My friend, who knows the situation, was just shocked to see first hand how he has no idea about how his actions affect others.  He says that a lot. That he is doing stuff 'for me'. Not doing it because he is their dad, but as a favour. So that I owe him.    **TL;DR** Am I being guilt tripped into staying by a man who tells me he doesn't love me?   **edit** I meant to add that because I saw my OBGYN last week and told her the situation, she ran a full STD panel on me, just in case. Everything came back negative, so I have that going for me, which is nice.   Good luck and I hope you find yourself able to give us a positive update soon xxx   All I can think of tonight are his poor little daughters. To be on such a high seeing their Dad inducted into the HoF, then to loose him so suddenly just three days later.   Heartbreaking.   Thanks. Having between two and four kids to look after this week is certainly keeping me moving, even if I am supposed to be resting!   No, he has not always been like this. I guess reflecting on our life together, he has always gone through phases of being a very involved and loving father and partner, and then phases of making me feel as though the kids and I are a burden to him.  He would be moody, distant, grumpy with the kids. But never to this extreme.   Now (since telling me it is over) he is being loving, more communicative, more attentive to the kids. And I think that it is because he is realizing what he is loosing.  But I have to be strong. I keep coming back here and looking at how he has treated me and the kids. How he has tried to make me feel guilty for ending the marriage.  I am torn between wanting to belive he cares for me, and thinking that this is all just a way for him to try and persuade me to stay, just so he doesn't get his feelings hurt, and to relieve himself of the guilt of leaving us.  It is incredibly hard for me because I am a person that will always try to see the good in people. I want to believe there is goodness and truth in this world. But I know that sometimes, even though it hurts, I have to accept that people lie to me for their own personal gain, regardless of my own feelings.   I know :-(  I have to keep coming back to this thread and re-reading what I have written. He keeps asking me to stay. I am losing my best friend and my husband.   But I can't go back to that way of life again. Even if he promises it can be different.  But it is so hard when my heart just wants to be loved.   Thank you   Thank you. Unfortunately contact is going to be happening whether we like it or not, until I am able to move back to the UK. The crazy part is, that we have not talked like this, or been so close in a long time. If only he had been able to talk to me about how he was feeling a long time ago, maybe we could have got through this :-(   I do wish I could stay off my feet, but it is Spring Break and the kids are so excited to do the stuff we have been planning for weeks. I have modified days out though so that I can get more rest and time to sit down. Thankfully their attention spans aren't that long, so we usually end up going out for half a day and then coming home to play.   Thank you. Having come from a broken home, I have felt first hand what it is like to live with bitter and twisted parents, and I have sworn never to do this to my own kids.   Thank you. It is just so good to hear my Dr confirm that it is not all in my head. That I am genuinely in pain and there is actually nothing I can do about it.   Thank you, I am looking into using my dads solicitor back in the UK, just to be sure everything is written down and legal.  I know how the kids will probably feel, and that is making me feel ten times worse. My parents divorced when I was 10, admittedly in far less friendly ways than I am going through now.   Thank you.   Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21za91/i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has_just_ended/[1]   First update:http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/229eea/update_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has/  First, I want to thank off you you who gave me such support and advice on my previous posts.  We have talked more since agreeing to separate than we probably have in the last two years. Proper, intentional conversations, talking about our emotions, how we are doing etc.  He wants me to stay here, even though he doesn't love me. I have told him that I cannot do that. It is not fair on any of us. He understands this, and as others have told me, it is like he wants to have his cake and eat it too.  I am making progress in planning for the kids and my futures. He has agreed to pretty much cover any and all costs with the separation, divorce, moving, setting up a new home etc. I will be sure to make sure his commitments are recorded legally to ensure I am not screwed over in a few months.  He has been very emotional the last few days. I think the enormity of the situation has hit him and he has realised what he is going to loose.  He still says he does not love me, but also does not want to loose me as I am his best friends.  It is incredibly emotionally draining and I am very tired of everything at the moment.  I saw my Dr today as a follow up to my hospital visit last week. I asked him if this pain I am suffering could be purely from stress. He said that the stress is not helping, but that he is sure it is not the cause of it. He feels that I either have mesenteric adenitis which is an inflammation and/or infection of the lymph nodes in the stomach which causes appendicitis like pain and can last for two weeks, or I may have abdominal adhesions that have grown since my last surgery. Because the mesenteric adentis is essentially self healing, I have to wait five days, and if the pain has not improved at all, he will be asking for me to undergo a laparoscopy to try to identify if there are adhesions, and to remove the cyst on my left ovary.  I am glad that I am not imagining this pain, as I had started to feel that way. My husband even suggested that it was all in my head last week, after I came out of the hospital.  Any advice on what I should be planning for would be appreciated. I will be most likely moving myself and the kids back to the UK in about 10/12 weeks.  Thank you.   **TL;DR**: My husband has no idea what he is doing, or what he wants.   He has my user name and he knows that I have posted here.   I doubt he will read it though as he already know what people will be saying about him.  He is even too scared to tell his family. He is trying to avoid making any decisions about the future, so I am being proactive and basically researching everything I can for my benfit, and then telling him what is going to happen.  I will not let him have this power any longer. Even though I am falling apart emotionally, I have to be strong for my kids, to make sure I can give them the most loving, supportive home I can through all of this.   Thank you   Genuinely scared the hell out of me!   True :-)   He has such a lovely speaking voice, very gentle for such a huge guy.   Thank you   Thank you   Thank you.    Thank you   I certainly wouldn't be relying on them, I just know that they would not allow him to skip out on his duty as a parent.  We have to provide a written statement of our intentions to the courts for the divorce to be processed and he would be held to this from then on.    Thank you. I know I deserve better, but years of serving everyone elses needs and wants makes it very hard to break free. But I will.   I am getting everything in writing. I think his family would basically disown him if he tried to not provide.    I am making copies of anything he is messaging me. Is that ok? I will also be sure to get a written agreement too. I think his company have someone here who can help us with it.   I have been posting in r/relationships for advice, and had a post in r/anxiety on a throwaway account three weeks ago (mythrowayayisaokay).  The relationships post explaining most stuff is here - http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/229eea/update_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has/ It is long and has a few previous post links in there too.  Basically my husband told me our marriage of nine years and relationship of 14 years is over as of this morning,  I have been waiting for him to make this decision for three weeks, dealing with him being nasty, cold, over-attentive in that time, whilst he tried to work out what he wanted.  I have also been in and out of the Drs and the ER with crippling stomach and side pains that are, as yet, undiagnosed cause. I am guessing stress might be high up on the list of causes.  I have spent the morning occupying myself with factual matters. Looking at how to get a divorce in the UK, how to find accomodation for myself and the kids, what I am going to need financially, finding a counselling service for children for when we move out etc.  I know I am doing this to block all the emotions and mental anguish out, and I am scared what is going to happen when I stop thinking. I am scared that I am going to break down completely. I am scared that the pain issues I am suffering with are going to get worse. I am actually scared that I am going to loose my mind over this.   I have to stay strong for my children. I have to stay strong for me. But I just don't know how.  I have an appt with my therapist on Thursday and I emailed her today to confirm the aoot and to let her know about todays developments. I am seeing my Dr on Monday and will talk to him about this then.  I have emailed my parents to tell them what has happened too. I have told them that I am not ready to speak to the face to face (well, on the phone and skype) yet. They are being very supportive.  I just feel like I am balancing in the edge of a massive pit of despair. And I am so scared I am going to fall in soon.  I can feel the anxiety and depression waiting for me to let my guard down. Ready to take over everything.   He is already agreeing to basically pay for anything and everythihg the kids need. He is also looking at how to send me back to the UK debt free. He will also be paying for all of our living costs until I can find work.  As much as I hate what he is doing to us, I cannot find it in me yet to hate him. And for the sake of the kids and all the interactions we will need to have through the years, I would rather try to keep this as amicable as possible.   I usually go with 'Ohshitwhatthehellareyoudoingdownthere' rather than 'Cleo' :-)   Thank you   Thanks   Thank you. Unfortunately he cannot move out as the house we are in is tied to his job. We have agreed to wait it out 10/12 weeks here until I move back to the UK.    My four year old suggests Miaow-Miaow, my seven year old says Fluffy. I think she should be called Sapphire after those lovely eyes.   Thank you   Thank you.    Thankfull all healthcare here is fully covered by his company.   Thank you   Thank you   The problem is that I do all of that work to please him, and I know this is all kids of wrong. I guess I am still so desparate for this to work that I am not considering the pain I am going through by staying, rather than facing the pain of leaving.   I guess so :-(   I took my pain meds, not him. He is not **that** much of an asshat :-)   Therapy - check. I am seeing a therapist to work on my issues including self worth.  Lawyer - I need to look into how to do this, how to pay for one etc.  Support group - I have my family, but they are back in the UK, I have some friends here that are being great.   I know if I was watching this happen to someone else, I would be telling them exactly what you are telling me. Why is it so hard to accept what is going on, and not be in denial?   Thank you.  All of our family are in the UK, we moved to the US two years ago for his job. I have spoken to my side of the family and they are all willing to support us if I move back with the kids. I just really want the kids to be able to finish their school term here, they only have 10 weeks left.  My friends here are aware of what is going on, but one has just flown back to the UK, one is in DC and the other close friend is very supportive, but has her hands full with her own family.  I just need to get my head around what is going on. I know I cannot continue living like this.   Thank you.  He is basically an extra child at times. And having two small kids anyway really doesn't make things any easier.  I am still in pain this morning, but he is still way to drunk to be taking care of the kids. If this pain continues, I am going to have to call a friend to have the kids and to drive me to the ER again. I don't know what the ER would be able to do, but at least there I can be monitored etc. Maybe they can find what is causing the pain.   I know. It is just so hard not to want things to turn out differently. We have been together for so long, and this has happened so out of the blue, that I think I am still in such denial that it could be over.   I really wanted to just leave him there last night, but I was worried about him being so drunk and out of it. Also I didn't want the kids finding him passed out in vomit, with vomit all over the house too.  I agree that I really need to put myself first, but it is very hard to do that when you are also considering the kids. I think if I was closer (in distance) to my family, then I would have left him, or at least moved us out already.   Just one of the things I am working on with my therapist - self worth issues.    Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21za91/i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has_just_ended/  So, it has been three days since my last post, and three weeks since he told me that he didn't think he loved me anymore.  Things have been strained to say the least. I am still in a lot of physical pain, but as yet, no one can identify where it is coming from. The next course of action is to check my gallbladder.  He has been very distant since I was taken in to the ER by my OBGYN. When I got out of hospital I was given instructions for bed rest and no exertion, but as soon as I got home, I had to sort out the kids lunches for school the following day, put the kids to bed, get dinner etc.   On Thursday, his car broke down, so I had to go and collect him from work. He then told me he had invited his works team around to our house on Friday evening (the next day) for a games and drinking night. We have had these nights before, most people bring their kids as we have a big house and the kids can run around and play, watch tv. One out of the couples is DD and as I rarely drink, I am usually another DD?  Anyway, I spent most of Friday getting the house ready, not too much, but wiping down and making sure the kids toys were away. I also had to shop for a leaving present for my youngest childs teacher whos last day it was.  He came home early from work to cook for his friends, I sorted the kids out with dinner and helped him out.  We had a good evening, I tried my best not to show that anything is wrong as he has not told anyone about what is going on at home. The last guests left just after midnight and I tidied up a little, then came up to bed to take my pain meds and to get some sleep. He was very drunk and layed down in the spare room. I asked if he was sleeping in the there and he started asking me why I was being so friendly with him tonight. I told him I was just trying to be nice and to act normally. He asked why I hadn't been that close to him the night before. I reminded him that I had tried to sit with him to watch tv, but he was being an ass and wouldn't move to let me sit near him, so I had gone to bed early that night.  Anyway, he basically passed out on the bed, so I got him a glass of water, covered him up, and came to bed. I took my pain meds and antisickness meds, both which make me drowsy, and fell asleep for a while. I woke about 45 mins later to hear him throwing up. He had made it to the guest bathroom, but had thrown up everywhere. I have a bit of a vomiting issue, but I then stripped the bed, grabbed his clothes and hosed them down and got it all in the wash. Cleaned the matress, remade the bed, cleaned the carpets too. Moved his water into the bathroom and put a bowl next to him too. He was really emotional and crying, I tried to console him and tell him he was ok, but he told me to go away. I made sure he was safe and left him in there. I went back in after 20 mins and he was asleep on the floor in there. I cleaned the toilet bowl, basin and his arms, tried to wake him to get him to the spare room,but he was too out of it for me to do anything. I have made sure he is in his side, plenty of room around him etc. Not the first time I have done this with him. I have put a blanket over him and he can move when he wants.   So now, I am wide awake, in pain, not able to take any more meds for two hours, and thoroghly confused about what the hell I am supposed to do.   He complains that I show him affection, he complains if I leave him alone. He wants to be free of responsibility, but can't even look after himself when it comes down to it.  Most of all I am wondering why the hell I have just spent two hours cleaning up after a man who says he no longer loves me, and isn't sure he wants to be with me any more.  TLDR: What the hell is going on here??      **EDIT** So, it is over. He woke up this morning, still drunk. He asked what had happened last night and his only concern was that he might have done something embarrasing in front of his friends.  He came in to our bedroom about half an hour ago and basically blamed me for all his bad feelings against me, why he doesn't love me is all my fault. He was spoiling for a fight but I wouldn't give it to him.  He was completely horrible, and told me that the doctors can't find anything wrong with me so why am I in pain.  I told him that if he felt like that then why didn't he just say it was over. And he did. And then had another go at me telling me that I should go ahead and post it all on Facebook and in here as I had been talking about him anyway (I had told him from the start that I was posting here, and he knows my reddit name so nothing was hidden - I even gave him my throwaway name).  He has lost that last bit of respect I still had for him. I am crushed and devestated, but I have my answer now.   I only had the t/v as it was at my OBGNY office. I had the same issue as you last time, when I was layed down all looked normal, when I stood up, everything shifted and the ovary went into tortion. They only worked it out when they did the laproscopy!   Thank you.    I would have said yes to your last question, but time, pain and not enough sleep is making me doubt everything now. What was real and what was him faking it all?   Thank you. What made me most concerned and realizing how ill I actually feel, was when I didn't want a cup of tea!   Thank you   That is how I thought we were, and still how I feel about him. I am wondering if he ever did care at all...  	74
 I know we all circle jerk in here about the benefits but what are some of the downsides.  In my experience...  -increased aggression -Higher chance of making questionable decisions with women  ^^ what I mean is that sometimes I fap and it saves me from calling up a chick that I would later regret sleeping with.    Me too.  I've always thought that nofap was extreme.  But then again I have a high sex drive so if you put a good looking female in front of me I'm going to have no problems getting aroused for her.  I think the people who really need help and need to withdraw a bit are the teens who masturbate like 5 times a day.  That's just crazy.  I might go a few times a week if that.   So do you think it's smart to just buy a laptop with a touchscreen and Windows 8 (assuming the price is the same) then?  I've just heard a lot of bad things about Windows 8... how it was a failure and MS sees it like it saw Vista.  HP's recent announcement that they're going back to Windows 7 on some of their new models had me worried as well.  I'm also hoping these touchscreens aren't a gimmick.  I want my laptop to last a while.   I guess the main thing is that I'm not looking for a touchscreen computer.  Rather than pay extra for that, I'm looking to buy older and upgrade to today's specs. If possible.   I have no interest in Windows 8 at the moment.  I might as well get an older laptop that I can upgrade the hd and RAM on then.  Would prefer portability and battery life over everything else.     **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**   * Country of purchase:  USA   * Budget range:  $1200   * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Portable... mostly for school, with a lot of time working in libraries and airports   * Screen size preference:  13.3"  (15" is too big to work on in a plane)   * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):  Windows 7   * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):  None   * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):  None   * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):  self   * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility):  None.

Nice story though.   I notice he uses at some crime scenes and not at others. Where can I find more info about the yarn and it's purpose as well?   I'm gonna try this.  Enjoy the gold!   I don't hate you at all. I made this post for feedback and insight from others.  Thanks you for your kind words.  They weren't harsh at all.   lol. Actually this is effective.    if she gives vague answers   Vague answers are all I've ever gotten.  :(  Thanks for the advice. I'll be fine.  I'm certain.   Yeah, I used to have the same gripe.  Especially when he was staking out the Mexican gang and literally parked in front of their house.  But then I realized it would be a horrible camera angle to show Dexter 3 blocks away.     So you're telling me that there's a higher chance of a Vince Masouka in Miami than a Dexter Morgan??  http://www.lolwut.com/layout/lolwut.jpg    is there anything i should be aware of heading into everyone's least favorite season?  lolwut?  Just watch it.  Only thing you need to be aware of (and it seems you already are) is that the quality is so-so.  So temper your expectations.   Thanks!   We were together for over 5 years and long distance plus trust issues put the nail in the coffin.  Honestly the reasons don't even matter at this point.  I've typed essays about it on the internet before.  I have employed a pretty decent post-breakup strategy over the years.  I hope I didn't give the impression that I'm sulking around everyday depressed about this. lol.  Today was just that random moment where it REALLY gets to me.  It happens about once every two months.     I've considered therapy.  How do you go about finding a good one?  We were together for 6 years.  Have had on/off communication over the last two years.  If I knew for a fact reconciliation wasn't a possibility, I would easily get over it.  The problem is that she keeps dangling hope out there.  Like I said, most of the time I'm completely fine.  But today was a down moment.   I honestly wouldn't wish this pain on anybody.  I have my good days and my bad days.  Trust me, my good days far outweigh the bad... But here I am at 7AM on a Sunday, awaken from 4 hours of sleep after a night of partying and a dream about her.  It was so real, but alas we are not back together.  We haven't even talked in awhile.  I really hate my scumbag brain.   ---    **tl;dr:  It's two paragraphs cmon!  If that's still too much just read the title.   Nobody ever replies in there.   The newer smartphones have incredible battery life.  I went from having to charge my phone every 6 hours to once a day.  I love it.   Try to find balance OP.  Remember, you can't get that time with your kids back later.   Why would you girl want to see this? Seems like a red flag   Well to be fair he did shake Roddy White's hand after he was cooked for a TD in last year's playoffs.  I get why people don't like Sherman, but to me he just seems like a trash talker who can also take it if need be.  Unfortunately, there haven't been too many opportunities where people have shut him up ON the field.   Just bought them.  Thanks.   Just curious. I've been binge watching on Netflix and my brother said to stop watching after season 4.  I just watched the first episode of season 5.  Should I quit now and save myself future anger and headaches?     Congrats but sounds like you replaced one addiction with another.   I need to see more!   I'm watching Dexter on Xbox 360 and it does it for me.  I noticed it the other night.   Thanks for this breakdown.  I think I had a different view of what I perceived to be a sociopath.  Someone who simply isn't driven by the emotions most people feel.  This could lead them to commit crimes or just go about their lives never feeling connected to anybody.  But reading these comments has taught me a lot about both sociopaths (which I agree are not accurately defined) and stoics.   I don't think all sociopaths harm others.   so·ci·o·path  ˈsōsēōˌpaTH/    1. a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.  I could imagine some sociopaths simply not caring about the world around them yet not going out of their way to harm others as well.   I wasn't even trolling tho.  I thought about it while watching Dexter.  I have now been educated thanks to asking the question and creating this thread.   They both seem to be emotionally detached from the events around them and accept things for what they are.   Nice.  I wouldn't change anything honestly.   Ooh... I like the second one.   I always feel obligated to say, "No problem." or "It's cool." so I don't seem petty.  But what should I say if I don't forgive the person?   75% of these replies are from non-teachers.   I live in the US and so does he.   Nice, too bad I'm not in the UK!   Why is there a plethora of cats failing at jumping?  Is this a thing?   I gotta save this.  I actually busted out laughing.   The feelings you're feeling right now are temporary.  This is purely your internal battle with your ego.  You've already admitted that you didn't really want him and the new girl is better.  If you met someone tomorrow to absolve your jealousy/loneliness I promise you wouldn't care about this anymore.     But what if you don't have a mission?    As someone who has had to work a job where I stood up on my feet all day, I don't think standing is that good for you either.  I was in more pain then than I am now.   Semi-related... What about stuff like Red vs. Blue?  They sold dvds and made money using Bungie's game and engine.   A pic with your eyes covered would probably help you get the best feedback possible.   /r/nonmonogamy/   Good idea.  She has a bunch of Penzey's spices in her house already.  Maybe a gift card so I don't buy something she already has?      I disagree that the 25th ranked school and 75th are the same.  Cmon now.  I'd rather do online or part-time at a top 25 school than full-time at #75  	50
 Music and reading. And a bit of writing from time to time. Writing helps me get things off my chest, music helps me explore the ways I'm feeling, and reading helps me articulate my thoughts.   Right off the bat, no matter how much a job pays, if it feels it isn't worth it, it isn't. The pay is not worth the damage it does to you. I'd like to tell you, so you can further understand that there are others who endure the same hell, day in and day out, 40 hours a week. For me, it's at minimum wage. I am currently seeking another job, but until then, I'm stuck at this one.  I work in customer service at a gas-station. Between two companies, I've been doing this for almost a decade. I have 40 hours scheduled, hours I'm given suck. Take this week I'm currently working -  Sat - 6a-2.5p Sun - 9a-4.5p Mon - 9a-4p Tues - 10p-6am Wed -10p-6am Thurs/Fri off.  An hour shy of the 40, but because I've already been having trouble sleeping this last week, it's the two over-nights that I'm truly dreading. Because of the area I'm working in, those two nights will be spent split between my duties, and keeping tabs on the heroine addicts that hang out in the general vicinity of my station.  This is a job I hate. I've had a lot of interesting experiences throughout these years, and some very scary situations. Some examples of what I've gone through, just trying to do my job.  One night at my old station (company I worked for before this current one), I was getting ready to break down my register and go home. I was working the closing shift, so it was getting close to 2am. Doorbell chimes, and I look up - straight into the barrel of a gun. I was lucky - all he wanted was the money, so as soon as I handed it over, he was gone. That stayed with me for quite some time.  Several weeks ago, at the station I'm working at, we had a small car-fire out at one of our pumps. When I looked outside, all I could see was smoke. I freaked - but my immediate thought was 'No way I'm dying here, not for this company, not for this shitty pay'. So I hit the 'all-stop' button (turning off all the gas-pumps), grabbed the fire extinguisher, and did what I had to do. That was quite stressful.  Something that happens to me practically everyday at work stems from a policy my company has in place - everyone gets ID'ed for tobacco/alcohol, regardless of age or frequency of visits (we're a bit of a corner store for a lot of people, so we see some people multiple times a day). That was two years ago - and to this day, I still have people coming in and getting blatantly hostile with me over one simple question; "May I see your ID?". Because of that one damn question, I've been told to fuck off and die, I've been called a fascist asshole, I've been called a skinny little faggot, I've been told I'm going to be hunted down and murdered, and I've been told that people like me are soulless assholes.  And all I'm thinking here is, "I'm just trying to do my job". I hate it. I absolutely hate it. When I was at my worst, I'd get home and drink like a fish. I wasn't happy until I finished a 6-pack myself.  And I'm still stuck there. But I don't intend to be stuck there forever. Now, I mentioned I worked for two companies - I did manage to get out of that hostile environment, and into a -very- good paying government job. I ended up walking away from that job (for a lot of reasons), regardless of the fact that it paid well, and ended up back at a gas-station. Every day is SSDD; Same Shit, Different Day. Everyday. I lose track of what day it is, what week it is, much like you do! And it's hell. But I've finally reached a point where I'm done taking it.  I'd suggest you consider what I'm doing as an option for yourself - while you're working this job, when you do get home, do yourself a favor and start looking for another one. They're out there, all you have to do is look. There are websites dedicated to just that alone, for various lines of employment. Put together a resume, because that right there gives you a chance to put down your best attributes and personal strengths - right there, on paper, for you to actually visualize. Then go out there, get some job interviews lined up, and give it your all! Because you're worth more than the 40-hour-grindstone! We all are! I hope this helps, even if in some small way.    I'd still like to encourage you to speak to a doctor - and be up-front with them that you are -not- interested in medications. There are other ways to manage your depression without meds. Writing helped me for the longest time before I got lazy about it. Music helped me for the longest time before I lost interest in it. Drawing helped me in a lot of ways, but it's not something I do often because I honestly think I'm horrible at it - but my point is, there are other ways to help, without medications. But go and talk to a doctor and see what other options they may have to offer. Glad I could help in some small way. And whenever you feel like you're down in a dark place, come back here and post again. It may take hours, but I honestly believe that, if not me, someone else will notice and come to your aid.   That's just it - I didn't pick my strongest attribute. I'm good at interacting with people in person, regardless of what may be going on in my head. And I do not consider myself a people person. Interaction in person, for me, is draining. But because I'm good at interacting with people, I excel at customer service. And I -hate- working customer service - at least where I'm doing it now.   Do it! Do it, do it, do it! For the longest time, I kept the darkest of my thoughts and emotions to myself. This sub has changed that in a lot of ways. Not only have I been opening up to other people, but other people have opened up to me, and it's helped - not only them, but myself.  And for everyone else looking for friends - post! Post what you're going through, post your experiences, and see where it goes from there. A lot of people here are willing to help you through the storm to the safety of a calm port. And I'm glad Digital now counts himself among them!    Good - going to /PTSD is a step in a good direction, and I hope someone there can help you. And I truly hope that this storm passes for you. Good luck, and take care.   Don't ever feel like you're annoying anyone with how you feel and what you're thinking - especially when you bring it here. I'm with Seeing_Grey here, the anonymity does wonders. And I can relate to how you feel - I've had a few friends I've brought my darkest thoughts to, and they've done one of two things to me; they didn't care (or care as much as I thought they would) or even worse, they tried to turn it into a competition. It isn't. What you've learned from these friends who can't support you is that you can't trust them to have your best interests in mind. So I would like to encourage you to come to us, here in /r/depression, and open up. You're safe, you're not annoying anyone, and you can learn a lot from not only the responses you get to your situation, but by lurking the sub to see what other people have been through. You're not alone in this. None of us are. That's what drew, at least me, here. The feeling that I can open up with what I've been through, and that there are people who are at least willing to listen. Again - you're not alone. At the very least, when you feel isolated from your friends, you still have us. We may be as anonymous as you, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.   I'd like to add this - it's not your fault. It's not like you took your depression, baked it into a cake and fed it to your brother. You didn't do this to him. What your mother said is harsh - and /r/raisedbynarcissists may be a good sub to explore other peoples stories of what they went through, and bringing your thoughts and emotions here for when you're feeling down because of your depression.   Thirded.  	9
 fear of body fat. i was obese all throughout childhood/ teenage years. lost all the weight once i started on the track team and fighting competitively. thank god i kept growing so i dont have any of that extra skin. but yeah mentally/ emotionally still scarred from the names i was called. if i ever get over 15% body fat i think id be flirting with depression again   no eating. you can just put a blanket under and if you use a condom its fine.    I used to be really into the "hip" christians. Jefferson Bethke, Chris Quilala, Mark Driscoll even. Now I look at them and I still think they are genuinely good people. I can't help but think like, man, these people have convinced themselves of such deep religious fanaticism and even made it a cool/hip thing.    funny. got taught sex ed in PE in elementary school, but we talked about it a lot at church as like one of the most terrible sins ever   LOOOOOL   i would say mind reading. i think at a certain point, if you could read everyones minds, youd just get depressed. lot of things better left unsaid/ unknown   that last sentence was pretty damn poetic. .gna steal that. creds to u in advance   horny as fuck   love it   https://www.harriscomm.com/equipment/alarm-clocks/desktop-clocks.html   hey its really great that you're trying to get in better shape, but what exactly do you mean by "fit by that deadline" do you mean losing a certain amount of lbs? running a mile in a certain amount of time? dont look for a quick fix. think about it this way. you're undoing 21 years of unhealthy living, so it's not going to happen in just 3 months.   id say start with running a mile everyday. or if thats too much 1/2 mile. and for food, you dont have to micromanage, but learn about the caloric contents of your food (how many calories, how many grams of fat, carbs, proteins) eat more vegetables, clean lean meats (if your not vegetarian), healthy fats from nuts, avocado or fish, and avoid processed sugar/ refined carbs.  that should be plenty to get started   internet   porn   or what if sex is consensual for one and rape for the other hahaha   we are all going to hell. this is hilarious though     	16
 catching a lizard during recess and keeping it in my pencil box because I wanted a new pet   for the record, I do not own the original photo. I would give credit to the owner if I could find out who they are. there are so many versions of this picture out there and there are so many different people claiming that it is their own artwork, that its hard to tell which one is the true original and who the artist really is.         	4
 You're a fucking moron.   In a rational world, this would be an obvious answer.   But these people are in as much fear for their child's current life as much as the next, and truly believe that the next world is a better place.   Would you risk a million bucks a week forever if you ask for 5 to grab a sandwich now? That's how they think.   Shit happens. I agree that its fucked up, but you can't trample on someone's religion.    You can't force your religion/ values on someone else.   Sometimes it sucks, but most of the time its the tits. (Legality of caffeine, alcohol, gaybuttstuff, burkas, and so on.)   Why can't we all just hate each other silently and alone?    I've been referring to myself as 'Snow Samoan' recently.   Am Aleut.   :C    Says the field nigga. /s  I don't get checks. Would be sweet as fuck though.   Apparently since I haven't met a black woman I would consider dating versus having met and dated white women, I am racist.  FFS what kind of logic is that?     ITT: People too young to understand what aging is.   Its what I've found that I enjoy. Its cheaper than drinking, more interesting that walking etc, and I can go see new places, new things you wouldn't see normally. Its also the combination of driving and music that let's me slow down my thoughts enough to sort them out.   There's always just a lot going on.   And yes, I've tried other thinks like you've suggested.  Its about as rational as liking one soda or another. Just personal taste.   I love driving around at night to clear my head.

Processed food is fine as long as you don't eat too much. I.E. More than 2000 calories a day.   In general, typically...? I would hold their weight the same.   People think refined foods are worse because it is easier to over indulge. Refined sugar is no more dangerous *in the appropriate amount* than say pure cane or beet sugar.

It'll taste different, but it is not one the whole more or less healthy than, say, organic alternatives.   And then there is anti-science bullshit.

Drinking and using is a symptom of something bigger. You can't just stop drinking or getting high and expect your problems to dissapear. YOU are the problem.   Been sober for 3, trying to get sober since I was 15. I don't know if you're in AA/NA or anything like that, but it helped me, along with inpatient treatment. (6th times a charm.) surrounding myself with good people and staying active in recovery keeps me pretty happy.  When I felt like you're feeling, I was dry as shit. I know you didn't ask, but I just thought I'd put it out there. Sponsor, steps, and you know the rest.   2 years sober, long story short I totally thought I knew where this was going. Now....well now I feel like I need to take a shower. Or 5   Okay. I've typed and deleted and typed and deleted because I have no idea what to say to this. no fucking words to describe how much this fucked me up. Can't even enjoy my hot Cheetos and shit.    Oh my god you guys are the best people    I can't lie to him. I just don't want to be here anymore.   I was in Brazil for two months visiting family. I wish I hadnt. My boyfriend is a photographer and I saw on his page he took a few pictures of some girl. She is our friends ex girlfriend, who's a heroin addict and put her through the wringer.  My boyfriend decided to introduce her to my group of friends, as she doesn't have monday because she's from a different part of the state. She's been around while I've been gone. I fought with my boyfriend when I saw those pictures, not knowing who she was. I found out, and I was over it. I come home, excited to be back (it wasn't the easiest trip...family is tough) and the next two days she comes over. She works with him, and another mutual friend and my head took me to the darkest places. Do they have something? Have I been replaced? In short, my mind won't stop, even though I KNOW none of this is true, and I feel like a psycho Fucking girlfriend and paranoid and sick and twisted and I want to relapse (2 years sober, alcoholic/addict) and I want to disappear. I hate admitting I have these insecurities, but I do. She's intimidated by me, and I talked to her, letting her know she's more than welcome here. To be honest, I wish she hadn't come into my life or anyone else's. I'm being selfish, I'm being horrible and I hate myself for being this person. I wish I had never existed. I hate myself and this is all so Stupid and it sounds so Stupid but it already hurts enough to write down my fears. It's been downplayed. I don't think he would do anything to me. I know he didn't, but there is a voice in my head telling me that I'm alone, and everyone is hiding something from me.   I'm in AA, I have resources, but I'd just rather hang myself in my closet and Dissapear.   EDIT: not monday, I meant she doesn't have many friends.   I'm not that creative! As long as my entire body is under the covers, I'm safe. Magic blankets? Who knows, only monsters under the bed will tell.   I'm on /r/nosleep every night while lying in bed and 99% of the time I end up under the covers.  	17
 Really the only thing he's useful for against Troll right now is that FG pierces BKB. But the downside is that Troll usually uses BKB at the very beginning of a fight when his team's disables are all up, so good luck getting the full channel off.   First off learn how to farm with strong carries. Troll, PA, AM are three good examples right now. If you learn how to play these heroes well, and can hit 5 cs/min on a consistent basis, your MMR will go up by a thousand. Under 3k, the carry that has the most farm wins. While your team is busy team fighting across the map after the 8 minute mark, you should focus on getting as much farm as possible with the space they are creating for you. Ignore them when they call gg at 15 minutes because you're not participating in fights. They're stupid, and that's why they're under 2k.   Get your farm and only participate in fights if the fight is under YOUR tower, allowing you to tp in instantly and get a couple clean up kills if you are able. The biggest mistake people make in sub 3k is fighting before their hero A.) has enough farm or B.) hits their peak. It is a complete waste of time to go into a fight, die, and lose time you could be farming another big item.   Saw the other post about what heroes have never been in the meta, and it got me wondering what actually defines a hero as being "in the meta"?   Even if Eul's gets nerfed I doubt we'll see less Lina. It'll still be a setup for her stun and her ultimate is one of the strongest in the game, especially with Aghs.   Go into the draft with a game plan. "Counterpick the enemy heroes" is a terrible plan and you shouldn't do it. You might be left with a team that has no synergy, horrid lanes or that has varying different timings that could screw you over. However, counter picks should still be utilized. Did they first pick a Batrider and VS fits into your game plan? Get it.   Your players need to have 3-4 heroes that they can comfortably play in case a hero gets banned or a counter has already been picked. If they don't, then they need to learn them or they're a liability to your team.  Watch pro commentaries on drafts. They'll explain why the teams drafted the way they did, and it can give you great insight.        They mostly play sniper troll jugg and sf  Then they need to expand their hero pool. That's their problem that they can only play the easiest (aside from SF) and currently strongest heroes in the game. Not yours.   I've actually experimented with Blink instead of Force. If you have the chance to Astral yourself, the cooldown on blink means you can blink out of a self-Astral. Also makes initiating with Astral far more reliable.  The downside is you lose a bit of early damage and the utility.   Support players would have instant games.   Carry players would have 15 minute queues.   Mids would be 30.   Knowing when to gank is huge. If you're 3.6k you're probably past the 8 minute "gg mid no gank" calls, but getting a Haste rune on someone like TA or Storm should be an easy 1 or 2 kills for your side lane and you should take advantage of that.   Never really got into the hero too much, but I know the basics.   I know it's always a good idea to leave a Remnant behind you for an escape if you get ganked while farming. However, if I go to throw another on a hero to initiate a gank on them and use Activate, it goes to the one that's far away before the one I just threw.  Is it a mechanic that it will always go in the order that you send them or is there some way I could ignore the first I threw to only move to the second?   Part of getting better is learning how to win with stupid teammates and against equally stupid opponents. You'll figure it out.   Someone made a thread yesterday tracking the MMR between his calibration matches. The first 4-5 games bounced between a 500 or so MMR range.   PL just got a rework. He doesn't need another.   I say we should nerf Radiance.  Radiance isn't core on PL any more.     Essentially  I thought I remembered seeing pro's in the area between 5 and 5.5k so that's why I did that. But really I don't think the difference between 5 and 6k is large enough to warrant making a separate bracket for 5-6k. Considering there are only ~600 people actually above 6k if I remember correctly.   0-1k = How did you even turn on your computer  1-2k = You're not good  2-3k = Average  3-4k = Getting better  4-5k = You're probably top 10%  5k+ = Essentially pro status   It doesn't already do that? Why not?    We can't mute you during the draft stage  That needs to be changed.   At least make sure your trolling reply is something that could be real.  0/10   That'd be cool.   I got queued last night with 5 solo on my team, 1 solo and 2 stacks of 2 on the enemy team. Hardly seems fair, but my team still won so I can't complain.   People will buy the arcanas and still play the heroes.  Duh?   Isn't the point of Hex to be an instant disable? Increasing the cast time would defeat the entire purpose.    I tried my best to carry   but he let us down as bristle.   I was Spectre.  5-14 sub-200 cs in a 46 minute game  K.     Either shut him down so hard in the first 15 minutes that he isn't a threat (he really isn't that great if underleveled and underfarmed), kite the shit out of him in team fights with Force Staffs/Slows or get BKB-piercing disables (Fiend's Grip, Primal Roar, Black Hole) and focus him down immediately.   God I love this video.   Someone probably made fun of him at school and he took his anger and humiliation out on anonymous people on the internet.    The fourth game I also played sniper with even better performance and I got nice team too and I won the game.  So what happened to your MMR after the 4th game then   It's the same concept as rushing Linkens on Weaver. It's not exactly what you want to get first, but it's not the worst thing you could buy.   I dig Beastmaster, would be a cool buff.   Also to anyone reading, Primal Roar shits on Troll Warlord. Hang back, wait for his BKB/Ult, Blink in and Roar him and sick your boar(s) on him. Works best when his BKB gets to a lower duration but you get the point.   So when I was rising from 2.6k-3.2k over the past month or so, I obviously didn't win every game. But there were times where I'd win 5,6,7 in a row. Fuckin awesome right? Ez 200 MMR. Well then I noticed something. Instead of being almost equivalent to the average MMR of the server (which most people are at 3k-ish), after a winning streak I was actually 50-100 MMR behind the average of the server. This happened after every streak of 4 or more wins (which there were a few of). So after a winning streak the system was actually putting me up against theoretically more difficult opponents (even though the difference between 3.0k and 3.1k is negligible) than what my supposed skill level was, because I was winning.  Just found it strange.        PL is a better Troll Counter.  Absolutely.   Would it actually be worth it to build a BF on Troll if you're counter picked by a PL? It would screw up his entire item progression and timings though.   If Sniper goes MoM before BKB, he's never going to get the chance to build Skadi or MKB. Have you seen a PA crit on a MoM'd Sniper? It's fun stuff. A naked Phase/MoM Sniper is ridiculously squishy. One crit from a Treads/Aquila/PMS PA that early on is over half of Sniper's health. And since there's no bkb, and also since the cast range on Phantom Strike is greater than Sniper's attack range, PA shouldn't have a huge problem getting in.  If Sniper goes BKB before MoM where's his damage coming from? He doesn't have the Skadi slow yet, nor the True Strike from MKB, nor the attack speed from MoM. He has protection, sure, but PA can easily kite out BKB charges since the Snipers doing next to no damage.  And when they are finally slotted, like in the average teamfight you mentioned, the PA wouldn't just try to run to or away from the Sniper. If Sniper BKBs before you get the jump, you Phantom Strike out to an ally or creep and wait out his BKB. If your team is initiating, you should really be initiating a first instance of lockdown ON the Sniper, since the Sniper is the highest value target, leaving room for PA then to BKB and jump in. If the Sniper isn't jumped, imo, it's not a good enough initiation to commit to. Wait out the 5-10 seconds, and if the opportunity is still there, the Sniper is dead.     might as well say "you can win by playing Troll"  Troll spamming is the easiest MMR I've ever gotten, yet it amazes me that people actually can't play him correctly. Honestly the hardest thing about Troll is having the game sense to know when to switch between Melee/Ranged axes depending on situations. PSA: If you're chasing someone down, switch to melee for extra move speed, switch to ranged to attack, switch back to melee to chase, switch to ranged to attack (hoping to proc a Maim or just get the Skadi slow on them), etc. until you catch them if your whirling axes aren't available.   Trolls super easy. If you can't win with Troll, you don't deserve to go up in MMR.   How would you build the Sniper then?    I went from 1.8k to 3.2k in about a year. Over time you'll steadily get better.    their names   some notable people  I love how specific you are.   I really want to see Oracle added to CM before TI5.   There are way too many variables and what ifs.  Essentially the answer is whoever gets the jump first.   Force Boots, Soul Ring, Euls would be every support's first 3 purchases.    could be  Not saying it is, but considering I have no idea what the average reddit MMR is, I wouldn't be surprised if it were high.  That's interesting though.    Congratulations, you picked two heroes out of the possible 108 others that have a spell immunity piercing disable. Magnus, Bane, Enigma, Beastmaster, LC are ones too.  But what if your team is Sniper, Skywrath, Phantom Lancer, Tidehunter, Witch Doctor? No BKB piercing disables there, unless PL builds Abyssal.  Also a good PA will wait until the Axe or Clock initiated elsewhere to jump the Sniper.    Why would you let him reach you to being with? stun him.  Then he buys a Blink Dagger or BKB.   Unless he comes charging at you with bkb, then run.  His W gives a Slow debuff if it lands. Two core items on him are SnY (Maim chance is a Slow) and Skadi (built in Slow). You don't run from this hero. Kiting him requires teamwork and coordination or heroes with escape mechanisms.   He's the best 1v1 fighter there is due to ridiculous attack speed steroids, and a built in bash that pierces spell immunity. Capable of reaching near max move speed with Phase activated. He's also arguably the best pusher in the game right now due to his Ultimate giving attack speed to his entire team on only a 30 second cooldown. One of the best STR gains per level for Agi carries as well. Oh and he has a Slow and a Blind. Being able to switch between melee and ranged doesn't have any downsides. He can solo Roshan after level 11 and HotD (minute 12-15 depending on how your laning phase went) and he's strong at every stage of the game.       A PA and Sniper battle with equal farm should always be won by the PA. The Aghs upgrade does damage, yes, but Abyssal is core on PA to lock down the Sniper and the only way someone will stop you is with a BKB piercing disable. A team won't always have one of those.   I've played from 1.8k-3.2k in my time of Dota 2. While these elements are still prevalent in 3k, this describes 2k far more accurately at least for US East.   Spectre is a really weak laner in a meta that favors strong laners. Naga is the same way. Tusk is situational. Spectre and Naga don't pressure Sniper in the laning phase, which is when he needs to be shut down.    they will just blow you up as soon as you blink to sniper  Ever heard of a BKB?     You described 2k way more than 3k.   You could have too many different outcomes depending on item builds and RNG for an answer.   If you had said SF has item, item, item and Storm has item, item, item it'd be a bit easier.   Out of almost 11 million unique players this last month, you honestly believe that there are 5.5 million players above 3k MMR?    Reddit  Yeah, slightly over 200,000 people (out of 11,000,000) that are known for being completely biased and forgetting that we're not even 2% of the community.   The average Reddit MMR could be 3.5k, I'd agree with that.   some notable people  Got a link?  A year and a half ago, the 90th percentile was 3k with 5 million players. 500,000 above 3k. So now you're saying that out of the 6 million new players since then (assuming the original 5 million are counted in the current 11 million), 5 million of them are above the skill level that would have put them essentially at pro status only a year and a half ago?   K.    3.5k (the norm)  The average player is more like 2.2k. Considering the dotabuff cutoff for "High Skill" is 3.2k, it wouldn't make sense at all for the average player to be above that.   If you're the best player on the team, you need to play a hero that allows for the most solo kill potential. You absolutely cannot rely on your teammates at that MMR. You need to be able to do it all yourself, and the easiest way to do that is by playing a high impact carry. For example, I guarantee at that level people can't grasp the concept of not stacking stuns. At higher levels it happens on accident, but it's very common to see 2 or more stuns thrown on a hero within a seconds time span, instead of chaining them for longer duration.   The easiest way to win is by getting more last hits than the enemy. If their carry has 10 cs at minute ten and you have 50, ignoring any kills, towers or runes you have 5x more networth than them. That's around a 2000 gold advantage. Keep farming until minute 20 at the same pace, you now have 100 cs at minute 20, where they might only have, hell probably 25. In that time span they went from 500cs gold to 1250. You went from 2500 to 5000. Couple that with some solo kills and making sure you don't die, and after minute 20 you should easily be strong enough that sub 2k coordination will not be enough to kill you. Easy win.   TL;DR: Farming efficiency is what separates low skill players from high skill players. Learn how to farm, and you'll easily jump to 3k.   Congrats?   Prefacing this by saying I'm talking about pubs, not pro scene.  It's even more unpopular now that 5 core strats are arguably more viable than 1 carry 2 cores 2 supports. Supports do their best work in the first 15 minutes. Ganking mid, pulling the safe lane, early wards/courier, securing your cores' farm while also hindering the enemies', etc.  However in this patch, getting your team an early advantage is actually bad, because each kill the enemy team will inevitably get will give them more and more bonus gold due to the comeback mechanics. The fastest game I've ever won was as Troll a week or so ago. We got megas sub 20 minutes after I destroyed their mid and the enemy team gave up. Other than that, games are going at least 35. That's 35 minutes for a team's 5 carries to farm, defend high ground AND get EXTRA gold from kills due to your advantage.   Also factor in that carries get to farm for the big flashy items, do the most damage and are more easily recognizable for "glory" per se, whereas in pubs supports are seen as ward bitches, you can see why they're the minority.   Mute whoever is being toxic. Engaging in a flame war will do nothing but take focus away from your play, hindering your ability to either stay in the lead or make a comeback. If they're retarded/Peruvian, there's nothing you can do about it.  Stick to pings and chat wheel. Only type if it's to discuss strategy, and even then keep it brief and to the point.    Lina is picked a ton. Not on Lion/Venge status, but she is also capable of filling two different roles.   Yeah no shit. Sniper has easy counters and first picking it allows them to pick any and all of them.   What game?   The problem in team fights though is that once the RP is dropped, those heroes are dead. Omni would be good but if you're playing against a good Magnus he'll either wait out the GA or make sure to get Omni in the RP.   As far as countering it though, obviously you're not going to outfarm the Troll. Do you just split push around it really hard? Limiting the Mag's impact will work a little bit but he doesn't even need to max Skewer. 4-4-1-1 at level 10 and your Troll is golden.   Something I've been wondering recently. From what I've seen in the pro scene, Trolls almost always banned. But in the games he gets first picked, why isn't Magnus an immediate second pick from the same team? I know he doesn't NEED Magnus like CK essentially needs a wisp for example, but that combo seems way too strong to pass up.  To add to that, Trolls also almost always picked in pubs. If you're the Troll picker, try and convince someone to Magnus. Even if they suck at RP'ing, the Empower flash farm opportunity will skyrocket you. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1403320471  Or, if Troll isn't your thing, learn Magnus. The hero doesn't need a ton of farm for this combo to work, just a Bottle, Blink and Mana Boots. Your main goal is just to steroid your carry. After your core items take it upon yourself to do the Ancient stacks, since relying on supports to do it is generally not going to happen. And if you're a good Magnus that can land 2-3 man RPs consistently, it doesn't matter if your Troll is bad (Manta and SnY on the same hero, way to go). Put Empower on him and it's a triple kill in 5 attacks. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1400871942  I'm only a lowly 3k but the top game is a new record GPM for me. I'd wager to say this is currently actually stronger than Drow/Visage and far easier to execute. I don't think I've lost with this combo yet, playing either the Troll or Magnus. But eventually I'm going to play against it, I can already feel it. So, how do you counter it?    Have you tried turning it off and back on?   Disruptor, Batrider or Enigma in my opinion.   Just make sure to spend it before you die. I have two buttons on the side of my mouse, one is hotkeyed for mic and one is for quick buy. There's nothing worse than finally having enough gold for that last Ultimate Orb and getting ganked and not being able to complete your item for the next 2-4 minutes.  Assuming you won't need to buyback, anyway.   Only have it on Auto Cast when you're positive you won't get jumped (i.e. when he already jumped someone else.).    immediate after radiance  Yeah that's stupid.    Mid should gank given the correct opportunity. It's not their JOB to gank per se, but if there's a Haste rune and a side lane wave is pushed to your tower, that's an opportunity to gank and you should take advantage of it.  Also, everyone on reddit knows this. You're preaching to the choir.     I love OD. One thing you may have forgotten to mention was that his Q adds Pure damage. This is extremely powerful against Agi carries (and Axe) because the damage isn't reduced by their armor.   I experimented a bit with Blink instead of Force Staff. The synergy between your W and and cooldown on Blink means it's a far better personal escape mechanism than Force Staff. You do however lose the utility of Forcing teammates and a bit of damage. This also means that if you save W for personal defense, you can usually easily escape from the middle of a team fight to go to the back lines and keep pumping out damage. Also great for BlinkAstral to initiate on someone.   They are usually heroes that depend more on levels for effectiveness rather than farm. Usually initiators.    End the game before Spectre is farmed enough to be able to carry.    You didn't need BF because he should have been Empowering you.     Scale it to 1/2/2/3 charges per level.    Your build sucks. Aghs BF Jug isn't good. Yeah the argument is there for the RP combo, but look at their heroes. Magnus is best against a heavy melee lineup, of which they only have 1 (not counting Timber and Tree because they shouldn't be right clicking you anyway.) You didn't need BF because he should have been Empowering you.  Your money would have been far better spent on MKB/Abyssal.   Yo mamas so fat that she only buys Tangos.    No. Her agi gain is half of Troll's and has half his base armor at level 16. Considering she needs PhaseAghsDaedalusForce/Blink before she's truly strong, that's zero armor items. She'll melt to any real carry if she's locked down.   I've had no problems playing against WR as Troll. All you have to do is either buy MKB or kite through her evasion and then bash lock her.    Gyro is a terrible mid. His attack range is garbage, and if you're maxing Missile you're forgoing abilities that help you farm, of which he needs a lot of to be effective.   He'll lose to any mid with good harass that runs a bottle. Kunkka, SF, Sniper, TA, QoP are 5 that come to mind instantly.    (i was playing meepo)  Against a hero whose biggest strength is single target physical damage. There's your first problem.   (in my opinion she's equal to troll)  Troll provides an attack speed steroid to his entire team as well as a built in bash, aoe blind and aoe slow. WR provides skill shot lockdown, a magic nuke, evasion/maxMS/slow provided you run over them and an attack speed steroid to herself and only on a single target. Troll farms faster and is a much lower skill cap.   Looking at the dotabuff, if you had jumped her you shouldn't have had a problem killing her. If she jumped you, you're dead. That's how the matchup works. Just because you lost to it doesn't mean it's overpowered.    It's "not a fun and friendly atmosphere" he said.  Welcome to online gaming.   Spectre, Clock, SB, Axe, Nyx, PA, LC, BH kinda.   Basically anyone that can get in his face and hold him there while dealing out heavy damage.   If you're taking racks and you've won a team fight, it's usually best to back off if the enemy buys back. Unless you're massively ahead or still healthy enough to fight, it's super bad to get killed by heroes that bought back.      The only part of Dazzle that gets countered by Axe is Shallow Grave. Actually, if you look at his 3 other skills, Dazzle is more of a counter to Axe. Shadow Wave is great for a heal bomb if Axe calls teammates and creeps. Weave helps your team against his physical damage and can reduce his armor. Poison Touch is meh. But since his core items include Force, Euls, Medallion, maybe a Mek, he's not bad at all.   I'd make them confused, disarming them and making their hero move randomly for 2/3/4 seconds.    I've done this. It's great.   Just randomed Magnus, essentially commanded someone to get Troll. Other picks were Sniper, Omni and LC jungle. Proceeded to roflstomp them for 40 minutes.  lolthismeta   From what I've experienced, it's better to have lackluster supports rather than a lackluster carry.    easy counters  Oracle, Bane and Winter Wyvern are the first 3 that come to mind.   Oracle is an extremely high skill cap hero. If you don't know how to play Oracle, you're probably going to do way more harm than good. Bane is in the same boat but less so. Misuse of Nightmare can easily lose you a teamfight, and without proper positioning and game sense your FG can be immediately interrupted. Winter Wyvern is okay but still takes a rather large amount of game sense.  It's way harder to play those heroes as counters to Troll or Jug than it is to play a Troll or Jug. Aghs Lina and QoP are good because of their Pure Damage Ultimates but otherwise aren't much.  And as for Sniper, he's nowhere near as overpowered as people like to claim. Shrapnel early on is insanely strong but he's still basically a glass cannon. Get in his face and he melts.   Magnus, Troll, Drow, Visage, VS.  You can sack Magnus in the offlane because his main contribution to this lineup is Empowering the Troll for flash farming ancient stacks and just the threat of an RP.   "GG MID ITS MINUTE 8 NO GANK PLZ REPORT"     I calibrated in Oct '13 at 1.8k. Peaked over 3k once about a year later, but fell back down to 2.2k.  Recalibrated on another account in February at 2.6k, hovering between 3 and 3.2k currently. Just takes time.   Yes, in which case you should play supports that don't lack that potential. The best way to improve your MMR is to get good at high impact heroes. While some people can improve by playing support, it's generally easier to get really good at snowball mids or carries that farm quickly and have great kill potential.      What's sad is that 5 carry strats are arguably more viable than 1 hard carry, 2 cores and 2 supports.   You lose the first 20 minutes super hard but turtle for another 20 because pushing high ground is stupidly difficult and reap the comeback mechanics to push down one lane and end the game. I'd like to see statistics for this patch, if possible, for how many teams actually lost the game even though they took all of the outer towers first (excluding games with a Troll because he can take 3 lanes of racks in 90 seconds).  It's stupid.      Ventrilo is the bomb.com  Yeah if DDOS is such a problem because of Skype, I don't see why people are still using Skype. Do tourny rules make you use Skype?   Is it worth still picking up a casual Yasha for farming speed or is that what the MoM is for?   I know it probably varies depending on the game, but what is the current best item progression for a Dusa? I usually take her mid, and I run RoAPhaseYashaSkadiMantaBfly. Not really sure where to go after that, I'm assuming MKB or Daedalus?   Also, what should the skill build look like? I only keep 1 point in her ult after 6, and max Snake and Mana Shield first. Should I forgo Snake for stats?   Ty.   Skadi is the fotm item for sure, next to MoM. It's a great pickup on almost every carry.  Rapier should only be bought as your last ditch effort to win. I had to buy one last night as Medusa because we were 2 racks down. Hid it from the enemy team, they tried to push for the 3rd racks, we team wiped them and marched down to win the game. I actually ended up losing it to their Mirana but we'd already taken megas and they couldn't push out.   Wait for the next patch.  In all seriousness nothing in the first 20 minutes of the game really matters. Even if you stomp all 3 lanes, if the enemy team has any semblance of high ground defense you're going to lose your entire advantage if they win a team fight while you try to take racks.   The best thing to do in this patch is gear for late game no matter what. Unless you have someone like a Troll that can go from 3 racks to 0 in 2 minutes, you're going to have to play to win around the 40 minute mark.    I got a 729 gpm game on AM last night after I'd been drinking. Considering I'm 3-10 on the hero on this account, and my only wins have been while drunk, I think I know who to stick to after a few beers.   It's not a hard hero to play necessarily, but it's a lot harder to play well than Troll or Sniper. Misuse of Nightmare can royally fuck over a team fight. Knowing when to use Fiends Grip takes a lot of game sense too, because you either need to wait out all of the other team's disables or position yourself perfectly to avoid it being immediately interrupted.   Not saying he's the highest skill cap or anything, but he takes a lot of game knowledge to play well.    theres a reason hes first pick pro material.  Uh, maybe a couple patches ago. I haven't seen a first pick Lycan in months.  inb4 THIS ONE TEAM DID IT THIS ONE TIME LIKE A WEEK AGO   Troll can easily outrun Razor with SnY/Phase. In late game he can also murder the Razor before too much damage is stolen. Really isn't that good of a counter.   Juggernaut. I don't know why, but for some reason I just can't win games if I play him.   The problem is that the counters to Jug, Troll and Sniper (all extremely easy heroes to play) are heroes that have pretty high skill caps. (Winter Wyvern, Orcale, Bane, for example).  Any retard can pick Troll and win a game in 30 minutes. But if you give that same person an Oracle they're going to royally fuck up. That is what sucks about this current meta. The strongest heroes are the easiest to play.   No.    I've played hundreds of games against Pudge and I still royally suck against him.  Dude all you have to do is watch where he moves and put creeps between yourself and the Pudge. If you don't see him, drop a shrapnel on the high ground.   Pudge mid only beats bad Snipers. If you're a bad Sniper, your biggest issue is positioning.   Uh, SKs burrow has atrocious range, if you see WK running at you to stun you should just back up. If you're don't, you're bad.  Axe is one of the top 3 offlaners at the moment, but your range should be fine unless they tower dive you.   Boots first and maxing Take Aim solves these problems, by the way.   If you're getting hit by stuns you're playing it wrong. If you're not mid, max Shrap and Take Aim before Headshot. There's no way the enemy should get to you. If they do, you're doing it wrong.    This is 2k so we're both going to misposition every once in a while.  That's not really an excuse. Sniper shits on Pudge mid. Use Shrapnel for vision on his high ground if you have to, but you should definitely be able to position yourself well enough to avoid hooks if you're a half decent player.   Tri lanes are great for people who know how to run tri lanes. It took me a long time of captaining CM in 2k to realize that at the time I, nor any of my teammates, actually knew how to properly run a tri lane.   Sub 3k, if you lose the laning stage, just keep farming until you get the items you need to fight. It is absolutely wrong to enter teamfights before you're ready, as most of the time you'll die and further set back your progression. It takes a lot of practice, game sense and knowledge to know when to enter a fight. In sub 3k, people will be tower diving at 15 minutes. This provides great opportunities to TP in at the end of a team fight and potentially get a couple clean up kills, but you have to be careful about it.   That's no fun.   You shouldn't be playing her anyway, that's kind of what I'm saying.   Nyx's Mana Burn, Frost Nova, Purification, Multicast.  I win.   If anyone is having trouble actually killing this hero, the best tip is to save him for last and control him throughout the teamfight. Silence him, euls him, sheep him, kill everyone else around him and go for him last.     Does anyone build refresher abaddon?  I doubt it. It would be an extremely luxury item considering there are so many other items that he would want before that.  I mean I'm sure people HAVE but it's not really something I see as viable.   Troll and Bloodseeker. They're both so easy to play, it kind of just isn't fun.    tri-laning   bottom of 2k  Terrible suggestion.   1. I highly doubt people that low know what pulling is. 2. I even highly-er doubt that they know how to do it correctly. 3. You're going to end up pushing the wave under the enemy tower giving them free xp while your carry is zoned out of last hits and splitting xp three ways. 4. You're probably going to try to dive tower because omg 3v2 advantage and die. 5. Your offlaner is now in a 1v2 and will probably feed.   I'd recommend building a Poor Man's Shield for agility carries. Stops a lot of early right click damage harass and boosts your damage a bit for trading and last hitting. If nothing else, definitely pick up a Stout. Practice last hitting under tower. Lower MMR people miss a ton of essentially free last hits because they don't know how to last hit under towers. Control the creep equilibrium by going for denies. Usually you want the creep wave closer to your tower. It's worse to die than to miss out on some cs. If you're way too pressured, just hang back and soak xp. There are some offlane combinations that will be absolute hell to deal with no matter what carry you pick, especially low 2k where you can see anything. Sometimes you can let them take the tower, and 1 or both will rotate away to pressure other lanes. That frees up the lane for you to freely catch up on cs. Just don't die, play safe, and secure as much cs as possible.   I was able to bait out a Dream Coil and a Warlock Golem with two separate illusion runes in the game I just played.  Felt so good.   The people at 6-7k aren't mentally handicapped.  There's your thread.   I cry every time I see someone midas rush her in the jungle in 3k. So useless.  	117

I would almost consider this AMA a more modernized, albeit, less face to face, version of a town hall meeting.       With that in mind, I am wondering what other communication styles you had planned, what with trying to get a forward thinking campaign moving under a third party banner. Do you feel that there are extra obstacles to be cleared because of your status as a third party candidate, and how do you plan on handling said obstacles?   I know what that's like.

But obviously enough, I'm not going to be fucked up around her    I got her to watch The Culture High a couple months back, so I might have started to get her to think a bit about it, but I'm not going to say for sure   Honesty is one of my big things. I don't care what you do (to an extent) just don't lie to me about it   Honesty was basically my entire selling point. I'm not the best looking or always the nicest, sweetest, or most eloquent, but at least I won't lie to her   She doesn't seem like the type to do so. And I have other habits that are frowned upon moreso than smoking weed.    As the title goes, I thought I found a girl who I would have been dating, but I found her apparent deal-breaker: she thinks it's the worst thing ever to smoke pot, yet she tried to claim that she supports medical marijuana.       I then explained the differences in weed in illegal states, adding that we can't have dispensaries around, so it is difficult to find low THC, high CBD strains in decent quantity or frequency.       She then sent me a message telling me her last boyfriend apparently lied to her about smoking. My thought is that if I'm honest with it, it won't be an issue.      Edit: I've seen all of the honesty related comments. I don't lie to people I care about.  The issue might be (if you look into my post history) I like drug use. So I might just be marking another girl off the already short "girls who are interested in me" list. Yes this is whiny. No, I don't really care right now.  I wanted to hear the subs thoughts.  Bonus: I forgot I asked her to watch The Culture High a couple months back, which she followed through on. So, I guess I made a little progress..   The recommendation seems skewed a little high. I roll hard off of 300mg. The recommended dose for my weight (240) as 540mg. That's over half a gram!  Edit: recommended dose is actually 245mg, which is close to my normal range. I had my weight in kg instead of lb   /r/drugs read this comment.   4chan   You shouldn't call a black man a nigger, not when there are other options that are less used. I want to call that coon a jigaboo some days, and I might call that jungle bunny a porch monkey on others.    Hahaha the first time I got caught was the first time I saw a phone go through a TV. She ordered a new one and apologized the next day for her reaction. I was on Christmas break and decided to smoke some with a couple friends. My mom thought it was because of the people I was hanging out with. It was quite the opposite: I liked to smoke and I had the money, so I bought the weed and was repaid in gas, munchies, and ways to pass the time. I also sold to another group in very small amounts (my biggest sale in high school was a quad) and was making my own decisions and such.  Today, my parents know that I smoke; but I haven't tried to show them the reasoning. They refuse to talk about it. Remember, a phone went through a TV. They don't call me out on it or cause trouble because I look and act like a functioning young adult, unlike my brother.  I work, I go to school, and I have ambition.   My dad has told me several times about how he has been around people who smoked but never smoked with them. He said he isn't a fan of the smell, but I once saw his face light up in happiness over my mom picking up lunchmeat. His eyes were bright red and he had "the grin" so I'm convinced he has smoked before, and still might on the down low. I've smoked with a few of his close friends, so I know they're not too worried about it.  My mom is the opposite. She has never done a drug in her life recreationally (she keeps her Vyvanse locked in her cabinet and takes only the prescribed amount) except for cigarettes and caffeine, if you want to get anal about it. She is an ER nurse, and with that,  I understand why she is against drug use in general. She sees the worst outlooks on a daily basis: ODs, kids (15-19) losing out on a long life, just the generally crippling effects of being lost to an uncontrollable addiction.   You will not take Sammy Davis Jr. from me!!!   That thumbnail has too uncomfortable of a resemblance to Joe Biden for my tastes    Well I saw the three faces looking at the moon as I gazed on. One demonic, the other two unlike it. As if I were forced to decide which one to trust    /r/bestof   /r/bestof   Because I don't fully understand what constitutes it. Yes, it is supposed to be a transcendental/profound experience, but I always understood that as a religious context. Also I could tell myself that I am in the middle of a trip still    Part 1.     So at about 9 pm last night, I took a tab of acid, and let it do its work. The visuals weren't too intense but the feel goods and body vibes were beautiful. This lasted from roughly 10-1. I decided to have a smoke sesh, which created part 2 of the trip.      Part 2.     After this; I went into full trip mode, and laid in my backyard for 2 hours. It was dark, but the full moon made it look like it was daylight. Everything looked like it was a twilight time of day, and there was so much depth to the horizon. I could see designs and figures in the clouds. Weird enough, I saw 3 demonic faces staring into the moon, and I stared into it all. Once I could move, I entered one of the most intense and euphoric meditative trances in my life. I sat and I contemplated as much as I could, but I can only recall pieces at this time. I wound up falling asleep at sometime when my mind finally decided to give up from overload.  Rating.    Part 1: ++ (I could still hold a full conversation with my mother)     Part 2: +++ (I will not assign one of my own experiences as a ++++, but this is the closest I feel I have ever been to it)         I love how hip hop oriented this list is. I just got into Schoolboy Q and haven't had any complaints at this point. I started hearing songs from Habits and Contradictions at parties I'd go to; and it just stuck from there    At least I can do a good Dr. House walk now   Good word   I wish I had some. But none of my people deliver. At least I'll have a script for something by torrow evening   Hasn't helped at all in the past 24 hours   Never had it before   The first three have not helped so far. I'm heading to the er tomorrow to see what my options are. I already have prior back issues on record (scoliosis and nerve pain)    I totaled my car last night. I lost control coming home from a party, and struck an electric pole. I was sober that evening (blew a .00 and passed all assessments) I now have no vehicle to drive, and my mother refuses to take me to the ER. I'm going to get my brother to take me after work. Is there anything I can do to help deal with this pain? If not, that's fine. I'll put down an ice pack and take some Ambien. I just needed to vent. I already have a messed up back, and this did not help.   I'm going to ask the important question: how is it so far?   I cannot disagree with that statement. As I Lay Dying was huge when I was in high school   Rae Sremmurd- No Type.     Any of my super angsty/metal core music.

Also the .UK domain helps   The scene explicitly shows him kicking the midget.

Does anyone else have a similar experience, and if so, tell me you use your position of knowledge responsibly?   The cumulative hangover will kill me   General smoking etiquette for me:  Don't be a cunt.    Don't be a dick.   DO hold your hit for a couple seconds (if possible)    Always enjoy yourself.    Oh and don't forget: smoke some, but only if you're not going somewhere where you're expected to be perfectly sober.   Replace but with and on all of those   A friend of mine and I decided to make a tray of brownies and started cooking our weed. Everything was going great until we both left the kitchen, and wouldn't you know it, goddamn grease fire. I haven't seen the damage to the place yet, but he is currently in the ER with burns and such.   If you're going to use vegetable oil or anything of the sort, be very observant and never leave it unattended.  Update: He has 3rd degree burns along his right wrist and right foot. Also; he is dealing with the pain like a champ.   Bleezy   For those curious [Poison](http://i.imgur.com/HbKOBpr.jpg), [Dhalsim](http://i.imgur.com/C102N0s.webm).      [And Poison's Trans Status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_\(Final_Fight\)#Censorship)    Me and my buddy have been playing Ultimate Street Fighter IV with random characters. He gets Poison and I get Dhalsim. After the match we realize that this is factual. On an LCD tv, we just played a trans woman beat up a Indian dude on Liquid Crystals.      Gandhi   I'm on mobile so I can't easily link the thread but I saw one where the question was posed if Batman's Alfred was Sterling Archer's butler, and how things might have changed.  So now I'm curious, how would Batman's progression as both a person and superhero be altered if he were raised by Woodhouse instead of Alfred?      I already have trouble socializing sober, and it's even more difficult when tripping. Don't know how much used I'd be.   Brother is a Stims guy who love to fuck with paranoid people and can possible turn violent if he's tweaking and freaks out.  I am a psychs guy who gets easily freaked out in simple social situations and fall into my thoughts when I'm tripping.  Weird enough, we combine well when we've smoked enough and then do our drugs of choice.   Superman would be bribed away 10/10 for one simple thing.  Bulma's panties   It was hand grinder too. Does that mean it's not as good to snort          Okay so I binged. I had 3/4 of an ounce of weed, a 750ml of Captain Morgan, 10 xanax, and some morphine. I smoked a few bong bowls, then took 4 MG of Xanax.  I now have an entire weekend at Muncie Gras that I have no memory of, all my xanax is gone, there's some kief in my bag, morphine is also gone and so is my memory for the last 2 days. Wow.  And I had to get my car out of impound.   Edit: wound up being about 12 or 15 bars missing. What the fuck?    Chirp chirpp   I have a bong. And I've been dropping xanax bars like nothing. 8 mg in. Just wanted to let everyone known that time to yourself is wonderful. Also can I add morphine?      There was even a documentary about it a couple years back   Wrong state. Franklin County, MO is awful as well, bet it's mostly meth    Franklin County (assuming I'm thinking of the right one) brings back some memories. I lived in the county next to it, and trust me, I could see this stuff happening more and more as I was growing up: people falling into the wrong circles, getting hooked on substances, chasing highs. All in all, it's not worth it, but you can't really forget where you're from   You mean DXM lol. DMX just makes me want to smoke crack   It has boiled down to me having a lot of weed, a handful or two of xanax, and some morphine.    Made an edit   I have an undisclosed amount of money that was recently added to my bank account and about 3 days of down time before my new job starts.   So, spending money is present, and time to recover is also present?  What should I binge on this weekend?  Edit: I have all my weed already purchased. I have about $400 I can spend. For the feeling, I want something where I can be social, and hyped up. Like I'm on top of the world without too much comedown. I don't need to feel lovey.   Things I can get for sure: Xanax, various opiates (not touching H, personal preference) more weed, MDMA, shrooms, LSD, 25X series, Cocaine, Meth.  Anything else I should ask about?   This is how you would legalize weed in the South. Jesus did it, so should you, because that's what Jesus wants    Bonus: Majuub   That's one way to make it to the top   Then your dealer is in a car as well...   White people do as they please in this country. It's just a way of life   That is trippy and beautiful    And I have discovered something wondrous about me. Might just be the MDMA helping repressed thoughts   I discovered an entirely new thing I liked to do       On my current one right now, Candyflipping!! Just coming up on the Molly, wishing I had some weed though  	106
 Pretty sure that level up saved Bjergsen right there.   I don't think you win 7 games in a row by being sloppy.   Spanish is pretty straight-forward, German however is terrible since it has 16 different ways to say "the". Also German does NOT have extremely simple grammar. In fact there are a lot of native german speakers who fail to use correct grammer all the time. Deutsche Sprache, schwere Sprache.  However i might need to add that most european languages are indeed easy to learn for native English speakers and vice versa since the languages are closely related.   Hearthstone is one of those games where i feel like it's not really worth all the grinding and trouble to hit that legend rank. The only reward is that cardback which looks really meh imo and it doesn't give you enough bragging rights compared to what you can get in games like WoW, LoL and even SC when you put in the time and effort. Everyone who thinks it's worth i wish you best of luck but in the end I've decided against it. Cheers   	4
 Thanks(:   Hey everyone. As one of the few females here, I would just like to remind anyone who reads this that there are ladies out there. I have been called brother, man, and had inquisitions about my penis. I am not a man, nor do I have a penis. It is sweet to call someone your brother, but I am not your brother. Maybe we can somehow include this in the flair? I would really appreciate it...  Anyway, have a good day!   But I love this community... I don't want to leave just because I'm a woman. Maybe we can just have a reminder that we are not all men?   Well, I'm a woman, if that helps paint the picture...   That's true... Kind of like an alcoholic having a beer, I guess: didn't get wasted, just had some to calm the nerves... Thanks.   You're welcome! Feel free to friend me or whatever if you have questions / need support(:   That's a really good point... I probably will and just be glad that I didn't binge or anything... I just feel stupid for doing it and being so far (which is totally normal). Thank you.   Oh, haha. I thought you meant like a regular old glove. I suppose I could try that.   Absolutely! 15/f here! Just prepare yourself for being called brother, man, etc. This is a wonderful community; I'm so glad you're checking it out!!   Really? Why do you think I shouldn't?   I'm not a guy.   I guess this is a stupid question, but I haven't in the past. I feel really stupid because when I was doing it, I thought it didn't count. If I thought it as counting, I wouldn't have done it. I guess I just need to hear what you guys think... Thanks.  UPDATE:  I'm resetting... I'm not being true to my mission if I cheat myself. This sucks, but I'm doing it. It's not hard mode if I allow myself to take the easy way out.  UPDATE 2: Now I'm undecided... I didn't finish, so why should I, right? Because I still purposely engaged my sexual organs... I don't know, this is a tough decision for me. I think I'm gonna sleep on it.   I must have these.   A lot of nights, I have vivid dreams of masturbating. When I wake up, I sometimes find myself touching myself. Should I be concerned or discouraged? I'm doing this while I'm unconscious, but I'm not sure how I should feel about this.   Lol, I am, but that won't be for another 281 days.   Oh, okay. Good to know(:   Cyan...? The stars are definitely light green. I do agree that the numbers are barely legible, though.  EDIT: Oh wait, no I see that there are green, blue, and purple stars. My mistake.   I don't like this... I used to have a gold star that felt like a medal. Now it's just a simple green sticker in which you can barely read the "2"... This may sound a little over the top, but this is a bit of the slap in the face. Makes my time spent feel a little lesser in importance...   Woot woot! We got this!!(:   I'm such a better person now. I'm more outgoing and have a lot less problems with my depression. I feel proud of myself and I love myself for that.   There's actually a $2.84 near me.   I like the rocket, but I cherish my star.   Hey everyone!  I just wanted to share with you guys that although this has been a tough week, I'm only a week away from 90 days!!  Keep pushing yourself, guys. It is so worth it!   No... Alaska's ground is earth, not ice. The glaciers in Alaska do not constitute as part of Alaska. That's like saying Michigan is mostly Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.   This was amazing. Thanks so much for sharing.   Look at all that hair...   Please send this in. It's amazing.   Lights will guide you home   My dog LOVES playing with hair ties!!(:   This is a *really* good look on you!   Yeah, she definitely did. Maybe that is how she meant it, but I think she just worded it more harshly.   I think what she's trying to say is that if a friend hates someone because they wronged them in some awful way, then you shouldn't be friends. Like if some girl called me a stupid whore and gossipped about me a lot, I wouldn't want my friends to be friends with her.   I enjoy it when I have time to sit down and doll myself up. When I'm rushing to look acceptable and run to class, it's pretty crappy.   Also, I think it's worth noting that if you genuinely thought your hair didn't look good, say something like "Oh you think so? Thanks so much! I was feeling insecure about it." Be nice and let them know that they were being nice to you. No one needs to know that you have deep rooted self image problems.   Not so far. It's been fairly smooth, but obviously I'm not too far into my 70-90.   I would assume it was because she was a teenager.   Of course(:   Quick post to remind you guys that **it does get easier**. I remember a time where I just didn't care and gave in thinking I could never do it, and here I am on day seventy and it's never been so easy. It eventually just becomes instilled in you to be clean. Are there temptations? Hell yes, but the difference is you determination in saying no.  Be strong, it is so worth it. Feel free to ask for advice or tips, if you like.   NFP doesn't follow the Rhythm Method anymore.   This isn't the right place for it, though. There's /r/depression and other subreddits like it.   Glad I could help(:   TO THE FLAG   This is awesome! Best one on the sub so far(:   THIS JUST MAKES ME WANT TO SAY THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE!   Oh yeah, totally. I was way too run down to think outside of the box like that, lol. Thanks(:   Ah, got it. Thanks.   I don't know; I just think acro is so distracting. The audience doesn't pay attention to the emotion and the song, we just hope that he won't drop her... I didn't get any real emotion from it other than fear for the girl.   Are you kidding? You're gorge.   I face away from the water. I like to breathe ^and ^sing.   That makes sense. Thanks(:   Hi there, boy. What do you look for in a girl? Appearance, personality, the whole package.   Kind of an awkward question, but is it intimidating to you guys that I'm fifteen (a sophomore), but (I've been told that) I look like I'm 23? I have almost no guy friends (or "romantic interests") because guys never even approach me. Thnx xo   I'm so glad to know I'm not alone on that... I was wondering if I should go a few grades or if they just had extremely high expectations.   Same here. Sophomores and juniors took the PSAT today; all of us had form W.   I've had it stuck in my head ever since..   How the hell did you get b and c?   What happens to him?   Well, I warm up for ~30 mins. You should be able to tell because your vocal chords should feel almost stretched or relaxed (if that makes any sense). Doing scales and things should come at ease with your voice.   Have you been doing sufficient warm ups?   *It's  I'm sorry...   Same here. It's the only way!   This is a really sexy look! Sorry about the breakup, *hugs*.   Yes, girls. Good luck to you!   I always thought they were things that might come up in normal conversation, so it never really struck me. I was just glad that they didn't change them to obnoxiously avoid being sued like "Pottery Farm" or something like that.   That's exactly what I meant; I've been too tired lately to put it into words like this. Thanks for explaining!   That's a really good idea. Thank you.   That's a really good point. Thanks(:   I don't think I could up and choose to believe something other than what I believe. I think something convinces you, and you can't think otherwise. You may have your mind changed, but I don't think it's a *choice*, if that makes sense.  Thanks for the advice!   I want to do this.   Okay, thank you.   That's a good idea. Thanks for the advice!   That makes a lot of sense. Thanks(:   No, I didn't actually get to natural planning. I just said that I'm starting to become "super Catholic," and she took it from there.   Hi there,  Today I was talking to my sister (I'm fifteen, she's sixteen), and I brought up my faith hoping to talk about my plan to do natural planning when I get married. She immediately decided to remind me again of why she is agnostic-atheist for a good long while as I sat and listened. I don't think beliefs are a choice, so I didn't want to intervene. She said nothing bad or discriminative, but just talked about being agnostic-atheist. As I sat there I thought, "Is this okay for me to listen to? Should I say something?" I don't really think I should; I think she should practice whatever religion, or lack thereof, she chooses.  What do you think? Thanks. I love you.   I know how this sounds, but I want a boyfriend. I just want someone to talk to, listen to, and make me feel excited around them. I have my friends, but I really just want someone to hold me when I'm down and someone to tell me they love me and/or they're there for me. I want to tell my friends about the cute things he does that make me feel like the only girl in the world. I want to hold his hand when he's having a tough time and make him happy.  Again, I know it sounds petty, but I'm just tired of not having someone in my life that motivates me to keep going. I don't like doing this alone.   *hugs*   YES! Oh my God, this is the worst...   No, no, no. Jeans vs. sweatpants. It was an analogy comparing jeans to thongs and sweatpants to briefs.   You're actually supposed to close the lid before you flush so that all the germs in your urine and stool don't fly out into the air, in your sink, on your toothbrush, etc.   A thong? Not at all.   Oh, lol. Idk, you just get used to it.   I don't know what you mean...   I actually sing/rap/whatever this quietly to myself in the halls.   Well, I'm a dancer, so I'm always wearing really tight pants. If I don't wear a thong, you can see the line, and it's pretty embarrassing. Also, after I wore them for awhile, they just made me feel prettier and more presentable. It's kinda like wearing jeans over sweatpants.   Daamn baby, you look fiine.   I have a teacher that does this. It went *okay*. I sometimes put in equal effort into two different assignments, get a 60 on one and a 100 on the other.   :')   Are you serious? Wow...   I think that'd be so cute! But instead, I would say something like, "Hey, check out this picture of my dog/cat/pet rock." I think that'd be a little more subtle. But I understand if it'd be weird to tap phones just to show someone a pic... Either way, good luck(:   They always do this. It drives me crazy.  	90
 I estimate I have emailed 1700 resumes over the last two years with only 5 interviews. I have been getting the help of a nonprofit organization for the last month to try to find a job.   I take Bupropion (Wellbutrin) 300mg. it worked for the first 3 months but is starting to fail. I am highly allergic to every other SSRI so trying different meds has been a 25 year failed experiment.  	2
 Or its one of our stupid birds flying the coop like they often do in spring    Kevin Bacon   I tried that myself made things horrible comfort wise. Though I'm by no means a professional.    Hello everyone, I've been thinking about lowering my bike recently. I bought it last March and rode it all summer as it was. (standard height) However that being said. I am 5'2 small female and ride a Kawasaki ZX6R 2008. Its quite tall, I have to tip toe on stopping and sometimes it makes me feel really uncomfortable. I know that lowering a bike will change it geometry and make it different while cornering. But say lowering an 1'-.5' would it make a big difference? Or should the bike just be left in stock suspension. Something I've been thinking about for a while. Considered it all summer while I rode it. Though now its off season and I've been thinking about spring a lot and lowering the bike. So whats this community's general consensus. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!    Emily, Sarah,  Jessica,  Khalessi, crystal, John, Chad,  Bob,  George,  Jesse    I'm online in Ontario, Canada.  Downloading a game from the store as i type.    No but the right shoulder pad armour on my mage was floating around her body in every cut scene    Did you make these or buy them? I was thinking of doing something similar.    Sorry but why not have sex instead of fapping?    True.    Headlights are wrong for a 2008 zx6r. Looks more like an 2005   Tick or treating    I figured as much. I might breed her when shes big enough    Check etsy   Salmon, with jungle and albino apparently    She will be 2 in august   	16
 My Bloody Valentine - i can see it but i cant feel it   Watch the performance. It is heart melting.    RemindMe!   Oh jeez this is depressing.  There's a lot of money to be had in China. All you got to do is have a degree (which you do), speak English (which you do), and be relatively attractive.  Plus, if you like it enough, you can just stay here and never pay your loans ever!       I don't think so. Same name though     Your dad is what I aspire to be.    I just pmd you. I would like to cover your adventure through the Chinese legal system.    Do you know where I can find an article?       I hate you.    do you know why she deleted her account?     Anyone know where she went?    I know, but only pricks pronounce it jif      Good to hear that you're coping so well :)   No. Got lucky on the first try.    50 mg  	18
 What.   Yeah I don't really understand gender roles. No idea what the rules are. What I really don't understand is why it is so socially inappropriate for women to not shave their legs and armpits. Way too many people are ready to be vocal about the natural state of someone's body.       Women shaving hasn't even been around that long. WWI is actually when it started. At that time the only women in France that were shaving were prostitutes. Yet now it is being called a 'trend' to not shave.         It is just such a weird thing for people to have such strong opinions on. I don't even get it, aliens would be baffled.    Unfortunately my health no longer allows me to have fun.   I uh. I don't really pay taxes. Aside from sale taxes and such.    I have POTS which causes me to get dizzy when I stand up as well as some other things. I would just say I fainted and knocked it over or something.    Excessive alcohol consumption.    Playing music, performing/contortion, rescue dogs. They all sort of fell in my lap. They also got taken away too though. Now I do jigsaw puzzles and pretend it's fun.   Probably.    Yes. Usually when I have a technical question. If I am curious about how something works (which I often am) I will ask someone who should know. Like a locksmith. Normally if I just ask they will brush of the question because I am just a dumb woman. But if I act slightly flirty and be all cute at first I can get their attention enough to start using smart people words and then they will actually give me a real answer.         Tits are useful.    I like a nice dark beer. Particularly porters. Also tequila, straight or with whatever.  I don't drink much anymore. But being drunk all the time was a blast.    "You can't be that sick, you're too young/look so healthy."         No. Fuck you. You have no idea what it's like for me to get through the day.    I thought most people knew that.    I believe in a slurry of random shit from all kinds of cultures. So I would be really confused if all the random specific things I follow were checked out in the first place.   Juggling. Jugglers always get the ladies.   My friends house. I expected to be there but the situation was insane. I woke up with the taste of vodka still in my mouth wondering what time is was. When I went downstairs there was about seven people there and ALL of them were on mushrooms. One of the weirdest days of my life.          Even the cat was high. Let me explain, where I am from fall is mushroom season. My whole friend group is very familiar with picking them so that's what happens. As soon as fall hits that cat always waits for my friend at the door when he leaves. Just waiting. Waiting for him to come in with a paper bag. As soon as that happens the kitty lurks around the kitchen waiting for someone to leave a cap or stem out somewhere. It never fails that he snatches one and eats it. For whatever reason that cat loves getting fucked up.        So I am down there watching everyone trip when we realize a friend is missing. Apparently he couldn't keep up with the cat and had to go hide in the hall closet. I had to coax him out and pet his head until he felt better.          It was a long night for me. But I got to see my best friend make an ass of herself which is a rarity.    "Everything that makes me uncomfortable should be illegal."         It is really absurd that if someone wants to sell their body for a living they aren't allowed. If brothels were mainstream it would be a much more healthy profession. It would also create more jobs and help circulate money.         But no, it's not allowed because a bunch of Jesus people would freak out.           It would also put more power in the hands of women which is obviously  a threat.   Hearing them have sex.         Hearing them have sex.   Vital?   Hold your breath.    I have had at least a half dozen doctors lie to me. Apparently I look stupid. And like a drug seeker.    His name was Blackberry. He stopped pooping and got really fat and died.    Let me get back to you on that.   These from back in the day. I did some modeling when I was a teen.         http://i.imgur.com/UQLvyHA.jpg               http://i.imgur.com/6j5pxrB.jpg   The library. Sometimes I do donate books or money.    Barthalone cysts.   I am extremely flexible and worked as a contortionist for a while which I loved. All growing up I did dance and gymnastics and was really good at the bendy stuff.        Yeah well it turns out my body is like that because I have a genetic collagen/connective tissue disorder. In the past year it has also caused me to be in crippling pain all the time. I'm 23 and can hardly get to the grocery store. Some days I can't even dress myself. Osteoarthritis is already starting to take my hands. Not sure how Iong I can manage to stay out of a wheelchair.          At least I'm special?   I don't know but every boyfriend I have had has taken longer than me to get ready.         When women take so long it has more to do with the standards women are supposed to meet to be accepted socially. We grew up with the notion that we will get further ahead if we are pretty (which is partially true). We also have to have all the right makeup and outfits and hair to be pretty because that's what the media says.         But there are just people like my sister who are chronically late because they function on asian time or whatever.    Or saying bless you for that matter. Why did you just acknowledge another person's bodily function by bringing up your alleged supreme being? You're actually supposed to do that? Like every time? Even when you don't know the person? And everyone finds this completely normal?    Oh I definitely have POTS/dysautonomia symptoms. I get dizzy and lose my vision every time I stand up. I am also in and out of fevers all day.       If I wasn't so ridiculously flexible I would probably assume I am classical.         For some reason I also get lots of little broken blood vessels and petechia really easily. Which weirds me out.    Yeah I know several guys that wish they went circumcised and several that are glad they are not. I think it is unnecessary. I can't imagine putting my brand new child through an elective surgery.        I asked my dad if I would have been circumcised had I been male and he said yes. I was actually kind of upset about not having my hypothetical foreskin.   I came here to find this. The god stuff is one thing but I really just think it is an absurd custom regardless of the origin. Yet no one seems to realize how little sense it makes. How is it rude to not acknowledge someone's bodily function? Please don't confront me about my sneeze. Why am I supposed to be thankful? As if it was so traumatic it makes me feel much better when someone brings up religion. Even complete strangers. No thanks.    God damn fucking little powder birds.   You should see one on good Friday. It's extra spooky.    My sister is like that. Now I am really self conscious about drinking water because she used to freak out at me when I was a kid.   I have been taking my mom to my appointments which is helping.         I was seeing a couple doctors at a university pain clinic. At first they seemed great and I thought they would help. They always spent a lot of time with me and everything. Then they got me a referral for the university geneticist to check for HEDS (which I'm sure I have) but the geneticist had too many patients and turned me away.        After that the doctors stopped trying. All anyone says is that I need to diet and exercise. I'm not even overweight. All of my horrible pain started because I was physically active. One of the doctors even said "Well why do you want a diagnosis so bad?" and "Sorry I don't have any magical powers that can fix you".               I have tried pretty much everything besides opiates for my pain but nothing helps. They all think I am drug seeking. As if I want pills so bad I left my job/home/dogs/boyfriend and moved 2000 miles so I could get a fix. Several have told me I shouldn't have opiates because I will become addicted. Which is offensive considering less than 2% of people using narcotics properly become addicted. Somehow I must CLEARLY be part of that percentile because I am young and have tattoos.          Sorry. I'm ranting.    People are shitty.    Patient here. Being lucky enough to have good insurance my main problems with the medical system is the doctors and how it has been corrupted by the war on drugs.        I know there are great doctors out there, but I never seem to get them because I have seen at least ten just this year and none of them will take me seriously. The unwillingness to learn something new or how to treat me is heartbreaking every time. I know a lot of medical terms, I'm fairly articulate, and I end up crying every time I explain what's going on. I had a rheumatologist spend maybe three minutes in the room with me and then refuse to do anything about my current systems.          Sorry to be whining at you here. I guess I just hope you might have some insight. I am positive about several conditions I have but can't seem to be taken seriously. It has been destroying my life for the past ten months. I am 23 and can hardly get out of bed due to how severe my musculoskeletal pain is and I can't understand why it is so hard to find a doctor that cares.   Yeah healthy eating habits are hard to come by. I mostly eat what my body wants/needs but I still stuff myself occasionally and I will never stop liking ice cream.       Some people just don't get it though. I had to lecture my boyfriend on why it's not ok to eat an entire bag of doritos in one day.   It may slow down with age, but without *any* collagen you would die. I still have collagen but it doesn't work for certain parts of me. There are six different types of the disease I have and they all work a little differently because there are different factors in the deficiency. For me it mostly effects my tendons, ligaments, muscles, and small blood vessels. Sometimes people it's mostly their internal organs and for others it's their heart and vascular system which is life threatening.    Probably, but I have several health conditions that already cause those things so I wouldn't have noticed.        She will just have to come to terms with herself and realize that starving herself won't solve her problem, no matter how tiny she gets she won't be satisfied. And if she can't try to help herself now she will be doing the same thing in five years when she looks like a holocaust victim.         Anorexia usually stems from things other than just body image. She is probably horribly unsatisfied with other things about herself and not eating is a way to take control. Especially if she feels withdrawn from the people around her. All you can do is be supportive of her and her recovery. Remind her what is great about her and why she doesn't need to go to such extremes because she doesn't need to change. She just needs to figure out who she is and respect that person.    I'm sure it is healthy for some people. But for people like us it makes ot to easy to obsess over.    Well unfortunately there is nothing I can do about the flaw in my DNA that prevents me from producing collagen. So there is in fact *nothing* I can do but hope to stay out of a wheelchair for the next ten years.    I used to live across the street from the crazy ramtha lady and her mansion. There was a brick wall around the place with copper posts. It was weird.    Eating healthy is really important. There are foods that will make you less bloated and whatnot.       But when you're struggling with an eating disorder the main thing that needs to change is your body image. Mental health is a difficult thing to work on and you usually you cant do it on your own.   Yeah I fucking hate doctors. That's so frustrating not knowing what's going on and your doctor won't take it seriously. Sometimes you have to put your foot down and get all stern with them.   Some people have a really bad time with it but I did fine with the pills.   Yep. I always have to turn down parties and stuff.        But I know how you feel, what I have is a connective tissue disorder as well as osteoarthritis. That shit is no fun.    I see. It's cool when doctors actually check for things like that.    Yeah I have no other options than to keep trying.    Seriously. It is so frustrating already that I can't be active like everyone else and then I get shit for it. Being active is the reason I got this bad in the first place. I know for a fact that exercise is the opposite of what I should do.       I don't care when most people are dumb but when doctors refuse to get me tests for the conditions I am certain I have without even finding out what the conditions do. They just tell me diet and exercise. I'm not even overweight.    Yeah I have seriously tried every ploy. The only thing that is beginning to help is bringing my mom into every appointment with me.   I'm not counting on it. Doctors won't treat me. I have been avidly trying tof almost a year now.    What test did you do?    I have a bunch of shit but a couple of them are joint hypermobility and osteoarthritis.    Have you heard of ehlers-danlos syndrome?    Maybe a tampon. Or something that makes even less sense like a hospital gown.   Yeah I will probably manage fine. A low pain day for me is a 6. So I am well versed in pain. It just sucks because I don't know how soon my joints will go and right now I'm only 23.   Yeah I have never gotten narcotics for a kidney infection. And I have had four. Last time the doctor bitched at me because I almost died.   I have a genetic condition that has me in constant pain. Doctors won't treat me because I'm young. I would trade it for cancer in a fucking second.         So I feel you.    Yeah I went to a clinic that did that. I chose the medical option.    I am not looking forward to getting joints replaced. That seems awful. I already can't deal with how my hips feel sometimes.    Are you tall and skinny? Or pale and flexible?    Testicular torsion.    One of my best friends was in acting classes with John Cameron Mitchell.    How bad my health is, how it is ruining my life, and the fact that I will never get better.         I am seriously not even cool to be around because all I can think about is how fucked I am and how I can get the medical attention I need.    Most obese people I know do eat until they are uncomfortably full. Which are the ones who need to know the difference.    That's a better answer.    Exactly.    Ick. Trazadone also made me not eat and gave me anxiety.    Lately, the misconception that someone who is young and looks healthy can't have serious medical conditions. Or if they do it must be their own fault. Even doctors do this shit, and not just sometimes. I mean the past dozen doctors I have seen won the do shit.       I will tell someone I had to stop working because of my health and chronic pain. Usually I hear something like "But you look so healthy" or "It can't be that bad, what is your diet like?" and "Wait until you're older!".        No fuck you. Just because I'm not fat doesn't mean I'm healthy. I have a genetic condition, my diet won't change my DNA, asshole. And I would rather not think about getting older because I will be lucky to stay out of a wheelchair for the next ten years.          If it wasn't this bad I would still have a life. Yet somehow people think I am being dramatic. Why would I throw my entire life out the window for attention?        I'm sort of just angry all the time.   I generally only drink water for the most part as well. Staying hydrated is difficult for me so I also eat extra salt. It really helps.         But I am also not a healthy person. That is beyond my power though.   Some people don't know the difference between being hungry and not being uncomfortably full.   I used to do that when I was anorexic.    Good luck. The one I am on now (cymbalta) was the first one my doctor tried out on me and it is perfect.         I have had several not work out as well. Recently I was put on amatryptaline for pain but it made me depressed. Prozac made my anxiety way worse, and when I was 11 or something welbutrin made me throw up.   You could have just answered nicely. I doubt you're irreplaceable.    Ramtha?   Yeah there is potential that I would foster a young kid and then eventually adopt them if I could. Regular adoption will never be in my budget. Even if I had a job rather than disability.    Absolutely.    It really is.    Those people are particularly easy to read. And when you are in a life or death interview you can probably think of some shit.   You can usually tell when someone is full of it though. Or they are a good liar in which case that might be a good skill to keep around.    They do. Which is why they are a good investment.    I have been on it for quite a while and I have been able to make rational decisions and mentally function like a real person. Antidepressants are all different and so are the people that take them. Just because you have a bias doesn't mean I should just have to live with psychotic depression.           That's the same argument people use for pain medication but some people would rather have a professionally monitored chemical dependency than spend the rest of their life rolling around in bed being miserable.    I think the reason I bought it for a bit is because I used to be a contortionist.    For about ten minutes while I was waking up I still thought I could do it. Total bummer.    Eh. Women are assholes too. We also just have to be more concerned about avoiding getting raped.    That's how you fail.   I know. I am sure it would be different for guys anyway because it wouldn't necessarily be much of a threat. If a car starts to slow down next to me I have to make sure I can run if I have to or be ready to defend myself.        Women making cat calls are not usually scary. When men do it I get stressed out.    GED-Musician.        Yep.   I use cream eyeliner and have had the same tiny pot of it for at least five years. It tends to dry out so I add a drop of baby oil to it and it's good as new.         Also I won't buy a fancy brush for it. I bought one of those awful liquid eyeliner pens, removed the felt tip, and washed all the makeup out. Those felt tips are perfect for cream eyeliner.    Yeah I am 23 and back to staying with my mom. It's weird. But I'm here for different reasons.    Put on old shoes, dumpy clothes, and a rain coat. Go jump in puddles with someone. When you get back home and change into comfy clothes, make hot chocolate, put a movie on, snuggle.         Source: I'm from the Pacific Northwest.    My antidepressants. It's a great investment.    A while back I had a root canal and they offered me the gas for an extra $100 or something. I took it and it was well worth it. Particularly because I have a bad case of TMJ.          Although I ended up having to get that tooth extracted a couple weeks later.    Yeah its not really cool when it happens all the time.    She is probably hypermobile. It's the most common type and generally causes the most joint problems. It is also the most painful.    I am plenty familiar with how it all works.    Exactly. I actually had someone doing that recently and when he ran out of argument he responded with "wah fucking wah" or something like that. Like that was supposed to upset me or something?          The thing about reddit is that a lot of the people who spend a lot of time here do so because they don't have good social skills or don't know how to not be a dick so they don't have friends. All they have is reddit. Which is good because everyone deserves a place where they can be comfortable and attempt to socialize. Even the cunts are cuts for a reason. Usually. It just sucks for some of the rest of us.   Yeah the chick on the show had the vascular type. Fuck that.   Thanks. Me too.   I don't work now because of health issues but before I stopped working my boyfriend and I worked for the same place. It is a dog rescue where we had different positions but it was all grunt work. If I were healthy we would both do fine in each other's place. We were at different warehouses though so he would have had to deal with more bitchy people. My position also makes 2.50 an hour less than his. Which I'm sure he would hate.   NO FUCKING BIG SURPRISES.        Also guys, before you stick anything in a vagina make sure there has been plenty foreplay and she is throughly wet. It is better to tease her until she REALLY wants it and is even getting impatient than to dive in too early and the vagina muscles haven't relaxed yet.         Then continue to pay attention to the amount of moisture there is during sex. If there is even just one dry spot on the labia or wherever, it hurts. And sometimes we are shy. Not paying attention to the amount of moisture is how condoms break.    Apparently.    My brother went to the store to get my niece some nighttime cough medicine. While he was there he remembered he needed more lube and grabbed a bottle. Half way to the register he realized what he was about to buy and put the lube back.       That would have been a really sketchy purchase.    I don't remember who said it but my sister and I have been through some shit together and we are pretty close. Not so much now as she has a heroin problem.          "Sweet is the voice of a sister in the season of sorrow."         I am the only person in the family she really ever talks to because I still treat her like the person she really is.    I know. Hitler was full of good ideas.    [Thought I'd share some OC.](http://i.imgur.com/oKYdhBi.jpg)    Not being able to function like a normal person my age due to my health. It ruins everything.    I don't care much about the downvotes. It's the ignorant argumentative comments. Sometimes I am just really confused as to why I get them on a relevant and neutral comment.   Your own health. Just avoid webmd and stupid articles by white women.   Around 12 when I was going into puberty my joint pain got worse. Then again around 16 or something. When I was 18 I began going grey.            Now I am 23 and probably a quarter of the way grey. My health has also been rapidly declining in the past year to the point where I am unable to work or even leave the house much. Doctors don't like to treat young people for chronic pain so I just lay around and try not to further hurt myself.    I want them but I probably won't because I have a genetic condition that I don't want to pass down. I would also have to quit my meds while pregnant and breastfeeding which would be hell.  	112
 He's from space Dicks so it all makes sense now    And most of the rock and music today sucks allot    Green day sucks dean would defiantly not approve and yes it is whiny    To clarify I think dean would hate this shit I was just jokeing with the title any ways deans more classic rock (actual good music that's far better than any crap today) type of guy.   Someone got that it was a joke dean would never listen to that shit classic rock forever!   I wasn't being serious I just couldn't think of a title lol but true deans more of a classic rock type of guy the good stuff       It says spoilers in the title    So was the blade slowly taking deans soul away and then dying kind of completed the process ? Cause Cain said there is a price with the mark  (a soul?) can someone clarify .   He didn't call it, he lived it.      Looks like dean has a [dark passenger](http://i.imgur.com/JZ0uQsz.jpg)   It's from being away from the blade    No surprise new Gods a dick .   I think he will become some sort of angel    True very true   I think for the finally deans going to kill himself while taking Metatron with him because he realizes the mark of Cain is too strong and this season kind of emphasized on how dean only saves sam so he's not alone and not just for Sam's well being so I think he will use the last blade to kill Metatron of course then stab himself so he can hurt anyone else in his blind rage and the way he comes back in season 10 is he becomes an angel or Crowley will save him(since he has human emotion now) if only the boys promise not to gank his ass.    Just a though not saying it's going to happen.   Also share what you think I'm interested to hear about it!         But that's only happened like 2 in spn    Touché    What do you like most about your job?   I'll have to try and find them haha   Thank you for sharing and I'm really excited now haha!!   Hahaha sorry?   We love you though :)    Has anyone ever been to a con was it costly?  Was it worth it? Was it what you expected?  I was thinking about going to the con in Minnesota but just getting photo op tickets with Jared and Jensen and then a 1 day pass.     Why would it matter if you are heterosexual or not?   Got it from an Instagram account    I was going to go with that as my title haha      Oh ok   Dude! Asia .   "Come on bobby, lets go hunting"      I think bloodlines has some potential.   I want this to happen         That video was during shooting an episode so most likely       That too   This songs a bit over used but when ever I hear it I think supernatural maybe it's because the original is in season 6  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l2S4GTD-AAw   No   I happy to hear that haha       Really?!?! I thought there has been 23 so far either way it's gonna suck when the season ends   I don't think I'll be able to contain myself when carry on my wayward son starts on Tuesday I'm not ready for this finale and its suppose to be a cliff hanger like a certain season that involved 'pac men' as dean called them . Anyone else not ready?   It was the heat of the moment !   Thanks for sharing I love it!!   Wasn't trying to appeal to anyone just thought it would be a cool ending   Yeah the second one would be depressing    Why not? Haha   There was a whole episode about it lol   Was just thinking of ways the show could  end, would love to hear others ideas too.    Ok so dean and sam are in motel after ganking the last evil s.o.b main antagonist of whatever season it is   They both go to bed    (Shot of just sams face as he's asleep ) *radio turns on* "it was heat of the moment" Sams eyes open , "RISE AND SHINE SAMMY!" *Goes to black*. ………………………….………………… Version 2 dean and sam are in motel after ganking the last evil s.o.b main antagonist of whatever season it is   They both go to bed    (Shot of just sams face as he's asleep ) *radio turns on* "it was heat of the moment" Sams eyes open , "RISE AND SHINE SAMMY!" Sam gets up and turns to see lucifer on the other bed as the motel slowly starts to turn into the cage  *Sam starts to scream* goes to black.    I liked it       None taken haha   I didn't make it lol   Dean would probably say it's not the same or that's just wrong haha         My advice for you is to downvote and move on like I said before you can attract the positive end of a magnet  and there is no need to be a mega-douche I'm expressing how I felt about the new spin off and what I though about it so sorry for being a human being and p.s. Have a nice day :)!   Thanks and my bestfriends name is sam he's a little behind on spn but  every Tuesday I call him and say that    There haha   And dean and sam are always surprised by new characteristics from monsters all the time.   I meant supernatural as in the unexplained, magic and monsters    You could have said anything!  	68
 I googled for a counsellor (I'm in the UK) and found an amazing one who pretty much was my saviour. Google is the best tool out there :)   I'm so sorry you are suffering this way :( I have anxiety but mildly in comparison to what I used to have. Best thing I ever did was find a good councillor and find out WHY I was depressed and anxious. Knowing why stopped the self harming and the destructive behaviour as a result of learning to love myself. Sending strength and love x  	2
 Curly toe beans! 3    "Your face is as flat as a locker"    Clowns.    Shhhh, don't tell her she's not!       Nope, he's not European.    Nope, getting farther haha    Nope! He's caucasian but it's not a white supremacy thing.    I've asked him why he likes me and why he's dating me and he said because I'm smart, funny and that he feels comfortable talking to me. But it is the asian comment that bothers me the most.    I'm so sorry you have to go through that. *hugs* Thank you for the advice! 3       Please post more pics when you get him. He's adorable! 3   	12
 Reddit Detectives! Someone make this a thing.   I fear for the wedding cake (and guests) if I ever get married. Everyone else is sharing their sweet story of how they either did or did not smash cake in each other's faces. I would be telling the story of how SO put cake on my face and I subsequently started a food fight.   [Applicable?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO1Q7F23DxM)   Really, only 9 months? I don't believe you.  edit: Just saw your correction. Don't mind me.   I'm too afraid to ask.   "Don't forget to drink your Ovaltine"   ITT: OP, get vaccinated ^seriously  Glad this cute little bat doesn't have a white nose :)   That escalated quickly.   Make a Twitter handle just for this and live tweet the whole thing. See how my followers you can get in such a short amount of time.   RemindMe! 24 hours "Follow up on note guy"   I second the idea of using a paintbrush as a knife in paintball.   The first time I had a reddit I treated it like Imgur and only looked at the funny pictures. So much valuable time lost...   Welcome, Brother Sharkbait!   I mean, if you're offering.   Seattle?   Guys, this one is a dead end.   I was on the mod team before the takeover. If you need any CSS help, or otherwise, let me know.   Agreed, and agreed.   Yes, that is mine.   Adventure Time!   If anyone was wondering, his resume is still downloadable (and three pages long).   Just spent 20 mins on that site, and downloaded the app. Not sure if I'm thankful or not.   Immediate sadness upon seeing the picture.   Immediate sadness upon seeing the picture.   Does it hurt?   I think this is my favorite non-serious response.   No, I got orangered from it. I think it only posts once per thread.   RemindMe! 12 hours "Check the button scavenger hunt."   First to find it! Keep going /u/unicode_suggestion!!   I think most Americans don't have the capacity to picture how much a ton actually is. Obviously we know how many pounds it's equal to, but we have nothing tangible to relate it to. When something is in pounds, it's easier to imagine how much weight that actually is. I.e. 2.4 mil lbs sounds a lot heavier than 1200 tons. Might just be me though.   Yey!! Do good work and find a cure!   Oh wow, it'll be almost like having pet bats! In the same way that having a bird feeder is like having pet birds. So not at all like having pet bats. I can pretend, dammit!!   The big question no one is asking: OP, is that you in the picture?   The wildlife people (whatever government agency does that) shut down many of the caves as far as allowing humans to enter.   My mom used to get mad at me because I'd use these to clean the walls and I'd end up taking half the paint off.   I would totally volunteer for that.      I just saw one of these roll down main street!! What is happening??   Aayye June birthdays! I'm turning 26 next month. I too will be making a trip to the Lego store!!   Resurrecting this to see if you will post results soon.   Holding back tears at this news. His was the first concert I went to growing up, and I saw him live two times after that. Definitely one of my favorite artists, and men, of all time.   I'd also like to know where the admins stand on these types of subreddits.   My "TV" and "$2000 PC" and "other valuable items" that I don't actually own. Renters insurance covers break-ins, right?   Were the frogs still alive when you had to dissect them in biology?   Speaking from experience?   Dudebro is just like "yeah, cool, man. Whatever. Go away please"   Look, OP, while I appreciate the message, I don't come to reddit to feel good about my life. I come here to accept the fact that I am internet scum, surrounded by more internet scum.    Prove me wrong.  Easy. I'll just live forever.   RemindMe! 364 days "Check up on these guys: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/35l896/if_you_had_365_days_to_eat_a_standard_wooden_door/cr5ijxr"   Excuse me while I go vomit.   You, OP, have awful handwriting. Great LPT though! I always write out things I need to remember to take with me for the day.   This was three snares and a cymbal though.   My old boss would do that and it drove me crazy. He'd just hold ctrl and spam the C key.   And many of those types are really no big deal, show no symptoms, and go away on their own after a few months.   On reddit, avoiding talking to real people.   There are two kinds of people.   So glad I'm not the only one who noticed that.   I have to agree with this. She's always struck me as having not much going on in her head. Not discrediting her work by any means.   It's super awesome though when they only move about two inches and it's not enough and you're just standing there awkwardly shoving them.   I do this too, in crowds. I'm also very short and skinny, so moving through people is easy. I feel like most people don't even notice.   Just had the image of someone climbing the grocery shelves to get around slowpokes. Made me laugh.   You want me to believe that people visit Canada for vacation?   Somebody recruit the Headless Monks.   First of all, check your facts.  Second, the city going up in flames is an example of hive mind and has very little to do with the empathetic states of the individuals involved.   Not all of us are after money solely. There are many factors that drive an empathy-lacking individual to do certain things. If someone feels like they can take a particular life path because it will allow them control over other people in the way they desire, they're going to take that life path.   That's a good point I hadn't considered about the whole thing.  Them taking people specifically with lower IQs is the mark of a broken system. The people making decisions about a person's lawfulness should be intelligent. Otherwise they're all just sheep obeying a higher order they don't understand.   Doesn't that only work for words that are misspelled?   I'm wondering if we will see a trend of violent sociopaths becoming police as a cover. With the news covering nothing but the deaths at the hands of police, it seems like a logical move. I also wonder if maybe that trend has already started, which is why there are so many police acting this way. I find it hard to believe that a typical empath could end a person's life without just cause and be ok with it. This goes a little beyond just an abuse of power. Thoughts?   Are you one of those people who overcomplicates a^2 + b^2 = c^2 by adding "where a and b are two sides and c is the hypotenuse of a right triangle"?   I'm opposite. I could do calculus/diff eq problems all day long, but when it was applied to things in my physics class I couldn't understand it. I like the basic logic without the application.   That's a good point. In most other subjects there are a lot of answers that are up for interpretation, but in math it's mainly just right and wrong. I can see how this would make the class seem harder than the other subjects.   This is a great answer.  Through high school, I thought I was really bad at math because I was struggling to understand algebra, and I really didn't care about it. When I got to college and took calculus, I fell in love with it, and every advanced math class after. If they could make primary math as interesting as advanced math I think more people would be good at it.   I'm the same as you. I'm really good at math, but can't remember anything from history classes. All of our brains work differently. Some people get the math brain and some get the history brain (or whatever other brain).   Half Life 3 confirmed   It looks like gravy.   I wanna play. Test.   I own a non-profit that works with kids. We could really use some help. PM me for more info if you're interested, as I'm not inclined to put the personal details out there.  	77
 I had the same thing (different medication though) where I felt nothing at all and the days were just going by and I didn't feel much, so I dropped the amount I was taking back to what I use to take just so I could feel something but now I feel sad and wouldn't mind feeling nothing at least just for a little bit it doesn't feel like a fun game to play.   37.. Time to get help again I guess :/   Wow you've put this really well unfortunately I feel like I can relate, I hope you and everyone else who feels this way can find something, someone to make them feel like they belong.   Wow this is so good, I'm so glad I was hitting random and found this sub reddit new subscriber right here xD  	4
    You need to do some more investigating, the hospital sounds like it has a very interesting history!   Bloody queues...don't miss that! LOL I was trying to do the same thing!!!! AWESOME  I remember the day I got the Chef title...so much joy.   I was on Frostmourne, you?  I used to raid weekly but what I was really super keen on......cooking achievements lol. My main is an undead Mage :)   Hmm maybe have a think about buying something with a kitten print on it? Like I don't know - kitten mittens? Mug? T-Shirt?   As in the bed started rusting before your eyes?   I hope more people see this thread! Would be an interesting read.   Reinforced the need to seek approval      I'd say go for something that is relevant to something she's joked about or talked about - shows you've been listening and that you remembered. For example, I made a joke to a friend stating that nothing says Happy Valentines Day better than a bacon and egg pie...if I got this said pie then I'd think that person was pretty darn awesome.    We have some pretty sweet pink tabards too! If I do come back, I'll PM ya for your Real ID haha.   I haven't read up about Lords of Draenor at all - what are the highlights?   Not anymore...although I do miss being Guildmaster for the Hello Kitty Adventures Guild....sigh..   Sounds like a pretty cool movie plot      Batman.   Dates. For example, when there's a shot of a headstone I need to work out how old that person was when they died (if there's no mention of an age).   Medium - love Patricia Arquette.   WoW: The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria.    Survivor   Be prepared to genuinely work hard, sounds clichéd but that's the biggest tip I can give.  I interview a lot of college/uni students that are so self-entitled it hurts. These candidates also like to think that they're too good for the role.   There's nothing wrong with getting your foot in the door and then working your way up.   This dude was cool but when he got promoted he started getting really arrogant and cocky.  He treated his team like shit but kissed ass and flirted with the boss. One night he tried to stick his hand up a colleague's skirt, the boss just moved him to another department to save his ass.   Titanic - Jack lives   Listening to Beyonce's music post marriage to Jay Z...sorry Bey fans!!      This. Meatspin.   Can confirm    Sizzling bacon   Complete transformation - physically, mentally and emotionally.   Anything from the Patricia Cornwell Kay Scarpetta series such as Body Farm   What an awesome idea!!   Must be contagious, you just made me smile too :)      If you're out in public, there's people around and you randomly pop a boner, what's a guy to do?    Not finishing my degree sooner, wasted a lot of time and money - maybe things would be better for me now if I had just started getting my shit together sooner.    PICC line scar in my inner arm, I learnt how fragile and unpredictable life is - you just have to roll with the punches.   When after seeing them i'd feel pissed off or insecure.      My fourth toes on either side are bent, its almost like the tips are disappearing so the mid joint is trying to break through the skin. Nasty.    Did you go through Seek too?   I didn't know that - with the comments below I'm not sure I should attempt to watch the reboot   Well i'll be heading over shortly so if you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me :)   Overall, are you enjoying it so far? Are Melbournians generally friendly?   Alright, I'll give it a go - nothing to lose! Thanks.   Really? Not moving for another 4 months!   Sailormoon    /r/totallystraight    14   Yay for better public transport! I'm not sure how I'm going to survive the extreme temps! I've heard about 41 degree weather over there while I cringe when I'm barely surviving 24 degrees here!  	48
 Firstly, happy birthday!  My tip for these things is to try set up your day so that it is harder to not do these things than it is to do them. For example, don't aim to write, say, two pages per day in your journal, aim to write *something* in your journal, even if it is just a couple of lines capturing the essence of your day. Similarly, be happy if you can get yourself to meditate for five minutes, or do a bit of jump rope, rather than being unhappy because you didn't run for an hour or meditate all evening. Personally, and from what I have read of other peoples' experiences, you're probably less likely to stick to something when you have set yourself a huge amount to do each day, it's more likely that you'll just drop it all together, maybe picking it back up again a few weeks or months later when you feel enthusiastic, only to drop it again after a matter of days.  Starting with just *something* is a great way to build a maintainable habit :3   https://www.facebook.com/TheSimpsonsArt  This guy, he makes our world just that little bit brighter :3  Edit: *danker   Really though, I wouldn't consider myself particularly large in the chest department yet there are a lot of looks that just don't 'hang' as well on a chesty frame as a smaller busted frame that I can't wear. It really is an actual annoyance that truly does limit your clothing options. Plus, boob size in and of itself isn't really something you can brag about, imo, I think boob, uh niceness(?) is often not directly related to boob size, but that might just be my tastes.   The dream.   I bought couple of this guy's posters and it was kinda awkward when they arrived at my parents' house and my Mum was all "what's in the poster tube, train_subject3902?" Plus my bf doesn't want them up in our house so it's like, really hard being surrounded by basics, yaknow?   Fucking hell.   - I want so badly to get one of the PhD projects I have applied for, and then funding for said project. So far things have gone well (knock on wood) and I've worked hard on my applications, research proposals etc.  - I also need to feel better about knowing that ultimately the decision is out of my hands, and to know that I'll be ok if I don't end up being able to start a PhD this September. Basically just be more chill in general with things that may or may not happen, not holding my breath and missing out on the present.  - Get back in to drawing, crafting etc., not worry about producing stuff that is 'good enough', just enjoying it for the reasons I did when I was a kid/teenager   Actually, the helmets have a patch of velcro inside for this very reason, which is oddly reassuring to know   Dear God there's a section where the discussion just breaks down into an awkward childfree flirting/pairing off *shudders*  Disclaimer: You know what, I may not have kids either, but I sure as hell don't consider that to be some massive achievement, nor do I feel the need to spend my 20s circlejerking on the internet about how much kids apparently ruin your life   Man how I wish my pigs were this chill about getting their nails clipped :p   Mine can't stand it, they are happy enough sitting on my lap, or being petted on their terms, but not being picked up. One of mine in particular will make such a loud squeaky protest and wriggle all over the place whenever I do so. So I generally avoid doing it unless I have to; usually I will just give them a quick pick up to give them a look over each day and leave it at that if I can.   From what I can tell from my own pigs and what I've read of other peoples' experiences, they generally stay this way for the most part, regardless of how tame they eventually get. My pigs will happily run up to me when they are out for floor time or whatever, and will let me feed and pet them by hand, but the second I try to pick them up they scarper.  One piece of advice I can give is to try and pick them up by way of some sort of intermediate item between your hand and the pig. For example, try ushering them into a box or a piggie snug or whatever you have, and then carefully lift that with them inside. They tend to find that much less stressful.  TL:DR, don't worry about it, it's pretty normal for them to dislike being picked up :)   I wish   It's true, all other men are terrible yoloswagfags apart from you, I've been so blind! Thank you kind sir, dumping my current bf right now  Edit: *tips lady fedora*   btw am a grill XDDD   "Iiiiiii'm Mamrie Hart" ...I hate myself and my terrible Youtube viewing habits   Totally would listen :)   Purple Smart, Yellow Quiet, Tree Kicker, Song Smile, Squiggly Tail, Speedy Cloud   :3   Came here to post this quote. My absolute favourite :3   Sadly, not many people in developing countries have the option to know what their child will be like before it is born. I think we take a lot of our medical care for granted, in many wealthy countries it is a given pretty much that you'll be able to have multiple scans and so on before bringing your baby to term. For all we know this girls'  parents had no idea what sort of condition their child would be born in...   God it's bad enough they have to work themselves and each other up into a paranoid bitter frenzy online, why they gotta hate on other people who are actually enjoying their own sex lives?   It's unfair that you got downvoted for that, good for you for deleting them, buddy :)   My boyfriend makes fun of me all the time because of my "pocket satsumas", and all the fruit I have stashed on my person. Perhaps there are many of us ^I ^hope ^so, ^^we ^^healthy ^^^as ^^^fuck   Why?   Aww she's so adorable. Grats on your new piggie, do you have any plans to get her a cagemate or two? Guinea pigs are happiest when they have at least one other buddy to live with.  As for the drinking thing, I'd just leave her with the option to have both water sources for now. What with moving to a new home and everything she's probably got enough changes to deal with for the time being. In the meantime just listen out for the sound of her drinking from the bottle (it tends to be noisy enough for me to hear from another room) or look out to see if she uses it, or just keep an eye on the water level.   There's no real need for her to use a bottle over a bowl if she refuses to use the bottle, however, so I wouldn't worry too much. Best of luck :)   I'm going to need this as a motivational wallpaper   My God I hope I never have to squeeze out one that big...   Such a simple idea, love it. Best of luck :)   Seconded, coming out is stressful and to be having that kind of reaction, it must be pretty tough. I know it probably seems like empty reassurance to say things like "well if they treat you like this over something like that then screw them" because, well, it doesn't make things any less lonely for you. But you sit tight there and just know that you've done literally nothing wrong, k? :)   Again from me over here I've got nothing but sympathy, it feels horrible to be uncomfortable and insecure about your body, or part of it. And, just like society places horrible pressure on women to look attractive, I do think it's sad that small peenies are *sometimes* the butt of a few jokes here and there.  But I have to admit that, as someone who has dated guys with a range of penis sizes, I JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT PENIS SIZE. I'm also willing to bet that the majority of women don't either. Apart from the ones that are basically female versions of TRPers. Seriously, using your own bodily insecurities as fuel for a bitterness and AWALT rant, that is truly some next level self-improvement, nice job, guys /s     In all serious if you're having feelings of harming yourself, please consider talking to someone you feel comfortable doing so with. If you don't feel like sharing those feelings with someone close to you then please contact a helpline or something.    Hear hear, all the guys in my friendship groups who subscribe to TRPer-esque beliefs are generally under confident, and it's a big shame. I too am finding it hard to jerk anymore. These guys are just sad, angry, and vulnerable, and need to know that the world is, for the most part, not a scary and exploitative place.  Edit: missed-out letter   Yes, I think I prefer this quote :)   Wasn't this in the extended version? I only have the extended dvds so I'm not sure what's in the regular versions and what isn't anymore   I think that must be part of what makes it so insidious for a lot of men who are unsure about themselves and their masculinity. If you have some group like TRP telling you what it means to be a man, and you feel insecure about your masculinity to begin with, of course you're going to want to conform to that. Then if you add on top of that the fact that anyone who expresses doubts is met with "you only feel doubts because that's what the nasty feeeemales and matriarchy have made you think" it must be so confusing. Kind of like in an overly religious community when you have doubts but have been told to ignore them because they were just put there by the devil. Or whatever.   All hail Chad. His inclusion wasn't necessary at all, why do they always have to illustrate their point with these ridiculous stories? Like, his entire post could basically just be: "sometimes I worry that a woman could make a false rape claim out of spite, perhaps even over something as trivial as the sex being bad". Sure it would be a fucking ridiculous worry to have, but I could maybe even sympathise with someone who'd read so much hate and bullshit online that this was their genuine fear.   When I first started reading TRP stuff it genuinely scared me but now it honestly doesn't bother me so much. These people can't mean these things that they say, it's just a platform for them to sound off when they're feeling moody, and the things they have been coming out with lately have just been getting more and more insane. No one in their right mind could type that out of pure sincerity and if they do (truly believe what they are saying), well, there are also people on the internet who believe we are being ruled by lizard men, and I'm not about to get upset over them either.  But no, for reals, I don't think these people inhabit the same social world that everyone else does...     Love it! This really brightened my morning, keep up the great work; I can't wait to see you really get into the swing of things   This would actually be a decent Kickstarter idea for getting the band going, plus I would love one too :3    modern women have been brainwashed to believe that male extramarital sex is an indication of lack of commitment   this makes sense since this is a real threat to her husband's commitment to her  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHICH ONE IS IT?!   These people are broken :(   This genuinely spooks me   Yes! Also I've seen plenty of comments about how, "ok, if you want to breastfeed in public at least don't do it in an ostentatious manner"  1) I have never seen a woman whip out her boobs in anything other than a "right let's get this job done" kind of way. Because that's what feeding a baby is, a repetitive job you need to do so many times a day. I'm pretty sure most breastfeeding mothers are, like all parents of young children, more concerned with just getting through a bunch of childcare and other tasks so they can get on with their day. There is, and never has been anything glamarous and "teehee, everyone look at my tits" about breastfeeding.  2) As an owner of a pair of female breasts, I don't *want* strangers to look at them in public, and I'm pretty sure that's not going to change if I ever start lactating. I don't understand this fear some people have that "oh no, she's going to get her boobs right out and force us all to look right at them!", don't these people realise that most women in that situation would rather be discrete? Even so, fucks sake, if you see a nipple out in public, big fucking deal, right?  So, yes, what you said, amen.  /rant   I'm not sure if you have a particular style in mind but I've found this website to be a great resource for learning Gregg shorthand  http://gregg.angelfishy.net/anunit01.shtml   Right. Except it's obvious here that's she's done far more than simply putting on a Speedo and dying her hair. A lot of effort goes into recreating costumes and I honestly don't see why this post is getting such passionate negative responses (though thankfully only from a couple of people)   I do this! Glad to hear someone else thinks it's good advice and not just paranoia :p   Oh wow, I didn't realise just how much trouble Frank Herbert had trying to get published (apologies for being such a dirty casual :p). That's pretty inspiring in a way, thank goodness he got published in the end...   I got my guinea pigs just at the start of summer when I was still living in Edinburgh. For those familiar with the city, basically every year there is a huge arts, comedy, literature, etc. festival that runs for many weeks in the summer. Almost every evening during this there are fireworks set off from the castle.  My piggies seemed to handle them ok, which was great considering that my flat was fairly central and so the fireworks were pretty loud for us. Maybe they'd be a bit startled by the first one each evening and scoot back into their hut, but they didn't seem anymore bothered than they would be say, if someone were to come into the room without warning. Keep an eye on them but so long as they have someplace to hide and feel safe should they need it, I'd say don't worry too much. :3   I'd say food colouring would probably be a safe bet. Otherwise anything 'child friendly' such as powder paint, that can be safely ingested   Aww. May I ask how the introduction went? My boyfriend is very set on the idea of getting a kitten some time in the new year but we're a little unsure about how the kitten/guinea pig relationship will play out.   Ahaha, I came straight to this sub to post this very video :p Great minds think alike and all that...   As someone who has spent the last year in Edinburgh constantly hearing it pronounced 'Edinboro' by American tourists, I can confirm this.   Oh shit guise all of RP is tru what have we done?! /s   Recently I've been getting into mindfulness and shit, and all that kind of 'self-improvement' stuff. Mostly I started it to try improve my concentration, and other very functional reasons like that.  If anything one of the unlooked-for effects has been that I feel much calmer and accepting of other people, more empathetic and trusting...   Basically what I'm trying to say is that I've clearly fucked up here and am obviously not doing self-improvement right. Can someone please tell me how to reverse this and start improving myself through hate?  Plz k thanx guys xxx    Reality  Lel.   I don't use Tumblr and am not very in the loop about what is and what isn't Tumblr-esque so yeah, maybe there are more of those sort of jokes there than on Reddit...? ^my ^^fucking ^^^bad ^^^^I ^^^^^guess...?   THIS HAPPENED! :D :D :D   Oh hey some of this research was done at my undergrad uni. I took a module by one of the main Face Lab researchers on facial attractiveness that was really interesting, not least of all because I do occasionally see TRPers misunderstanding a couple of his papers (see: "she is so going to cheat on you when she's ovulating" discussions). But yes, basically 'biotruths' are not something you want to live your life worrying about. The TL:DR of it is that individual humans may be born with certain shared tendencies to find certain features attractive, but primarily we are a species that develops mostly in terms of our own personal experiences, the family and people we grow up around, the type of environment in which we live... Basically we are an adaptive species, and like how we are not born knowing a specific language or culture, but rather with the ability to learn these things based on our formative experiences, so too it is with sexual attraction. Way more efficient and adaptable, right?  Anyway, I highly recommend you guys read "*In Your Face*" if you're interested in learning more about human attraction to faces, how we process faces, all that stuff. It's a very enjoyable and accessible book, as all good pop sci should be :3   In all seriousness this is something that has bothered me for a while. I would consider myself fairly traditionally, conventionally feminine looking, I guess, but many men and boys DO like women of all kinds. Hairyness, short hair, butch characteristics of one kind or another, whatever. Basically, you name it and someone out there is attracted to it, no matter how 'unconventional'.  However, TRP philosophy teaches men that it's not ok to like something that might not be considered 'conventional', or that it is shameful, or betrays their low alfafaness. If I ever have a son I want him to feel comfortable liking whatever aesthetics he likes in other people, not to be shamed into feeling like he can only be attracted to a very narrowly defined 'type' of woman or man. If he just so happens to find only conventionally feminine women attractive, well, good for him, but I'll be damned if a bunch of bitter creeps on the internet shame him into feeling bad about his tastes.  It's honestly as though TRPers are scared that women are one day going to think "aww man, without all these societal pressures on me to look good I better stop taking care of my body, stop shaving and then force men who don't find me attractive to have sex with me. They won't be able to say no or I'll just cry misogyny, MWAHAHAH!"    Bit rich coming from Reddit, the spiritual home of all "white girls/women/white women with this particular type of haircut/horsey girls/moms be like..." jokes...   Haha, oh wow yes that's it! Gosh it even has Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it...in fairness my knowledge of horror movies is crazy weak. Thanks :D  Edit: and yes, I am currently searching through it on youtube for the guinea pig part, although maybe I'm remembering that from something else, it was a very minor detail...   I have this dim memory of one time seeing an oldish film on tv when I was little, it's just been bothering me recently because I have no idea what exactly went on in it and what it was called. As an adult it'd be cool to finally know what the hell this half-remembered movie was. I have no idea if it's some really popular story I for some reason haven't heard of, or some obscure B movie that barely anyone ever saw, but hopefully someone will be able to help me out here.   I think it was set in the Victorian or Edwardian period, though I could be wrong. From what I recall, the main character is a scientist who somehow comes into possession of a corpse. For whatever reason, this corpse comes back to life when reanimated, maybe the scientist put some crazy life-giving elixir on it, no idea.  One detail I'm sure I remember is that the corpse somehow falls out of a window and into a water trough, thereby becoming completely soaked and, for some reason, murderously dangerous. Not sure how exactly the film resolves itself.   Bonus info: at one point I'm sure I remember the scientist being in his dark lab and having a cage of guinea pigs that he was exposing to a flashing light...?  Hopefully this film actually happened and isn't just the product of my messed up child's brain. Any ideas?   I like this approach and could definitely do with adopting it myself.   I especially like it because it means that if I don't like a book, *it remains unread* and so there's still that chance that some time down the line I might think "hey maybe I'll give it a go again" and find that, coming at it at a different time or from a different perspective, I might still have a chance to 'click' with it in a way I wouldn't have on the first reading. Much better than battling through it joylessly and then forever thinking "yeah, I read that book, it was suck".   The top one has the face of a tiny kangaroo! :3   The thing is I literally cannot think of any other message this stock photo could be intended to convey than the one OP gave it in its caption, stock photographers are getting crazy specific...   This is Reddit, people here joke all day long about females and children getting raped, because "sheesh can't you take a bit of off-colour humour?!". Make one joke about men getting raped and you're public enemy number one.  Not passing any judgement on that, just saying that's pretty much how things normally go in the main subs.   That's cool about the interview, best of luck :)  I'm in the middle of a bunch of job applications and interviews myself, not exactly enjoying it :p but I need money and something to do for this year in between finishing my masters degree and hopefully starting a PhD next September. So much uncertainty.  Any chance we could see your photography website? I could do with a little break and something cool to look at :)  	66
 Well I lied I still gamble here and there lol.   I've told my coworkers and no ones ever judged me. What other people think doesn't matter. Its what you know matters. The people who matter will care and understand and the ones who don't care it will show. I see it as a gift  because it is weeding out the people that don't matter. But it is also something we have to live with. Life is about learning from our mistakes and moving on. Addiction has shown me that I can live a normal sane life without drugs or alcohol or gambling and I take it as a gift and a learning point.   Hi there thanks for reaching out that is definitely taking the right step. I used drugs for about 8 years and finally came to a point where I had to stop. Your at a point where you seem like you want to end it. I would suggest trying out a local AA or NA meeting and linking with sober people. You need sober support and if you want you can Pm and I will recommend a few books. Your still addicted you need to acknowledge and move forward with recovery and you will feel much happier.   Whats kept me sober is cutting out people I would get high with completely. Reaching out to sober people when I needed help. Reading books. Reminding myself that I should be grateful because life could be 100x worse if I never stopped. Helping others with addiction, connecting with people. Not being self centered. Which has always been hard for me.     	4
 I honestly can't point to a specific trigger for why I got depressed. I always had days where I was really sad/down my entire life. Those days somehow slowly turned into multiple consecutive days, then weeks, then a full on depression. I also had miserable coping skills with conflicts/problems which didn't really help. I worried about everything really, my lack of any successful relationship, being a virgin, fucking up my college degree, the people I had dissappointed, the oportunities I had missed, what I could have done different ... pointless worrying really about stuff I should have just accepted.   I tried therapy twice, once during my 2nd hospital stay, which was helpful for getting a bit more insight into the underlying problems, and then again during the last year, which was absolutely pointless - a lot of talking about my problems and what I could do about them ... I found it rather useless, I always knew what to do and what my issues where, I just didn't manage to actually do what needed to be done.  I told my parents pretty early, but avoided telling them about a lot of the gory details and how bad it really was. My parents were fantastic the whole time ... I told some close friends too, but only very superficial information.    	1
 Great as always, and ditto on "as a woman I shouldn't even try to fight off children". I mean like dafuq? It's not like they were YOUR children!   Another Zoidberg fan here! I really like Billy West's choice of voice for Zoidberg. Even very mundane lines can sound very funny. I remember laughing hysterically in that parallel universe episode when one of the Zoidbergs said "The box says no" when asked to give it to the other Zoidberg.  But as in cases with most fictional characters, I may find him to be incredibly annoying in real life. Also quite scary given his lobster-like apperance :p   And Family Guy was saying how Charlie Brown sold crack to Snoopy and he overdosed on it! ALL MAKES SENSE NOW   Ahhh I see. Thanks. Looks like I was overthinking it haha   I love the fact that fans are still cosplaying Futurama characters after the show ended. The legacy lives on!   Oh my god! Thanks for posting. I thought the whole thing was original. Family Guy also parodied this but I never knew where it'd come from until now!   I feel kind of dumb, but I never really understood the gag point of that dialogue. :( I always thought Frankie actually was a cafeteria worker and the robot (that was showing Fry around) was confused that he was one of the patients.   "Shut up baby, I know it."  "*Kif sighs*"  "YOU ALL HAVE ZOIDBERG"   Agreed. I love Zoidberg (as my flair connotes) and episodes like "Why must I be a crustacean in love" was pretty strong but that had huge help from Fry, Leela, and Bender as well.   I feel this way about life... I could use some Futurama right now :(   "And stop sighing so much!"   Your costume rocks!! I hope he spoke to you in Zapp Brannigan's voice.   It's difficult for others to understand what real clinical depression feels like because the term is used so casually by people who are having a bad day. But really, you can't go tell a cancer patient "change your attitude about things and your cancer will go away". Some have it better and find counseling to be the key to getting over depression for good but the rest of us... we bear it for the rest of our lives and hope nothing exacerbates it.   Happy birthday, gsp2! I wish I knew your first name to say that instead of your ID. I feel like I got to this thread a bit late, so I hope you had a better day today.   I can relate to you in some part. Especially telling people that I don't care but in fact I do care. The important thing is though that you're doing something. And anger, though unhealthy in large doses, can be evidence of better things. For instance you have a goal and motivation to achieve it so you are frustrated by slow progress. But hang in there, and try to keep it up. And don't beat yourself up too hard. Leave that to the strangers on the internet.   I can't physically stop you but won't you at least talk to us?   I understand it's difficult to have a job when you lack motivation, but would you care to try finding something that you can do without a lot of social interaction? Perhaps something you can do over the internet. Having something to do can provide distractions.   I used to be nihilistic. And then one day I thought to myself: there is no point in being nihilistic itself. All these thoughts, moments spent in deep introspection, it's all for naught. It's meaningless to think about how meaningless life is. So I began to do something else. Watch movies. Go shopping. Do homework (I was in univ at the time). Sleep. I occupied my mind with other stuff and I became less fixated on the meaninglessness of my life.   That would make a great name.   "I probably would've smoked, I don't know, RAISINS, if someone told me it got me high". And now it's CARROTS!   I don't know why you were downvoted so hard. I enjoyed the episode personally (I just liked seeing Amy and Leela go crazy) but everyone's entitled to their opinion...   Ahhh you're right. I think I was thinking of Osgiliath. Time to hit the books again!   I actually conducted [a poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/351gpp/poll_the_empire_or_the_stormcloaks_did_you_kill/) and was surprised to find that more people (those who participated in the poll anyway) chose to side with the Empire. I thought the Stormcloaks would be more popular.   I'm more surprised by the amount of gold Belethor has! Did you buy that much from him or is it from the speechcraft perks?   I'm more into sword-fighting so I chose Red Guard. Red Guards have versatility when it comes to class so you can be a spellsword if you'd like to combine some magic into your battle. I don't like being too much of a glass canon... I'm too clumsy for that :p   That is so awesome. I watched a video clip of Jason Mamoa's appearance when the whole cast members were being interviewed at a comic-con during (or right after?) S1 and he had the full eye makeup done, memorized his Dothrakii lines from the show... He was amazing. I really appreciate when the actors respond to the fans' hype with equal amount of enthusiasm.   Agreed. I mean he still gets "hero" buffs and walks away from wounds that would cripple most men but that was certainly a nice touch, adding to the white walkers having supernatural powers. Not even the heroes are safe -- but then again no one is safe under GRRM's pen.   I was hoping the giant would use the dragon glass to fend off the white walkers... But guess he didn't need them after all; his feet were just as effective.   Edit: was thinking of Osgiliath but I'll just leave my comment as it was...   I can definitely relate to the Minas Tirith scene. I love the Khazad Dum and Helms Deep scenes as well, but the battle at Minas Tirith had extra desperation to the atmosphere because Frodo was there. (I hope I'm remembering this correctly; been a while since I read the books / watched the movies.) Much more at stake, and we had Faramir who didn't entirely trust Frodo and Sam. So yeah, I can definitely see why it made you think of Minas Tirith.   I was really afraid that he'd die and the white walkers would have a giant on their side. Looks like he made it out of there though? I really hope so :(   People always joked about "and how far have whitewalkers come exactly? WHEN THE HELL IS WINTER COMING" and tonight we all got what we've been waiting for. Brilliant sequence.   One misdeed is enough to undo a hundred good ones.  Namely, you can kill evil dragons and save the entire world but that's not gonna give you a break when you accidentally pick up a jug at a general goods store.   I know it's just a series of quests but as someone who'd rather hack and slash with a sword than practice magic, I have no freakin idea why they chose me as the arch mage. Were they like, "fuck it I don't want this responsibility. let the Dragornborn do it. She's used to doing chores anyway."   Do regale us with tales of guests taken by surprise!   Let me guess... someone stole your sweetroll.   What was her name? Lift-up-her-tail? That looks like a product of so much effort. The head is really freaky... in a good way! Really captures the, uh, Argonian charm.    I like random fighters that I meet on the road. They taunt me while wearing expensive armour and stuff. Thanks bud, always appreciate donations.  Of course, I would kill Nazeem for that Cloud District crap but I like having NPCs around no matter how annoying they are...   And meanwhile that Dragonborn of mine is occupied with building a house. Vampire Lord at large? Fuck that, I gotta expand my main hall.   Done. Gotta say though, the other one about gamer psychology didn't seem like it was applicable to me since I don't play TES Online. Anyway I hope my participation helps. Best of luck to your study!   "Bloody good payment! Now go, and please your husband like never before!"   Nice! I got a cookbook by authors of the Inn at the Crossroad for GoT food. I'm still biding my time to get appropriate ingredients. I'm living in Asia right now and some of the herbs are hard to get here :(   I was expecting to see a Garfield mod haha   "From now on, you'll be called WIGGLES!"  Also you have an awesome sister.   Thank you so much for posting links to the recipes. Saved!   Isn't cultural appropriation stealing from other cultures and presenting them as though they're your own? In most cases I've seen accused of cultural appropriation OPs were just appreciating what they learned from other cultures. I'm all for cultural diversity and appropriate respect but people get so sensitive sometimes. And I'm a non-white person always subconsciously on the lookout for subtle racism!    What are petals made of? They look so perfect!   It's very hard to capture it but I LOVE when I see a cat smile like that in excitement! S/he's very pretty 3   Yeah the books had it worse for Robb... And you spend more time reading the books getting to know the character so I suppose it adds to the pain :(   It's funny how his death felt even more tragic than Robb's in some way...   Great story and awesome music. But I wish the game mechanics were a bit better...   I LOVE THE LOGIN THEME...   He's the type of person that's really sexy but there's something about him that neutralizes it a bit. I feel like I would actually enjoy hanging out with him. But I've also heard from a reliable source that he knows nothing so conversation-wise he might not be that fun.   That's a fitness regime I can actually follow!   While I find Kit gorgeous myself, I agree with you on Tormund. Hot damn. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T FOOK A BERR   I guess that's yours now.   My first choices are already up here so I'll add some of the lesser ones, probably corny.  "Become Vengeance, David. Become... wrath." Se7en  "They say evil prevails when good men fail to act. What they ought to say is, evil prevails." Lord of War     I love how the hobbits are the first to follow.   Similarly I love "you bow to no one". Makes me tear up.   I was surprised that some people found it cheesy. I loved that dialogue. people always say "hey nothing personal, no hard feelings right" It was personal to me you dick.   I love the fox photo that you linked but I love [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206395673/sand-dunes-photo-with-beach-grass-and?ref=shop_home_feat_1) so much... I can just see this in a haute living magazine!   I seriously need the Angry Dome from time to time...   Now you've given me an evil idea and my cat will hate you for it XD   Awesome in general, but "antivirus in the darkness" part got to me especially. Well done.   This photo makes me d'aww and sad at the same time. I wish I could be at ease around my dad like these cubs.   He spent most of his time working when I was little and I had little time to get to know him. He was always the Patriarch, Mr. Big-shot at his office, that I respected and feared at the same time. Now that he's retired he gets really hissy when he wants to assert his dominance. His chauvinism annoys me but also makes me sad to see him desperately cling onto his faded glory.  Curious a photograph of a lion and his cubs should bring complicated emotions...   I love your interpretation of the photo.   Yup, I made sure I carried those after getting quite a scare once. As for shrines, I haven't come across a lot of shrines outside towns and "official" shrines. And thanks for the recipe! It's crazy but I don't think I've discovered that despite all the time I spent mixing stuff together :p I still have so many properties to learn about ingredients...   Jeff, uh, finds a way...   I adored this dress. But at the same time I worried about the train (is that what it's called? the part that trails behind her) getting dirty.   That is a very interesting take on the game play. I've read people favouring walking over fast-traveling to be immersed in the environment and atmosphere (with which I wholeheartedly agree) but I never thought about the prospect of vampirism and whatnot. I don't think I have the metaphorical balls for it yet but it sounds like something I should try out later on.   That is some find looking dude. Looks like a true Dragonborn in the sense that he is of the Reptilian descent!   Gaargghh now that I've seen your achievement I must CATCH THEM ALL :D I'm level 40-something but I waste time making potions that I probably don't use, catching butterflies... Serana is probably waiting for me day and night wondering where I am. I should really get behind getting all the dragon priest masks and claws...   Stones of Barenziah Quest Markers  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9385  It is also in the Steam workshop, one of the most most subscribed mods.   Oh yeah, I remember the Vegas part. Too bad he left... He tied everything together.   That is so pretty! Congratulations. I have quite a bit to go myself. The silver one reminds me of death masks from the first Resident Evil installment.   Agree completely. He's someone I'd find obnoxious and extremely rude in real life (like many fictional characters) but is hilarious on screen. I also don't like how they casually wrote him off saying he left the country with the girl who had a baby for another job or something.   You made me tear up a little at the bus stop. It's not the films or the company itself that makes Disney special. It's people like you. Thanks for making a dream come true for the girl and her family.   I've watched too many GoT episodes recently; I thought he was gonna say "stop trying to kill everyone".   Add me to the group of people waiting for photos of your rats! I would love to see them :D   I totally read the title as Cat and thought you named him (her?) ironically. This is when I realize I'm a total cat person XD You have an adorable little rat. Did the little guy finish it all in one seating?   Someone turn this into a webcomic... It would make a lovely series.   To me, Hiddleston is a guy that you bring to meet your parents. Kit is a guy that you would invite to a threesome with Tom.   3  Call me crazy but I see some resemblance between Kit Harrington and Markiplier. Makes me enjoy his LPs even more.   "Here lies Dragonborn, the Bane of Alduin, slain by a Mudcrab."   Shadowmere sure thinks they pose valid threat... That horse always runs off to fight them while I fight stronger enemies. TEAMWORK   I've stayed off modding Skyrim to enjoy the vanilla to the fullest first, so I can't tell if you're joking or if this is really a thing. If so then that's awesome!   She does! That's adorable. I thought you perhaps meant to make it sound like espoir.   Wow. I think it's good enough to be featured in her official cook book. Well done!   Why did I click this at lunch hour with no way to get sushi... I imagine my first attempt won't be nearly as neat as yours. Rice everywhere!   I envy you but at the same time worry that it might cause considerable shoulder pain... Maybe not that heavy a guy? :p   Aww that's too bad. But thanks for letting me know all the same.   Yeah, I really like the striking b/w. If you can scan it and photoshop colour it maybe? Anyways I hope to see more of your work in the future :)   I absolutely love the DB hoodie! Wonder they shIP internationally?   Agreed. It's more fun, I get to try out / practice champs I don't usually play, etc. I don't get emotionally invested in these games either.   I was like "please don't be League, please don't be League... SONNABABITCH"   The funny thing is though, it wasn't like he was flaming people for allegedly costing him a game like usual trolls do. It's a freakin' friends request to a stranger he's never met... Goddamn. This kid has real issues. I'm even more embarrassed by the fact that he's from my province :(   I had to stare to make sure if it wasn't just optical illusion. He looks healthy otherwise! Get ready to be ruled over by this little cutie, OP! :D And do keep us posted! I would love to see his progress pics as he grows.   So unique! It looks great as it is, but do you plan to colour it by any chance? Missandei in particular looks like she'll look even more beautiful with some vibrant colours.  By the way when I read the title I was like "NOO Missandei wouldn't steal Dany's man!" XD   Welcome, neighbour! High five from Canada :D   Yup. I think the most important thing is a sense of drive and perseverance to follow that. /edit: typo   [Higher Resolution](http://i.imgur.com/Tenl0wD.jpg) for the extra goodness   It's inspiring to see people that make relationships work through patience and hard work. Kudos to both of them!   As someone living in Korea I can guaran-fucking-tee that she eventually did.   Never thought I would say this but that's adorable. Congratulations on having an awesome relationship! I really love how you two feel totally comfortable with each other to have this kind of thing.  And I don't think you guys are unfit to be parents if you ever change your mind about having kids.   [Just in case the joke is lost...](https://youtu.be/mv3ScKLD1Vc?list=PLLoWhJJEjzXl0jfiQjuVuJkVe0gGpYstU)   I can just feel how safe and comfortable she is around you. Thank you for providing her with a great home! I really love the picture of her with her big bro and sis. I wish my cat could have siblings... ;_;  	103
 I totally agree. I stopped looking at that sub because all the top posts are boring no makeup makeup looks. Or its a picture of a girl who is like "my eyeshadow was on point today" but you can barely see her eyeshadow but she's pretty so everyone upvotes it. I'm sick of muacirclejerk too because it's just pictures of boobs.   Oh no :( Well hopefully this pill works out. If it lasts more than a few weeks I'll probably change it. I haven't been on birth control in a few years so maybe my body just isn't used to it.    That's good! Hopefully that's what happens to me. I'm on an emotional roller coaster right now.    I didn't know there was an adjustment period, I'll stick with it. I see my doctor again in three months for a check in so I'll let her know if I'm still having problems. Thanks a lot for the info!    I know :( I was on the depo shot for a while but ballooned up 20 pounds. Then my doctor said it probably wasn't the shot that made me gain weight. Oh well. I lost it all once I got off the shot so who knows...    I use neem oil and have never felt it sting. It's possible it's because your skin is dry. You probably don't need to stop using it.    Is [this](http://imgur.com/ypWepIV) KP? That's my calf. I normally use some kind of lotion for KP but I haven't for the past few days, and my legs look like this. It's really annoying!    Thanks for the info! I'm going to download a period tracker app since I know some of them allow you to track moods and make notes on certain days. I've been on two types of bc pills before with no issues like this but I can't remember what they were called, but both of them completely ruined my sex drive anyway. Ugh!       Well that totally gave me some clarity. Someone on the street the other day called me "sir" and I felt like I was punched in the gut, I wanted to cry. It makes sense now why people get upset about misgendering.    What are you even talking about    Yeah, the only guy I knew named craig wore the same clothes literally every single day. He was weird as fuck.    I live alone and this happens to my shower all the time... I'm gross.    This is fucking hilarious.    Oh that's really interesting. They're always kept in pretty small enclosures at the pet store with a ton of them together, so I assume that just exacerbates the smell!    My neighbors when I was a kid had two ferrets and they'd always come over to chat with us while their ferrets hung out on their shoulders! Super cute but smelly! Then it turned out the wife was cheating and they got a divorce... No more ferrets :( I always wanted one buy my mom said they smell too bad.    How do you train your dog as a therapy dog? I assume it differs by state or country.    That is so cute! I wish my school had therapy dogs during finals!    Hilarious. I'm using this in the future.    Eh, people hold weight differently. There's a cool image of women who all weigh 150 and are the same height, and they look totally different.    I'm curious about how long spot treatments are supposed to take to reduce acne. I really do not notice a difference between using a spot treatment on a pimple and not using one at all. They still take the same amount of time to go away no matter what I do.  I have tried using diluted tea tree oil, BP 2.5%, BP 10%, the aztec clay mask, a 2% salicylic acid lotion, neem oil, and the Burts Bees Blemish Stick.   I would almost like to take pictures of my acne and compare how quickly pimples fade with each treatment vs. no treatment. If anything spot treatments just irritate my face.   So...what should I do? I'm basically going back to square one with my face (using very basic products) and slowly reintroducing products because I'm sort of at a loss for what to do with my skin.   Because then they can't circle jerk about trashy eyebrows.    I would contact your medical provider to discuss your medication. Your anxiety should be getting better, not worse. It can take a while to find the right medication, but please do contact your doctor.    You need to discuss with your mom that you are experiencing anxiety. It's difficult for people to understand why you may not be going to school other than assuming you are lazy or a bad kid.   Sometimes parents need other adults to explain anxiety to them. Speaking with your school counselor about your anxiety, or a teacher that you trust, can help you get the help you deserve and need. If you have a friend who you trust, take them with you.   You deserve to have a good education and to do so in an environment you feel comfortable. I never told my parents about my anxiety and looking back I wish that I had, because I would have learned coping mechanisms a lot sooner.   Good luck!    Awesome job! I think anxiety makes us catastrophize. We envision that the speech won't go well, we'll have panic attacks, etc. Focus on your success in this one! You've come a long way, and you will only get better with practice.    I like to double check that my makeup is removed after cleansing by taking a small piece of tissue paper or a cotton ball and wipe it on different areas of my face. If there's no residue left over I'm good!    Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone have any recommendations for an at-home wax kit? I'd like to start waxing some areas on my face, my legs, and most importantly my bikini region. I don't want to spend a fortune if it turns out my skin can't handle waxing, since I've never done it before. But, I also don't want to get a cheap product that isn't effective.   Also, I use AHAs and BHAs sometimes on my legs to help with my KP - will that make my skin more sensitive to waxing?   Thanks!   You can find the Alpha Hydrox line at a drugstore - I bought mine at Walgreens. They have a lotion that is 10% glycolic acid. If you do pick it up remember it's much stronger than the St. Ives so you'd have to work up slowly to see if your face can tolerate it. The bottle says to use it twice a day but that's insane - I would use it 3x a week or less to start off.   [Here](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=5992) is some information on the product. They also sell products like pads that have 14% glycolic acid.    The cleanser can probably remove most makeup on your face but you might have a tough time removing eye makeup like mascara or anything waterproof. I picked up a bottle of Neutrogena Oil-Free makeup remover and I swipe my eyes with a cotton ball and then go in with my OCM routine.   Any oil-free makeup remover would probably be effective if your face doesn't agree with mineral oil.    A man basket is a really good idea! It would also be super cute to leave a note in my SOs work bag so he can find it...  Thanks for the tip. I really liked the one post on TrollX about the boyfriend who left the girl a basket of origami cranes that had little reasons why he loves her...it was so cute! Maybe I could put a bunch of those in the man basket too with his favorite beer and something else...   Meh, I think it's pretty normal. Also I'm pretty attached to my kitty despite her being a dick since she was around during my separation and divorce - and weirdly enough was a LOT better behaved when I was a complete emotional wreck.   No problem! I got advice from /r/wicked_edge and /r/ladyshavers.   No, the Witch hazel does not sting. I have heard of people using rubbing alcohol to inhibit bacteria but I find that stings too much, and it's very drying.   I really do recommend getting a razor where you can use double edge blades. That way you can use a fresh blade each time. If you'd like you could use a new disposable razor each time but buying a DE razor with blades will be much cheaper in the long run.   I use the Dove deodorant which is fragrance free, I think it's the go sleeveless kind. It will say fragrance free or for sensitive skin on it.    So my procedure for removing hair down there is:  * Soak in the tub or shower for 15-20 minutes to soften hair.  * Exfoliate area with exfoliating gloves.  * Apply mineral oil to hair.  * Let oil sit for a few minutes.  * Use a fresh blade with my double edge razor (you can find recommendations on /r/wicked_edge)  * Shave with the grain, then horizontally, then against the grain if there is no irritation. I pass along the hair 2-3 times only. The fresh sharp blade helps a lot with this.  * Wash area clean, then pat dry.  * Dab area with witch hazel. * Swipe area with a deodorant stick (the no fragrance kind) that I bought specifically for after shaving down there.  * To prevent ingrown hairs I swipe with stridex pads when I use them on my face at night.   I don't get ingrown hairs but sometimes the area can still get irritated. A fresh blade and a double edge razor was the thing that most improved the skin in that area.    People can never be reminded enough to patch test! You always think you have great skin that can tolerate anything and then one day bam!   Slow and steady is the best method for skin care!   Ouch. It's never fun when someone points out your acne. I had a friend whose dad for whatever reason always made fun of my acne and would say, "Why do you have so many pimples?" Like what the fuck man, I'm a teenager. It sucked.   Now that I'm older my acne has become more mild thank god. But still, I'll always remember the shit that guy said to me.    Do your hands touch your face in that area? Is that the side you talk on the phone?    They are hard to find :( I have only seen them on Amazon with varying prices. It's annoying!   So do you think if I get him something he wants that isn't really related to Valentine's Day he'll be happy with it? I'd get him a card too and write something sweet.    That's very true. I'm just confused because I feel like on someone's birthday and on Christmas you could them something they want, but Valentine's day has to be something cute and special. So, I do know what he likes, but I'm not sure it's appropriate for Valentine's Day.   We did make plans to go out for dinner, but he's buying!    I like the idea! He doesn't have a case for his phone and a leather one would look super classy! He does drink a lot of coffee too. Thanks for the suggestion!   Lol, that would be funny but he doesn't need a coupon to get a BJ!   That would be a good idea. There's a local hockey team he has been wanting to see so maybe I'll see about ticket prices :)   I got him one of those for his birthday! He loved it. Weirdly I told my parents I got him that and they said it was "weird" and that they wouldn't want one. Who wouldn't want a fruit bouquet?! Whatever, he liked it. But, that means I can't do it twice!   Haha every person I ask IRL says blowjob! But I mean, I give those regardless of the day, so it's not super special! I would definitely prefer something fancy, I'm thinking the meal is a good choice.    I do agree that it's a nice gift idea, just not sure if it's something I would get him on Valentine's Day! Maybe more of a birthday gift. Honestly now I want a pocket knife!   I totally agree. We can't really diagnose anything on here. Best to see at least another professional!   Aw, I figured! Balloons scare the crap out of my parent's dog too!   I think mine is just an attention whore who knows she gets pets if she bites. It's annoying but I'm not doing much to get her to stop.    You could try the Witch Hazel. I have never personally used ACV. I use Thayer's Witch Hazel and I don't find it does much other than keep my skin feeling fresh and moisturized.   Your skin looks very nice by the way! It is hard to see the white bumpiness, but it's possible it's normal.   Take a look at [this](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/exfoliators/8-aha-toner-652.html) product. It's an AHA, but it has a short ingredient list. It uses lactic acid to exfoliate the skin.   I looked into ACV for exfoliating and it's possible it could mildly exfoliate the skin.  Also, you can experiment with oils. Look into rose hip oil, castor oil, or hemp seed oil. From a quick google search people claim they help with redness. I was going to incorporate rose hip oil into my routine for my eye area as I have heard it helps with wrinkles!    Oh my gosh that's so sad :( Why are people always scaring their dogs!   My parents have a St. Bernard who is scared of bubble wrap and trash bags and a bunch of other weird stuff. It's so sad to see him scared! But take out the vacuum and he attacks that motherfucker like it owes him money. Dogs are weird.    Cuddle slut lol! That explains my cat perfectly.   I don't know, my cat is a huge asshole. She'll paw at my eyes with her claws out if I don't wake up when she wants. If I walk past her and get too close she either bites my legs or scratches at me. If she's laying on me and I try to adjust her she bites me. When I got her from the shelter they told me she bites but that they are gentle "love bites." NO. They are full on, I hate you bites.   She also throws up all the time, and she always does it on my pillow or my shoes.   My SOs cat is also a total prick who will sit on your chest and bite your face until you pet him. He also waits by the door and tries to run out at any chance he gets. That fucker bit my eyebrow one morning. My SO currently has a scratch down the side of his face from his asshole cat.   Weirdly enough I still like cats more than dogs, but that's probably because I'm really lazy.    Definitely! I've been on the hunt for a cheap product for my mild KP too. So far I've had good results from using AmLactin (but god the smell), the Alpha Hydrox, Gold Bonds Rough and Bumpy (this smells great!), and currently I'm using Cerave SA Renewing Cream (amazing). The only problem is price. The Cerave SA cream runs at 20 bucks a tub. Gah.    Not necessary! You can use both. Some people use them both on the same day, or they alternate days, depending on tolerance. A BHA is good for acne (it can be drying), and an AHA tends to be moisturizing and help improve skin texture. So they both do different things (you can check the sidebar for more info on AHAs and BHAs).   I second using an AHA, they are very effective!   The small white bumps could be closed comedones or they could be regular sebaceous filaments (which are normal). It's hard to tell without a picture.  Unfortunately I don't know how to get rid of redness or the bumps without a chemical exfoliator like an AHA or BHA. I do know that people praise neem oil (I use it!) but I don't know if it would help the bumps. I do find it quite moisturizing though and it seems to help my acne. Most people do find the smell pretty bad, but I like it!  I have also heard safflower oil as a decent oil for the skin. It's moisturizing and I have heard it can help acne.   You could think about incorporating an AHA (there are recommendations in the sidebar). It would improve your skin's texture and make it quite smooth, and possibly reduce the redness as well. However, it is not "natural."   Edit: You could invest in a konjac sponge for light physical exfoliation if you wanted.   Where do you get the acne? Hormonal acne is common along the jaw line. If you are on the pill your acne is probably not hormonal.  You could add a BHA to your routine. Stridex in the red box is quite popular, or you could look at Paula's Choice BHA gel (they have 1% or 2%, if your skin is quite sensitive I would use the 1%).   I believe the Clinique emergency gel lotion has 10% BP, which can be quite irritating. If you still want to use BP you could try something with 2.5% BP or 5% BP. Alternatively you can use diluted tea tree oil! You can add a drop or two to your moisturizer or dilute it in a carrier oil.   Also, make sure you are changing your pillow case every night or sleeping on a t-shirt/towel. Make note of where you get acne and see if you can think of any possible triggers. Depending on how long you've been on the pill you could see continued improvement.     Yes! I have this exact lotion and it broke out my face, so I started using it on my legs and arms. It's great for helping with KP.    I have heard some people use Evening Primrose Oil for hormonal acne. I would discuss this with your doctor because I'm not sure if there are any side effects of taking this, especially since you have an allergy. It may be worth looking into.    I would definitely stop using the Stridex. Your skin may not like salicylic acid. You could switch to Paula's Choice BHA 1% gel (Stridex pads have 2%) and use it a few times a week. Alternatively, you could switch to using an AHA that is very mild, like the St. Ives Exfoliating Pads.   What are your skin care goals? If you don't get acne, I would stick to simply keeping your skin moisturized and wear sunscreen daily.   Haha awesome :)    I'm the same way! My SO is the opposite and always needs to get shit done. By the time I wake up he's done laundry, cleaned the house, finished up some work he had to get done, shoveled the driveway... And I'm just relaxing in bed on Reddit lol. I try everything in my power to be as lazy as possible.    I would wash the area like normal and keep the area dry and clean.   I personally use stridex pads on my pubic area but avoid the labia area because it's very sensitive. If you do use it on your penis I would watch for any irritation. I have also heard witch hazel dabbed on areas where you shave helps with preventing ingrown hairs and irritation.   I recommend using a new blade each time you shave if you don't already.    I don't know why you are being down voted. I would avoid chemical exfoliating on my genital region because the skin is very sensitive.    But isn't this because people who drink a lot of coffee tend to work indoors and avoid the sun?    I mix my clay mask with water and it's still been working for me. I can imagine it would sting less with water, but if I have a lot of acne or irritation on my face the clay mask exacerbates that. You could try only putting the mask on problem areas. For example I always avoid the area under my nose because it stings too much.    I would invest in either a microfiber cloth or a konjac sponge so you can gently exfoliate your skin. I would also look into a chemical exfoliator, something like Stridex in the red box is very popular and works well. If your skin gets dry you might want to look into an AHA like the St. Ives exfoliating pads which have lactic acid and it isn't very irritating.    Asian sunscreens tend to be less greasy than western varieties. I have heard very good things about the Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence (I think that's what it's called). Check out /r/AsianBeauty for recommendations!    Hi! Welcome to SCA. If you're just starting a routine, be sure to only add in one product at a time. Starting with a moisturizer is a great first step, and if jojoba oil works, that's great! Just know that some oils can break people out. A good starter oil is pure mineral oil as it breaks very few people out.   Once you've settled on a moisturizer, I would incorporate a cleanser and a sunscreen. You only need to wash your face at night.   I personally love my Cerave foaming cleanser. It's the first cleanser I bought after finding this sub and it works great and doesn't dry out my skin.   Once your skin is used to the cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen, you can look into chemical exfoliation and spot treatments, which you can find recommendations for in the sidebar. Be sure to patch test so you can be sure a product will not break you out or cause a reaction.   If you deal with cystic acne, is it possible to see a dermatologist? They could help with prescriptions.  Good luck! If you have any questions about your routine in the future this sub has a daily routine thread where you can post any questions you have :) I post there probably every day! And be careful, skincare is an addiction. Before I never used to wash my face but now I'm obsessed!   I believe the certain areas of your face are more sensitive and prone to irritation, which can exacerbate breakouts. For example, I used an AHA for a few months and the skin on my nose, chin, and cheeks was extremely clear. Yet it broke me out on my jawline, neck, and forehead. So I just stopped using the product.   It's your skin, so experiment with what works! You can use certain products only on certain areas, or you can try to find products that are for sensitive skin.    Gosh I don't know if I can pick. I do love my cerave in the tub! But I also love my oil mix of sunflower oil and neem oil.    I used it everyday, but it broke me out. I don't know if it's because I used it too frequently or if there was some ingredient my face didn't agree with. I would use it 3x a week to start out, or less if you experience irritation.    How thickly do you apply your Good Night White Sleeping Mask? I just used mine last night but I'm not sure if I need to layer it thicker. I ended up putting Vaseline over it.    Oh dang. Where do you live? I'd suggest finding products that are local, unless you would buy them online? I'm sure you could find them on Amazon.    Thanks for the detailed response! I'm glad it's plant placenta, even if that's not a thing, because thinking about slathering animal placenta on my face is pretty wonky.   I'll check out the links for spot treatments and the product order :)   Haha interesting! He doesn't have a pocket knife, but he's not much of a sportsman type? He's an accountant lol.   How much are they? That's actually a good gift idea to keep in mind for my brother or my dad!    I have tried using oils and then wiping it away with a cloth, but I really didn't like it. So now I wash my face with the oil and then double cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser. I definitely like this better, as it makes my face feel very clean and refreshed. I wear a decent amount of makeup so I feel like I really need the double cleanse method.   Also, it took me a while to get used to sleeping with Vaseline on my face. And you don't need that much Vaseline. I started by putting a massive thick layer on my face, and you don't need that much! A thin layer works just as good as a thick one.    I don't get grits! Some people do some don't. If I am wearing a lot of makeup I start to think I got grits but turns out it was just balled up makeup residue lol.    Oh no :( I started with mineral oil and loved it and then switched to sunflower oil and neem oil, which also works great!  Another reminder is to get pure mineral oil with nothing added - the mineral oil from the drug store tends to have tocopherals (sp?) in them, which can cause breakouts!   Also, don't be discouraged if you don't get grits! I've gotten maybe two grits EVER from using OCM, and I've been doing it for nearly half a year. The only time I got grits was when I used the Aztec Clay Mask before I did OCM. I was so excited. But the next week I did it again, and no grits :( Boo.    Yup, for some people a simplified routine works and for others it doesn't. It's not really helpful to say that people overcomplicate their skincare. My brother has awful acne, has had awful acne since he hit puberty, and he has tried everything from seeing a derm and going on meds to doing absolute zero.   For me, I never had huge issues with my skin other than mild acne. The products I use now have seriously improved my skin's texture and my face just feels so much better. If you look at my posts my skincare regime is quite long.   Skincare is a mixed bag. It's frustrating when a simplified routine works for someone and not for others! It's definitely a very personal journey.    This was really helpful! I actually was stressing over the tiny bumps under my eyes and started thinking they were milia, and even had a dream about it lol. But, looking at that picture they're normal! So thank you :)   I haven't used either of the products, but I did look at them. So, the face wash has salicylic acid in it, but it won't be on your skin long enough to do anything for your breakouts. I suggest looking into the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion, which has 2% salicylic acid if you like Neutrogena products. I have used this lotion and it's worked for me.   So, the face wash is probably fine, but I would look into getting a spot treatment like the Acne Defense lotion, and then apply a moisturizer after. I hope that makes sense!   Also, be sure to wear a sunscreen with SPF 30 (at least). If you have acne prone skin the sunscreen will help reduce the appearance of acne scars.   OH, and I recommend only washing your face once per day. In the morning it's fine to just rinse your face and apply moisturizer, otherwise you risk drying out your skin too much.   	83
 All Occasion Video is pretty great   That made me smile :)   Thanks :)   They're Hershey's kisses, peppermint kind, with mms on top.    They're just square Hanover (Snyder's) pretzels, mint Hershey's kisses and m  ms. Place the pretzels on a cookie tray, put in oven at 400 f for about 2:00. You have to watch them really carefully, or they'll melt too much. Take them out as soon as you can partially push an mm onto the top, and then push mms onto all of them. Put in the refrigerator and they're good to go. I'm just proud because it's so hard for me to get out of bed, let alone make something.   Haha, that's good      Going to try to make it!

 I'm pretty sure it's usually accompanied by a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia, bipolar, etc) but apparently some symptoms that separate it from just good ol' fashioned depression are delusions, anxiety, agitation, cognitive impairment, constipation, and I saw the term "hypersexuality" in a few articles that I can't recall the names of at the moment.    I feel like it's really rare to come across other people with this, but if there is anyone out there, did you ever experience *hypersexuality* at one point or another?   Long and emotional teenage love story short, him and I have been bestfriends since were were young chldren, and have been together for a year. He and I both struggle with depression, and on Feb 27, he tried to kill himself. He stayed in a hospital for a few weeks, and when he came back, said we needed to go on a break for a bit, but he "still loves me" and I'm "still his first kiss" and all that. For the first few days, he was very distant from me, but lately, he has been acting the way he used to- calling me pretty, hugging me without me asking, saying he loves me, etc. Him and I are still best friends and do everything together, so, this behavior is slightly confusing. Everybody keeps saying how they can see him start to "glow up" around me again, and that the way he talks about me is amazing, and how there is a very high chance we'll get back on track, but... He might be gay. He has always been bisexual and definitely had no problem being with me, a girl, in *that way*, but I could see how that might be possible. I'll love him no matter what he is or what he does, and he will always be my best friend, but, how can I cope if this does in fact happen? Our relationship was quite serious and we still are very in love with each other.   Okay, so, I'm 13. Basically, I have psychotic depression along with an anxiety disorder. When I started freshman year last September, I started to sink more into my depression. I also began to go out with my best friend (not together at the moment; he might be gay) who also has depression issues- she decided to blame him and my other friends for my "sudden change". I'm pretty antisocial in general, and I absolutely fucking detest my mother. Sue me. She is a 29 year old woman who pretends her life is fine when really she is an unhappy person. She decided the best way to make me change would be t punish me. I got my phone and laptop taken away for a month. It didn't work and just made matters worse. She threatened to pull me out of school, I didn't give her a reaction. Could not give her that satisfaction of letting her think it was going to get to me, and honestly, it didn't, because she never followed through. She sees this as a contest, almost a "let's see which one of us breaks first". What she doesn't realize is I'm pretty damn persistent, so if she wants to turn this into a contest, I'm going to win.   Honestly, her antics don't even bother me that much anymore. What bothers me is that she turns every conversation into an argument by bringing up "change" and ragging on my closest friends. She then gets mad because I don;t give her the reaction she is looking for. My mom wants me to be a happy-go-lucky, straight A (already am, btw), "family comes first" kind of girl when that's just not who I am. I don't place value in family because they're the people we end up with randomly, and she didn't even raise me. My friends are my family, and to be honest, I think she envies the fact that I care more for them than her.  How do I deal with this? Do I cave first? Help!   You know, the days where nothing is necessarily amazing, and nothing incrdbily extravagant happens, you just have a normal day. Maybe you get an extra hug from someone special, get a good grade on a test, make a new friend,  or you laugh a lot, it just feels amazing to be "normal".   What motivates me is knowing what loneliness truly is, and how bad it feels for myself sometimes. Also, sometimes it's nice to distract myself from my own problems by listening to and/or helping with others'.  	6

 27, married, have a 6 month old son and 2 cats.  Starting a new job ($15k more and advancement prospects) on Monday.  Love my husband, love my life for the most part.  The biggest thing I'm dealing with right now is my weight.  I'm fat, always had problems with food (like a borderline addiction).  Trying to get healthy for my son and husband but the apathy is overwhelming, on top of being a mother and working full time.   Rhys grabs my chin or lip when he's trying to fall asleep in my arms.  He'll wave his arm around until he's found something to grab on to.  Only when I'm holding him.     That's a great suggestion! I'll probably get her that gift card and then a cute outfit or some small gift to go with it.    Ok so I was the first one out of all my friends who had a baby so I hadn't been to a registry before. Now I am going to one and the mom to be has registries, but none of them have a rock n play. From experience and talking to other moms, the rock n play has been a godsend. They have a bouncer seat and swing on the registries...  I personally didn't mind when people went off registry and got things we didn't register for.  But I wanted to hear others' opinions before doing this.   EDIT: Thanks!  I'll be getting her a gift card and telling her about the rock n play but let her decide on her own instead.  I'll also probably get a cute outfit or book to go with the gift card.   Omg but hi chew is fucking delicious.    Oddly enough peekaboo doesn't work until they start to develop permanence. Before they do its just out of sight, out of mind.    Go check out /r/rupaulsdragrace sometime.  Huge rpdr community here.   You're both correct.  Drag has sometimes been a gateway for transgendered females (see [Carmen Carerra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Carrera) and [Sonique](http://logosrupaulsdragrace.wikia.com/wiki/Sonique)).  However the majority of the time drag performers identify as male.   I think the faster pooper should go first if the urge is equal. My husband takes like 20 minutes to poop but I can be in and out in 90 seconds.    I am fat and have a horrible relationship with food. When I am eating healthy all I can think about is junk food. It's like an addiction, all I can think about is where I'll get my next fix. I've also done my share of bingeing and purging, in small amounts and very occasionally, but it's there. No amount of therapy or medication has seemed to help at all. I am desperate to change for my 6 month old son but I have no motivation to put in the work and get healthy for him or myself.   Tied in with this comes a healthy dose of depression, anxiety, and self loathing. I am in therapy and on medication and constantly trying, but the apathy is overwhelming.    I'm well aware that my belief is irrational and illogical, but maybe I have a psychological need for faith in a higher power.  It makes me feel more at ease, and I don't get panic attacks worrying about death.     Werewolf bar mitzvah   Just because I believe it doesn't mean I absolutely know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that God exists   I believe in God but I have no proof he exists and am not absolutely certain of his existence. Therefore... Agnostic theist.    I always do because of the common confusion, though I don't go around talking about my personal beliefs that often.   You just have to wait until they grow in again.  It'll take about 2 months.    You're mostly right.  I technically associate myself with Christianity, but I feel like Christianity also has some things incorrect, because we just can't comprehend an all-powerful being fully as temporal mortals.   I'd like to actually get a queen back who wasn't immediately eliminated.  Having a queen come back and get to the top 3 would be a nice twist.   I'm an agnostic theist and *mostly* feel the same way, only I do believe in a god.   Anecdotal:  I need advancement opportunities.  The first 3 jobs I had out of college have been stagnant.  The job I'm currently at pays well enough, but I have nowhere to go in this company.  I will be starting at a job in 2 weeks as a Jr. associate (to keep it vague), so there are multiple levels for me to advance to and then more opportunity from there.  It's less about the money and more about seeing progress in my career.  I'm aware I'll probably get to a point in my career where I'm comfortable at my level, but I need to see some advancement at some point.   Cory and Topanga.   So exciting!

Our other cat is Evelyn   Our cat got into my husband's stash a couple years ago at night. We had put the bag on the highest shelf under stuff but the smell must have attracted Walter. Woke up to a lot of cat puke. He ended up being ok but I felt so bad for him after that night. We also got a mason jar for the stash after that.    Yeah the only time I have ever talked to anyone about my son's penis is when he had a slight infection on it, and even then it was only to my mom and MIL.

Yeah there are a ton of precautions you can take, most of which ensure the baby doesn't suffocate.

There are certain things that come out OK in the microwave.  You can cook a whole potato in a microwave, things like mug cakes/cookies come out OK.  But I've seen cookbooks from the 60's where they talk about cooking a whole turkey in a microwave and it just grosses me out to think about.   Legitimate pregnancy isn't a joke or a prank.  Maybe I'm different than most people in that if I know a joke (or think of a prank) that would potentially hurt someone else's feelings, I wouldn't tell that joke or pull that prank.  And as a response to your edit: again, your analogies aren't jokes or pranks.    When they were singing Happy Birthday to LRH a year after he died I was laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was.  Then my husband goes "We celebrate Jesus's birthday every year, too."     2013 Prius C here.  It's great for gas mileage and such, but for first time buyers I would absolutely recommend a Toyota Corolla or Camry.  They're inexpensive and with regular maintenance will last for 10 years at least, no problem.   I want them all!   I think if you post it on FB as an april fools joke it can hurt people unintentionally.  Like, for example, the women who struggle with infertility, or the women who have suffered many miscarriages or lost a child.   Same happened to me after coming back from my maternity leave.  Starting a new job in 3 weeks!   I'd second the Rudy's recommendation.  A lot of people will put it down because it's a chain, but I have yet to have a bad meal from there.   All the time.  I'm not a super sexual person, and I'm fine with vanilla PIV alone.  I'm big, very self conscious about my body, and very inflexible in my hip joints.  It's really painful for me to be on top, and I'm pretty sure I just lay there like a dead fish.  I know my husband finds our sex life really boring, but with how I am and then taking into account the fact that I take Celexa, I'm just not a sexually interesting person.  I'm working on it for his sake, because I don't want him to be unhappy with any facet of our relationship.     I'm pretty sure they've already put one up on Louetta near 249.  If you're driving by HEB there's this big lamp looking thing, but it doesn't look like any of the lighting around it.  Pretty sure it's a stingray.   I wish I could do that, but I'm so empathetic and I know if I were to quit on the spot then a lot of my coworkers would be screwed because they'd have to pick up my duties, which are highly detailed and would take them days to learn to do efficiently.    We have more donuts.   I'm currently waiting on a job offer call, I plan on participating in my own version of this relatively soon.  Only I'm such a pansy I'll just turn in my 1.5 weeks notice (and i'll be thinking "yeah, that's right, 10 days.  Not the standard two weeks because you don't deserve it").     Or they bring Trixie back.^let^me^dream^okay?    Y....yeah.  He did.    Jesus even said if you won't give joyfully, don't give at all.    I agree. I actually really don't like Archer and Lana being together, I think it takes away from a lot of possibly situations.    I think in general females have poorer spatial awareness than males. I know I sure as hell do. Google seems to say males are one standard deviation higher than females.    Probably around 2.5 million people know where 1960 is.   Everywhere I've looked for any kind of actuarial position requires the first two tests to be passed. My GPA was also less than stellar which makes people automatically reject me. I would love to be an analyst of some sort but never get calls back, probably due to the fact I have no experience as an analyst.    How about someone with a math degree?   Check out technical writing!   Yeah, but a BS in Math won't get you far unless you have a relevant minor to go along with it (CS, Finance, etc...).  That's what I have and, while I have a job, I'm not doing anything related to mathematics.  I tried finding analyst positions, they all want business degrees.  I sure as hell don't want to teach.     Finally just past my ears, but it's still weird.  I basically just let it do its thing unless I have a special occasion.   Held hands.   Well if I win don't expect a response for 7 hours. Goodnight and good luck!   Oh you poor thing!! I refuse to go to anyone but the one guy who hasn't remotely fucked up my hair. It may cost $70 but I've been where you are and never again.  Just play with it and try to find something that works!   Yes! I eat lean cuisine for lunch every day because it's easy calorie counting. I do chicken, veggies, and brown rice for dinner usually, oatmeal or cottage cheese for breakfast (with lots of coffee).    That's how I'm viewing my weight loss.  I've tried keto, paleo, and other things that are pretty exclusionary and I find that I can hold off for maybe a month (usually a week), but then I'll fall off the wagon, binge, and it's even harder to get myself up and going again. I need to have the possibility of having an oreo or a cupcake or something or else it's all I think about until I eat 5 of them.   This is helping me out so much.  I'm in those first two weeks right now and all I can think about is junk food.  I'm really working on portion control and eating decently healthy stuff, because I now have a 5 month old son and refuse to die young because of my own lack of self control.  But fuck, I've got to have some kind of disordered eating or something because I would punch someone in the face for a cupcake right now.  Just gotta make it through, drink a shit ton of water, and distract myself.   I'm in the middle of growing mine out.  Finally past the Ringo Starr look...   I was completely bored by their video. Didn't really seem that clever.    RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers    I have done LCHF/keto/Atkins and the 70% fat intake didn't suppress my appetite.     There are plenty of times I don't eat when I'm hungry, but the constant fixation on food is what is really getting to me.     CBT, Vitamin D, Celexa, and taking walks outside.   I have hypothyroidism, just had my levels checked and everything is perfect. Medicine is on point.    Yeah I have mfp and a Fitbit.  Right now my husband and son are the only motivators I have. My husband has been doing extremely well and I want to do well with him (not at the same pace of course) so that in the end my son can have two healthy parents. I fluctuate between 1400 and 1700 calories daily (mfp says 1700 calories to lose 1 lb per week) but I'm just miserable a little bit  maybe my depression is rearing its ugly head.    I found a really addicting low calorie dressing and basically just eat huge bowls of romaine with a little of that dressing (measured) onto it. Does it get better or am I destined to be so hungry the rest of my life?   I have done LCHF/keto/Atkins and the 70% fat intake didn't suppress my appetite. I've tried fiber, water, gum, protein, everything suggested on here that didn't require a trip to my doctor. I'm pretty sure I have some form of disordered eating.   Literally the only thing that has ever made me not want to eat is Adderall, which I would rather not resort to.  I think about food all the time. I need to mention this to my psychiatrist next time I'm in the office. Until then, is there anything else I can do to help this fixation on food??    Don't ever stop antidepressants without a doctors supervision. If Zoloft doesn't work and makes you feel awful, ask for something else. Lots of people hate Zoloft. I did, but celexa works wonders for me, as did Prozac.    Is that why I have extremely painful intestinal cramps when I have the runs sometimes? Happened today and I almost had my husband rush me to the ER because the pain was excruciating. Then the poop came.    Anyone have a recommendation for a good (inexpensive) one?   If it sounds right to pronounce both s's, pronounce both.    That's how I scratch my nipples.    If they have food or anything in their teeth, you tell her.  I have friends who just ignore it and I'm like "dude, Hannah, you have a big hunk of spinach in your front tooth.  Here's a mirror."  I always get thanked.   http://www.storebrandformula.com  That was recommended to me by a friend, whose pediatrician recommended it.  It's so much cheaper than name brand but just as good.  Honestly, from my experience the formula is so regulated by the FDA that there's not much difference between.  I use Similac Alimentum because my baby has a milk allergy and store brand doesn't carry a similar one.   My husband and I had a similar fight recently. I basically said "your priorities are your marriage and your child, and by not helping me out you are neglecting both."   Texas too.  The 99 cent only stores in Houston have produce   And Matt's mom!   Lots of women may disagree with me, but here goes:  Giving birth.   My water broke and I opted for an epidural about 30 minutes after the pitocin induced contractions set in. I'll be fair, I lucked out. Some women go drug free or have contractions for days before being admitted to the hospital. But my gallbladder attacks I had before my gallbladder removal were worse than contractions.    I was one of those people who was constantly coming in for the next bag of legal weed.  It was a horrible existence and expensive.  At least $30/day and as a waitressing college student I barely squeaked by.   So do you have a phD in your field?  How does one become a scientist?   I personally hate that companies are going open office.  If I were in an open office environment my productivity would go way downhill because I'd be distracted by everyone.  Keep me in a cube please.   Mind if I ask how much you make (roughly) per day/week/year?  I've always wondered how much my guy makes, I figured maybe $150/day in tips?   Document Control, looking to get back into IT.  Document Control is a glorified electronic librarian.  Any time our company has to send any document to anyone, I have to fill out a form and get it signed acknowledging they received it.  I also make sure we follow our procedures correctly so we don't get burned when we get audited.   PINOOOOOTTTT NOOO-OIIRRR   I don't get it   I thought thunder and as the sound that resulted when two or more clouds collided.    Sasha, that beached whale stage look is not great.   Aryan airlines!    Violet reminds me of that one friend that's pretty but so vain and overly loud that nobody really likes her   I agree with you.  My family grew up saying things like "Satan is on the attack."  Satan is not omnipresent, he is a singular being. Satan is not behind my anxiety disorder, a chemical imbalance in my brain is.     Your original post affected me so much. I'm so happy your baby man is doing so much better at this new center. Crying tears of joy for you right now!   Coco Montrese falls in love with a lead singer and breaks up the band.  Yoko Montrese!   I sorta feel this way about directions at work.  My supervisor comes to me, trying to be personable and telling me what needs to be done.  I would MUCH rather an impersonal email so I have a record of what was asked of me.  Too many times I've been put in the position of   Upper Management: "why did you do this?"   Me:"well, X asked me to"    UM: "when, and what did he say?"   Me: "I don't have the specifics stored away in my memory, let me dig through my planner to see when i wrote it down"   I'm at the Ringo Starr stage.  It's awful.   She wrapped a purple napkin around her neck. Not impressed.    It's refreshing to have a Puerto Rican reyna who doesn't need subtitles. Sorry not sorry   Jasmine, put that six pack away   When I was pregnant my reproductive endorcinologist and OB said I could do low carb (75-100g of carbs per day), not keto, for my pregnancy.  Honestly, even if I tried to do keto I wouldn't have been able to.  I had awful aversions to anything high in fat or high in protein.  Honestly, she needs to ask her doctor's opinion and follow it.  While keto is great for regulating hormones for PCOS and losing weight, she has more important things to worry about.  Her doctors will be monitoring her hormones and supplementing as needed.     I have a 4 month old and pregnancy was horrible for me too. So horrible that we plan on adopting if we decide to have another.    I've finally decided what to do with my life (at 27, with a 4 month old baby and being the breadwinner).  I will be doing an online master's degree in math or stats (TBD) hopefully starting in the fall.  That definitely opens up many more opportunities than just a Bachelor's in math.   Whataburger  Five Guys  In-n-Out   Being able to sleep in on the weekends, HANDS DOWN.     I have a real problem with Kripke.  NOBODY MENTIONS HIS SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.     It's crazy, but I've seen crazier. Example: League City to Jersey Village. Why they do that to themselves every day I have no idea.

 He got injured in training - a calf strain I think. Out for another 2-4 weeks apparently.   Is this just a random pic? Or is she a known model? If anyone can ID her I'd be very grateful, she's sexy as fuck!   The bit that really impressed me was the second pass from Fabregas. I could be wrong, but it looks to me like he wasn't expecting the return pass from the first player (don't know who it is), and even if he was, the pass looked like it was hit back at him way too hard, but he still managed to thread the ball straight to the feet of the guy on the edge of the box with the outside of his foot!   Malene Espensen.   So did Mercedes just have engineers who were better at dealing with the changes?   While I do follow F1, I've never been so into it that I know all the technicalities of it, and was wondering if someone could explain something to me. In the years that Vettel was winning the WDC, Red Bull were almost untouchable, but now that's what's happening for Mercedes, while Red Bull are competing with the likes of Williams etc.  What is it that allows one team to improve so much from one season to the next, as Mercedes have done, or as Red Bull did when they dominated? I don't understand where this massive disparity comes from.  Thanks!   Can anyone explain what's happening in that video? That's incredible, never seen anything like it!   Kind of, although it's not a jumping around celebration. He crosses the line and kisses the ball while standing, and as he turns around, presumably about to ground the ball, he gets absolutely walloped and drops it.   Nope, you have to be touching the ball while it's on the ground to count.   I wouldn't say it's entirely because of that. Georgia are undoubtedly shite, but since Strachan was appointed we've been playing some great stuff IMO.   I love what Strachan has done with this team. Absolutely love watching them play these days.   Did he even need the touch there?? No idea why he didn't just smash it first time!   And they're 3-0 up already! :(   YYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!! Wee bit jammy with the deflection, but we're good value for the lead!   Hope we push on now, I get the feeling goal difference could be really important in this group, especially with the Rep. of Ireland score at the moment!   Amazing! Thank you! :)   [This is the trailer](https://www.blacked.com/beautiful-blonde-loves-massaging-bbc-) for the scene from the website, which is fucking hot as well.  Really want to see this full scene!   What she said echoes my own feelings on this. I went cage diving with great whites in South Australia, expecting it to be a terrifying adrenaline rush, but it was nothing of the sort. When you're in the water with them you do see that they are nothing like they're portrayed in the media. Graceful is the exact word I use to describe them to other people. The only reason people get pictures like this is because they pull the bait away from the shark as they get near it making them do the big CHOMP CHOMP thing.    Sutil crashed out at one of the corners, then Bianchi crashed into the same corner while it was being cleaned up. Bianchi's now been taken to the medical centre, and could be seriously injured.   With regards to Sutil, this has just come up on the BBC feed:  Sauber say when Adrian Sutil crashed they asked him if he was OK and he said "yes", according to BBC F1 pit-lane reporter Tom Clarkson.   The BBC feed was talking about Sutil, but mentioned nothing about Bianchi, but now saying that he's in the medical centre. Bizarre that they wouldn't even mention the fact that Bianchi also crashed. (Unless I just missed it.)   "Knocked over the corner flag today and said sorry to it. Then I realised it was a corner flag, so it can't hear me. It was really funny."   Fuck! Then my internet has decided to be shit again :(   Is streamsp stuttering really badly for anyone else?   Things like this are why it baffles me that there is no video replay usage at all in football. It was definitely a foul, so the match would have been stopped anyway. All it would have taken is a quick look on a replay to see it was outside the box.   Although her body is definitely bimbo material, I don't know if her brain is! Luisa was one of the contestants on the UK version of The Apprentice not long ago, so she certainly has brains as well as the body!   [This is a nice video of her.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbAcrLnoAbY)   Ah right. I didn't actually see the freekick foul, was that a dive as well?   Freedom of Banbury and an honourary degree from the University of Dundee. Take it or leave it.   It wasn't the foul for the free kick he was talking about. Balotelli was going for a ball with Jagielka, Jagielka barely touched his face, if at all, and Balotelli just flopped to the floor holding his face. It was fucking pathetic.   "Ah, but do you have the freedom of any cities?".  It's all becoming clear now!!   Haha I have no idea either! I'm similarly bemused by honourary degrees. What is the point in those things?   http://streamsp.com/   Yup! Glasgow was the first place in the World to give Nelson Mandela freedom of the city, which they did 9 years before he was released from prison. To send a message to the apartheid regime, they renamed St. George's Place to Nelson Mandela Place, and it became the location of the South African consulate.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22976781  Pretty interesting read.   [Nelson Mandela Place] (https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@55.8619324,-4.2535597,3a,75y,286.3h,94.32t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s3USsajJK3InKeO5ET4N8iA!2e0) in Glasgow is quite nice :)   It's Alia Janine - who I happen to think is the best tit fucker out there :)  [I think this is the source](http://www.youporn.com/watch/8491376/alia-janine-handjob-and-titfuck/). It's not great quality I'm afraid, sorry.   Poor shirt, didn't stand a chance.  This is Leanne Crow, incase anyone's wondering. Although I imagine she's pretty well known on this sub by now!!   I think this is the reason I don't feel primarily British. Because England is by far the biggest country in Britain, a lot of people say British, when they mean English (especially people who don't live here).  Despite sharing a border, I actually think Scotland and England are two very different places. So quite often when people talk about British culture, or British identity, when they actually mean English, I just don't relate to any of it, so I don't have that connection.  Another thing is that the mainstream British media is heavily anglo-centric, again due to the population etc. and it's hard to feel like you're part of Britain when the overwhelming majority of stories etc. are centred around England.   I don't know the rules myself, but personally speaking, it is a bit of a disappointment when you load a gif with a title of 'piledriver from the edge of the box', thinking it's going to be a stunning goal, and it turns out to be 'decent hit from well inside the box'.  Sensationalizing a title makes it look like you just want karma IMO.  Although I do appreciate the upload, don't get me wrong :)   This is the first I've seen it, and my jaw literally just dropped - not so much at the penalty decision (although I'm not suggesting it was one), but the fact that Vardy got away with what looked to me to be a blatant shove. Awful refereeing.   I read a really interesting comment about why the media still have this love-in for Liverpool, and it was saying that it's because a lot of the mainstream media is made up of people in their late 30s - 40s who remember Liverpool's glory days in the 80s, so still treat them with reverence, even though they've hardly been relevant in the title race since the Premier League began (with a few exceptions of course, like last year).   Is there any official stats anywhere to back that up? That's an incredible stat if true!   That's a great gif - do you know the context? Or was that from last night?   I have to say, I'm the complete opposite, and the results of this survey have actually been a bit of an eye opener for me.  If anyone ever asks me what nationality I am, I will always say Scottish. If they then ask if that makes me British, I'd answer yes. But I would never even think to answer British in the first instance, and I assumed that most people would be the same i.e. they would say English or Welsh before British, but seemingly not!  So while I certainly consider myself British, I'm definitely in the "Scottish first, British second" camp.  And yet, my username contains UK! I'm a walking hypocrite.  EDIT: changed some words.   Is it really quiet at Upton Park, or is it just the stream I'm watching making it seem that way?   Wow!! I salute your work, good sir!   Jesus christ. I don't think I can express in words just how happy I'd be if you could remember that name!   I fucking love how thick she is. What a ride that would be!   Are they real?? As in, no photoshoppery? If not, they are some of the finest tits I've ever fucking seen.  EDIT: Changed a word.   Thanks mate, much appreciated :)   Depends on the city. Edinburgh is pretty much a nailed on no and you would expect Glasgow to be yes but I'm not sure about the other cities.    Christ, I have such a weakness for redheads. Can anyone tell me the name of this stunner?   You'd probably be better off saying good result, rather than good performance. Liverpool were extremely poor, but they got the result they were after.      Not that I'm aware of :(   [Nadine Jensen](http://i.imgur.com/Wr1vIi8.jpg) (same set, but not the same pic, sorry.   No, no the one to Mata for the goal. Sorry, I edited it to put that bit in!   I realise this might be going against popular opinion on here, but I have to agree with the commentators - I think that was a scuffed shot rather than a pass from Di Maria for the 4th goal.   But regardless, he's been absolutely out of this world today. Clear man of the match.   Couple more  http://i.imgur.com/4hvtjY5.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/gxj1kke.jpg      This was the semi final of the Champions League in 2007-2008. Chelsea and Liverpool had drawn the first leg 1-1, and the second leg had finished 1-1 after full time, so extra time was being played. The penalty put Chelsea ahead 2-1, and they went on to win that game overall, 3-2.  The added significance of the penalty is that Frank Lampard was taking it, and his mother had died in the week leading up to the game, so there was a huge emotional aspect to it as well.   A gorgeous, tall, naturally busty brunette who can deep throat a cock like that as if was the easiest thing in the world. Think I've found a new favourite! Thanks OP! :D   [With this picture,](http://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj503/anchorman78/sky-sports_t_gary-neville-retiring-sky-sports-11.jpg) rather than Torres.   [Nice wee vid of the Frank Lampard penalty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAfiVZH6Yio)   Here's hoping it's not a false dawn! :)   I'm thrilled that Villa are doing so well at the moment - I fucking love Paul Lambert after everything he did while playing for us. Really want to see him succeed at the highest level.   There was a really good piece by Pat Nevin last year about Liverpool and how they needed to learn to be more patient when they needed goals, and just keep passing the ball, rather than panic and hoof it up to Suarez in the hope he could conjure something up (which he often did of course).  He compared it to City's approach, where they were still passing the ball around in the last few minutes of the game against QPR that they needed to win the league the previous year, and of course, Aguero popped up and stuck it away.   I would imagine Diego Costa will get something similar. Although he seems to be taking it all in his stride, and more, so far!   Thanks.   How many fouls does a player have to commit to be booked for persistent fouling? Is there a set number, or is it at the ref's discretion?   Fuck, that first gif is amazing. My ex was a pretty big girl, and I absolutely loved it when we fucked like this. I just love feeling the weight of a woman on you while they absolutely fuck you silly!! Great times!   She's posted on here herself a few times if /u/missjennicalynn is genuine.   Indeed! I wish she'd managed to get more exposure, but things seem to have kind of died away for her :(    Germany weren't anywhere near their most incisive so I guess it wasn't a real test just yet  That's the scary part. It WAS a real test, despite Germany not being in top gear!  But if we play like we did in the second half for the rest of the qualifying campaign I'd certainly rate our chances against the other teams :)   Yeah, I was just being melodramatic, we SHOULD be alright against Gibraltar, but I'm taking nothing for granted!  But we really need our defence to start stepping up if we want to get through the group as a whole.   If only I could!   Give the World champions a genuine scare on their own turf, then get pumped at home the very next week by a team ranked millions of places below us. Tis the Scottish way. :(    Brilliant, thanks :)   Stirling? Near Sterling, near Tillicoultry, near Stirling?   Ah, cheers for the info. That's shite for him :(   I'm not being a dick when I say this, I genuinely don't know - has he just come back from a long injury lay-off or something?   Manuel who????   A tin of beans would be better than Mulgrew.   [You're cured!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVjkE87FDY)   If we can get a freekick around the area, wee Shaun might do the business.    they'll probably tear down Dewar's statue and replace it with one of him.  .. and adorn it with the ultimate sign of Scottish respect - a traffic cone.   Losing to the current World Champions by only 1 goal (as it stands) on their home turf is certainly something to be proud about for a wee nation like ours. If we can consistently play like we have in this second half, we'll give ourselves a pretty good chance of qualifying I'd say.   Is this Craig Levein?? Didn't have you down as a redditor :P  I can see the temptation to batten down the hatches, but I say we fuckin go for it! :D   Hahaha love the subliminal work there!!!   YAAAAAAAS YA FUCKIN BEAUTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Come on Scotland!!!   I knew it was written by Germans, which wouldn't be a problem in my eyes, I'd still have it as our anthem :)   Yeah version 2 is quality. I'd also like that because, while I love FoS, if we got independence I think it would be great to have an anthem that is about us looking to the future and moving forward, rather than looking back.   Love Highland Cathedral, rousing as fuck. Does it have any lyrics to it at the moment, or would somebody have to write some?   Unfortunately, friendlies do count in the UFWC, so Argentina are the current holders. :(  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships   My five a side team has a stronger back line than Brazil.    It's so weird - seeing women in bikinis on their own doesn't really do much for me to be honest, but add a pair of heels, and it becomes one of the hottest looks I can think of!! Amazing pic :)   Ah, managed to dload Cheat Engine, but even with the tutorial, I haven't got a clue what I'm doing! :(   I've only just started playing Dark Souls for the first time, but I'm really not enjoying it at the moment, because the FOV is far too close to the main character for my eyes, and I'd like to make it further away.  I've read about something called the Cheat Engine which I can use, but I don't know where to get it, or what to do with it - all I could find was a forum about it, but couldn't see any downloads. If anyone could help me with this I'd be extremely grateful.  I did use the search function on here, but nothing came up, which is why I'm posting - apologies if this has come up before under a different title.    Personally I'm gutted that we had a chance to start fresh because we had loads of decent players coming through from the youth academy, and wasted it. But Ally didn't seem to trust any of them and they've scattered to the four winds of obscure no-mark teams because that's where they're guaranteed a game.  Exactly. Rangers had a chance to create a team from the ground up, with loads of youth players, but instead they signed much older players like Jon Daly etc.  They seemed to have an air of desperation to to get back into the SPL at the first time of asking (through the respective divisions), but obviously didn't have enough faith in their younger players to do that, so signed more experienced ones, but at huge cost.  Would an administration flush out Wallace etc.? Or does it have to be a liquidation for that to happen?    And seriously, very few in Sweden can name any players in Celtic. Because they're so mediocre.  If you're going to use the argument that Celtic are mediocre because very few people in your country could name any of our players, then I'm afraid the exact same has to be said of Malmo. How many people in Scotland do you think can name any of the Malmo first team without looking it up on Wikipedia?  I actually agree that the Swedish league is stronger than the Scottish league at the moment, but the fact of the matter is that, in European terms, we're both pretty mediocre, and don't exactly set Europe alight these days, so I doubt many people outside our own countries will know any of our teams players.    spending big on wages  It's the massive wage bill at Rangers that really struck me, when you consider they had to get through 3 divisions before getting back in the top league - were the board assuming that season ticket sales each year would have been enough to cover it till then?   And may we soon unearth the next Lubo, to be seated at his right hand.   I have a question about the shockwave, if anyone can answer it. I don't understand how it doesn't seem to affect the water, but hits the boat with such force. I would have expected some kind of ripple effect to be visible on the surface of the water as it gets agitated (even though it's already moving around), and then hear the sound as it reaches the boat. So, how did that happen, please?   I know very little about sound/shock wave moment, so realise there may be an obvious answer to this and I'm just not aware of it!    It is a long journey but we need somebody to step up to the plate and join us by meeting our standard.  Who would be the most capable of that at the moment, do you think? Aberdeen probably?    Hey hey, you still have more titles.  That very much depends on who you ask about it!  (Although, please don't ask me about it, I really haven't got a clue about much of the Rangers situation).   Again, this is just my personal viewpoint, but I find being a Celtic fan so frustrating at the moment because of the fixation on European football. Don't get me wrong, I love being involved in the Champions League, but to me, it's not the be-all and end-all. Our team has clearly gotten worse over the past few years, but I'd happily sacrifice Champions League football, if it meant a more competitive league came of it. With Champions League football, we get a minimum of 3 cracking nights at Celtic Park, and very occasionally 4. If the gap in the league closes, as you've spoken about in your post, the league could be on it's way back to the days of the 80s, when teams like Aberdeen and Hearts regularly challenged for the title, something which I'd love to see. I don't mind if we win the league year on year, but only if we don't stroll to it, where's the excitement in that?   Well, I can't speak for all Celtic fans of course, but I'm not going to lie - I'm still enjoying it to be honest, for no other reason than they're our biggest rivals, and it's always fun to watch your rivals struggle (see the current Liverpool - Manchester United situation). I realise this is the antithesis of being 'classy' - something which doesn't go down too well in this sub it seems, but there you have it - I just see it as part of the rivalry. Rangers fans were giving us absolute pelters after we got shat on in 2 rounds of Champions League qualifying, and when we nearly went to the wall ourselves in 1994, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It's all just give and take IMO.  Yes, it's absolutely shite for their fans, who just want to go and support their team, but have a board full of fuckwits who only seem to be in it to make a quick buck, but like I said, I'm not going to pretend otherwise just because I'm on Reddit!   Is there any indication as to how much Ibrox could have possibly raised by selling the naming rights? Despite the name and reputation of Rangers, how much can a team from the Scottish Championship (or whatever division they were in when Ashley bought them) realistically get (or have gotten)?  I'm not being hypothetical here, I'm genuinely wondering if there's any indications.  (And yes, I do realise whatever amount they'd get would be better than a quid, I'm just asking out of curiosity's sake!)   "Wooooooof!"  *Archie MacPherson*    Subject to change when Rangers are back in the top league I'd wager.  The way things are going at the moment, there's no guarantee that's going to happen in the near future. This current Rangers side are still in deep financial trouble, which could potentially see them go into administration again, and perhaps even another liquidation.   I personally don't find it attractive at all when someone with big tits swings them so they're bouncing really hard from side to side.   But suggestive little jiggles like this are so fucking hot! Love the recoil back to their original shape at the end as well.   Ah, I should have said, I also used marines! Siege tanks to stop the zerg waves, marines to stop Kerrigan. That was enough to complete it on hard, but didn't get the achievements. The most fun thing about that mission for me though, was the fact that I had the hive mind emulator and built loads of them. Any time a brutalisk came near (are they the really big ones, I can't even remember!) I controlled it, killed the smaller zerg with it, then sent it straight up the ramp to the artifact. By the time the end came, where the worms pop up right beside the artifact, I had ten of the bastards, fully healed, just waiting for them :D It was great!  Once I'd completed it, I did it again, with more measured numbers of marines, rather than just pumping them out, along with a small banshee force. That was enough to get rid of the worms outside the base, and I comfortably got the achievements :)   If you search on youtube there's quite a few - she's a singer these days. Albeit a shit one.   Haha yeah that's why I love them so much :D  I think she's naturally this big because she seems to have a naturally thicker shape - she's not pencil thin by any means. She's just got curves in all the right places obviously! :D   I don't think OP was questioning the call on the pitch, just the use of the word "offsides". The term used in football (in the UK at least) is just "offside", with no 's' on the end.    I managed to win the last mission in the end, but no by building bunkers tbh, just massing siege tanks and blowing the ever living shit out the zerg that way! I'll definitely use the bunker tactic if I play through the campaign again though :)   [Longer clip here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOMdKnsJEio)      Thanks mate, was just a bit surprised to see this was Costa's first appearance in the TOTW.   Christ, I knew her tits were big, but I didn't realise they were THAT fucking big!   Why is there a number 2 beside a few of the players? Is that how many times they've made TOTW?   Hahah definitely over-thinking, but it gave me a chuckle!   Ah, thanks mate. Who else could you play on the wing? I just can't believe he doesn't play one of the best No.10s in the world, in the No.10 position!    The op has explained this too.   OP - Big Oscars really, of course a lot of genre movies are still going to get nominations for VFX and sound design.  My reply to your 'Alien' comment came before the explanation. In fact, it was your reply that led me to ask for clarification in the thread, the reply to which you've now quoted.  Obviously we just assumed different things from the OP. When I saw the words Oscar worthy, I thought it meant all Oscars, hence my reply.   Thank you!!! I thought I was going fucking mad! Every time he speaks it's like he's fuckin munching on a sandwich at the same time.   Who's playing through the middle? And why not Ozil?   Bit harsh on giraffes.   Has he just beaten someone's record, or just added to his own, if you see what I mean?   Out of interest, behind which 4?   For me it's the way he says it as much as anything else. The pause before the gag, and the over pronunciation of BIB, as if no one would fucking get the joke otherwise. Which happened to be absolutely horrendous anyway.   Even with Suarez gone, I was confused why so many people had Liverpool to drop out of the top 4 before the season began, particularly at United's expense. I personally think Liverpool are going to finish 3rd, ahead of Arsenal, and behind City and Chelsea.   Well, I think the person who used the phrase is saying that Gerrard and Pirlo, like the quarterbacks of the NFL, are the ones who are considered the playmakers. But it's not a term that makes any sense in a footballing context.   From Twitter: *The problem with Gerrard in the quarterback role like Pirlo is, he can't actually pass a ball anywhere near as good as Pirlo.*  Quarterback role? Is this really creeping in to football (soccer) terminology?     Nice wee line from the BBC:  *Mario Balotelli is going through his warm-up at White Hart Lane, he's managed to get his bib on so that's a start...*  Glad to see Mario starting, this could be a cracking game.  [Some context for those unclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYU-SeVofHs). Just a quick warning - you might want to watch this on mute, it's got Robbie Savage in it.  ETA: Added the clip.   I literally never watch Italian football, is Buffon still a solid starter for Juve and Italy? How many years do you think he's got left in him?   Ah, ok. To be honest, I probably shouldn't even be on this thread. When it comes to films, I don't pick up on the intricacies and technical things that are probably what wins Academy Awards. I just go by how much I enjoyed it! I've seen Inception so many times now, it must be in double figures, but I've only seen TKS once, and probably won't watch it again.   I only just saw The King's Speech recently and, personally speaking, I just can't see how it beat Inception to the award for Best Film. Inception shits all over it IMO.   Bill Murray for best actor in Ghostbusters, perhaps?   Best Film  Best Director  Best Actor  Best Actress  Best Supporting Actor  Best Supporting Actress  Are those considered the big ones?   OP, are you talking about just the big Oscars, like Best Film, Best Director etc.?  Or do you mean any Oscar at all?   Alien won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.    You don't know heartache till you watch a little girl cry for her daddy to come home.  What an utterly ridiculous and offensive statement to make.   Yeah, I'm pretty sure that losing 6-3 to most teams would leave me raging, but this felt different. I think it's because, even though we lost, we still took the game to Chelsea, and managed to take 3 goals off them, which is no mean feat, especially when you consider how good their defence is, and the fact that they're the favourites for the title in many people's eyes.  Obviously our defense needs a lot of work, and Howard was dreadful today, but I don't know, this loss didn't leave me feeling that deflated. Chelsea are just an awesome side!   As an Everton fan, I honestly don't know how to feel after that game. It was just so bizarre.   This. Is. Mental.   No problems mate, just whenever you can.   Brilliant, thanks mate :)   True, but it would at least give the other teams a better, and fairer, chance to reach the deeper stages at least.  Although what you've said also touches on my second wish - to do away with the group stages altogether!!  I remember when the European Cup was knockout from the start, and I'd love those days to come back. I can understand people's viewpoints of wanting to see the likes of Real Madrid play, and if they were to be knocked out in the first round, there'd be a lot of unhappy people (not least the sponsors). But personally speaking, I'd love that. As I said, I think it's much more sporting to do it this way, but I know that will never happen, as money rules all these days.   Thanks for the reply mate.  In a more general way - if a club can't sell enough to pay off the creditors, is that when liquidation happens? Is that what happened to the likes of Portsmouth etc.?      From what I've read, if the share issue fails, Rangers could face administration. I know that this incurs a points deduction, but in terms of the future of the club itself, what are the implications of administration? It's not something I've ever fully understood, no matter who it's happened to. Does administration always lead to liquidation if a club can't get out of it? And if Rangers were to fold, would they be able to re-form again?   I didn't even think it had 4 eyes till I read the comments here. I thought the black bit in the middle was just the pupil, like [this](http://neurocapability.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/snake-wallpaper-green-anaconda-reptile-eyes-desktop-wallpapers-a-l-ibackgroundz-com.jpg).     increasing the likelihood that better and more entertaining teams are knocked out and worse teams slip into the knock-out stages  I really don't understand the objection to this from a sporting perspective. I've said before I'd love to see seedings done away with completely (not just in football) and just let the draw be completely random, but loads of people say to me things like "Yeah great, can you imagine Zenit vs Steaua Bucharest in the CL final?".   But I don't see what's wrong with that. They're both professional football teams who've won their leagues, thereby earning themselves a place in the Champions League - if they both get lucky with the draws and end up playing in the final, then so be it. Just because they can't field the likes of Ronaldo or Messi, and might not play as attractively as the more famous teams, wouldn't make them any less worthy in my eyes.  I'd much rather an actual league champion from one of the less fashionable leagues won the CL than the team who finished 4th in the PL or La Liga etc. Personally, I'm getting fed up seeing the same teams constantly reaching the quarters etc.  (No offence to Zenit or Steaua fans btw, just the first two teams that popped into my head!).  EDIT: changed a few words.   /r/WatchItForThePlot    Haha, I get the feeling I'll be saying that for the next few years as well!   I'd very much appreciate a link later once you get on a computer if possible. I haven't heard anything remotely like that in the aftermath of it all, and I'd really want to see the source of a claim like that.   So that would imply you're under the impression that someone at Celtic knew before the game about Legia's illegible player, have I got that right? I don't see how they could to be honest - Legia's admin process is surely completely internal.  In saying all this, I can understand how angry Legia fans are, it's a dreadful way to be eliminated from any competition.   Good shout! I hadn't even considered Geography as a reason prefer to one draw over another.   Do you ever feel an easy group doesn't prepare you as well for the next round?   Ah, the best of both worlds :D Who do you support, out of interest?   EDIT: That title should read European competitions, not matches. Can't change it now :(  Just been having a wee nosy through some of the qualifying draw threads, and was just wondering - do you prefer your team to get drawn against the big guns? Or would you rather they got an easy group? I realise that sounds like a no-brainer, but I think it depends on the team you support.  As a Celtic fan, our chances of winning the Champions League (on the occassions we actually make it there!) have always been zero, so I love it when we get drawn against huge clubs like Barcelona, because the atmosphere on nights like that is always great.  I'm also an Everton fan, and I'm happy to see us get a pretty tough group in the Europa League, again because I think it'll make for some fantastic evenings at Goodison.  But I would imagine teams like Chelsea or Man City, who have aspirations of actually winning it, would much rather have an easier passage through the group stages, to conserve energy for the knockouts.  Just wondered what your views on it are?   To be honest, of all the replies from Legia fans trying to explain their dislike for Celtic, this is the only one that I've actually understood.  When you say you'd expect your representative to say something, do you mean you'd expect them to offer the place to Celtic? Because I have to say, I personally don't think there's any team on the planet who would offer that, not with what's at stake.  But at least I understand your stance on it now.     Can any Legia fans (or anyone who speaks Polish for that matter), write what it is they're actually singing?   Then fuck me, I need to know who this is!! :( :(   Tommi Jo was in an episode of Dating in the Dark here in the UK. Sadly, it also featured a guy called Ben Clarke, a massively arrogant, narcissistic cunt stain who was on The Apprentice the year before.  [This is the episode in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVDILBzSnJA)   Forfeiting a match always makes it a 3:0 result to the team who aren't the subject of the forfeit. It doesn't get changed to make sure another team is disqualified.    Not strictly true. Legia forfeited the second leg by fielding a player they shouldn't have, which changed the result to a 3-0 win for Celtic. That changed the overall result to a 4-4 draw, putting Celtic through on away goals.   If Legia had won the first leg 4-0, they would have gone through despite the second leg result being changed. They weren't disqualified outright.      Is it Meryln Sekova maybe? She's one of the few women I can think of that has tits this big but is also pretty slim.    Vieira v Keane was an epic matchup over the years.   Baggio for me as well - my favourite player of all time, and not even because of how good he was. I just thought he was the coolest looking fucker on the planet.   I was torn watching that game. I really wanted Arsenal to win, but being a Celtic fan, I was absolutely made up for Henrik, after he'd been so loyal to us - he could have easily played for one of Europe's top teams.   Yeah that's what I said - it's now more than likely that Arsenal will surpass Man United's record over the next couple of years.   Well I'm sure he was cursing when he left!    Given the way they've started under LVG, I'd say it's more the lack of Ferguson effect!   Ah, thanks for that mate. Very likely now that Arsenal will surpass Man United in this respect.   Ah right, so within the context of the English leagues it could be a record?   Oops! Haven't had my breakfast yet, my brain isn't working yet! :-/  Then yes, that would be a ridiculous group :D   Morning gooners! As a non-Arsenal fan, I was just wondering why so much is being made of reaching the CL for the 17th time in a row? I'm not at the wind-up here, it's obviously an important achievement, but is that the only reason why - or is this some kind of record?   I only ask because surely other teams in Europe, like Bayern or Real Madrid have done something similar? (I'm happy to be proven wrong!).   I don't think that can happen, can it? I thought it was a rule that you can't have two teams from the same country in a group.  Either way, replace Roma with the likes of Monaco or Anderlecht and it would still be a massively tough group!   Indeed. That kind of fight is often enough to lift other players around him I would imagine, and it certainly brings the crowd to life. Reminds me a lot of Suarez when he was at Liverpool.   Their manager, Slaven Bilic. Got sent off in the previous leg, apparently.   I'm not surprised, he absolutely ran himself into the ground. And I didn't realise he was such a fighter on the pitch. Just what Arsenal need.   Thanks for the reply mate, much appreciated. Pretty disappointed that diplomacy appears to be a shit mechanic, I was really looking forward to it! Now I'll just concentrate on a research win :)  I've thought about turning pirates off before, but felt a bit cheap doing it really! But I don't know why, I almost always turn barbarians off in Civ.   I've just bought Rebellion within the last couple of days, and was trying to go for a diplomatic victory against the AI, but even though I could spend money to make them like me, my feelings towards them just stayed at hateful the whole time, despite having envoys at their planets. I know I can offer missions to improve relations, but the only mission I seemed to be able to choose was to ask them for credits or resources, which they would just refuse, even if it was the lowest amount asked for.  Can anyone help? I'm not sure what else to try, and I don't know how to open up more mission types to offer them, if that's possible. (I'm playing 1v1 if that makes a difference.)   To be honest mate, after the way that a lot of Legia fans conducted themselves on here when UEFA kicked you out, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they did get abuse. Legia being kicked out the CL had absolutely nothing to do with Celtic, but that didn't stop the endless whining and bitching about it on here from some Legia fans, a lot of which was directed at Celtic, as if we were somehow to blame. Of course, it's the prerogative of Legia fans to come on here and act like arseholes if they want, but don't dish it out and start bleating if someone decides to return the favour.   This referee has been terrible all game for both sides.  	183
 Yes please!!  remindme! 1 day         At least you know what to look out for now o_o good for you for removing yourself from the situation!  	4
 I assume its the date the store opened.    Now that pennies are 'banned' in Canada, I'm craving to make a giant world map with all the extra ones I have.   Mcdonald and Broadway in Vancouver   hahaha YES! except it isn't a crappy Mercator!   The detail in topography was amazing! I'm pretty sure the red-dish colours indicate countries that produce wines they carry.      If you prefer to sit in the aisle on your flight but there "aren't any more aisle seats left", go up to the counter attendants at your gate and whisper to them that you have a bladder infection and you don't want to disturb other passengers. Haven't failed so far.   I guess he didn't get the memo about [](/s "Tara...")   WHOA! I only saw that once I turned my screen brightness to the maximum.   Now I just find this pic really creepy.  	9
 Naww thanks. Interesting username btw.  	1
 Greetings friend.   Name of the atlas in English is, "Translation of The New Atlas" actually.  	2
 It's the 26th... It's much clearer in person.   Especially this one, mostly because of Joel and Ellie. Well, Joel. He's close to where I live (based on signs in the game).   Is it weird that I would actually be disappointed?   Okay, we have different interpretations. I'm done with this conversation.   At least it will be exciting!      This is what I did. I finished the first time and just thought about it, almost constantly, in the few days that followed. I just finished my second play through two days ago, and I cried more the second time than the first, which I didn't expect.  A very powerful, very emotional game. I didn't want it to end, either.   It's been 20 years, I think five minutes isn't going to hurt.  She can tell Joel was lying to her, yeah, but that doesn't mean she knows the truth. The way Ellie acts isn't what really tells me she doesn't know anything, though, it's the way Marlene acts.  We obviously have different interpretations of what happened, so we should just agree to disagree.   All I could think about was another time I saw someone fall off a horse and what happened to them. I just knew he was gonna die.  (the time i was referring to was in game of thrones, season 1)   That was a really beautiful house, outside and inside. Huge, too. The size of those hallways!!   She asks "What am I wearing?" and "What happened?" when she wakes up, there is nothing that implies that she was briefed. Also, Marlene says something about Ellie being willing to die for the cute, but the wording (which I can't remember) implies, to me, that she is assuming that Ellie would agree to it, not that Ellie definitely agreed to it. If she had talked to Ellie and Ellie agreed, why keep Joel from her? Why begin immediately? Why not wait until Joel wakes up and Ellie can tell him herself, "I'm willing to die for this"?   She does talk about, a few times, things they can do after it's over, or says things implying she expects to be alive after.  "I can't wait for these things to be wiped out" (after a clicker attacks her)  She also says she and Joel can go wherever he wants after it's done.  That's all I can remember specifically, but I know there are more.   I don't know if it's ever stated out right, but Ellie's actions, to me, imply that she doesn't know.    When Joel met Ellie, her bite was three weeks old, didn't they only figure out that she was immune after she was bitten and didn't turn?  I was going to add that Joel knew Ellie better because of everything they went through, but apparently I forgot to add that.  Maybe Marlene would have wanted to save her after knowing her as Joel knows her, but Joel also had lost his daughter. Marlene lost people, but never anything like that. She's young enough that most of her life has been post-breakout, and I think a lot of people live every day expecting to lose someone they care about, so while losing someone still sucks, they are more prepared for it. Joel didn't wake up that morning prepared for anyone to die, let alone his daughter, and I think he felt a much stronger sense of loss because of it.   In any case, it doesn't excuse Marlene never telling Ellie about what they planned to do with her.  edit: fixed grammar   (I really hope I did the spoiler tag correctly)  I'm seeing a lot of merchandise like Firefly pendants with your name on them, or things with the Firefly emblem on them, and as much as I adore The Last of Us, I wouldn't buy any of those products, because I would never want to associate myself with the Fireflies after what they did to Ellie.  I'm not even talking about wanting to kill her for the cure. I understand, logically, that Ellie's death would not be in vain if it helped with a cure.  But they weren't even going to TALK TO HER ABOUT IT and that pisses me off. Marlene never told her, or Tess, or Joel, about what was going to happen to Ellie once the Fireflies got their paws on her.  I think Ellie is the type of person who would agree to die to save humanity, and that's why Joel didn't tell her the truth. Because HE didn't want her to die, he wasn't protecting Ellie's memory of Marlene or even protecting her feelings at all. He was protecting her life, but a life that, if given up, could mean the cure for humanity. He knows that if she knew the truth, she would be willing to sacrifice herself, and he couldn't deal with that.  Marlene has known Ellie from birth. That means she either doesn't know Ellie as well as she thinks she does, she didn't want to risk Ellie saying no and having to use force, or she was being a coward who didn't want to say anything to Ellie. I think no matter what, she was being a coward by not even saying anything to Ellie. Maybe she had convinced herself that she was doing Ellie a favor. I don't know.  I just know that Marlene makes me angry for not being willing to talk to Ellie, and either the other Fireflies were okay with that, or they were following a leader who was keeping them in the dark about things like that, and in either situation, I wouldn't want to be associated with them.  (I don't want to be associated with the hunters, either, though, so I suppose it's a good thing I don't do multiplayer)   I've been wondering about this, too. Wasn't it the cordyceps that infected her that were mutated? What caused the mutation? Could she infect other people? To my knowledge, she claims to have infected David, but he dies before he can turn, do we ever see his wound?   I noticed this in my current (second) playthrough. I don't know how I entirely missed the whole scene the first time, but then I noticed the writing on the floor, and then I saw the bodies covered by tarps... I wonder if he talked to them about it first.   I love seeing all the things like this, bits and pieces of other people's lives that we'll never get to know more about.    It's very realistic and I like that a lot, but it's brutal to think about.   I know they are pretty rare, but they are basically just really fast Runners with more fungus growing on them.   I'm from Austin, Texas. My friend and I were freaking out about it, haha :)   Oh my god, I just understood what this could mean :( This game just keeps finding new ways to kick me in the gut    Damn.... I really wanted to do this, but I can't really draw that well. Would writing be acceptable?   I'm curious about what you wrote this on the back of. Is it significant or just neat looking?   I loved the ending, it felt complete enough and still left me wondering just a bit, which some people must hate, but it's probably my favorite sort of ending.   Ellie knows Joel is lying, but she doesn't know why, or if any part of what he is saying is true. She never encountered the Fireflies herself, she was unconscious when they found her and she never woke up; she doesn't know they wanted to kill her.  She trusts Joel, though, and even if she isn't sure why he's lying and she's not sure what it means, she's willing to stick with him and "believe" his lie, because maybe she's not certain she wants to know the truth if Joel is willing to lie about it.  That's just my thought about it, anyway.   My friend and I joke about how Tess and/or Ellie keep finding knives that can't break and keeping them for themselves.   He died without showing any signs if I recall, but I don't know how much time passed between when she bit him and when he died. Tess' wound was pretty terrible within a couple of hours, though.    I was on a fucking rampage in that hospital trying to get to Ellie. As soon as Joel woke up and I saw Marlene, I said out loud, "I'm going to fucking shit rage if they try and keep Joel and Ellie apart." Then, of course, they did, and I murdered the fuck out of anyone who got in the way.  I would have chosen the "selfish" option in a heart beat, and I don't know if I would ever be able to pick the other one no matter how many times I played through it.  My only disappointment is that I didn't get to pull the trigger on Marlene, but I was not sorry to see her go.   I grew up with a brother, and the position of the toilet seat never bothered either of us. If the toilet seat is up when I go in there, I lower it. If it's down when he goes in there, he raises it. I don't understand why some people apparently make a huge deal over it.   Aaand, I just realized that's what OP said. I read the top comment thinking it was OP, I'm still getting used to the reddit app.   During winter, when Ellie was fighting David in the building. He fucking creeped me out from the start, and knowing the shit he wanted to do to her just made me sick. Everything that happened in winter was upsetting.   Oh I forgot to include the story with picture #5. There was a hole there ~~(it's gone now)~~ from a very long time ago, around the same time as the termites, and my dad patched it up. I included it to show that the wall was damaged by more than just termites. I can't remember how that hole got there, but it was also patched in multiple places along the top above the window, cracked from the weakened structure (similar to the damage in picture #2).   Thank you. I'm not sure when we'll be able to remove the drywall, but hopefully sometime this week. I'll post new pictures when we're done.   If I decided to hire someone instead, would we need to remove the drywall in order to get an estimate? I'm nervous about just tearing out part of the wall and then not being able to repair it until we can pay someone else.   We had termites in one room 10+ years ago. The termites have been gone for ages, but the damage is still there. It was in a room that no one used for anything other than storage, and it wasn't collapsing in on itself, so no one cared enough to do anything about it.  Now I'm trying to move in to that room. It needs tons of work, but the biggest, most intimidating thing is repairing the termite damage.  [Here are some pictures of the walls and visible damage.](http://imgur.com/a/7uEqs)  We aren't sure how much it's spread, obviously, but both walls face outside (? not sure of term), and I'm worried about that causing problems, same with the window. I know that the damage goes up over the window, too.  I've built walls before. I've built walls with windows before. But I have no idea what to do here. I have no idea where to start. Is it even a good idea to attempt to fix it without a professional and no prior experience with this specifically?   	34
 Still wanna do some iron banner? Gt: ThyPlaidKnight 28 lock   What a well written post. I would join that group of handsome Devils any day.   ThyPlaidKnight  Feel free to add me!   I like the idea of doing the draft over a longer period of time. A group could just set up a editable google document, give a 24 hour time limit per pick. The only real downside is If everyone has 24 hours to make their picks it could take as long as 360 days...  	4
 http://i.imgur.com/mFEd4rB.jpg   This is no makeup, Id love any suggestions! But I'm definitely looking for a pretty wearable brown lip    Absolutely love a few of their songs!   I'm being Mary Poppins! Any ideas?   Not that I recall, they're LE and I will admit I wasn't paying much attention, anyone know if they're the same price?    I absolutely love it! I'm not one who normally wears nudes or mlbb shades but I absolutely love this!    I hope they do, it is honestly much better, it's...less cheap looking?   I wish they would switch it! I like it a lot this way    I'm sorry my old packaging example is scratched up, but I picked up sweet cream last night and I was surprised that the packaging was different! It's blacker, and sleeker, I really like it! The cap to the lipstick hasn't changed at all, but overall im happy they changed it!       Heh, multiple orgasms   I'm pretty sure I have 10+ lipsticks just for putting my lip of the day in my purse and forgetting to take it out!'   Everyone's got a different type    Oh, I didn't understand why you were jugs saying "no"    I'm actually a little underweight, I have a very round face which could probably make someone think I'm chubby    Nope!  I just found this subreddit today!   To each their own!   Cutie pie 100000000000/10 I love you    Haha thanks! I was in a play,    Thank you! :)   Here are some more recent pictures I'm interested in what you have to say!   http://imgur.com/Z1iiVZW http://imgur.com/IDXji1P http://imgur.com/8Me63hO http://imgur.com/Qjj3gVl    Why?   Here are some pictures, I tried to get a range of different styles or whatever   http://imgur.com/4iHkhSJ http://imgur.com/Z1iiVZW http://imgur.com/IDXji1P http://imgur.com/8Me63hO http://imgur.com/Qjj3gVl    I can't see the rules on mobile, I saw that there was a 16 year old on the front page so I assumed it wasn't just 18+. Just thought this would be a fun experience. Sorry that made you feel like you had to be sassy       Thanks!   Thanks for the advice!   Rant: all the Ulta stores within my immediate area (about a 3 city radius) are completely disgusting when it comes to their displays and testers. I recently went to try and look for a nice black lipstick (to no avail unfortunately) but was dumbfounded by the mess that was specifically the NYX and Benefit areas   Rave: my new 24 Hour Color Tattoo in tough as taupe. I'm still trying to get a hold of creamy contour. But I absolutely love it so far!    I don't think I've ever heard that song and NOT cried    No they posted on their Instagram at it's July 31-August 2   Please let this be true    Already seen 2 people caught smoking pot and it was confiscated, and it's not even 4 on the first day!   I'm new to makeup! Id love to try all those products since I don't own any of them, and always have wanted to but I mean... A teen girl doesn't make enough money for all that   :((( I would love it if you picked me!    I live by central so I SHOULD be going there, but I go Glenn because of their theater program    Definitely, the homeless people seemed to spike in the past two or three years and now they're everywhere, the polish festival is going on right now and they're just wandering around it piss drunk. The city is getting more dangerous at night. But other than that the downtown area is super cute!   Hell yeah, I don't think I've been there yet and not seen a homeless man sleeping on it    An hour away from Ann Arbor here in Bay City!   She was the most obnoxious, loud mouthed, inconsiderate girl I had ever met,  we've been dating a year    Tri-city area in Michigan, maybe he reads reddit and just stole it, because I mean what are the odds that this thread is on the front page of r/askreddit AND the town radio host happens to share stories about bad break-ups that include getting a membership to the KKK    Dude I just heard my local radio guy that happened to him on air, this better be the same fucking guy    What does it mean?   I'd rather be a little slow and safe than aggressive and reckless when it comes to driving       That sucks! I wish it would have worked out better for you :( it's annoying know that no matter how many people tell you a foundation is great, every person's skin is different and we all need different things. I wish there was just one mega-foundation that worked for everything!   Thanks for the clarification!!    Could I be mistaken and thinking of photo ready instead if colorstay?   Are you sure you used the Whipped ?   I like to refer to myself as "cancer patient pale" if that give you any idea. The two lightest shades are very pale, one with yellow undertones and one with pink, I use the pink undertoned one which would be the "second lightest" but I think it is very pale, if you can I would try it on in stores but I don't think you'd be dissapointed!   Rave: Tarte Amazon Clay 12 hour Foundation. I have an unbelievably oily face and this is the only foundation I've discovered that's able to control it. It is my exact shade and doesn't make me break out, plus I can't even feel it when it's on my face. Truly the best item of makeup I own to date.   Rant: Revlon colorstay whipped. It's got glitter in it??????? Who wants glittery foundation!?    Product List   NYX Mosaic Blush  Random Brown Eyeshadow   	49
 So how would the admissions committee look at a 24 year old Black Latina with a 3.65 gpa?   Get your girlfriend to feed you while you play.   I came in this thread expecting this to be the top comment lol   ON FLEEK TIL I DIE!!!   Frustrated because I can't find another queer black lady to fall in love with :( Living in the midwest isn't helping me at all.   I agree with you. Slightly different but as a black person I'll sometimes make my voice higher around certain non POC for the same reason.   Why weren't you allowed to be left handed? That's crazy to me!   My sister knows that pain. When she answers the phone people will ask "is your mom and dad home?" lol.   I like you:) Plus I find deeper voices to be quite sultry   Well I was going to pm the info. Wasn't sure where or how to link here.    I know, confirmation bias. Nice to see all the lefties represent though lol.    Ok.Twas just a joke.   I don't know, figured someone has to do the grocery shopping    Ambidextrous is the fancy name :)   Hot as fuck. No idea how they survive in places like Saudi Arabia in all that black.   Sexy is always good lol!   I used to joke with my Muslim friend that she had the advantage during the winter. Full on hijab seemed warm.   Seriously. The deadbeat dad joke goes round and round...   How many Raptors are left handed or think they have a deeper voice than straight women? My sorority sister (also gay) and I were discussing how our neuroscience book says lesbians are more likely to be lefthanded. We also think lesbians have deeper voices than the general straight female population. Just curious:)  Edit: So at the time I counted 37% were left handed compared, compared to about 10% of general population. 14% ambidextrous. About 41% of you felt you have a deeper voice. I am not a scientist, but I like stats like these :)    Fellow Iowan!  *Waves*   From the midwest?   Ear plugs bro.   This might sound stupid but Amazon Prime. They have practically everything and a couple clicks puts what I want on my doorstep in no time.    Psychological addiction is legit. I started vaping ridiculous amounts after my aunt died because I didn't know how to cope. It reduced my anxiety and sadness to more tolerable levels.   Same. I have no idea why I do this.   Pop is so addicting. I drank a Pibb because that's all they had at the time and craved it for days after. I didn't even think it tasted that great.   During the summer cutting grass is a good way to make money. Kid on my street makes $30 just for small yards.   Last year I flipped stuff on Craigslist. Bought a mattress for $20 and sold it for $40.    Interesting, thanks!    I know nothing of Canada's pop culture.   True. I normally don't look up background info on an artist unless they're particularly interesting or good looking.    Damn you're right lol.  Edit: I just remembered Sam Smith as well.   Where do the maggots come from in rotting corpses? Are they already inside us?   Eating in general.   Me three!   Good to know!   Agreed, they're quick to write a script. I mentioned having a bad nights sleep (finals!) and she asked if I wanted Ambian or something similar immediately. I'll just lay off the caffeine thanks.   That likes Lady Gaga.   If you're in the middle, it makes it hard for people to walk around you in either direction.   I like to retighten my sheets in the morning. Feels better when I get in than loose crumpled sheets.   One inside the other.   Because it's an internet forum not the personal statement for grad school.   First original one I've read.   Found the not lesbian.   What should they call you in front of strangers?   It's like I get this weird tingly sensation right before the sweat erupts.   People in my school's parking lot are so anxious to get in, sometimes I don't have room to get the fuck out. Asian kid in the BMW, I'm looking at you.   Freeway Wind- produced by Skillrex   Time.  How does one overuse time?   Well, fuck you too.   Nonrenewable resource worries: fossil fuel, water, ketchup.   It's the only way I can tolerate Brussel sprouts.   As a college student with depression, I'd most likely be dead if it weren't for my antidepressants. Are you saying you think they're oversprescribed?    True. If the bus in my area came more often and went closer to grocery stores and restaurants, I'd definitely use public transportation more.   How many rolls do you estimate to go through a week. I admit I used to get irritated with my roommate because we went through 3-4 rolls a week for the two of us. After she moved, one roll would last me almost 2 weeks.   Definitely agree with electricity. I can't understand why my roommate needs to leave the bathroom and kitchen lights on when she's in her room with the door shut.   What's femalia?   Black people are from Hawaii now?   Actual black person here. I wash my hair twice a week or sometimes more if it's volleyball season. Any more and it gets super dry. My maintenance includes brushing or combing multiple times a day and cuts about every 8 weeks. Christ I hate misinformation.   Minus the big ass hospital bill.   I feel the same way. The dentist pulled 4 of my teeth for braces and a year later 4 more replaced them. So much pain.   Plus it makes your ass look great!   Marry me? I love to garden and make delicious cocktails. I also dabble in rugby from time to time.   Awhile ago I heard this interesting tidbit that in that past pink was a "boys color" and blue was for girls. The gender association switched at some point.  Also, I find guys who were pink button downs at my job to be very cute and doesn't subtract from their masculinity at all.   Haha I'm a woman and I love men's clothing. I don't have to worry about exposing cleavage and your pants have functional pockets!   That sucks and it's interesting bc, that's the reverse of my experience as a more masculine female. The older I get the less shit I get for not wearing skirts and drawing winged eyeliner. I like snapbacks and loose fitting shorts.   What's a normal gender identity? I feel like that is still an obscure concept.   Witch hazel works for me, after a gentle cleanser like Sebamed.    I was thinking they would have fit in as a member of the Volturi in Twilight.    I was thinking good place to put the onion dip   The knee's not the only thing that's gonna get jerked.    So if the patient who received the knee replacement gained a lot of weight, would the replacement fail?    Wascally wabbits!   Well then  *scuttles away*   Trainer or therapist?   Same here, underrated imo. I check to see if there's a possibility of a sequel, but I don't think that's ever gonna happen.   True, I can respect different experiences. A lot of different things come in to play here. I didn't grow up in a big city, but a mid-sized fairly diverse town in the midwest. My family's middle class as well. I have a ton of sympathy for people who are both minorities and poor. It's tough to break out of that mold. I wish your friend the best.   Your comment is so far off from my experience as a Black person. Everyone I know of is proud of me for going to graduate school and are supportive in numerous ways. My mother's church raised several thousand dollars to help me with tuition over the years, helped me move, and put my accomplishments (and the other students' as well) in the local newspaper. My dad was angry when I had a B in calculus in high school. How does this add up to black culture being anti education? I grew up with Black people, am actually Black. People tease me for being a freaking nerd and always reading, in a playful way. I'm not attacking you I just felt the need for a different perspective from the generalization you posted.   Weird I'm black and have tons of African friends.   As a minority, I really appreciate this post. I don't think some people realize how tough it is to be a rep for, or carry the weight of your race around day to day. I'm in college and I often check my speech or behavior, for two reasons. One, so people don't say of course a black person would get a bad grade in biochem, they're dumb and lazy. And two, so my impression doesn't make it difficult for the person of color after me. Even doing these things I've had to deal with professors making questionable comments.   Sometimes I'm jealous of white people's ability to be individuals, it's quite the luxury. People take your character into account before they notice your race.  Anyway, I applaud you for yourself analysis :)   Agreed   Are you a serial killer then?   Darkness! What did the five fangers say to the face??  *SLAP!!!*   *Nods in agreement*    [Another pic](http://36.media.tumblr.com/1f9d6e99e01400d203e7fdac480e1ec3/tumblr_nib11eDdBi1tzlxwlo1_1280.jpg)   the*   I'm a madam:) And thanks for your reply!    I read this in Sergeant Doakes' voice.    Again?!    I'm sitting at 10 weeks, with about an inch of new growth maybe. Right now I think I'll wait until July to cut it. The different textures are getting a little difficult to manage so I'm trying to be gentle with it.    You're beautiful! How long did you transition for? I'm in that period right now and getting antsy for the big cut.   /u/waffletoast are you me? These are exactly the two pets I want! I've been trying to find one at a shelter bc breeders are too dang expensive.   periodical   Try daily.    How do you know they're less qualified unless you see their personal statement, letters of recommendation and resume?   No it's created by the society that might assume Chad is a better person than Alejandro or Demetrius, solely on the inference they're making from their name.   Whites don't have a Bible saying being black is a sin.  You might want to look up the the Curse of Ham.    Can I get a source on that? Especially that last bullet point.   I'm a black Humanist lesbian, but not wheelchair. Can anxiety count as my disability instead?   Latinos...   Obviously this time of year the library is overrun with people trying to cram for final exams,   do you have any recommendations for other places to get a nice study session in?    Thanks!    Give them an education and get them to earn a degree  You kind of make it sound like a college in America is free or cheap. There millions of Americans who can't afford college or drowning in student loan debt. Who's going to pay to educate these immigrants?   Biodiverse?   I think the ones who wanna hit and run are over-represented. The settle down types are hard to find:(   Around this time last year. I met with a couple who sounded like a good match and settled everything with 3 other grad students in July. Took a little time to weed out sketchy people.    I found my roommates through Craigslist, good way to screen personality types to match yours. Otherwise there might be a Facebook page where you can make a post.

 Seems like a med student.   Yup. I was on my uncle's lap. He pulled his hands in my shorts and fondled my genitals in front of my Mom and Dad. Everything was so casual. No wonder I'm under therapy for PTSD/depression.   It's my dark secret. I was molested in front of my father and mother by my uncle.   I am watching a lesson on the same on Coursera.  The course is "Introduction to Astronomy" (Duke University) by Ronen Plesser.  This is best described in the 5th lesson (Where is the sun?) of the first week (Positional Astronomy).  I will try to post screenshots.   I have gone through the various resources (WikiPedia, YouTube, Reddit) about the ecliptic but still find it hard to imagine it. Is there any better way someone can explain people to imagine the ecliptic from the point of view of an observer on earth looking up at the sky over the course of the sidereal year?   Thank you for your thoughts! I belong to the LGBT community too and I have met some TGs. I think I will ask them too.   I meant the blisters caused by wearing ill-fitting shoes.   Would women in general be willing to admit to your hypothesis?      Must confess. I do both.   The link above redirects to this reddit post. Can you please check?   His character is so adorable.

 Perfect 😍   The other 70% have slipped into a coma from shock.   I always felt like that the first times I went out without my sleeves down. I imagine others did too. But it definitely does get easier :)    Yeah, I would too.   Shh. *is hold* - is cuter.    From my own experience; some people will stare. But most people are just too busy going about their day to fully notice things. I've never had anything said to me about them in public or had anyone asking about them.   Agreed, we'd love to see it :) well done on the 4 weeks    Bio oil, worked for me. Although, it has to be used several times per day for a few months to notice any improvement.    This is the most relatable thing I've read in a while. Kinda beautiful, but also rather sad.   The exact same thing happened to me yesterday, I did the side a little too short. I know pretty much how you feel. I'm sure you did your best, and had the best intentions. As did I. Feel free to PM me if you need to talk x   For what it's worth; happy birthday OP. Keep your head up, x   Perhaps not necessarily dumb, but when she started googling my symptoms. It got a little worrying.   Where can I get that? *-*   Slowpoke; self explanatory.  	14
 Oh for fuck's sake, man.  I'm not saying anyone is against me, I'm just describing a basic human attribute and how it can guide other human's perceptions; Face it, mate. People value physical attractiveness first and foremost. Why are you having trouble with that? Do you honestly think the way you look has no effect on how people respond to you?  And for every successful 'buttface', there were likely several, equally kind 'buttfaces' who didn't end up happily married. Do you think of them? What about that weird kid every school has that everyone thought would shoot up the place? Or the thousand other undesirables shunned and condescended by people like you, all the while being constantly berated about 'how that one time some random ugly guy got a girlfriend or something', and that 'looks don't matter, only your personality does'.   Did they all 'suck as people'?   And you still haven't answered my question, but I will for you: You didn't stay with those unattractive women because for all their 'personality' and everything, you couldn't fathom yourself actually entering into a serious, long-term monogamous relationship with them and went for someone prettier.   Am I right?   No, mate. You gained validation from whatever positive social experiences you had in the past and with said validation, created a sense of self-esteem. You didn't make yourself lucky and successful with women, you were born into it through favourable genetics.   Of course it comes down to looks with me, have you forgotten the fact that I'm ugly? My life has been determined by the way I look, similar to yours. We're just on different scales of the spectrum; people respond nicely to you because you're good looking, thus granting you self-esteem and validation and thus granting you the illusion of personal achievement whereas people respond negatively to me because I'm ugly, thus destroying self-esteem and giving no validation. Is that so hard to understand?  And how are my views on women disgusting? Because I don't patronise unattractive women by assuming that the physical attractiveness of a potential partner doesn't matter to them?  Also, you didn't answer my previous questions. Did you stay long with any of these 'physically unattractive women'?   I wouldn't for the very reason a girl of similar attractiveness to me wouldn't be interested in myself: Unattractive people aren't attracted to unattractive people just because they're unattractive.   I'm not a victim. I don't blame my problems on the world, I don't blame anyone for the way I look.  It's just the way it is. Fuck, why is that hard for people to understand?   It just pisses me off when people who have been spoon-fed social validation through no agency of their own talk to people like me as if the reason I didn't have that crucial foundation necessary for intimate relationships in the future was because 'I didn't try hard enough.'  And of course you respond with anecdotes. Whilst there has been concrete scientific study on phenomena such as the halo effect/ physical attractiveness' role in social interactions, there has been nothing to back up your 'friends who are ugly but married' but your word, likely coloured by a variety of external factors.   Look, if it makes you feel better about the world then keep believing that people's looks change don't how they are perceived, and that everyone is judged solely on their personality.   But you've been with pretty girls.  So you obtained validation from the interactions with them first, yeah? And with said validation you were able to go with some unattractive girls and then think to yourself, " Well, they're not that bad, but at least I've had these encounters with x, y and z, who were all pretty, so I know that I won't only always be with unattractive women."   Did you stay with these unattractive women long? Did you marry one? Get one pregnant? Of course you didn't.  Face it, mate, we're all shallow animals. You can dress it up as much as you want behind illusions of liking someone's 'personality', but it your shallowness will remain and the halo effect will guide your interactions.  Someone has to die alone, it's only because you're in the average that you don't see that.   Well, you haven't actually seen me, so that's a pretty unfounded claim.  I'm single for a variety of reasons, but my physical unattractiveness is at the top of the list.    That's the dilemma, isn't it mate? To overcome loneliness, I'd have to date someone as unattractive as myself who would also find me unattractive. You reckon that's a good thing? No mutual attraction between intimate partners?   It sucks, it does. I wish I could not factor someone's physicality into how I interact with them, but I, like everyone here (including those who won't admit it) can't completely dismiss how someone looks.  If you have to ask this question, you clearly haven't experienced what it is like to be unattractive. I, like yourself,like anyone,can't just stop myself from desiring physically beautiful people and start desiring ugly people. Fuck, I wish I could.  And I'd imagine most of those women attractive as myself face this same dilemma.   You have to be trolling.  Unfortunately, I don't think he is, this mindset is pretty prevalent among the average populace; if it wasn't some gracious deity, it must've been their own hard, American work ethic! Surely it must've been, right?   They achieved all of this from the get-go as everyone is born equal, yeah? Except those disabled people, but we can just dismiss them, lock them in institutes and viciously attack any doubts about their miserable lives they have with anecdotes of some friend-of-a-friend who was disabled and banged a hot chick or something, or that dude on T.V who is happy but missing his limbs.   It's the same with them uglies! You're ugly? You still got two hands, dontcha? At least you ain't as bad as them cripples! Get ta work n you'll be rewarded! What's that? You've worked hard all your life with no reward? Work harder,cunt.   Let's be honest with ourselves, big fella-- For every 'successful ancestor' there was at least one non-successful ancestor whose bloodline died with him/her, society is the product of an interplay between those that have and those that don't.  And you should feel better about yourself; people like me exist to pamper your precious self-esteem and allow you to reflect on the fact that 'at least you're not as bad as us.'   I don't wallow self-pity, I accept my place in the world and I don't delude myself with notions better contemplated by those who were allotted a better roll of the dice. Please don't come in here and patronise those of us on the other end of the bell-curve.   What do you think I could achieve, being as unattractive as I am? A relationship with someone as unattractive as myself? Someone who would also find me physically unattractive? Would you date someone you found physically unattractive? Of course you wouldn't; no one does.   Get out of the mindset that you are the sole conductor of your 'destiny'.  P.S I exercise and I eat well, but neither will change my facial aesthetic. My legacy will die with me, but so will yours after a time.    Ah yes. You're one of them self-deterministic types, eh? Would you say that to a deformed person? To a cripple? Of course not.   Well, matey, like how disabled people can't magically make their disabilities disappear, some of us aren't born aesthetically pleasing and no amount of nice hairstyles is going to fix that.  Thank the indifferent, random power of genetics that you weren't born like some of us, leave this sub and don't go thinking your position in life is entirely of your own doing.   Edit: The fact that these two numpties are being upvoted makes me a worried that this sub might not be for me any longer.   Work out, dress well, keep hygienic, wash your face, style your hair.  Heh...    To any modders out there,  SE combat needs a little more variety, IMO, and I think the addition of some kind of cruise missile launcher for large ships ( think something like the US MK 143 or a Tomahawk launcher) would be an awesome addition to the fairly limited large ship weapon collection. I'd do it myself but I have no clue as to how to code and have fairly basic modelling skills.   Won: Can eat anything and not really get fat.  Lost: Am only 5 ft 7. (fuck you, Italian heritage)   Wanna know what combat is like in Starmade?  There is no use for small ships; every ship you see is a gargantuan behemoth with enormous amounts of shields/guns/speed. Combat literally boils down to who can build the biggest ship.That's it. No manoeuvring, no clever building, no engineering custom weapons or ammunition.  And combat is all the game is really about, as you don't have to really worry about basic Newtonian physics/ resources all that much as :   a. There is no Newtonian physics, and b. Resources are so incredibly easy to come by ( stations, etc,) and building is as easy as Minecraft.  Meaning you can pretty much focus straight away on attacking other players, not balancing resources/build time like you need to in SE.  Sure, it has infinite worlds and logic implemented, but that's all it has over Space Engineers.   Oh, definitely.  The time frame in which I'm writing is set maybe a hundred or so years after the largest revolution known to the world of Wa: Gasin's Revolt ( Or The Fall of the Old Monarchy.  To paraphrase, Gasin was a wealthy merchant living under the reign of the Othenai Emperor in PL 1200 who overthrew the monarchy in 1205.   Merchants of that time were required to pay support-funds for wars of the realm. The Emperor of that time was engaged in a lengthy war with a smaller state which was draining on the resources of the merchants. Gasin was the first to say, ' Nope, fuck you. I'm out,' and stopped paying his wartax.   This caused an uproar from the nobility and the Emperor himself, who proceeded to have Gasin arrested. Gasin fled to a neighbouring kingdom and formed a group of like-minded merchants who then convinced the under class to rise up and depose the king. They did so enthusiastically and overran the state's capitol, butchering the Emperor and his entire extended family.  Gasin then took reign of the state, forming a council of other merchants to rule over the bits of land he kept from the collapsing Othenai Empire. Gasin and his Golden Teeth ( a term for both his actual teeth, which were gold, and the council of merchants he assembled) however went back on their promises to the underclass of 'every man has a voice' and instead established an oligarchical company-state called Authon. There was mass unrest again, but Gasin was lucky in that he was able to garner support against the rebellion by classing it as a rebellion of 'radical puritans', blaming the unrest on Authon's minority Axar population and the Church of the Fertile Womb. In doing so, Gasin turned the hatred felt by the multi-cultural underclass towards a single group of people long thought of as devious and insular, and avoided he himself being deposed.   Such was the work of Gasin Golden-Teeth, First High-Chairman of Authon.   People call any rioters animals and thugs, regardless of their skin-colour.  One example quoting Britain's youth as being called the 'most unpleasant and potentially violent young people in the world': http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2024486/UK-RIOTS-2011-British-youths-unpleasant-violent-world.html  People rioting and looting are cunts, whether they be black, white or brown cunts still doesn't change the fact that they are being violent and anti-social.    From the great expanses of tundra of Northern Othen to the moutainous heart of Firlon, the remains of Pre-Light society abound within Wa.  Most prominent of these could be considered wonders, for they are indeed marvellous creations of ancient technological prowess and still puts to shame much of what Post-Light civilisation has built.   I'll describe two wonders here: one Pre-Light and one Post-Light  **The Mai Space Elevator:** Forever a mystery, the Mai Space Elevator ( or The Finger of Cotmiv, depending on who you talk to) remains the most intact Pre-Light building of the known world. Lying a few kilometres from the city of Mai, its condition is so well-preserved that is it rumoured to still reach space, possibly even connected to some other ancient structure in the distant heavens.   However such speculations will remain  mystery as the elevator has been held tightly under the thumb of the Atcotmivrosht, the followers of Cotmiv, who deny all entry to the elevator on the grounds of it being a place not to be seen by mortal eyes, and their presence amongt Mai's senior council has made any possibility of exploration improbable. So the Mai Elevator remains untouched, gargantuan and eery as it towers above the hills of Central Othen, visible to the eye for hundreds of kilometers.  **The Pious Walk:**  An enormous procession of huge kneeling statues carved around 800PL, the Pious Walk is perhaps the most well-known wonder of Firlon. Each statue is said to represent some long-dead Huisa monarch, in total  numbering around 450 statues, all in various states of decay. The Pious Walk leads right to the old city gates of Ntua, ending it the unfinished statue of the most recent monarch, Boja the Seventeenth, who was beheaded during the fall of the Huisa regime in 1213 PL.   Dunno what Jackal is, really.   He just appeared one day and told me he'd stay for good. When I was little, he got me to break the spines of my sister's mouse which was pretty hilarious! I gave the mouse to him afterwards and he put it on his shoulder and said he was Blackbeard and now the mouse is still on there but it's teeth are really long now and I sometimes wake up to find it rolling around on my face,haha. The teeth scratch me sometimes.    Well, Benny said he saw him.   But Benny also eats the lead paint from the metal balustrade on his balcony.  My brother said he used to have the same dreams as I did at our old house in Haberfield when we were little but I don't think he's seen Ol' Mate since then.   Oh, I thought it was Gina, Piero and Bruce.   Hey guys, greetings from Australia: the land of VB, utes and wilful ignorance.   Bit of a weird title,sorry, but I guess I had to try and grab someone's attention with pure, exploitative bluntness.   Ol' mate Jackal's wearing my skin.  Well, not actually wearing my skin physically (at least I don't think so), but he's certainly not just in his own fur now. It's kinda strange as well because I thought he'd gotten used to me getting used to his worm-hair stuff ( Whatever the fuck it is; it's not really like worms, though-- more like thin seaweed caught in a tough current while it's still rooted to the rocks. Weird how it just floats like that.)  Anyway, I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions as to what I should do. I've tried asking him to stop wearing my likeness, but he talks too quickly. Always has. Sounds kind of like if you got three people and a goat and pumped them full of helium and then compressed them flat, letting out all the helium in one big rush. So a mixture of high-pitched animal/human squeals? Kinda hilarious sometimes. It hurts to listen other times.  I mean, I've known him since I was six, but this is the first time he's actually changed appearance.   What should I do?     B-but I have to fight the Dark One! *[looks off moodily into the distance]*   Hey guys. I've been following the CGCookie tutorial on creating a Low-poly mesh for game design and I've run into some trouble.   After rearranging the UVs and preparing to bake the normals, a weird circle that only appears in object mode appeared at the base of my mesh. Seen [here](http://imgur.com/a4XMp9e)  I also believe that this mystery circle is screwing up my normal bake and causing it to look like [this](http://imgur.com/Z6iUd7I). Also in that picture you can see that the origin of the low-poly has somehow changed, so to bake I have to manually move it closer to the high-poly.  I've tried recalculating the normals, flipping the normals, etc, but nothing works.  Have I accidentally hit a button that I shouldn't have?   :(^^^^^why ^^^^^did ^^^^^I  ^^^^^click?   This was shot on the coast?   Yeah, you don't wanna live there.   Not to seem rude, but where'd you get your source on the 25% statistic?   I'd imagine some in the East also wanted to revolt against Kiev but no one really acknowledges that they had any real grievance and just attributes it to Russian involvement.  But I see your point. Russia did play upon Eastern Ukraine's frustrations and encouraged them to revolt whereas the American colonists revolted independently.   My Axolotl and I: An erotic love story.   Yeah but without the French the Revolution wouldn't have gotten anywhere. You could argue the same thing in Eastern Ukraine: A small amount of Eastern Ukrainians were legitimately angry with the Kiev revolt and decided to revolt themselves. Russia took advantage of the situation and poured forth supplies and manpower into the rebels.  A lot of Western media seems to portray the Eastern Ukrainians as never actually wanting to secede and that the Russians basically manufactured all of the dissent, but I doubt the Russians would've had so much success in escalating the conflict if there hadn't been at least some grievance amongst the local population.   People tend to forget that the American Revolutionaries were also helped considerably by the French.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War  When you think about it, the scenarios are actually quite similar.   LIES! I've posted my pictures and I'm not attractive. I think I'm just one of the few ugly guys brave ( or stupid) enough to do it.      Вы учитесь русскому тоже? Я учусь в университете тоже. Может быть Мы практикуемся? У вас скайп или тиймспийк?   See, I'm the other way around.  I can do the Japanese r (alveolar tap) and the Arabic r (uvular trill), but can't for the life of me do a Russian r  (alveolar trill).   Sorry,replied to the wrong guy.   I don't particularly give two shits if you don't think it's true or not.   It was a story told to me by my dad, not to you; I just thought I'd share it, but you know...yadda yadda circlejerk/hivemind, etc.   Next time try not to get all pissy because of the anecdote of some guy on the internet's father.     The Aboriginal Languages of Australia.  Some of the most interesting and unique of the world's languages are found here (one of the world's only tripartite languages is found in Northern Australia), but one by one they are dying out.   I think production was around 1998.   Yeah, all he messed up the caravan and the wardrobe, so my dad was called in to fix it. This story was more anecdote than criticism against Keanu. Just thought it'd give more insight into the fact that actors aren't these God-men that a lot of people think they are.  As I said, my dad's a pretty vocal guy and he was just swearing out loud to himself at having to fix something that someone messed up. He didn't know it was Keanu that had done it, nor did he know Keanu was inside.  Guess this isn't the thread to post the story in.     What? You can't call someone out on their behaviour? Is it because he's a celebrity? He didn't straight out say it to Keanu's face, he was just generally cursing as he had to take time out of his shift to go fix a wardrobe because someone had kicked it in in a fit of anger. He didn't know Keanu was there.   The guy wrecked the caravan that had been given to him, my dad had every right to call him a fuckwit. It was the film set's property and Keanu chucked a hissy fit because he though the Matrix was going to be a flop.    My dad worked on the set of The Matrix and has a few stories to tell about his experience there. Apparently, Keanu wasn't as nice as people today think him to be.   According to my dad, Keanu made a general mess of his caravan in a fit of anger and my dad was called over to fix the wardrobe. My dad, being the verbal kind of guy he is, expelled a variety of obscenities, some along the lines of, "What fuckwit did this?"   Much to my father's chagrin, the perpetrator of such fuckwitry was no other than Keanu Reeves himself who had still been residing within the caravan. On hearing my father's exclamation, ol' mate Keanu exited the caravan in a huff, but before he left he kicked in the door, turning to my dad and saying something like, "Something else for you to fix."  Probably left out some details as I haven't heard my dad tell the story for a long, long time, but that's the general gist of it.  edit:My dad appears in the credits of the film.

A number of space elevators had been constructed, transhumanism was the norm and Wa had finally established a equilibrium with its environment.  However, the sun Toruzh ( thought to be the eye of the God Toruzh by Eastern Othenai tradition) emitted a powerful solar flare that rendered most of the technologies created by man worthless and plunged them into a dark age lasting around 450-500 years. Countless hundred of millions died from starvation, disease and exposure as their machines ceased to save them from Wa's harsher aspects. Along with their technologies went all recorded data not written down, leaving the inhabitants of Wa still wondering to this day at what life may have been like for Pre-Light folk.     *'Yes, how can man see after such brightness? What value does the light of hope have compared to such beauty?'*   -Author unknown. Pre-Light Era.   Contemporary armies of Wa make heavy use of projectile based weaponry.   E.g. The Military Arm of the Authon Corporation equips its average soldier with a repeater. Repeaters are side-loaded, semi-automatic rifle-esque weapons that use a mixture of compressed air and magnetism to project small shards of metal. Due to the method of propulsion, projectiles from repeaters have a small range of fire, and thus regular soldiers are extremely dependant on artillery ( both static and mobile), exosuits, and melee.  Most heavier vehicles are equipped with larger version of said repeaters ( like the Monk-class MK.1 exosuit which uses dual heavy repeaters), or long-guns that fire a wide variety of spear-like projectiles. Other types of vehicles (land and air) also carry dumb-missiles, bombs or flamethrowers)  Artillery in Wa use traditional, Pre-Light powder-based munitions. Powder-based weapons are rare outside of artillery due to the rarity of saltpeter. That doesn't stop the armies of Wa from blasting the ever-living fuck out of each other with countless tonnes of explosive artillery rounds however. No one know how much saltpeter is left in the world, but it is used solely for military products.

 As strange as it seems regarding his current behaviour,he used to be really nice and open-minded before he knew haha   Yeah,you're right,I think this it what I have to do. I gave him a chance to stop being an ass and he blew it so I think that's the only way. Makes me sad still because we've known each other for like four years :/   The things I know would help me are just people showing a bit of care,open-mindedness and understanding. Them actually be there not only when they need something out of me. A world where you don't have to brag about your achievements to feel like you exist but that's a bit too much to ask,maybe.  Is there really nothing you can think of that could help you,too ? :)   So,you could try to spend a some time alone with her,make sure the moment is really nice,conflicts-free and tell her. This is what I did to come out to my own mom,it took mad courage to say the words but I felt so much better afterwards. If she doesn't react very well,I'd recommand you to bring back the subject later but to always be there to answer her interrogations if she has some,sometimes a "not-so-good reaction" is just people failing to understand.  If this is not an option,you might want to write her a letter. Also,remember that you have time to come out,you don't have to rush it. Only do it if you feel fully prepared to do so. :)  Look,if you are in fact a girl and pursuing it would make you happy,go for it without shame ! Life really is too short to do things you don't want to do,pretend and stuff just because of a biological sex. From someone who tried reaaally hard to "be a girl" only to please everyone ( I'm FtM ) and ended up miserable,I mean it. :)  	4
 This definitely resonated with me. Beautifully written.   I am having trouble finding the right foundation for my skin. I thought Classic Ivory, Ivory, or Nude would be the right fit for me  (even I had talked to people who worked at Ulta Beauty Shop and they believed it's the right color for me) but because now that it's summer, my skin's a bit tan now and I look a bit ashy with Ivory.  As for the color "Nude" - it depends because I have NYX Stay Matte but Not Flat Liquid Foundation and I think it's the right color for me, it has the yellow undertones to it I think. But when I tried the NYX HD Liquid Foundation with the same name, "Nude" - it's a bit lighter than the matte one and I still look ashy with it.  My skin is normal to oily.  This is the [picture](http://imgur.com/UvcJdxn) I took two weeks ago.  I have no foundation on, no makeup on.  I just hope this help you guys to get a better idea of which would be the better foundation for me...  Please help. It would be tremendous if I could find the right color for my skin.  Let me know if you need more information - I'll reply to your comments. Thanks.   Thanks for the tips!   I can't wait to get mine. I just ordered a couple of days ago!!   I've been watching a couple of different YouTube videos with different YouTube makeup gurus (such as Desi, Jaclyn, Pixiwoo) on brow tutorial.  Of course everyone does it differently but I have noticed that after filling in the eyebrows, they highlight to shape and clean up the brows... I have seen some used powder(?) and some used concealer(?)... correct me if I'm wrong... but which would be recommended to use after filling in the brows?   Thanks, I'll try that.   I try to when I can.  I just have this anxiety about being in the gym, full of people. Always thinking about what other people are thinking.  It's just very unsettling at times.   Can depression change your sanity?  I'm just so tired of being depressed. I'm just done. It's driving me crazy. I'm tired of being tired. I'm tired of being numb. I'm tired of watching time goes by, knowing if I don't do something different... then it'll be all I will ever know... I'm just SO tired.   I don't recognize the person I was 3 years ago, even though I was dealing with depression (only at the time, I thought I was getting better). I saw myself smiling often and laughing in pictures. I wondered if I was faking it or if it was a genuine person, just enjoying life.  I just don't recognize that myself...  I just don't remember that feeling anymore. I just don't recognize happiness.  Why does depression hurt? Why does it have to be agony?   I think that the best way to evaluate yourself before taking on medications would be talking to a therapist and ask for his/her opinion.  You can always get a second opinion by a different therapist and if you want to see a psychiatrist, you can discuss that with the therapist and they can refer you to see a psychiatrist and have them properly diagnose you and would help you get the right medication for you. I have done that and truly, overtime you learn about yourself better and you decide what's right for you.  Good luck, we're all here for you.  	10
 I don't quite understand... do you mean sexually?   	1
 You can't just use DICTIONARY definitions omg     Back in my days, it was pretty embarassing to admit that you're doing something just because "it's cool". It was only cool if you had a better reasons for it than that.  Good ol' times of 2010 :/     so...this implies there are people who think it isn't?  i...will have to think about that o.O    Maybe I'm embarassing myself now because it's obvious, but what the hell is a truscum?   I was not allowed to travel by long-distance trains by myself until I was 18 years old. Using trams in a big city, no problem, going to party with people they didn't even know, no problem, but no long-distance trains EVER. Not even when they I would get picked up at the station, not even with a reserved seat near to the staff, no, no fucking way.  I never fully understood that. Maybe it was just that they really didn't like my LDR boyfriend and it was a convenient way to make sure we would eventually break up, I don't know...    I don't really agree with that, it's a little harsh I Think...  However, the post made me think about something - I've read about a man who was claiming to be an alien and went to court over something (I think discrimination issues?) and the court rejected him because aliens have no right to sue on earth. Would that happen to otherkin too, if they claimed being discriminated?    Ok girl, listen up.  Not too long ago, I was basically in the same spot as you are. Even the same videogame. My boyfriend and I started playing together, and at the beginning, it was great. It was a fun game to play together, also with friends, and we both got into it quickly.  But he always had a little bit more time to play than I did. I had longer ways to school back when we were still in high school, my internet was often lagging out while his was good (we were LDR), so at some point, I had to face that he was not only a whole lot better at League than I was, but also that the amount of time he spendt on League was troubling. Insane, at some point. I remember, one time I visited him (remember, LDR, I traveled about ~ 400 km too see him for one weekend) he spent an entire day playing, without me.   What I want to advice you is - speak to him. Speak but DON'T ACCUSE. If you say he neglegts you, he cheats on you, he is addicted, whatever comes to your mind - he will deny it, you will think you're right, and you'll end up nowhere. I did this a hundred million times, I feel.   You need to tell him that you are worried about your relationship. Confront him about why he plays this game so much (honestly, wanting to become a pro player when having played for a few months is naive, at best. Most pros have been around since closed beta times) and where he thinks your relationship is going, how he thinks the relationship should continue; because I think he knows that a relationship will not continue forever when the couple isn't even meeting anymore.  I found it also helpful to find some new activities that you can do together. That might simply be a new videogame, or a sport, or watching a new show - anything, really. From what I've seen around my friends and boyfriend, people easily get attached to League and play a lot - but once a new fun activity comes around, they forget about it.  One last advice - I don't think you should expect him forever to act like in the beginning of the relationship. Of course, at the start, people hang around together all the time and care about nothing else, but League or not, this state is not forever. I agree that the amount you described is too much, but I don't think you can expect him to drop everything completly to go back to the relationship's start - that's not gonna happen.        Alright, I'll try that, thank you.    I don't actually know. I used some of these online-calculators, but since I don't know my fathers exact income and taxes (and the documents with this are the missing ones), it doesn't really help me much. Furthermore, an advisor from the Studentenwerk my father talked to apparently said that online calculators are unreliable ... but well, that might as well have been a lie for convenience so i can't prove him wrong.   I'll take a look at the loan thing though, thank you!   They only offer legal advice I think. When it comes to psychological or family problems, I don't think they have a service for that.    I can't wear toe socks. On my left foot, I have a very big toe instead of 2 smaller ones.   Can't say that it affects my life too much though...   	11

Route 67   Route 66   Germany.   Holland.   One of the things that really bugged me about systemd was how it was just thrown into some commercially supported distro we were using (SuSE I think), when much of the work we had done on our systems before hand was heavily dependent on the framework of the original init system (System V I guess).   We absolutely had to upgrade to the new version of the distro to overcome some issues with another package that was central to our business, which was also commercially supported by Novell.  When we staged a few machines we trundled through what amounts to porting much of the lower level system scripting across the canyon of these two distinctly different (at least from our perspective) init systems.  It was not fun. It cost a lot of money. It caused a rift in the team.  As for me, I am used to collapsing system initialization into a small script where everything is basically hard-coded, for lack of a better term, with full paths to executeables and in a sequential order that makes sense from a hardware point of view (look at multipathing over a distributed filesystem, for example).   It's a practice I implemented at this particular place because they wanted those machines to be able to reboot in 20 seconds, so I ripped out everything that we didn't need, packed up our own RPMS, and it all worked relatively smoothly until systemd came along. Sure we expected to have to do some legwork between distro revisions, but nothing like this.  So yeah, it was my fault, and I'll take a seat at the anti-systemd camp anyway because having such a seemingly fundamental change in the workflow of manipulating services on these machines was not something anyone could foresee when we dove in to begin with. For all intents and purposes systemd, and upstart for that matter, can be construed as a form of vendor lock-in when it comes down to choosing what commercially supported distribution to use.  It aint the good old days, that's for sure. Linux is a fucking beast.  Long live FreeBSD ;)   [The Arc de Triomphe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe)   [The Dune of Pilat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_of_Pilat)    You are on a dune.

We should let big money and agendas do the counting here instead of fairly neutral professionals simply being paid to run some numbers through their nice systems so aptly built for the exact purpose of running numbers.  At least the big money and agenda guys can effect change.  Heh.   Nature will sort that one out.   U-Verse (now known as Lightspeed) has been a disaster in terms of just getting the easements and permits secured to haul wiring that requires power and weatherproof air conditioned steel boxes all over the place and failover and needs to be within earshot of the attenuation tolerances of cat6 cable in many cases. Jeez.. that gave me a headache to type.  ... all through multiple townships and municipalities at a time. The logistics involved in replacing, upgrading, or most of the time, installing those big roadside boxes full of ethernet switches all over the damned place has been a nightmare since day one and is to this day. To say that ATT could just "switch on" higher speeds needs to be kept in context. Where the infrastructure was in place to do so, as with our smug DOCSIS3 cable providers, then it's a no-brainer. However, in most cases the stuff is just not built out yet for ATT to have a magic button to press that exponentially increases your broadband connection.  The cable companies do have that button, though. They have long since installed what's needed to incorporate ~300 megabit speeds into their product line and need only upgrade some gear here and there to make it happen. ATT needs fiber ran and fucking expensive port density installed to do that. They are having to implement a technology used in datacenters, a technology designed for relatively localized and closed off scenarios. It's bulky, archaic, inefficient, high maintenance, buggy, and it's being shat all over the US right now. Sounds just like everything else modern capitalism has done for this world, come to think of it. Hell, this is the poster child for planned obsolescence and ruining best practices. Imagine if everyone on your block had to use the same restroom. It's outside, fifty yards down the street, big as fuck, and a cool 65 degrees inside, but it flushes *fast*.  Cable companies just have a copper wire that they can mux and demux *miles* from signal origination. What ATT is doing aggravates the shit out of me. Leave it to ATT to pound a square peg into a round hole. Their entire super fast broadband implementation looks like ten pounds of shit in a five pound sack.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fighter_%28video_game%29  The one I am thinking of was a 3D flyer with basic 3D objects chunked together to form a ship that was upgradeable by flying through prize objects. You could get lasers and double guns and boosters and cool stuff like that for your ship to make it more effective and handle better.  I had hell finding the game to begin with and the reason was that the "Star Fighter" name itself was all caught up in a lawsuit, so they wound up having to rename my game to something else, I forget, but it was enough to drive me nuts trying to find it again, and that was years ago.  That game needs to be here, now. The physics engine driving that game was perfect and gave you a real sense of actually flying a fighter jet.

My father and little sister once went to drive a pipeline to check it for leaks, which is usually an easy job unless dad had to order some extra large clamps for bigger leaks.  They left the house early in the morning and didn't get back until very late at night. Turns out a tire blew and the spare was flat, so my dad pulled up to a nozzle on the pipeline and pushed a little natural gas into the spare.  Just enough to make the tire diesel in his face, actually. He had a funny looking bruise the size of a silver dollar from the face of the tire chuck on his bicep, and probably still has pieces of gravel embedded in his skin from the explosion.  He had to carry my little sister, who must have only been 10 at the time, many miles through the desert heat towards Orla. Dad always kept lots of water in that truck, and he had enough tools on board to fix damn near anything. The last half of that sentence is a worth a whole series of books on amazing feats of the DIY engineer.  He always told us to stay waaaay back when he was doing anything dangerous. Even though I was only 12 or so, I was tall enough to drive his truck, and went with him regularly to maintain the wellheads and what not, but sis rarely went. The one time she does go, something exciting happens, and I was stuck at home with nothing but my .410 and rattlesnakes to play with.  Life was tough out there, but my dad was tougher. I will never forget the look on his face when he got home that night. He had bloody specs all over his shirt.  Sis was unfazed. Went right on playing with the dogs and doing the things she did during the summers with Dad.  That was some 25 years ago, and just another day in the hard life of the big man from Pecos. I wouldn't trade a minute of being out there in the middle of nowhere with my dad for anything.   Found some tiny black ants that sting like hell here in Corpus this visit. Not sure if they are Crazy Ants, but I know I have never had ant stings go numb like that before.   This is about all that country is good for. The only problem I see is aquifer contamination. Some fairly complex and poorly understood, even legendary geology exists in the area. I lived out there and probably still have family living around Mentone. The stories I have heard over the years about theorized oil bearing formations and bottomless springs make me wonder.   While I myself have never been accused of making the best decisions in life, please allow me to boast with a humble and constructive certainty that I am not an egotistical douche bag. All of this in spite of such smoldering good looks and sultry wit. As a jewel-cutter of a linguist and jewel-thief of a heart-breaker, don't take this the wrong way, but....  I would go as far as to say that I possess the constitution needed to go on a blind date with even *you* - even after witnessing the carelessly agonizing method with which you mishandle the emotions of others, and more disconcerting, your limited capacity to make the night and day distinction between the train wreck of human emotions involved and the simple impulses of an instinct basic enough to originate from a common part of any brain in the animal kingdom.  Anyway, being in the pursuit of the perfect balance of character, integrity, confidence, and presence necessary to portray my manliness, I have grown to relish the opportunity to wield an exceedingly rare ability to deliver credit where due. I deal in benefits and doubts, and as your awareness of my intentions may be increasing, the implications of the proverbial "catch" associated with my benevolence would be best related (to the good sport that you are) as a curve ball enveloped in the resolve of dust and leather that only a glove resourceful enough to both spank and cover your ass will do.  Today we will learn how that glove can serve to compromise the intent of the pitcher. The trick is to keep your eye on the ball and your mind on the glove, and that's going to be quite a feat considering where your head is at the moment.  Be completely honest with this man. No more or less than a forthright confession. He will *completely* understand, trust me. It's really easy - If the mind can tire of wading in expression, and the heart can mire in the depths of depression, the body must be allowed the shallows of regression or the relationship comes to an end.  Human beings have been endowed with the self-awareness necessary to grasp such concepts. Now all you need to do is take a step away from being human and become a modern woman by finding a way to tell the guy he is charming enough to spring you into a blind date, but repulsive enough to make a freight train take a dirt road. Kind of difficult to reproduce if you can't stand the thought of someone touching you. Something tactful like that.  Then again, look at what modern science has done for humanity. Faces can be swapped. Realistic genitalia has been made obsolete. In addition to many other objects, a woman can now be viewed as an investment vehicle. With as little as $25,000 worth of plastic surgery her net worth increases dramatically, and she gains some proportional amount of pedestal life.  When I was in little league I moved my catcher's mitt all over the place to distract the batter. It worked really well, but only on kids. As I grew older I noticed that it was more of a distraction for the pitcher.  ---  TL;DR: My dad would laugh and say, "Looks are only skin deep, but Ugly goes all the way to the bone."   What an atrocious mobile site. Whoever signed off on it needs some critical neural pathways rewired.   By sending tiny spacecraft to the edge of the solar system with gibberish imprinted on them serving as TL;DR for our pathetic, self-defeating existence.   I worked with a guy who blew 0.12 at a clinic over two days after he quit drinking. At 0.01 an hour of elimination, and correct my math if I'm wrong, but that comes out to roughtly **~shithammerfacewasted**.  I blew 0.18 about 30 hours after I was arrested for peeing [mostly] on a fence, um, somewhere during, um, the daytime,  meaning that I was, by contrast, only **~33.8 sheets of toilet paper in the wind**. The cops did the test for kicks because I went to highschool with one of them.  Small town ;)  I have a portable breathalyzer from Walgreens that is a lot of fun, but I can't seem to find it come to think of it. Late into the night I have seen .3's and .4's pretty regularly, discounting any tests that would read too high due to recent (10 minutes) consumption of alcohol.   Sing a song of Sony,   A pocket full of Yen.   Magnavox and Zenith,   Undersold again.   See the U.S. suffer,   From the job we do.   This is how we get revenge,   For losing World War II.    For some reason I found this entertaining enough in grade school to commit to memory. It appeared in either a MAD or Cracked magazine of the time.    Holy *shit* House of Leaves is scary.  And probably the most impossible contemporary book to truly follow. I had to take notes.   Boat probably had the same engines as the whaler that tried to take him in Japan.   Talk about adding insult to injury. Wait 11 hours for some "beef" from McDonald's.  Take that $1.29 or whatever it is that you were going to spend and go to the grocery store in the same parking lot and feed yourselves some goddamn vegetables. You can probably get 10 ears of corn for the price of a "cheeseburger" from McDonald's.  Seriously: "HEY WHY DON"T WE ALL PITCH IN ON A FUCKING BBQ???"  Think of all the *beer* you could buy with those people pitching in. A keg or three, a few briskets. Bam..  I'm sure one of those rednecks has a nice pit and there is probably a huge park nearby full of this going on anyway.  Look at me, all pissed. Heh. When I was 12 or so they opened a Short Stop about a mile from my place in Austin. I told my redneck dad I was going to ride my bike over there and grab a burger, and that's what he told me: "Son, that's like adding insult to injury." I chuckle a little to this day thinking about that, and then I remember that his father died of a heart attack at the age of 40 for eating real beef literally three meals a day for most of those years.  11 hours... I do believe you'd get your ass whooped for doing something like that around here...   North Beach is a great place to party, but so is Port Aransas, and the water on the Port A. beach is *far* cleaner than the water at North Beach. I would not allow my children in that water at North Beach. There was a post here somewhere recently linking to a website that had a map of saltwater samples up and down the coast, and the area around Ropes Park, not far from where North Beach's terrible samples were taken, was found to be the worst in Texas.  And when I say "water quality" I'm not talking about brackishness.  Don't let your kids swim in that water, trust me. I went to school in Corpus and did a semester of research on pollution in the area. The place is as toxic as it gets and has had some of the craziest birth defect rates in the country.   So this got me digging around on wikipedia, and found this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraj_Al_Bait_Towers  Being from the coast and worn out from this long day my first thought was that this was the biggest bait stand in the world.   The one at the Dell Diamond after the game was probably the best fireworks show most people in that stadium have ever seen. It completely blew away the one at the park.   Is that militia going to escort every rancher's family to and from school and work for the rest of their lives?  Don't get me wrong, I have no qualms about taking matters of self defense into my own hands, and would protect another innocent person with my own life, but I still have rules to play by.   Smugglers do not.  That's why this is a job for the military and nobody else. We can hunt people half a world a way in the middle of fucking nowhere and "spy on everyone", but we can't protect our own border? What a farce. It's outrageous and clearly indicative of corruption at the highest levels of our government.  I could really rant about this one because it revolves around just how crooked elected officials are in this country. I'd sue the federal government for protection and make them buy me out at market rate if I were these ranchers.  If I were a smuggler I'd watch the fuck out because that corruption is a two way street, and shit rolls downhill pretty quick when it comes to erasing scum in the desert.   See: Halliburton   I would say it's more formulaic than authentic. You could literally switch around all the nouns in the paragraph and make it sound like propaganda from any country.   If you really think about it in terms of genetics all it takes is one generation.   Why wouldn't the coast guard set a trap for these assholes?  Shear off the net and put the floats back in the water and watch the damned thing until someone shows up to claim it.  Cut most of the net off, make it look torn or something, and stick a few tags up some of those dead sharks' asses and find out where these guys are going with them.  They are just going to do it again. The CG might have cleaned up a mess, but they are only going to have to clean up a bigger one as the poachers will probably try to recoup their loss and then some.  It's like that "young fisherman" from Mexico they caught in those pictures. I can see that guy's side of things, look at his boat. It's a piece of shit that you probably couldn't sell on Craigslist here in the states at all. Sadly, he probably has a large family to feed. He certainly isn't making a lot of money - but hey, let's be sure to figure out a way to bust his ass.  Don't get me wrong, I'd probably pull up his net and/or report him myself, but it's the lack of sense displayed here by government agencies who would rather hold up "a few dozen" (actually a few *hundred*) dead sharks as a trophy and put the weight of those laws down on the guy who probably just needs the goddamn food.  Nobody ever consults me, I swear.  Well, except my clientele. Unfortunately the CG is none of them.  	51
 That feels like such a revelation, all the comments here are so completely inspiring and all I can think is- wow, this never occurred to me but you all are right. Thank you seriously this improved my outlook a lot. I'm still getting used to the shiny new issues that have been assigned to me, and every bit of support helps me get a little farther along in the journey (cliche party \m/ ) I'm sure this is how everyone in this subreddit feels and I hope I can help people too   I have, the amount of support for total strangers here is staggering. This is my first post here and I want to become more involved  	2
 Well, my bachelors is physics, my masters would be engineering. I'm not sure if that changes things, but I've found a bachelors in physics from an unknown school is basically worthless.   Title says it all. Mediocre grades at best (2 C's and a D at a school where any more than 4 grades below B- gets you kicked out). Told my advisor at the lab I wanted to finish my masters and leave. I can't do PhD. I can't do the stress without it literally killing me (by my own hand or by accident). I was so angry at myself for my shitty performance last week I put my fist through my mirror.  So when my advisor told me he wanted wanted me to apply to the PhD program directly (and take some classes that would prolong the time until I could get my masters by a semester or two) for the sake of "additional funding", the day after contemplating this for two weeks culminating in me destroying my apartment, I said no.  Now I'm told I have exactly 0 chance of funding, and I'm 15 credits away from my masters.  On a scale of "That was a silly thing to do" to "seriously consider self immolation or sepuku", just how badly did I fuck up here?    Younger Americans will kindly remember his executive order declaring all student loan debtors bankrupt,  That would be awesome, since student loan debt can't be discharged via bankruptcy.  Me:  "I Burnphonegrad declare that I have no money to pay my debts, and heretofore declare bankruptcy"  Student loan lenders: "Oh, you got nothing? We'll need like 70k of that please"    Instead, I threw the damn thing in the trash.   No offense but you sound like you would have been a joy to communicate with   I'm jealous. My stack isn't nearly as badass, just a 780 and a Marantz 2245. Of the two the Marantz is my favorite, both are recapped and restored (still need to do a little work finishing them both, need to source a power button for the Marantz and a new backplate, and need to fix the one VU meter on the pioneer. Maybe then I'll get a wooden case made for the Marantz to satisfy me until I can get my hands on a 2270 or sx-1280  Edit: I do always forget how late in the 70's that line was, since the internals are More like the early 70's equipment than say, a late 70's Yamaha receiver  	5
 My short term memory is pretty much shot, which seems to be a symptom of long-term isolation :( I'm pretty incapable of learning a foreign language. Tried French, Japanese, and German.   I was a teaching assistant in my college's capstone course, so it's not like I suffer from debilitating social anxiety or am unable to be around people. I have problems with sensory overload (fuck clocks - hence tick tock tick tock), but a classroom setting is usually quiet enough for me to function.   I wanted to go somewhere like Micronesia and volunteer teaching English (their primary language), but no moneys/passport.   	1
 I went there in the summer - it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to!   I have this, I come across as so insanely ditsy that people misjudge me for being stupid or simple-minded   I absolutely love this painting - is it done on MS paint??/digitally????  	3
 How's she your wife if there was no proposal?   	1

 Sure. I just cut out a stencil in freezer paper, ironed it to a shirt, and then sprayed it over with a 50-50 mix of bleach and water. There are tutorials online and I can also send you the stencil I made if you want.    Probably not because I don't want my ass sued to oblivion and back, but if there's any interest I can post up the stencil that I made once I get back to my computer if anyone is interested in making their own.       I started playing about a month or so ago. I'm level 22 and mostly playing normals (still learning a bit). Just looking for some more players to possibly invite to games with my friends who are mostly 30's. (: We have skype. I mostly play either Irelia or Sejuani right now.   In-game username: Litrain_subject7930   Thank you so much! I'm so excited! :D   I'd like one too if there are any more left! :D   I am also a college senior about to enter my second semester. I can't say that I know exactly the best method to deal with this since I'm also going through the same fears, but I've been going to therapy for the past several months and it has certainly helped me a lot. This next semester, my therapist will be signing me up for group therapy sessions for social anxiety. I would suggest doing the sames -- many universities will have free therapy for students or similar programs for help. Best of luck.   I personally really dig earrings on guys. Studs especially. I just really like the look, especially on Asian guys. :b It really depends on the guy, but I've found that most Asian guys have been able to rock this look.   Sorry this happened. ): Experience has taught me to be extremely weary of guys who refer to themselves as "good guys".    Wow. Okay. I am thoroughly creeped out. Mission accomplished.  	10
 Darwin was racist.   Potato lover   We had the same issue as OP a while ago, updating malisis doors was the solution   Lol ty jolli. Here's to many more years? :P   Its a bug with Malasis doors   Thanks, it worked now! TIL :)   Are those 7x7, 11x11 circles etc around the cauldron like around the golden glyph or not?   Or else?! :P   Oh wow, so simple! I'm gonna remember this!   We are very similar, except that I had 6 years of French in high school so I think I can speak, read and understand a lot of French already :)   It was very similar to the Dutch word pantoffels   I speak Dutch and I can see it's a legit word, but I have no idea what it means. It's some kind of duty/task and something to do with a compensation I think.   Slippers?   Bagpipes!   Beautiful :)   Ah, alright, thanks :)   Wow, great work as always! I have one question though, what are the items that Pakratt seems to be collecting? :P   I hope you can do this and finish it :) Good luck.   I'm 21, should be graduating in June but I'm not. Screwed up my internship because of some personal issues as well as a lack of motivation and broke up with my boyfriend all in one week. At the moment I'm struggling with the fresh breakup (first one) and all its joys while wondering what to do next with my life.   Bioinformatics, to be honest. Biology will always be here but as the amount of data available is increasing drastically, there's people needed who can process this, yet know what they're doing.    Initial panic once the season started  Honestly, the first episodes from season 5 were indeed hilarious. Genny showing everyone the difficulty was on hard, a lot of people yelling there's mobs around and of course we're starting the season with rain :)   I have no idea why you were downvoted. Each mindcracker has their own good series going on, it's just to find out which of these you like the most yourself.   It annoys me when I feel pretty good the next morning, yet morning people are slow and grumpy. Get out of the way man. Don't look at your phone while walking the stairs and put a smile on your face.   Yeah, I'm hoping both Generikb and BdoubleO will go to HermitCraft.   In case carpenter's blocks is in your modpack: carpenter's block, shift+right click one glowstone dust on it, then the block itself that should cover the carpenter's block. Bit more glowstone needed, but it makes the block glow and you don't have annoying nooks preventing you from placing down other blocks/machines.   Found through Generikb's Beecademy.   Can confirm, I've seen them live once and it was amazing :)    I had a Minecraft related question and ran into the subreddit.   Never ever put Within Temptation in a tent on a festival. Saw them at Lowlands in 2011, main stage. The echo under Sharon's voice was too big, couldn't really hear the music anymore. It's been the only time I've walked away from a band ever. I had seen them in Zwolle a couple years before that happened and that must have easily been one of their best shows. They are pretty good in open air.   Can confirm that this is a fun server to play on :) Been around since november and I probably won't leave for another 4-5 months. We're actually open for applications now too /u/Eaves12!   There's a big list of Thaumcraft add-ons, maybe have a look at some of those. Also Magical Crops?   Hermethcraft   Made me think of Arctic Monkeys?   Sometimes I google myself to see what a total stranger can find out about me.   Yay :D   Being hard on myself and being emotional (mother), being stubborn (father) I think. Also passion for music from my father.   Not much, actually. Lot of small simple things that are quite realistic like meeting friends who live across the border, see Editors live, make a roadtrip.   I just bought you a puppy.   Advil (liquid ibuprophen caps) + either hot shower or bed, whatever I feel like   Sushi and sauerkraut   "You still have to do this", man I would annoy so many people   You still need to do this again. :P   Skype is mainly used to chat, we never do voice calls on Skype and you can disable notifications in the group chat. It is very useful to have, as we don't post every single thing to the forums. It's not a requirement but I myself see it as a big part of this community.   At what time did we finish work last Saturday? I forgot.   Currently coding in Python, as requested here within the company.   Help people get their baby car + kids on the train, or bikes, or heavy suitcases. Once stepped out of a crowded bus so this guy in a wheelchair could get to his appointment in the hospital.   You should try a complete reinstall of your modpack or contact your admins.   Are the witchery villages even lit properly?   I don't understand abuse.   Here in the Netherlands we have something called Kapsalon, fries with doner meat, garlic sauce, chili sauce and a bit of lettuce etc. Grilled cheese on top. 1800kcal   See you tonight.   Mine is in a loop after just three words :( Ah well as a bit of the first time to be a bit of the first time to be a. And if I start my sentence with I: I am not the first time to be a bit of the first time to be a bit of the. :( same loop   Given it a chance. Its just not funny. :/   Seinfeld   /r/asexuality :( still need to tell him   Be honest, be yourself. Admit it when you are maybe not good at something but tell them you want to work on it and see it as a challenge.   Put a few screws in my grandma's coffin to close it off, literally and figuratively speaking. I loved her and she had been suffering from cancer for years.   These are literally the first three animals I could think of. Either a loving, caring domestic dog, or to be as free as an eagle / dolphin.   I had a good week for once. Finally got something off my chest to my SO and I've felt relieved and free ever since. Had a lot of fun, got my internship back on track, had a good weekend of work. I feel much better than the past two months.   Something absolutely annoying, like mirror all text.   Why am I not surprised to see you in this thread? :P   Taking a plate of bread out of the oven, glass door closed against my elbow. Couldn't do anything because the bread would drop. Should've just dropped the bread.   Ah, yeah. Infusions are like giving yourself certain abilities/resistances right? I now have an owl familiar and I've been flying around looking for coven witches but no such luck yet.   Plenty options there. Online lessons/tutorials, buy one of these books that start at zero and have sheet music and a music disc so you can play along, or take lessons.   Ah sweet, you got one already? Have fun! :)   The last one is pretty sick.   I need to dance whenever Wannabe is on the radio.   Pick a music instrument.   I am not sure if this is 80s too (I'm on my phone) but Duran Duran - Wild Boys   A song that will always bring me to tears is Fix You by Coldplay   That's no good music then. Good music hits a snare and makes tears stream down your face.   I feel very bad, I didn't text this but I could, in the relationship I'm currently in. I just don't want to lie to him..   Fix You by Coldplay   "Pull my finger"    I believe it's called TV Guide or something along those lines..   Thanks, hope so too.   I'm still wide awake, 5AM by now.   Calming down, just finished playing a UHC in minecraft with a couple friends. We won after a crazy game. About to go to bed, it's 3AM now and in 9 hours I'm supposed to be at work.   There's plenty of apps that do this, where you just manually keep track of what you've been watching.   [Have a listen...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJWIJs27gyU)   De Staat, a band from Nijmegen. They're known within the Netherlands and maybe a few surrounding countries. They deserve so much more. I've seen them live a couple times and it's good every time.   Saved this for later use, thanks!    Makes you build up the discipline you will need later in college/university. Definitely worth it. First three years of college were easy enough for me.   I know there's no serious tag on this, but this might be *too soon*   It's scary how mad I can get at myself after doing something stupid. It builds up inside, eventually leading to a phase where I zone out and need pain to get back on my feet.   Sleep in, coffee, shower, coffee, food and games until I tip over from being too tired. I get these days every now and then in the weekends and life just can't get better. My main worry of the day is to make sure my coffee doesn't turn cold.   A friend in high school who committed suicide.   I've always overestimated driving a car. I still have to start my driver's lessons and I'm 21 now.   One of my roommates occasionally meows at us. Just looking for attention I think.   I'm on the train to work now, in a silence zone, so that would make for a lot of angry faces.   That is so organised. Satisfying to look at!   A new tire for my bike. Well that's fun.   Jeetje.   There are a few guys who always eat a cup of noodles as lunch.   Ah alright, good to know! Would be a shame to find out too late :p   Take care of yourself, do what feels best and remember things can only get better.   Sauerkraut, sushi   The pack is on the Technic Launcher, search for "Indeed Beta". You should be able to download it and play.   We run a custom modpack. Sorry, I should've maybe linked [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeastservers/comments/304d8c/indeed_custom_1710_pack_hqm_vanilla_mini_games/) reddit post. There's a modlist in the comments. It's a pack designed for low-end computers, I can run it fine on my laptop. I can't access dynmap from where I am now, why isn't it useful? Server is probably empty at the moment, everyone's at work. I agree on the games tab though, haha. We mostly use the forums and Skype to communicate. Have a look at the reddit post, you can apply through the forums :)   Now that I think of it, I have seen Kim and Duncan from the yogscast do this in their Flux Buddies series. They used bear traps to contain them or shoved them into 1x1 holes, 2 blocks deep. I'll have a look, thanks again :)   Yeah I thought so. Witchery is such a big mod, it's got way more than I expected. There are so many things you can easily miss the first time you play it. I think I might do some lycantropy later, I first wanna get the witchcraft stuff going.  If you ever want to join a server, I can recommend you check out the Indeed community (www.indeedcommunity.com). Ever since I've joined, I've been having fun and made a lot of friends there. We have just opened for applications again.   Heh, wow. Amazing :) Thanks so much for the ideas, would be amazing to get them working! Really looking forward to try them!   Wow thanks for the large response! I'll have a look at the Brew of Flowing Spirit, sounds like it's very important. No idea what it does yet but it's probably around on the wiki's and/or in the in-game books.  Yeah it'll have to be a big maze, but I can just design it in creative I think. Should be fun to push a few test subjects.. uuh server members into it. It's a long-term project but I'm known for not finishing long-term projects. I'll see how things will go.  Good to know the others can just go kill stuff. :) Will have a talk with the group to see who's in for some fun hehe.  	103
 That was 5 years ago, and people can change and evolve so much in that time. She seems supportive of Caitlyn now--hopefully this tweet isn't indicative of current feelings toward trans people :/  Either way she should DEFINITELY delete that at the very least.   I came to say this, too. Everyone would hate us but who gives a fuck, we have awesome wine and cheese and don't need the haterz   All my guy friends had crushes on my older sister. She's just a lot cooler than me. I've learned to live with it...and I've also stopped inviting her to meet my friends because I am so fucking sick of hearing about how cool my sister is.   My mom worked for the government when she retired. The benefits are fucking insane. For a really long time most medications our family had were free or SUPER cheap. Co-pays are usually nonexistent. It's amazing.   I mean, just because you don't mind something doesn't mean every person in the world has to be comfortable with it, too. The question is asking about people's personal pet peeves, u/khelda1 is allowed to share their opinion. You may have a different experience, but that doesn't make hers any less valid.   Drooling just reading this. Thanks!   Pretty please, OP? Donuts are like the #1 thing I miss!   Former cashier here. This would happen *all* the time at my work. The transaction would be finished completely, I'd hand them their receipt, and they'd be like, "Oh, is it too late to use my coupon?"  Why would you pay for something and THEN ask about your coupon??   My favorite is the one that links to a picture of just a wall with a bunch of light switches on it. I imagine he probably took the photo on accident, but how did he also tweet it on accident? Or did he do it all on purpose? The world may never know    oh god please don't try to talk to me, I am not prepared to talk to a human all I want is to find my favorite brand of yogurt and go home  For me, it's either this or a completely false sense of confidence, like, "Oh, he looked at me. He digs me. I'm a badass. I'm the sexiest lady in this budget grocery store. No one can touch me. I am immortal."   Mostly it's just me trying to get my favorite yogurt with as little human contact as possible, though.   Love them and accept them for who they are   This is only sort of related, but it was more of a reaction to *my* reaction to a movie. When I was 13, one of the first PG-13 movies my friends and I went to see together was "Lady in the Water." We all thought it was a really scary movie (not sure if I would still find it scary now), so there were a few moments where we all jumped or screamed audibly.  After we screamed at one point, some grown man in the theater yelled at us to "shut the fuck up" and IMMEDIATELY another grown man yelled back in a really tough voice, "No, YOU shut the fuck up! If these little girls want to scream at the scary movie, let them scream at the scary movie!"  It was both horribly embarrassing and one of the funniest things that's ever happened to me in a movie theater.    Tobey McGuire's ugly cry face later became a meme.  This sounds like it could be the best "where are they now" line at the end of a movie, ever   They'll say, "Awwww, Topsy," at my auuuuuutopsy   On my ankle right next to my foot, so when I drop things and am too lazy to pick them up with my main hands, I can pick them up with my ankle hand instead of struggling to pick them up with my feet.   Oh, I worked there a few years ago. It probably changed since then, haha   I watched that episode with a friend who didn't even watch the show or understand the backstories of the characters, and he wept   Oh I'm SURE they do, Nosferatu.   I also used to work at Hollister, we would have an Asian couple come in every week or so (somehow they always knew when we got a new shipment) and buy out basically our entire stick to resell in foreign countries at a more expensive price. Which is ridiculous because a t-shirt there is already like $40.   I worked at a natural foods store also, and we had a salad bar/buffet type of thing. A lot of people would sample the foods without asking before they purchased, which is both unsanitary and also, because the price of our salad bar is by the pound, technically stealing. But our store really encourages giving samples to people, so we had signs up that said, "No Sampling, Please! If you'd like to try something, just ask!" to deter people from sampling every single item and making a free meal out of it. However, we had this old lady once a week or so who came in, got a huge cart, put one small item in the cart (usually a can of sardines) and then perused out salad bar and hot foods section, "sampling" literally everything we had. She would then go to our hot soups and "sample" all of those. And *then* she would go to the candy dispensers and "sample" all of *those*.  We had to ask her multiple times to stop, but she continued to do it. Her reasoning was that she was a paying customer (because of the one can of sardines she buys every week), so she should be able to sample our stuff. After a while we just had someone follow her around the store every time we saw her come in to stop her from "sampling" anymore on her own.  Moral of the story: Old ladies are the worst.   I think it's just a defense mechanism. I went to elementary school with a girl who always failed her spelling tests and would joke about it, but then after a few months of joking about it she broke down and cried about it. It was really sad, actually :/   I had a waitress the other day whose name was Lybirtee. Like, "Liberty" on its own is kind of an uncommon name. Why did you have to go and spell it all crazy-like?   I mean it's better than sitting in the sun or in a tanning bed. At least they're being healthy about it?   (Watch it turn out that tanning spray is a carcinogen or something)   He's talking about the grocery store, you sick fuck!  	24
 I've had her for about 6 months (she belonged to my ex-roommate and/or his mom for a couple of years), and sometimes when I bend down to pet her, she runs and hides (and sometimes she doesn't and just lets me pet her).  She likes to snuggle next to me when we both sleep at night, and she climbs on top of me when she wants affection.  I do know that she doesn't like to be picked up though, but sometimes I have to. She'll thrash around and make noise when I pick her up, and I'm not sure if I'm hurting her or she just doesn't like it.  Other than that, I never hurt her on purpose (not even as punishment for doing something bad like I know some pet owners do), I make sure her litter box is clean, I feed her and give her water (and even share my own food with her sometimes), and like I said, I let her sleep next to me even though she has her own bed and it restricts my movement when she's in the bed with me.  Is me picking her up sometimes the reason she runs away from me sometimes?    How exactly does it affect you?   What's so weird about it?  I don't know, it just feels... different. I guess because I'm used to seeing the character take one step after another when I move them, instead of floating. Maybe they feel lighter than characters who walk.  I also noticed that with Zod, the way he walks makes him feel heavier when I use him, which also feels weird to me.  Like I said, it might be something I could get used to, and tbh, I do appreciate the fact that different characters all have different stances, even to the extent that some don't even touch the ground (although it might be cool if you could choose to float or walk as Superman or something, since he doesn't levitate everywhere in the comics/films).   In *Injustice*, Superman, Green Lantern, and I think a couple of other characters don't stand-- they float roughly two inches off the ground and glide when you move.  Is it me, or does that just feel extremely weird? Is it something one can eventually get used to?   -top of ladder reads "THIS IS NOT A STEP"-  -Calvin immediately decides that he *will* use it as a step-   In [one strip](http://assets.amuniversal.com/07d60d60df8e01317256005056a9545d) Calvin claims that Hobbes cleans himself by licking his fur, which is very true about most, if not all cats.  Now, Calvin is obsessed with dinosaurs and has amazingly thorough knowledge of them, but he never exhibits real interest in any other animals (except [snakes in one strip](http://assets.amuniversal.com/ebd6bec0784d01302116001dd8b71c47), and [wasps/spiders in another](http://assets.amuniversal.com/d295bca0deca013171a6005056a9545d)). We also know [Calvin hates school because "[We] don't read about dinosaurs."](http://assets.amuniversal.com/541c1540decb013171a6005056a9545d)  So how would Calvin know that cats lick themselves clean unless he's *really* seen Hobbes do it? And if Hobbes isn't real, how does Calvin know about all the other true cat/tiger habits that he imagines Hobbes having?   Believe me, the cavalcade of downvotes has made that point crystal clear.   I agree. That was more or less my point. Millions of people follow a religion whose holy book advocates slavery, stoning children, sexism, and condemns homosexuality, long hair, etc.  It might offend a homosexual that so many people follow a religion that says they should be put to death for not being heterosexual.   http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2r5jcv/atheists_of_reddit_how_do_you_feel_about_the/cnco7kq   Buddha was definitely a real person. Mohammed, I'm not sure.  It's like I told another user-- we disagree. No reason to bicker about it.   Cool, then we're both happy.  3   You don't like using "boyfriend/girlfriend" the majority of the time?   We disagree on the level of believability amongst various entities.  Also, the reason I specified what I said is because you said:  **Does that make his version of religion more believable than any other?**   I'd rather be a moron than someone who tries to bully people over the internet.  By the way, I still love you. You're just on your period.   We disagree. Live and let live.   I *really* don't feel like looking up information regarding Jesus' existence, but the point is, I didn't say Christianity was more believable than ANY other religion. I said it's more believable than Norse mythology.    am good to my partner  Serious question, and no offense meant at all-- are you a homosexual? If so, how do you feel about what the Bible says regarding homosexuality?   Whatever the case may be, semantics aside, saying that one "knows" Hell is real or isn't real is incorrect.   Well, and I'm not positive, but I do believe that most historians are of the belief that Jesus was a real person.  Son of God? Jury's out.   Back of the line. No cutsies!   The fact that bears don't fly, talk, know how to use salt or what salt is, wear tutus, or travel in packs numbering 100,000.   Good question. Some people would say he's not, since he punishes the bad people of the world. Others would say that he defied God, so he's undeniably evil.  Hard to say.   I like this post. Very eloquent.   That it's a lot less likely than Hell existing.   You're right; I could be wrong about that.   I'm basing this on what the Bible says as far as I'm aware.   I referred to that possibility in the body of the thread.   I believe that's what the Bible says.   This is interesting.  Please elaborate.    There is no (none, zilch, zero, nil) possibility of going to hell. So why think about it?  You can't say that. Nobody knows either way. Knowing means you have irrefutable proof. Neither side does.   The thing about Norse mythology is that it's a lot less believable than Christianity, which is saying a lot.   You don't think Adolf Hitler was possibly like that? He's the first person I thought of when bringing up the evil overlord problem.    It's as feasible as going to hell, maybe more feasible since we know sharks exist and mutations happen.   _ In all fairness, mutations in nature happen mostly for a reason. Sharks having legs wouldn't give them a better chance at survival, sustenance, and reproduction (the only three things that wild animals care about) than they have now.    In short it really doesn't bother me. Why should it?  I'm not saying it should or shouldn't.   Plot twist: I *do* end up dying gloriously in combat.  In seriousness: Like I said, Atheists tend to stick to their beliefs very strongly. But you'd be a liar if you said fear of the unknown isn't one of man's most significant.  The "unknown" being, despite what anyone in this thread says, no one KNOWS if Hell is real or not.   It's not fiction, but it makes sense in fiction for a reason. People who are evil are generally less moral to a tremendous extent. To the extent that they will kill/torture people, enemy or ally, for the pettiest of reasons.  Didn't hold the door open for the evil overlord? Dead.  Mispronounced a word while speaking of your reverence for the evil overlord? Dead.  Hesitated slightly before killing an unarmed enemy in cold blood? D-E-A-D, *DEAD*.   I don't think Pascal's Wager quite fits here. That's simply believing in something because you fear the consequences of not doing so as well as the lack of benefits of not believing. That'd be kind the equivalent of someone reading this thread, saying "Oh crap, it would fuckin SUCK to go to Hell," and converting to Christianity.  I assume most Atheists have more pride and strength of belief than to do something like that. I'm asking those people, who will stick to their belief that NO deity exists, if they've ever thought about being wrong.  Sort of like asking someone who's a police officer, and a very good one, "Do you ever fear getting gunned down by an armed criminal?" They're not going to quit the force just because that's a possibility, but the concern can still be there.   Haven't you ever seen an evil overlord in a almost any work of fiction? You don't want to be on their side because they'll win, because they'll also treat you like shit. _  See: Visser Three, *Animorphs*   I'm not sure it's possible to be indifferent about spending eternity in any version of Hell. That would be like being indifferent about being forced to watch all your friends and family get gunned down, then have their corpses raped and eaten.   lol, I don't think *you* understand what Atheism is. Atheism is a *belief*. You don't *know*. You *think*.   The point of this thread is basically "What if you're wrong?"   Granted, with all the different religions in the world, and the fact that a person can only choose one, Atheists have as much a (statistical) chance of going to Christian Hell as Christians have of going to Jahannam (the Islamic Hell), and so on. Only one religion can be "right." That said, I'm an Atheist as well, so please don't think I'm criticizing your beliefs, or anyone else's for that matter.  Regardless, what are our resident Atheists' feelings on the potential of eternal damnation?   Ba dum chh   What if certain types of fish are harmful to them? And you just happen to catch that type of fish. Totally coincidentally.   Plot twist: Morose_Pundit wins and is declared king.   They significantly outnumber you, and you're a potentially hostile invader. You'd be dead, at the very latest, the first time you go to sleep.      I meant more along the lines of someone saying "Oh, that's not a poisonous snake" or something.   This I can live with.  Although at the same time, this was initially about The Authority trying to push a Plan B to the top of the food chain, which seems counterintuitive to the fact that Daniel Bryan (resident B+ player) defeated all of the active members of Evolution at WrestleMania, with an injured arm, to win the world championship.    Randy Orton was in Triple H's vision, but couldn't get the job done.  Exactly. So think about it from Rollins' perspective. He was placed as a lower priority than someone who couldn't get the job done, as you said. Triple H thought more highly of Orton than Rollins, and Orton was a failure.       A Plan B might be traditionally less glamorous but is ultimately more effective and reliable than what came before it.  Then why wouldn't you use it first?   And how is Plan B better than Plan A? If Plan B was better than Plan A, it would *be* Plan A.   If a girl told you that you were her Plan B, how would you feel about that?   Being someone's Plan B isn't something to be proud of. You're just something they settled for because their original goals didn't transpire and they needed something to turn to in a time of desperation.  You're not what they really wanted-- you're more like "Whatever. I guess that's good enough." Like going to the store to get two-ply toilet paper, but they only have one-ply.   Actually, there are more ways to be poisoned than by eating something poisonous. You can't eat gas.  It's that simple.   Hmm. Good info.  Apparently, at least according to Wikipedia, those snakes that you mentioned would qualify as being poisonous. So I guess when people say "poisonous snake," they're technically not wrong, but still probably don't think the word means what it actually means.   I know that "poisonous" means that, as far as I'm aware, it's harmful if touched or ingested, and "venomous" is used to describe an animal who has to inject the venom into its prey.  But is venom not a poison, at least technically speaking? If not, why not?  I just randomly thought of this, and I have no idea if I'm even close to being right, or if I'm completely off.   I'm sure you know that everything in the world, no matter how good for you, is capable of being consumed to an excessive extent.  You never worry about that? There is such a thing as drinking too much water.    I was under the impression that the term 'siren' only developed a connotation for a 'loud and unpleasant wailing sound' in modern times.  Yeah, I'd say that's accurate. But I assume when the word acquired that contemporary definition, it wasn't a coincidence that it was also the name of the seductresses of Greek mythology. The word *had* to be named after them... right?   One produces a sound that was so beautiful it could seduce almost anyone who heard it.  The other makes you want to cover your ears if it's going off too close to you.  Why do they have the same name?   I'm gonna try this, but in theory, I feel like the jumping jacks would just make me more tired.   I work from home, and I don't sleep well for the most part (I have insomnia and completely rely on sleep aids, and they tend not to give you a good night's rest, which results in fatigue a few hours after waking up), so at some point during the day, I usually get a little tired and have the urge to just crawl into bed and finish my work later (which I could do, but staying awake and doing it right then would be better).  Any advice? Even when I go sit at the kitchen table to get away from my bed, and hopefully the urge to lay down, I still feel the urge to put my head down and just fall asleep. It's very inconvenient.  By the way, I have talked to my physician about this. She recommended that I attempt to provide my body with a consistent circadian rhythm, which I'm working on. But for now, I figured I'd look for a short-term solution while I do so.  Thanks.   I'm trying to watch videos on NBA.com, and the way certain videos work is that you click a link, and a little mini-window will pop up where you can watch the video(s) you selected. If you click [this link](http://on.nba.com/1AaNcJZ), I believe it should show you exactly what I just described.  When I do that, and the video tries to load, it never does, and I just get a blank screen (but I can hear the audio). But if I right-click on one of the thumbnails of the videos on the right side of the mini-window, and select "Open in new tab/window," I can see the video just fine.  It's a minor inconvenience, but does anyone know what the issue might be? I've tested this in the other internet browsers I have, too, and it's only Firefox that has this problem.   I've done *both*. My dad is unwaveringly hard-headed and doesn't listen to any logic except his own, and my step-mother is being a hypocrite-- she was in an auto accident, and she takes morphine for the pain from the surgery that was required on her neck.  She also told me a story about how one of her friend's sons was smoking marijuana with a group of guys, and it was laced with crystal meth or something or another, which has absolutely nothing to do with my situation. That's an instance of smoking with people you don't know and/or who aren't trustworthy. No relation at all to me drinking a half a bottle of alcopop every other day or so.  I'm drinking *Smirnoff Ice*. It barely even qualifies as an alcoholic beverage. It's almost glorified soda.   My sister is pretty much a drunk, but I've always been introverted, literally (as in staying in the house) and socially (not indulging in the vices of most people in my age group).  All I did was mention that I've been drinking a little, and they damn near leapt from their seats, without knowing what I drink, how often I drink, and what other controlled substances (only small doses of prescription medications), if any, that I use.  And once again, they basically gave me the "lalalalala icanthearyou" argument when I explained that my physician said drinking in moderation is fine.   How does the title imply that the two are being used together?   Then what should someone do instead?   There is a middle ground, you know.   Both have the potential for addiction/dependency, as well as tolerance, and can be incredibly dangerous if taken in large doses. However, if taken in moderation, neither of them is very self-threatening. In the case of alcohol, it's also legal (for those of at least minimum drinking age), just like morphine and other opioids or benzodiazepines.  The only difference I can see is that one requires a prescription and the other does not.  The reason I ask is because I, at *25 years old*, living on my own, told my dad and my step-mother that I've been drinking a little bit on a recent car trip, and they treated me like I was some sort of stupid, hopeless alcoholic. And they didn't believe me when I said my physician, seeing as she considers me intelligent and responsible, told me that drinking in moderation would be fine.  On top of that, all I drink is alcopops (Smirnoff Ice, which is like 4.5% ABV-- that's approximately 9 proof, which is incredibly low for an alcoholic beverage), and I hardly ever drink even a half a bottle (750mL) in one sitting, and I *never* drink more than once a day.  I don't get it.   Some girl from halfway across the country sent me a friend request, because she was "looking threw (not a typo on my end) facebook and found my profile and fell in love with my eyes."  I'm not taking her seriously at all-- I'm just waiting for her to do or say something that will 100% confirm that she's a bot or a scammer. She actually sent me a couple voice messages on Facebook and we've talked on the phone. Her voice sounded almost exactly the same in each context. I gave her my cell phone number (it's not a smart phone; there's no information about me on it).  Regardless, here's a list of things she's done/hasn't done that makes me way beyond skeptical:  * Told me her first name was one thing, but her first name is listed as another on her info page * Claims she works with kids, mainly in the "activity area"... but she tells me she doesn't get off of work until midnight at the earliest and 3 AM at the latest. What could she possibly be doing that involves kids at anywhere near that time of night? * Posted a status about how her friend was at her house at 10:45 or so the other day, even though she told me she was at work  And, like I said in the title, whether via cell or Facebook, she has not once sent the first message of a conversation in all of at least 7 or 8 conversations, despite all the "OMG I like you so much, you're so cute, I'll text you in the morning," etc (all of which I roll my eyes at). It's like I have to "activate" her by sending a message.  Is that an issue with bots? Also, what else should I look for?    literally designed to be thrown long distances efficiently  If, and only if, thrown with proper technique. What are the odds that someone who's never played football can throw with good enough form to maximize the football's aerodynamic capabilities?   Assume this athlete hasn't played any sport, which involves throwing a ball, at any credible level. He just has a strong arm and minimal technique. Also assume that his hands are large enough to palm the basketball.  Which is he more likely to throw further? The basketball or the football? And why?    And do you think it's just a coincidence that once Montana left his backup just happened to be nearly as awesome?   Montana also thrived in a totally new system, as an old man. And there's almost no way you can truthfully say Steve Young was near Montana's level.   Well, in football, I'm almost positive that the consensus is that quarterback is the most "important" position, which is why Montana is considered by a lot of people to be the NFL GOAT.   Not to disrespect your opinion, but I don't think Barry Sanders is even considered the best running back of all time. Somewhat short career and leads the NFL all-time in runs for losses IIRC.   Doesn't the fact that Jim Brown retired so early hurt his case? I'm not too big on NFL history (I know a little bit)-- this is what I've heard.      I was told by the mods it was okay to post this thread.    Those are obviously office and cell phone numbers including area code.  My intelligence is bad and I should feel bad :-(   I received a PM on here asking to do a phone interview for Dr. Drew's news show tonight. I have no way of knowing whether or not this is real, as I'm not very savvy in this area.  The only thing I can think of that might help is the fact that he left a series of two ten-digit numbers, labeled "O:" and "C:" respectively. I have no idea what they mean, however. Maybe they're phone numbers-- "Office" and "Cell"?  Also, should I expect payment for this? I'm guessing not, but I figured it was worth asking.  Any advice? Thanks.   "Going down the list" as in doing so and looking for anything that resembles "Cloud Scout"?   Searched "Cloud" and got nothin. :-/    AutoRuns and remove any unknown or malicious entries  How do I know what might be something harmful that I'd want to remove? Also, a lot of stuff looks unfamiliar to me, but it looks as if it's a key Windows component and I don't want to break my OS by deleting something I need because I didn't recognize it-- I'm not very savvy in this area.    reset internet explore, firefox and chrome settings.   This was also suggestion I came across, but I have a bunch of add-ons for Firefox and I didn't want to have to go through the trouble of remembering them all and then re-downloading them.   Do you know if any of those programs will initiate a mandatory computer restart? I scanned one of my 2-TB external hard drives with a duplicate file finder earlier and it took forever, so I don't want the computer to restart automatically since I'm not doing going through the files.   http://i.imgur.com/wjgbEUz.png  I've used search engines to find any solutions I could, but I tried at least 5 or 6 of them and they all involved either a program that cost money, or a program that couldn't detect the adware.  Some sites suggested simply using Windows' "Programs and Features" to uninstall it (and even showed screenshots of "Cloud Scout" being listed in their Programs and Features screen), but it's not showing up in mine.  I searched the entire computer for anything under "Cloud" and nothing showed up.  Any suggestions? Thanks.    I've seen Kuma with a goddamn Lincoln wig. A BEAR WITH A LINCOLN WIG. I do not want to see stupid inanity like that ever again.  Tekken has a boxing kangaroo, a dinosaur, and a dummy made out of wood that has come to life (and, somehow, a "female" equivalent).  That's pretty inane in my opinion.   I've seen some pretty bad character customization in Tekken Tag 2 Ghost Battles   It is, but it would be up to the user as to whether or not he wants to deviate from the character's established outfit. Ken and Ryu have arguably the most well-known outfits in fighting game history (gi with no footwear), but if someone wants to change that and give them, say, a more ninja-esque costume (yes, I know they're not ninja) because they think it looks cool, no harm, right?  Also, a lot of really iconic characters don't have truly distinct outfits. Scorpion and Sub-Zero's costumes change from game to game, with the only similarity being that Scorpion wears yellow and Sub-Zero wears blue. They don't really have any one outfit that you can picture and say "That's Scorpion's/Sub-Zero's costume."   The ability to change what a character wears, from the colors to the style to an entirely new outfit.   Ah, so they can't stop themselves from attacking and they're pretty much screwed?   Speaking of that move that Deadpool has in UMvC3, I always wondered this... it's a counter move as far as I know, which means your opponent has to attack you for it to activate. But why would anyone attack Deadpool once they see him power up for the move? Isn't it 100% inevitable that your attack will result in you getting clobbered by Deadpool's life bar?   Oh, here's one-- it's not really a tactical advantage, but I'd be surprised if anyone other than Deadpool can *literally* use his life bar as a physical weapon.   I was thinking about Steve Fox, and how instead of kicks, he has dodges and sidesteps in his moveset. I find him to be one of my favorite (probably my very favorite) character to use in any fighter because of the fact that no other character (that I've seen) has this trait.  Obviously, if you're playing a 3D fighter, you could always simply sidestep into the foreground or background, but I think it's different with Steve. His evasion moves can make for some pretty badass defensive sequences and can make the user think about his strategy differently than he would with most other characters.  What other characters are unique or have special attributes that few others have?   You're right, that was worded poorly. I apologize.  So, how much of the reputation of pitchers being poor hitters is because of the reasons you just explained (tiring oneself out by throwing so many pitches), as opposed to pitchers just not being good hitters for seemingly no good reason (similar to how quarterbacks are known to be fragile and not able to take hits like other offensive players, and big men in basketball are known to be poor free-throw shooters)?  How many full-time pitchers in the history of the majors have been halfway decent power hitters as well?   [Beware](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/)   http://imgur.com/a/Xf9lo#55  O_O Oh, flippity flop, sweet holy Moses on a circus wire, YES.   Speaking of Babe Ruth, and this is completely off-topic (sorry), but why was he so much more successful as a hitter when he wasn't also pitching? IIRC (and there's a good chance I don't, since I don't follow baseball-- I just know how it's played and stuff), there were few, if any, seasons in which he was a pitcher and also hit a shitload of home runs.  Is there a reason for that or am I just completely off?   The best part is Paige smiling after Natalya throws her off. She apparently likes her women to resist. Makes for a challenge. :-)   And she doesn't even bother to thread her belt through all the loops.  She's such a rebel. 3   Or hell, if that's never been done, has anyone broken the same record twice, period, in their career?  I know Peyton Manning broke the single-season touchdown record twice, first with 49 in 2004 and then 55 in 2013.      Hey, say what you want, but I'm not the one going around licking people.      Ow, the downvotes. That's what I get for trying to avoid alcohol dependency _   I didn't mean to offend you or even make you feel like I was "correcting" you. I'm just relaying what I was told by a medical professional. That's all.  I meant no disrespect whatsoever.    Whatever else you enjoy, do it and bring a friend along to share it with.  Yeah, I've been doing this all day. I'm trying to do anything I can to resist reaching for the other half of that bottle. So far, so good.  **EDIT:** Also, for the record, I did drink last night because of depression. That's why I'm so wary of this cycle.   Only certain prescription medications that I take that would be considered "controlled substances."   I asked my family physician the same thing, and she assured me that "depressant" and "depression" are related in medical terminology. It's why, according to her, prescription medications like Klonopin (which is a depressant used to treat anxiety) aren't recommended for long-term use, because they will eventually cause depression due to *being* a depressant.    One alcopop isn't nearly enough to elicit that kind of response.  But alcoholism has to *start* with that first drink.  **EDIT:** Also, right, I definitely realize and agree that this is a real thing. Which is why I want to avoid it. I'm trying to be as proactive as possible in keeping myself from being one of those people-- you're talking to a guy who had his *very first* alcoholic beverage last night (I'm 25 years old).   And the vicious cycle I'm referring to is this:  A person drinks to get over depression. (S)he consumes enough alcohol that the next day, they feel depressed, even perhaps when he or she normally doesn't, so he/she drinks more alcohol to get over the depression.  The next day, more depression, more alcohol.  Then more depression caused by more alcohol, and more alcohol caused by more depression.  Is this a completely unavoidable situation?  I'll be completely honest as to why I'm asking-- I'm an inexperienced drinker and last night I bought a bottle of Smirnoff Ice (1 pint 6 oz or 650mL, only like 4.5% ABV) and drank about half of it. Made me feel kinda good, but I wasn't drunk or even close to it. Just buzzed, and barely tbqh.  Then today, I'm kinda bleh (no hangover, no headache, just kinda low). So my first instinct-- "Maybe I should have a drink again."  But then I fear that the cycle I described above might start. Am I always going to feel depressed the next day every time I get buzzed? Or is there a way to keep that from happening?   I've heard arguments from both sides about second-hand smoke. Any sources?   Has anyone had success earning on this site outside of using a smartphone to download apps/play games?  I'm partial to Tapbooty because you can cash out any amount via PayPal starting at $1. That's extremely convenient.   What's the difference? I mean, there are "Anti-DUI" commercials, but even drinking without operating a motor vehicle can be extremely harmful if not done responsibly, just like smoking cigarettes can be.   I guess it makes sense since a person obviously took this photo, but it kinda freaked me out when I first saw it.      _ You guys suck  :-P      The line is cliche to the point that most girls will see it coming a mile away.  Hit her with something like "I'm more of a nibbler than anything. ;-)"      Thanks for the x-post. It's much appreciated.   To answer your question that has nothing to do with the topic at hand, I bought a 65" rear projection TV some years ago, and it wouldn't fit through the front door of the house. We had to take it in through the back, and instead of taking the TV to my bedroom, I took my bedroom to the TV.  And all the landline cords and the router/modem setup is in the basement, since that's actually the most conducive place to put it based on how my house is built, and I don't have the Wi-Fi device for my Xbox 360. So, if I'm upstairs, no Xbox Live, and no TV to play it on anyway.   There are probably at least a half-dozen places in my basement where cold air is coming in. Windows, maybe tiny cracks in the walls, etc. Any advice?  I live by myself in a two-story, two-bedroom house, and neither of the bedrooms are furnished, so I can't just sleep upstairs (unless I really wanted to take everything, bed and all, up two flights of stairs, which would be beyond pointless).   Mostly instaGC. I've also tried Tapbooty since they have a very low cashout minimum for PayPal. I've gotten one or two to work on instaGC, none on Tapbooty, and Prize Rebel is another one I've tried downloads on. I've had roughly the same success there as I've had on instaGC.   I can rarely get them to credit. I download whatever it is they want me to download (with Sandboxie), install all the stupid little add-ons that come with it, get to the finish page of the installation wizard, but a lot of times, I get no points.  Is there some way to better ensure that I get credited for download offers? I see people saying that they make $10 a day on downloads alone-- I want that, too ;_;   I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, since I tend to ramble.  I'm 6'4 (almost 200 cm/2 meters for those on the metric system-- and no, that's not my real height with 2-3 inches added), and it seems like the world isn't designed for people my height and taller. I constantly have to bend down/lean forward to grab or look at things, and as a result, I have a really bad slouch. It's to the point where standing/sitting perfectly straight feels like a workout.  I have no idea how to fix this problem, since I'm so used to the way I stand and sit right now (I'm 25, and I've been 6'2-6'4 since I was about 16 or 17 I think).  What can I do to fix this problem? I don't want my spine to be permanently mangled by the time I'm 50-60; at the same time, though, I think I should take baby steps with this until I get more accustomed to standing/sitting straight.  Thanks, guys.   You shouldn't hit on trees, then.   She might not have one.   This isn't a pickup line per se, but I've always found this situation to be frustrating. She's super hot, but you can't chat her up during your transaction-- it doesn't take long enough, and you can't just stand there holding up the people behind you. So here's what I do (and it's worked a couple times).  What you'll need: A pen, a post-it note, and a little bit of stealth  What you do: Walk into the store, ID the girl you want to talk to. As soon as you walk in, make sure she can't see you put the pen on the counter-- a good way to do this is to do it as you bend down to tie your shoes (leave one shoe untied to make it more convincing).  When you're checking out, put your items on the counter and put your post-it note to the side (maybe take it out of your pocket as if you're looking for your money/wallet/card and just want to discard it for a second).  This is where the pen from the beginning comes in. Ask her "Hey, can I borrow that pen?" She'll assume it's the store's, and she'll say sure.  While she's ringing you up, write your name and number on the post-it note. Take your items and your change, and then give her this:  "Oh, here's your pen back... thanks. And here's my phone number. Call me."  And then calmly walk out of the door with a smile on your face. MAKE SURE YOU SMILE. Add a wink if you're feeling particularly confident. It also helps if you can at least make small talk during the process-- try to make her laugh or smile.  Like I said, this has worked for me at least twice, and one time it didn't work, the girl still said it was "cute."  Just thought I'd share a solution to a problem I hate. Didn't really know where else to put it.  This is gonna get downvoted straight to the eighth circle of Hell, isn't it? :-(   You have 2K15 on Xbox One?   Do you have Xbox One?   Do you have 2K15 for Xbox One?   WTF is this shit? Nobody said it was a good idea. I'm making an educated guess based on what's been happening. Chill the hell out, dude.  And Ryback being heel isn't a bad idea. Ryback being heel and being booked the way he was is a bad idea. Jesus H. Christ...   Do you have Xbox One?   He just doesn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of Team Cena, even calling the team "Team Cena and Team Ryback."   With another human player, since putting on a good match is a good deal about communication, and one can't really communicate with the AI.  I used to do this with a friend of mine, but he has a PS4 now and I've got an Xbox One.  Anyone ever considered the thought/want to try it?   I never saw the Halloween series :-(, so whenever I see this, I'm reminded of Jason Voorhees.   It was indeed. Also, if you look closely when it happens, Harper is by far the first one to react to the music. My friend and I joked that it's because he was the only one who recognized it.      Also, for what it's worth, I struggle with countering, if anyone knows anything one can do to get better in that area.    I'm kinda nostalgiaing everywhere  Feel free to continue doing so :D   I should have mentioned that I want to get better at defense mostly, although this is still good advice.    You're also aware that Spartan is basically a Leon and Bayman clone, right? Both of them are in DOA5.  I like the fact that her character model is a Spartan. I find that to be pretty damn cool.   But the catch here is that I need a source of knowledge for Dead or Alive **4**, not 5. I play 4 because I like using Spartan-458, and she's not in DOA5.  Or another option would be to just use DOA5 guides and strategy, if the two games are similar enough. But I don't know if they are.  Let me know which option would be better?  Thanks.   Or is 120 over 80 simply a myth?  I was told the latter by a nurse practitioner's assistant during my last routine checkup with my family physician.   It's not like all of that will magically equate into being able to breakdance. He still had to learn how to do it.   Oh, boy... this feels like *300.*  **Our downvotes will blot out the sun!**  **... then I will post in the shade.**  Okay... once. Only once. She really liked me, I really liked her, she was super hot, and we were in bed together watching a movie... oh, and I forgot to mention that she's a borderline alcoholic who can't handle her liquor. Bad combination.  Anyway, the inevitable happened, and I tried, I *really, really tried* to resist the urges. Devil on one shoulder, angel on the other... let's face it. Considering it was the first time and I wasn't ready for it, the angel didn't stand a chance and pretty much got gunned down immediately by ol' Beelzebub.  I stopped the movie we were watching and turned off the TV. I went to undo her belt and take off her jeans, and by the time I did that, she was actually forcing my head into her crotch with both hands. I had never given oral sex before, so I tried to tell her no, but (and I doubt she even remembers any of this), she persisted, so I considered it a tradeoff.  I went down on her after I undressed her down to her lingerie, while also touching her sensually the way I like. We both got what we wanted that night (I think so... I'm still not sure how good I was-- she did a lot of heavy moaning, though, so that's worth something, I guess).  Anyway, that's the story. Nobody had to use a rape whistle, or get their brother to beat anybody up, and no one went to jail. It went pretty much as well as it possibly could have, for both parties involved.

This is the sort of thing that you don't really want coming up without warning. _  Anyways, I just explain to them how I tend to prefer soft, romantic touching, kissing, etc., over harder, erotic bedroom activities. Then I usually ask them if they like to spoon, and if they say yes, then I ask if I can do things while they're asleep, like touch, kiss, undress them, etc.  Having this conversation with a woman is a LOT easier than it sounds. I've never gotten a "No" when asking if I can act on this fetish.  Jesus must love me, because I never thought that would happen the first time I told a woman about this. I thought for sure she'd be creeped out and run away immediately. _   ^ 5  :-P   I don't have a rep since this is my first post, but I'm willing to trade. I'll PM you.   Nah, you shouldn't. I'd pay her waaaaaaay more than $100 to get blackout drunk in my bed if I could.   _ No, not her *literally*. Her pornos. lol.  Although I would definitely pay a woman to do this.   The name sounds familiar, but I mostly don't pay attention to the names of the people in the porn that I watch.  The only sleep fetish porn star I can name off the top of my head is Jasmine Mendez. She's sooooooo hot... I've spent at least $100 on her.  **EDIT:** How do YOU know about Sleep Creep?    Where do you actually find this type of porn? Is it just called sleep fetish?  Pretty much. Hell, there are [YouTube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3LvpaUWQ0Y) that aren't even porn that I can masturbate to. The lack of intercourse isn't a big deal, since I'm not a big fan of it.  Yes, I and my sex drive are both extremely weird.   What do you think it is about this that get's you worked up?  The freedom to do what I want without being judged, perhaps. Like I said, I don't like intercourse at all. Contrarily, women want to be fucked. I don't want to fuck. I just want to touch a woman's body sensually-- I can and have done so literally all night more than once.  If the woman is unresponsive (but not dead-- just making sure we establish that I would never even think about going that far), she doesn't have to be annoyed by my weird sexual habits and impulses.   I love answering questions about this, so ask me absolutely anything.  A little context just in case people don't quite understand the extent of this fetish, in my case at least-- during standard intercourse, I can't ejaculate if the woman is responsive at all, and I can't achieve an erection while watching anything but sleep fetish pornography (oh yeah, it exists).

 I have to keep a huge amount of hobbies because once I'm not devoted trying to learn something it starts to creep in. Some days though it's hard to get started....it's kind of like an arms race with the illness I suppose. How well are you with personal relationships with family and such?  	1
 Jaw hits the floor.   Does your cat also fly or airbend?       I love my hair. It's perfectly straight and voluminous and I don't get bed-head.    Dem THIGHS!   This sounds exactly like someone I know...   This is not WTF. More like /r/pics   Hipster cat.   The one thing that stuck out to me...the misspelling of "making".   With skills and butt-loads of spare time, I imagine.   here's the link: [http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/vb084/a_dragon_sculpture_i_made_out_of_cd_shards/](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/vb084/a_dragon_sculpture_i_made_out_of_cd_shards/)    I recall this being done to make a dragon.   looks like a golden retriever   I wants.   I did exactly what your son did when I was little. I got up early, climbed a kitchen stool to unlock the frontdoor and went to the playground in my neighborhood.

 I recently switched to Trazadone and found it useful. Maybe you want to try switching to something else. Amitriptyline is another one that some people say is good for sleep. I found it useless having used it for nearly a decade (yea, I'm stupid) so I guess that it depends upon the nature of the problem and maybe your brain chemistry. Maybe Trazadone just isn't good for you.  I am in Scotland and the light is now starting to wake me up at 6am. Are you sure that it is the Trazadone and not something else that is causing you to wake. Heating coming on and making the room to hot or giving you a blocked nose? It is always worth trying to think laterally to ensure what you think is the problem, really is the problem.   I used to find that sometimes that type of thinking would go away with a breathing exercise that I used. I would lie in bed and then force myself not to breath for as long as possible. My diaphragm would want to move but I would prevent it until I couldn't hold any longer. I didn't hold as if I was in a no-breathing competition but just until it was uncomfortable. I would then breath in. This helped as it meant that when I breathed in I was breathing in from the bottom of the diaphragm and not using the chest muscles. I found this quietened my thoughts down and I would drift off to sleep. It wasn't 100% effective but it did work quite often.   As you say, the thinking is probably a symptom of something else (stress) and indicates a greater need to relax. Maybe you could stop the thinking by saying 'Forget it!' each time the thoughts start. By learning not to think about work or other life stresses and put them aside for the day you will find it easier to sleep.   It can be really difficult to solve but don't give up.   Sounds a little like sleep apnoea. Are you aware of that issue and it's effects on people?  It normally comes just as people enter REM sleep. The throat closes down and air cannot get to the lungs. Two types: Central and Obstructive (but their is also mixed). You may get headaches the next day due to lack of oxygen. Attacks can happen many times an hour and as the sufferer is asleep they don't realise what is happening. As the attack happens they wake up to stage 2 sleep meaning that they are not in REM sleep very much during the night. Higher risks of heart disease and accidents etc. Can be very serious.  You can get it tested for at a sleep clinic, hire a CPAP machine if you wanted to test treatments for yourself, watch these videos for treatments using Vitamin D and B100 (http://tinyurl.com/oazpp5b) or use a Oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels while you sleep. If using Oximeter get one that straps to your wrist, they cost about £100.  Here is my more detailed article on it: http://tinyurl.com/p27vwj2  Good luck.   Wow, I have had my share of troubles but I am grateful that I don't have anything like that to deal with.   It would seem to me that the root of the problem is that your dad is very lonely. Hence he is grasping at such an improbable straw to try to connect to the world. My first thought was that maybe you could gently help him to find other ways to socialise and help him build his confidence. However, he would need to be in a far better state of mind before you could begin to work on that. You clearly have a lot of work to do if you are going to provide support for your dad. Your counsellor(s) will be by far the best person to provide support for you and your sister. They should be able to make good suggestions on how best to communicate with your dad.  My suggestion would be to, as gently as possible, explain to your dad that you think he is very lonely. Tell him that is normal for a lot of people (maybe you have been there yourself) but that things can get better. Explain that you would like to help him and that he doesn't need to feel embarrassed about talking to you because you love him and want the best for him. Maybe you can invite him to some very small social events sometimes so that he can learn to build his confidence. Maybe a walk with you and a male friend of a similar age to your dad, or a drink in the pub (that's what bars should be called!). I would suggest passing this idea through your counsellor first though if you can get a few minutes with them in the next couple of days - a phone call would be enough. Your dad clearly needs support now.  Good luck in dealing with this. It must be a very worrying time for you and your sister.   The CBT method is automated with a supportive community at http://sleepio.com. It costs about £6 per week and is typically 12 sessions. It is sort-a like that which buschic described with some additional stuff thrown in.  I would also highly recommend watching these videos on how an American doctor cured patients of their sleep disorders using vitamin D. It is really quite a detailed amount of information. http://tinyurl.com/oazpp5b  Magnesium helped me fantastically for about a month and then became less effective over the next 8 months. It was so successful for a while that I read a lot about it. I condensed my research into this PDF: http://tinyurl.com/qaawma8  I found that I was allergic to milk and dust mites. The only symptom was an occasional blocked nose and only when I lay down for 3 hours or more. Once I stopped taking dairy products there was an enormous improvement. I need to look into the possibility that even a gently allergic reaction could cause severe insomnia. However it is worth bearing in mind in case you have a similar problem.  Good luck on toughing it out on your smoke withdrawal. I always used to wonder if recreational drugs caused my insomnia. 25 years later I was glad to find out that it is extremely unlikely!   There are plenty of people in life who will pull you down. Some do it on purpose and others don't know they are doing it. Either way you don't need them.  Try to find groups that engage in your interests and see if you can make friends with the people there. You'll have something in common with them and a reason for getting to know them. It will take a bit of time to get organised and maybe in the meantime you can find some things to do on your own. Maybe find places to cycle or walk in your spare time, join a martial arts, yoga or fitness class. You'll eventually bump into some people who seem OK. When you do you can see if they want to get togehter to do something like the pub, film or snooker.   I'm sorry to hear that you are having such a hard time of things at the moment. It can be very, very difficult to keep trying to find ways to improve your situation. From my reading some meds can take up to 6 weeks to kick in and it may be a slow improvement from there (although I am not knowledgeable in this). Don't beat yourself up about taking meds. It is not a sign of weakness.  Many years ago I was struggling while working. I decided that I had to leave the job and make my new job the task of trying to improve my situation. It was a lot of long nights sat on my own not being able to sleep and sometimes I would get so desperate that I would sit and read about things that can cause depression. I would then resolve to try that thing, going to the shop the next day to buy some mineral/vitamin supplement or ordering a light box. Each time I did it I found that I got a little hope. It was often dashed when it failed and I was back at square one. However eventually I came across a couple of things that started working for me. They only worked a little bit and I had to find several other things as well. Over time I started to get more and more hope. For me there is now a light at the end of the tunnel - if I can reach it. The point I am trying to make (albeit clumsily!) is that for me, some of the worst times were when I had almost no hope.   It is hard to force yourself to read about what could be causing your issues, and it is also hard to try to implement the solutions. However we know that you feel rotten and there is a reason why - either biological or emotional. If you don't know the cause of your depression then trying something you have not done before may be that one solution you are looking for. It is very hard work, but take it one step at a time. Maybe you could:  1) Read up on different medications and set a date to visit your doctor in a months time and ask for a change - assuming your current med continues to be ineffective; 2) Read up on vitamin/mineral/allergic causes that have caused your depression. Then go and try that supplement; 3) Read up on the effects of light on mood (chronotherapy) and maybe buy a light box; 4) If your family doesn't know what is going on then make a resolution to chat with them (if they are generally supportive). they may be able to provide support. 5) You go running, so maybe you could join a group and one day when things are not so bad for you go along to it. You may meet some interesting people who could alleviate your loneliness a little bit. Also remember that some people actually choose to be hermits or solitary monks. There is nothing wrong with that path. You may be forced to walk it for now but maybe you can find solace that you are fighting a philosophical battle. One day it may be over and you will have an active social life again. There is nothing wrong with being single or allowing yourself to enjoy your own company.   Just try one thing initially. Give yourself praise that you are at least trying your best even if you think your efforts are feeble - they aren't, you just have a very, very difficult problem to solve.  Good luck.   It didn't help me but I am fairly certain that my issues were caused by a mixture of vitamin deficiency and allergies (touch wood, fingers crossed etc.). There is plenty of evidence to suggest it works for SAD and delayed sleep phase disorder.   There is an interesting book called Chronotherapy (renamed as 'Reset Your Inner Clock') by Dr. Michael Terman who set up the Centre for Environmental Therapeutics. You may be interested in that if you think that light is the source of your insomnia.     	9
 It will probably be another full week before we get anything.   I personally think and hope it will arrive along with the first public beta.   I’m not having issues with the crashing of the control center tray, but on tray pull-up there is some lag and dropping of frames, which is annoying. So I suppose that I hope for the continued smoothing-out of interface elements as well as the continued improvement of battery life, wi-fi issues (for those who have them), and of course the addition of Apple Music.   They just seem to prefer releasing things on Tuesdays.   I never said I believe her every word, just that she does her homework and is a pretty swell analyzer. She seems intelligent and open-minded to me, so while I may not end up siding with her on everything, we still share a similar (and in my opinion healthy) distrust of government and mass media. Her striking analysis of Family Guy's "prediction" of Robin Williams' death is what really got to me.   Wow… that is extremely unsettling, not unlike looking over similar presentations regarding NSA data mining. Thank you.   Where is this?   Well, there are occurrences of what some have termed "predictive programming," which just a term for conditioning/priming the mass conscience using media laced with subconscious "clues" which are, as some believe, the Elite's way of "warning" the public of catastrophic events. A good example of such a phenomenon is Family Guy, a show perfect for subconscious brainwashing due to its off-the-wall, seemingly "random" nature, correctly "predicting" some major occurrences, such as the Boston Marathon bombings and Bruce Jenner's transition into Caitlyn. Saturday Night Live has also supposedly been used to push secret agendas (including that of the 9/11 attacks) before they had come to full fruition. If anyone else has more info/examples, I'd certainly appreciate it.  Source: Betsy McGee on YouTube. Please check out her channel; she's a bona fide, homework-doing badass.

 Yeah, and I kicked it in.   Actually, I don't know what I did to make that photo so bright. Maybe it's just my settings cause I always have 100% brightness cause I have terrible dark-seeing abilities irl.   As the original poster of that picture, I must agree. There needs to be a mod for that hahah!            I hate to admit it, but I am going to cheat to get to see the other moons and planets. I can't land properly cause I hardly understand how so this helped a bit. Thank you!   Well as it stands, I am very low tech'd right now but you are more than welcome to try and explain it to me. I understand the most of what everyone is saying its just a matter of I don't know if I can actually do it.   English please. Hence, noobie lol. I understand the super basics up to the Mun orbit training pt. 1   I definitely have 3 spaceships of my own that can get me to orbit for sure, and if done right, the Mun. I am happy with them thats why I had asked for other ships. It's fun to see what else I could do to take off!   infinite fuel?    How do you use mechjeb? I have heard about it and just downloaded it but how do I use it?    Probably should've included that it is just the command pod. Tried burning what was left retrograde in hopes of intercepting with anything but it didn't work.   So, I got the game the other day (this is about my third post today alone) and I finally got a spaceship into orbit around Kerbin. I was so excited that I forgot to stop burning prograde. My orbit is now wonky like [so](http://i.imgur.com/jmzZkO6.png). Is there anyway for me to save this pod cause it has about 130 science points to it right now. Any help would be appreciated!   Since i just got the game, are there any good .craft ships you would suggest I download?   I did it with the first and second set no problem.   x-posting to r/ODST if that is okay?   I hadn't even though about dual monitor wallpapers lol! Thats really cool!    If I get any money soon it will be donated to the cause!   I am fairly familiar. When I was on demo I achieved full orbit on a ship with less than 20 pieces.  How do I build a space station for starters though?    Mere minutes before the 40% sale wore off on Steam, I bought the game. I am now a proud Kerbalnaut! Even though I spent somewhere around 14 hours on the demo!  So what are some of the challenges you guys would give me? Make them simple though!:)   I would say that you could use a printer/scanner to scan one of the pages in the back that is blank, front and back, and just get a remake of the covers and get a lot of copies of those spare pages.      I will host /r/ODST stuff!(Considering I am a moderator on the sub.) We try holding a gameday at least once, if not twice, a month!   Okay so here is my theory, picking up what people have said about the Institute, Black Row, The REV ALPHA code, and everything else I have picked up. Just my speculation and theory btw.  EHEHEMM... Vault 119, one of the few Vaults built in the Northeast, is inhabited by people who haven't seen the surface in almost 225 years. Generations have been born and generations have died, all the while the inhabitants keep living on, ignorant of the outside world. They go about they're daily business their Vault, just south of Boston, waiting for the door that has kept them safe for so many years to open. Their Vault, made by Vault-Tec before the Great War, wasn't meant to open until 300 years after it closed. Unless something goes terribly wrong.              It's a normal Monday morning, and the Survivor is wading through his daily routine of classes, then workout, eat, sleep, repeat. He walks past the tunnel leading to the door and hears some heavy thudding. Of course very curious, he walks towards the door. As he gets closer, he can also hear a voice on the other side. Someone was calling help, and from the sounds of it, they weren't strong. As The Survivor turned to run from the door to get help, he hear a louder thud, then what sounded like laughter. He ran off, too scared to mention what happened. A week passes and this time as he is waking up, all the alarms in the Vault start going off. The Overseer starts sounding off a message through the intercom.       Something wasn't right. All the statuses were checked green that day. No critical systems were failing, no reactor was blowing up. Something bad was about to happen. Just then there is a loud explosion and a fury of gunshots as a large band of raiders charge into the Vault. They kill everyone. Save the Survivor. They hide under the body of a raider they killed until the rest calmed down. Then he escaped. S/He is amazed both by how beautiful, and horrific, the landscape is. He finds the body of the man that was banging on the door the previous week, and disposes of the corpse, keeping the 10mm pistol and Leather Armor however. From there, it's storyline.      I did this with FNV on my Xbox. I was perusing around on my laptop and forgot I had the game on my PC so I started playing it again. And with a few mods, it totally sparked back up.       Hey guys! Come join me on Halo: ODST to play firefight, campaign, and everything else this wonderful game has to offer!:)  GT: Troop4921   Hey guys! Come join me on Halo: ODST to play firefight, campaign, and everything else this wonderful game has to offer!:)  GT: Troop4921   I might join that after a while!:)   I agree on the point of Halo 2   3 being better than (almost) any CoD game. Halo 2, even being almost 10 years old, still has a humongous fanbase still playing. Even I am included in that fanbase:) Halo 3 was one of the biggest multiplayer games when it came out. Although it's population dwindled at times, when it became free, It's population reached the same numbers it would have had in the first month. I truly love the series and I see alot of opposition writing it but I believe that Halo, overall, is the better game.    Hey guys! train_subject896 here! I posted on /r/ODST about the game day but I figured I should include the whole community as well! Well, tomorrow, Saturday 11/16 I will host an ODST gameday!  What do we do: Well, aside from the obvious playing ODST, we do alot of firefight, achievement hunting, and the occasional legendary run on campaign!:)  Who can join: Anyone with ODST! Even if your on a friends console with them, your welcome to join! We love having tons of ODST's teaming up against the covenant onslaught! :D  How do I join?: Message Troop4921 on XBL or myself, train_subject896, on reddit and I will invite you! Also, you can leave your GT in the comments and we will try fitting you in if we can!  Have fun and as always, see you on the battlefield!:)   Hey guys! train_subject896 here! So, I recently jumped back into wanting to play Minecraft but the problem is, since I updated my launcher (last I had was like before the horse update) I haven't been able to play, let alone even log in. Does anyone else have this problem? Does anyone know how to solve it?   Hey guys, train_subject896 here! So, like many of the other active duty Spartan's on here, I am back into the grind of school and have been since August. I currently am enrolled in a public speaking class. My final is a persuasive speech that has to last 5 minutes. Being the diehard fan I am, I chose to beg the question, "Why Halo is better than Call of Duty" as my topic. Now, here is where I need your help /r/Halo.  **Why is Halo better than Call of Duty to YOU?**  Now, before you all get fussy, I am a fan of all games, including the occasional game against bots on COD. I respect it as a game, considering the titan it is, and expect you to have some form of etiquette rather than answers like "cuz cod iz 4 fagts 420 sweg". Please be level headed and source your info!  Thanks all! See you on the battlefield!:)   My biggest wish for it: SOMEHOW LINK IT TO FNV OR F3!!! I love intertwining storylines. Maybe the character is a sort of descendant of the Courier or Lone Wanderer. I really agree with alot of points. I love the factions of FNV and would like to see that again. But take out the Enclave. After Broken Steel, I feel like they learned. Alot.   That was freakin deep    Hey guys! Sorry about the past couple play days falling on their faces and not doing to well! I've been very busy irl working on the musical I'm in at my school and other works! Hopefully you all can forgive because this time I'm attempting to give a week's notice so if you want to join, please write your Gamertag in the comments and I (GT: Troop4921) will message you next friday to let you know your in and we're still doing this!  See you all on the battlefield! Mickey over and out!   Sadly, I'm not with my xbox this weekend. My high school's musical that I'm in is having dress rehearsal's this weekend and next weekend. It's a possibility next weekend. Sorry! I'll try as much as I can to get it going but in the meanwhile, we have this week to spread the news!   Anybody wanting to play at all?    Hey guys whats up! Since the release of Halo 3 for free the population has boomed! And I decided to play a little bit but now I really have that urge to play ODST so if you want to play, message me Troop4921 on XBL and we can play! I should be on all day so have fun! See you on the battlefield!   Hey guys! ac here! I recently made this whole 16 episode series of vanilla (it's on Xbox so it has to be!) Dragonborn DLC! A few things to note, sometimes the audio is off from the video which sucks and bugs me and I tried fixing it but by the time I noticed I couldn't do much. Hope you guys enjoy! If you have comments, leave them here or on the video!       Sheogorath for the Daedra cause who doesn't want to lose their mind for fun?! And with the Aedra, probably Akatosh.   I might x-post this onto /r/ODST if you don't mind. A few other redditors and myself went and did this a few months back and it was a blast.   Are these for sale anywhere? Cause if so, I know whats going on my christmas list. My heart ached a bit when I saw that thing.    I have my dragonborn playlist if you don't mind low-quality audio. I'm still figuring out the kinks of my Roxio Game Cap so everything is a little weird. But if you want, here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOjD4z3v6B0 list=PLI8faRdJSX0lIWrKNU1UZPdYvYCXEjTL2 feature=mh_lolz) to my Let's Play   I would definitely say play Oblivion, along with the Shivering Isles Expansion. The game itself was very captivating and I put in around 300+ hours on it. Add the DLC into the mix and it explains alot about some of the Daedric Prince's and what they do.      I will watch yours if you'll watch mine. My actual Skyrim is crap cause it was recorded on a potato camera, but my Dragonborn series is on my Roxio game cap. I always love seeing how other people do things differently then the way I do them. My channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/Troop4921) if you want to watch the actual videos, the playlist is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYj0I0TRD2I list=PLI8faRdJSX0l85MmoMUXZovxmckSrr_GW feature=mh_lolz)   Hey guys! So I would normally have made this a Saturday night event but I will be attending a concert (Five Finger Death Punch specifically) that night. So instead, to make up for the failed game nights of the past, I will be having a game day tomorrow!:) Feel free to join me playing ODST and Halo 3 all day Friday, Oct. 18th!   This was shortly before I had bought my Roxio Capture card so yeah, my recordings(video) have gotten alot better quality since then. Thanks for the advice!:)   So I was hanging out at a friends house just a little bit ago and he mentioned hearing a rumor or seeing something about Skyrim 2 that will be multiplayer and slightly boosted graphics, on the next gen physics engine and game engine.(I shot it down, thinking it was just ESO but I'm still curious.)  Anyone else heard anything about this?   Oh it won't fade any time soon if I have anything to do with it! ODST was my favorite game because of lore and gameplay.      Well, this was a flop! Sorry guys! We'll try again soon!    Sorry all! Running way behind! Got held after at work! Be on ASAP   	57
 If the moment and environment is right, most definitely.      Nude beaches sound awesome, I've always hated having to wear a bathing suit.    Another cool thing: I can now say Slipknot's seen my tits!   What's funny is I've never gotten groped before crowd surfing. I wasn't even the one who took the top off in the first place, some random guy did. But I must admit being stripped against my will and groped was pretty exhilarating!      I feel like it can be difficult to always be there for someone in that state, as hard as it is to actually be in that state. It's hard to just get out of the hole you're in. You can't just leap out, you have to take small steps, climb slowly, make progress. It's fine if you slip a little bit, it's fine if you need to stop and take a rest. It's fine if you need someone to help you. The most important thing is the fact you want to get out. You know, this is your journey and you just gotta keep moving    Since you can relate to my post so well, you should look up Atypical Depresssion. Out of all the symptoms I've googled and disorders I've read about, atypical depression is definitely the one I've been able to relate to the most    I am, and I have noticed that I'm much more likely to slip into depression a week before my period, but I don't always. I looked up PMDD, it does seem to be fitting   	8
 My parents told me I exist because my dad "sucks at knowing when to stop."  I guess they were referencing pulling out.   My boyfriend is 29 and still has it nearly every morning. Doesn't matter how often we have sex.   I was 22. Just over a year.   My boyfriend looks at Gonewild. I don't really care.   Every day. I love bathing/showering.   I call my cat a yellow bastard, an orange bastard, and a furry bastard.   I get that too. Dry humor.   That I'm quiet and don't smile. Yeah, years of depression will do that to you.   It turns out to be true, but isn't really relevant to today's unions.  Also, even then unions back in the day did far more good, even considering fucking up universal healthcare chances.   I'm pretty damn liberal, and even I admit this.   Sadly, I doubt that.   I'm poor, but hope to be middle class someday.  I'd happily pay the tax rates Scandinavian people pay for a society like theirs.    Unions are the main reason the U.S. didnt adopt universal healthcare like the rest of the developed world decades ago, because those fuckers thought it would take away from their "collective bargaining power."  Going to need a citation for that.   That's very much in debate by scientists.   Whether or not you understand pain has nothing to do with how well you can feel it and the suffering you go through.   Nope, that website doesn't exist either.   Her injury happened years ago and she isn't in pain now.   Except the brain of a squid is very close to the beak area. All the chef did there was chop off vital organs, so it's more than likely writing in pain.   Except the brain of a squid is very close to the beak area.

I think the ban on gendered slurs is the stupidest fucking thing.   Don't really want to go into detail, as people from real life know my username.   Not really, since the majority of military roles aren't combat.   I don't give a shit because sports suck.   Did't they call their families to say goodbye and told them what they were going to do?   More gay people just started coming out. Before that they stayed closeted.    Same. It doesn't help that I have horrible depression and anxiety and tend to ruminate a lot.   Math. You'd be amazed how bad I am at it.  Whistle.   In the middle of the most traumatizing period of my life. Since October. Don't know if it'll ever end, even with therapy.   Since custody is more often awarded to mothers, that skews that numbers quite a bit. If custody was awarded to fathers most of the time despite the father's ability to care for the child being non-existent, we'd end up with dead kids then too.  The best thing to do would be to award joint custody in every possible situation unless one parent is clearly irresponsible.   Could Indian laws be different?   I personally believed Cosby did it, but as we never had any definite proof, I never called for his head.  I last heard Cosby's lawyers said the women willingly took them, not the victims.   https://sites.udel.edu/thereview/2014/10/12/dr-jill-mcdevitt-famed-sexologist-comes-to-campus-talks-virgins-and-sluts/  This is as close as I could get, and even that's almost nothing.   Funny, I don't remember too many people saying, "These women are lying." I remember them saying, "I wasn't there, so I don't know what happened."  For the record, I believed Cosby did it, but as we didn't have definite proof, I never called for his head. Now that he's admitted it, try him.   I was talking about the government flying the flag, not private citizens acting like idiots and committing crimes.   They're bombing clinics to cause fear and panic among the people who work and go there.  Using violence to cause panic and fear is the damn definition of terrorism.   We've actually been waiting since the 1960s.  The Confederate flag didn't go up until the south decided they wanted to protest the civil rights movement.   Reasons for risking life and limb varied, but they usually came down to four fundamentals: uphold state sovereignty, regional duty, group solidarity and protection of home and family.  Except their constitution made it illegal to ban slavery in any state, so there goes state sovereignty, regional duty, etc. Say one day Alabama decides they don't want slavery anymore. Too bad, they can't ban it. Where's state's rights now?  The notion that the average Confederate waged war to preserve slavery is a tenuous one at best. Only 6 percent of Southerners owned slaves, and 3 percent of those owned the majority. Recruits themselves referred to the war as "a rich man's war and a poor man's fight."  Data from the 1860 census shows us that 47% of the entire lower south, and 29% of the upper south consisted of slaves. That's a lot of people. One third of southern households owned at least one slave. Mississippi and South Carolina boasted bigger numbers. It was almost 1/2 of households there.   I think the "rich man's war and poor man's fight" comes from the fact that it was the rich that made their living on slavery. Your average household just had a slave or two to do daily chores. Households would just have to do their own housework if slavery was lost, but rich plantations would lose their entire way of life. And of course, the rich could pay for someone to fight for him. A poor man could not.   Have you read the declaration of sucession by any of the states? They came right out and stated it was about slavery. Texas even talked about how the "negros" were inferior and being beneath the whites was their natural place.  The Confederate Constitution also banned any state from outlawing slavery, so there goes state's rights.   PG? Damn it. There's no reason why it shouldn't have been rated R. The books were for kids, but everyone who grew up with them are adults now. Make it really disturbing!   This sort of thing is why some students should be allowed on the school board.   "You're teaching us BS, stop it."   It was probably from the 1860 consensus. It was very common for households to have a few slaves.  It was mostly the rich though that had owned the plantations and hundreds/thousands of slaves to make their fortune. That's where the rich/poor divide comes from.  The Confederate Constitution also made it illegal for states to outlaw slavery. So much for state sovereignty.    The Confederate Constitution made it illegal for any confederate state to outlaw slavery.  It was all about slavery.   True, but it isn't the Democrats who have tried the Southern Strategy since then. That's the Republicans.   Have you ever read any of the states' declaration of secession?   They make it pretty clear it was slavery. Texas even goes as far as to say blacks are naturally inferior and belong under the power of white people.   This is how we get people who deny the war was about slavery.   Spacefm doesn't work for me. It gives me a blue page that's more or less blank.   People need to learn not to touch wildlife unless they're in danger. And even in that case notify your local department of natural resources if you can instead of touching them yourself.   I don't know why anyone would let themselves be put into the situation where they have more than one small child at a time. Except for twins or something, of course.  Having one sounds difficult enough.   I know there are sites aplenty for the different weeks, but I'm looking for something more detailed. Maybe showing half weeks or even day to day.  I myself am not pregnant, this is just for a project. Thanks!   When reasonable, yes. Reasonable restrictions on rights aren't trampling them.    say publicly that you'd like to see the president hung etc  I think you are allowed to say this. You just aren't allowed to say you're going to hang him or say someone else should hang him.  But since you think we should be allowed to say whatever we want, what should happen if someone knowingly accuses an innocent man of molesting a child, and an angry mob kills said man? Should the one who knowingly falsely accused him be punished? If so, that goes against your free speech ideals. That's slander.   Knives and chains would still kill less people.   You already compromised on the Bill of Rights.  You can't slander or libel. There's free speech and freedom of the press. You usually need a permit for protesting or assembling in public. There's freedom of assembly.  All of these are restrictions on the Bill of Rights.   So which of Bernie's proposed solutions would stop you from getting a gun for protection provided you can pass a background check?   Except gangs would get into a lot more trouble for having guns, which puts them in prison longer.   Was making slander illegal ripping up constitutional rights too? After all, free speech.  Reasonable limits on rights isn't ripping them up.    I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a weapon is more important to you people than free healthcare, education and higher minimum wage  This is America. We have a gun-shaped hole in our brains.   Are you allowed to slander someone? No. That's a restriction on the 1st amendment.  There's already balance in constitutional amendments like this.   And they can be arrested and thrown in jail when they're caught.   Are you allowed to slander someone? No. So there's already restrictions on the bill of rights.   This goes for men and women. If someone won't get off you, they're assaulting you.   My boyfriend has been doing this since we began dating (2.5 years) and it hasn't killed our sex life.  We still have sex that's enjoyable for me as well.    Usually let him do me really quick so I can roll over and go to sleep in peace.  My boyfriend is good at pestering me about it until I just decide to shut him up.   And they weren't considered the property of another person, for another thing.  Not sure what you think this has to do with the argument though. What does child labor in the north have to do with states admitting slavery is why they were seceding?    Children were paid for their work (however little) and you weren't allowed to kill them, for one.   No, they shouldn't. But they do. So now what? Shove them back in?   And yet you don't need to be well disciplined or trained to have a gun (which would be regulation), so we aren't even following that ruling.   Many states admitted it was about slavery when succeeding from the union. Texas even went as far as claiming black people were inferior and thus their natural position was under the foot of white people.   If someone is getting parental leave, the time for abortion has passed.   And the people who already have clearly just need to shove them back into the mother's cootch.   Most other countries are capitalistic as well. Having to provide benefits to the people who work for you to keep your company profitable and working isn't mutually exclusive with capitalism.    I was told not to drink soda or drink from a straw until 24 hours had passed after my surgery. But my boyfriend was told not to do these things for a week after his were done.  The procedure was Friday. Do you think I'd be okay to drink from a straw or drink soda yet?   You made a claim with nothing to back it up. How do you know "well regulated" doesn't actually mean regulated in a government document, but "well-maintained"?  In fact, the word "regulate" comes from the Latin *regulatus*, which means "to control by rule."   It's been known to mean "to govern by restriction" since the early 1600s.    The original documents of the Confederacy show they were going to war for slavery, not because they thought the federal government was over-reaching.  Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world … a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization." -Mississippi  "In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals..." South Carolina (talking about how owners weren't permitted to bring their slaves with them into New York)  "We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable." -Texas     Explain.    It's actually pretty simple:  Someone that causes there to be more guns: pro-gun.  Someone that causes there to be less guns: anti-gun.  There's fewer varieties. Manufacturers are making as many individual guns as they ever have, and Sanders hasn't stood in the way of that. You're acting like there's guns missing because there weren't assault weapons.   His voting record on guns doesn't bear out that he's pretending on this issue.   When it comes to a war about a state's right to keep members of a certain race as property, yes, it is. Surprise, surprise.  People who insist the war was about states' rights never mention exactly what that right was, because they know what it was.   The Confederate flag was created for an army that was fighting solely to keep human beings as property. It didn't exist until they created it specifically for the purpose.   This would be like if regions of Germany still insisted on flying the Nazi flag and said, "Hate Jews? Nah, we're just celebrating our heritage."   I like how people insist it was about states' rights but their train of thought stops at exactly what right that was.   the people fought for states rights.  ...states' rights to keep slaves.   No one is saying idiots can't fly the flag on their own personal property.    The issue was about liberty and self determination.  Unless you were someone's property.  IF it was solely about slavery, we would not have needed the civil rights movement, and or we would have shipped the former slaves over to africa to be with their people.  Explain?   Well, they're right.  An economy based in slavery.   and you don't like that, don't work for them.  So you'll be paying for everyone to survive while they pass up employers they don't want to work for? Because a lot of people have little choice in who they work for.   Most of those countries don't make the employers pay the full amount. It's a government program.   I wouldn't move here either.   Yes. Every single other country has leave. America is 1 of 2 that doesn't.   Parents get the time off so their child can get the attention they need. Babies that are very young need a lot of care.  The first issue is that people see children as someone's burden instead of an investment in the future. Having well cared for children is important for a society.   The first issue here is that we look at children as someone's burden instead of an investment in the future.   Obviously the answer is to shove the child back into the mother's cootch.   Many families would not be able to stay afloat with one parent quitting their job.   So all countries except the USA and Papua New Guinea are socialist republics?   I'm not sure you know what propaganda is.   When I was around 19, my wisdom teeth began coming in. They hurt, but that's normal. Except it became obvious after awhile they were impacted. I read online that if they're painful for more than 6 months, they're likely impacted and it's time to have them removed.  When I told my mom this, she rolled her eyes and said, "They'll come in. Believe me, your mouth is big enough." That's right. She thought the fact that I was mouthy had anything to do with whether or not there was room for my wisdom teeth.  Well, I knew they were impacted, but I was still in high school at this point and didn't work, so it wasn't like I could pay to have them taken out. Two years passed. I had various infections where my teeth were trying to come in and lots of swelling, but they always went away at some point and I was still having trouble finding a job, so I just left them there. I tried to tell my mom how much trouble they were causing me, but she kept saying wisdom teeth are painful and she wasn't paying to have them removed when "nothing was wrong."  Well, one day three of them got infected at once. The pain was so intense that I couldn't so much as move my tongue without pain radiating from my teeth to my ears to my throat. I drooled into a towel instead of swallowing my saliva. It's to this day the worst pain I've ever felt.  At this time my dad took me to the dentist, FINALLY. Mom was still insisting this was normal, BTW. The dentist was shocked to see how long we let the problem go without seeing anyone about it. The removal was painful as hell (they couldn't get the infection to go away before operating, so they had to do it while my gums were inflamed).   The dentist said my last remaining wisdom tooth wasn't impacted and it would come in. He turned out to be wrong, but at least I had 3 of the 4 removed.  Who doesn't mind seeing their kid in extreme pain to save on dentist bills? That's my mother!   The entire winter is double blanket month for me even when the furnace is working.   I remember getting excited when I could smell the Spam was dad was frying!   My sister and I didn't go to the doctor nearly as much as we should have when we were little. Too expensive.  And seeing a dentist? Your tooth better be literally killing you.   Food stamps?   Isn't it $250K?   This is my boyfriend's foot. He's 29, 5'8, about 190 lbs.  Several hours ago he kicked his foot against the corner of a cabinet. This is how it looks now. He's going to see a doc tomorrow if it doesn't get better, but how does it look now?  http://i.imgur.com/WFWZetT.png  http://i.imgur.com/yRQnDLp.png     I had no idea who Victoria was until 2 minutes ago.   Penpal! It's quite long but quite good.   She's been treated for depression since she was a kid.   They've been treating her for years, and she's done.   For fuck's sake.  That's all I can say about that.   Good rule of thumb: Take ma'am out of your vocabulary.    Miss is actually anyone who isn't married. Or used to be, anyway.   When I heard someone refer to me as "the woman at the desk" at work I was shocked. I still think of myself as a girl!   Miss.   He wasn't saying, "You imagined it," he was disagreeing that the event was rape.   Never understood the appeal of Mario.   Disagreeing that someone was raped years ago isn't intentionally trying to make someone doubt their perceptions or memory.   17 is past the age of consent in many places.   It isn't on request because it isn't given out to anyone who wants it. A team of doctors have to agree it's in their best interests.

 Being judged for crying in public    1. Not saving more money 2. Investing time in people who truly did not matter 3. Not keeping a journal   I have realized that it becomes the after effects turn this into a cycle: men are taught to bury their emotions. I did this for years. Later in my life, I met a girl who wanted me to be more open with her so she could connect with me emotionally. The cycle becomes being too open with people who don't deserve it and too guarded with people who want to be there for you.    Partition by Beyonce    Luvox was good but Luvox made me really sleepy to the point where I was falling asleep in public   You're No One Til Someone Lets You Down by John Mayer   Thank you for clearing this up   And this is the theory that has shaped dating gender roles   This truly resonates with me   Numerous people have thought I am gay because of the fact I am a friendly guy.    If so, how did you overcome this? If you do not want to provide too much detail, I understand.    I think one thing to consider is the factor of emotional abuse that is occurring within this situation.   There is a term called gaslighting in which the abuser tries to control the victim's memory by committing actions and convincing the victim that they never happened. Your brother seems to be doing this and your family seems to be assisting him in this.   You are seeking validation. You want what happened to be acknowledged and validated; this is only fair. However, if they refuse to validate these things, you can only do two things: stay in the situation or remove yourself from it. The deciding factor will be if the lack of validation will be detrimental to your recovery.      I've been there, trust me I know how hard that is. What you are trying to do is to defend your actions by saying that you would never do what the little voice is saying that you would.    When women rub their thighs    One thing I have noticed is that certain triggers make my OCD harder to manage.   For example, if I am feeling really depressed that day, I do not have the extra energy to devote to fighting my compulsions.   Also, there are really bad days and there are really good days.    What makes you say schizophrenia?    I used to have similar experiences and I definitely believe this is a part of scrupulosity (religious OCD). One way to counter this is through Exposure Response Prevention therapy. Basically, you need to pray without responding to the intrusive thought. I know how difficult that is though.    I normally bring up the ways in which men are oppressed or women are oppressing men. The normal response I receive is how male problems are not as severe as female problems.   It's hard to win an argument when the other party is so infatuated with their own opinion that they cannot see credibility in anything else.    When I fell in love for the first time and was with my long term ex girlfriend   Society expects men to be the pursuers    I really appreciated reading this. Thanks for sharing   I've definitely felt pressured into sexual activity because the girl felt unwanted if I did not. It was one of the shittiest guilt trips and truly placed a damper on my view of sex.    "It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you"   Normally three times a day   A couple at church got engaged and I asked the future wife "why didn't she want to marry Tiger Woods, instead?"    I was 8. Oh the irony.    OP, the only way I can give you advice that will help is if I hear more about your particular circumstances    I want to be pursued and romanced in the way that society expects men to pursue and romance women    My grandfather passed away when my father was four, so my father had a rough time growing up. I try not to fault him for parenting mistakes.   My relationship with my father is cordial at best. I basically try not to piss him off and he leaves me alone. We can hold a conversation though.    Sign language   The hardest part for me is how society invalidates the emotional abuse of men by refusing to acknowledge it as abuse. No one directly calls this type of behavior as abuse. People will say "oh, she is just crazy". Men will say "oh, my girlfriend freaks out on me". Men are not allowed to say "my girlfriend emotionally abuses me". However, if a man were to exhibit the same behavior, people would easily validate that the woman or SO is being abused.   There are many reasons for this. Some people believe that men cannot be abused because of some ancient gender expectations. Also, there are some men that will have a difficult time validating the fact that they are being abused.   I normally don't talk about the abusive relationships I have been involved in because no one will believe me. The hardest part about dealing with this type of pain is when someone invalidates a traumatic experience.    I don't mean to sound like a tragic story, but my parents and my family did not really hug me as a child. Consequently, I'm a hugger; especially with those who I am close too. However, I have noticed that many guys are less likely to reciprocate that.    Needless to say, my aunt almost walked in on me this morning ...   I tell my friends that I love them, constantly. You never know when your last opportunity will be. I truly don't understand why two men cannot express their love for each other without their being some sort of questioning of sexuality.    This really makes me question if there is a relationship between schizophrenia and OCD.    Obviously I'm no medical professional, but your paranoia about the FBI watching you sounds exactly like paranoid schizophrenia. I've also had paranoid fears and I still don't understand the difference between those and schizophrenia.  I know schizophrenia has to do with a loss of touch to reality. From your post, it seems as if there was no logical connection to you having those thoughts; that makes it seem like a loss of touch to reality. However, that's just my observation and I could definitely be wrong.    Thanks everyone for the help   [Bitch, You Guessed It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT3OQwyvKmk) "I was right!"   I have already been diagnosed with OCD. As a child, I often dealt with paranoia. Even to this day, I will often wake up in a panic during the middle of the night. Last night, I basically stayed up the whole night because I was scared someone was waiting to murder me in my sleep.   Anyone else have paranoia and OCD?    Petition to start a membership club for us   Little guy is probably the worst    Hi everyone, The Weeknd is one of my favorites artists. I know he is supposed to release an album this year, but I do not know when that is. Does anyone know?    In college, I was at a party talking to a friend. This girl that I barely knew walked behind me and started placing her hands down my underwear. I turned around to give her a very strong look of disapproval, to which she and her friends kicked me out of the party (it was their party).   Fun times.    I'm not proud to say this, but I've been in two. Abuse manifests itself in patterns, therefore, there is always another reason why a person easily accepts abuse.   I would often make excuses for her behavior (e.g. she is just having a bad day, I made her upset, she had a rough childhood). However, none of these things are acceptable excuses for abusive behavior.   The sad part about this is that he has to realize the abuse in his own mind. Once he acknowledges the abusive behavior, then he will begin to do something. The enlightenment is the hardest part.      The Weeknd    When I was a teenager, it was socks. Now, I just use an old item of clothing   I'm too nice and I have a really hard time saying no.    I used to be fat and now that I have lost the weight, I have left over fat deposits in some areas. One of those areas is my chest. I would love to trim it, but you can only rarely spot reduce fat.    Still here, but I only have a few freckles around my nose   Six and a half years ago. My then girlfriend humiliated me in front of all of my friends. I could not understand why someone I trusted so much would do that to me   I'm curious, what Ed Sheeran song? I love his music but he just brings out so many feels in me   Let's go Red Birds!   I keep a journal and I must say that writing your feelings is really helpful. However, I tend to repress my emotions by burying them under the surface and trying to forget them. Sometimes, they show up subconsciously though.    How did you overcome this?   Attacked by?  	54
 Not really, no. I mean, if we're talking about positive feelings, I've nothing much to lose. I don't see people close to me with the same problems.   I'm leaning towards writing and drawing, I always come back to them. I don't really see the point of doing things I don't enjoy or that frustrate me. I doubt people feel that way very often or they wouldn't keep it up. I've never kept anything I've written or drawn, I always throw it out or delete it, I get that angry at my own work.  	2
 HOLY SHIT YES I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THIS BLESS YOU    Many things can make you fall in love with a book.   * Words strung together so well they echo your feelings. Or melt you into a puddle. Or hit your chest like a hard *pang!*   * A character in the book whose words you read make you feel more like you're staring into a murky reflection of yourself in a puddle. A character that says a few words to you while you're caught in a busy intersection that grasps your complete attention in an instant and makes the commotion around you seem like a white noise. A character that was your first love.   * A story that not only puts you into the character's shoes, but lets you feel the frayed leather soles with your toes. A story that makes you forget yourself and take the form of a rolling camera.   I want to discover books that are not only written well, but provide meaning to readers. I thought I might ask you guys. What is your favorite book? And why (I would really like to hear about this).   I have a lot of books that I loved, but I would say my favorite it Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli. It was a book I read as a little girl and several times later, but the memories of the imagery really hold a special place in my heart. Please do tell me yours. :)  	2
 okay, would it help you if I changed it to "Slade Wilson(w/ Mirakuru)"   I refuse to disagree with you, my brother.   Well I googled synonyms of supernatural and got superhuman, so I would say Mirakuru is supernatural.  andnbsp;  **Supernatural**: unable to be explained by science or the laws of nature : of, relating to, or seeming to come from magic, a god, etc.   I'm pretty sure Mirakuru falls under "unable to be explained by science or the laws of nature", at least to the real world, which pre-The Flash TV, Arrow is basically in.   yea i did.   Yea, I'm confused.   Exactly. :)   In this video(scene), Oliver says "Those 5 years that I was away..I came across things that just...defy..explanation."   Is it possible Hal Jordan became the Green Lantern before or around the time Oliver was away from Starling City? Is it possible he means the Green Lantern, because so far the only supernatural thing we've seen, is Slade (with the Mirakuru ofcourse). What do you guys think he meant? Do you think the producers had a plan when writing this scene.  andnbsp;  Mind the title of this video... its an Olicity channel xP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcX3qFIvLGQ     [Nice Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRIYLV292Rs)   I'll rate the seasons in terms of rappers.  * Season 1 = J Cole / Great for a start, had some flaws but overall enjoyable * Season 2 = 2Pac (or Biggie or Eminem) / The greatest of them all, Manu Bennett's performance was amazing, and the character development in past and present day was astounding * Season 3 = B.o.B / Definitely had it's good moments, has it's haters, and has it's lover, good overrall, not perfect, but good... like Banana Bread compared to Cheesecake... good but not quite there  andnbsp;  Edit: I shouldve used desserts instead of rappers.   I'm not sure how the universes work in the CWverse, but this lady is apart of the Soviet Air Force... so maybe we'll get to see her in Arrow, if she even exists in this universe. http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Valentina_Vostok_(New_Earth)    damn reddit doesn't like fan-fiction :(  andnbsp;  If it helps, it's not a cheesy romantic fanfiction. Olicity will not be the core focus of the story.   I don't think there will be Coast City, I think he will be getting on a ship that sends him somewhere else... possibly Russia, or if he does go to Coast City it will be very brief.    Who is the guy on the right? Looks like a mix of Pied Piper or Cpt. Cold or something, but I know it's not them.   His first was actually getting Roy all roided up on Mirakuru.   I'm actually writing a Flash/Arrow fanfiction, I plan on making her meet the real White Canary, and not be so pleased with her ways, and change her name back to just "The Canary"   Because he's joking about how similar Green Arrow is to Batman.  andnbsp;  Unfortunately, he doesn't know that they share villains.  * Merlyn (Green Arrow villain) * Deathstroke (Green Arrow/Batman/Teen Titans villain * The Huntress (Anti-hero, not a villain really of Green Arrow, but brought into the story because.... Black Canary, Birds of Prey, etc. * Brother Blood (Not even a Batman villain, Teen Titans villain.) * Brick (Green Arrow Villain) * Cyrus Gold (Solomon Grundy pre-zombie, is a Green Arrow villain post-crisis) * Deadshot (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but has faced him in Animated TV Shows, and his daughter lives in Star City) * Ra's Al Ghul (Not specifically a Green Arrow villain, but Merlyn is affiliated with the League of Assassins, so it was fine to introduce him into Arrow... in fact if it wasn't for Merlyn, the League would probably never have been involved with the story, except some snippets of Sara Lance here and there.) * The Clock King (Green Arrow villain.) * Cupid (Green Arrow Villain.) * Brother Eye (More of a JLA villain... which Green Arrow is a part of.) * Count Vertigo (Green Arrow and Batman shared villain.) * Firefly (Batman villain.) * KGBeast (Not a villain.... yet. But a Batman villain.) * Dollmaker (Batman Villain.)  ___  andnbsp;  Consensus: The only true Batman-exclusive villains on Arrow are Firefly, Dollmaker, and Deadshot, we have yet to see Anatoli Knyazev's story, assuming they'll cover the whole Russian Bratva thing in the flashbacks.   They could get a different actor sorta, like if they did some future/alternate timeline grey-haired Slade like in the comics/video games/cartoons.  andnbsp;  I doubt they would... but it would be cool, to mention him in the future, or tease him in an alternate universe on The Flash, of course, they could still show a guy in the suit and mask, you don't need Manu Bennett for everything Deathstroke concerned.   not that funny :\   I get what you mean, if Olicity was like Diggle and Lyla, I think it would be received well by shippers and the rest of us.   Because you get   * the badassery of a crime fighting couple * some romantic/emotional scenes when the day is done, not mid way though the episode * and some humour... like "No glocks on the dinner table."      It's about time Joe West got some action, since I'm sure Arrow will never give Quentin Lance anymore :(   I feel like Arrow is gonna go completely downhill now. No more Slade, barely anymore Roy, probably no Hal Jordan, and more Olicity.  andnbsp;  :(   Terra and Beast Boy.... a better love story than ~~Twilight~~ Olicity.   My Name is Daniel Brickwell, for 15 years I was stranded in a basement with only one thing... a greasy Xbox controller. Now I have return to my city, not the raging teenager I once was, but the ....raging adult that will wreak havoc on Starling City. But to do this, I must become someone else... I must become something else..   hahaha    Don't forget the motto.  andnbsp;  Not God...Grodd.     a human "U wot m8".  Those already exist.... they're called "Kids on Xbox"   She was someone else...she was... something else...  andnbsp;  andnbsp;  andnbsp;  andnbsp;  Previously on Hannibal Bates.   No he's not. Our show is dying :( and they're probably gonna end it in 2 more seasons. Whereas The Flash will go on for eternity.  :'(   Yes... the Hōzen.     Grodd I hope, he's actually joking, at least reference him, find out his name, or something.   When Wells was...i guess lecturing Cisco about the Cold Gun going missing in Episode 4, he said "You know how I feel about weapons, Cisco, they do not belong in S.T.A.R. Labs"  andnbsp;  Then in Episode 21, Grodd said "Father. hate. gun." when he made Joe West throw away the handgun.  ___  Just thought I'd share (\^‿\^). Something to keep us thinking throughout the summer.   Kelly Frye.   Ha! Jokes on you, I've only seen about 2 of your synopses. So I have all summer to enjoy them.   	34
 You're not going crazy, I heard it.  Just once, and I don't remember which level it was.  I kind of like it over the regular boss music.  	1
 Thank you so much. I was told by my counsellor to write everything I'm bothered about out. Sit on it for a day, if I feel te same express myself. If not write why I'm okay with it now. A strange diary of sorts, but I've realised I like writing.   Oh :( parents are worse, they already have that air of 'I made you so I know better than you' you get depressed and you're a goner. My mum used to tell me to snap out it, then she would feel bad and baby me. She would actually feed me things like fairy cakes and happy meals. Like, they made me happy when I was a child, I'm still her child so they will still work. Okay mum, mum.      Please don't feel anxious! I welcome any help. If you'd rather PM me i would love to chat :)    Yeah the men in the school think we are ridiculous. Something sets one of us off and then the other shouts 'OMG DON'T' then we turn away from each other flapping at our eyes frantically. Working in a school you can imagine how many cute kids, and cute stories and bloody all sorts we have to put up with. She's a little different to me, she's 30, boyfriend is 24, he has a young daughter so doesn't want anymore children for a few years........she's like a cat in heat, ready to make babies like rabbits lol.   I find that i'm a lot more teary over almost everything. I met a puppy last week, i cried for five whole minutes. I've even gotten my boss to cry because i've cried over something cute. We set each other off.   Yeah it's exactly that! okay so i have this good job, i've got this nice house, i've even got a dog that's i've cared for 7 years, i pay my bills i cook healthy home made meals. I'm all ready!...................okay so where's my baby? i'm ready, i've done everything i'm meant to do.   Then you see people like this, I have a 19 year old friend that slept around LOTS, got pregnant by accident and took 50 photos a day, described every detail of her pregnant, moaned about how hard it was and I had to remove her. I'd rather her think I was rude than put up with her ignorant shit anymore.    That's my problem, I used to be terrified of being alone. It would cripple me. Now i crave it, I crave being alone, I go shopping on my own, i dance around my house on my own, i do crafts on my own. Why? because it's easier to do things with a clearer head when there isn't someone trying to help with everything. Sometimes i feel like if they could help you breath easier because it would help with depression, they would sit and inflate and deflate your lungs for you. Why breath by yourself when i can do it for you? They want to know everything, have you eaten? have you slept? why haven't you eaten? why are you eating bad food? why are you sad? why are you angry? what can i do? constant questions that you ask yourself over and over and over, beating yourself up about it. Then they ask, and they ask again and you want to scream I AM AN ADULT I WILL DO WHAT I WANT GO FUCK YOURSELF I HATE YOU. But you can't, that's frowned upon.   You know the worst bit? they are literally only trying to help, but if they just took a step back and listened to you they may be able to understand and help better. They think they know what's best because they've read about it or they've heard about it, but every single person who suffers with depression suffers it in their own unique way. So yeah, do your research and learn about depression, fantastic! but most importantly, fucking listen to the person. If you don't, you end up isolating them more.    naughty naughty rimmel!   I know she's your cousin, but this made me angry to my core. She sounds like a child announcing she's having a child, which she is, which makes me more angry. Children can have children but I can't.    So, I finished work. Headed to the train station. Sit down on the train and sink into my chair. Oh good this shit day is over now I can go home and get into bed and not get out until tomorrow.   The conductor asked me for my ticket. I go to get it and suddenly realise I've left my train ticket in work. Without even being able to control my next actions I burst into uncontrollable sobs. The conductor (a kind lady) was so shocked I got a hug and a 'don't worry if you've forgotten it, I'll let you off, don't worry I believe you' off she trots and 5 minutes later she appears with a little smile 'I was saving this for my break but I'd like you to have it' and she passed me a little chocolate bunny. I declined and she replied 'it's okay I should be on a diet, I'd prefer to make you happy than make myself fat'  And because I'm an emotional wreck I got my train journey home and a delicious chocolate bunny.    That's why depression is still and will be for a very long time taboo, maybe there is more understanding, maybe it's okay to be depressed, medically there is a a reason, an understanding on what is wrong with me. To everyone else though it's something they can't possible understand and no matter what people who suffer with depression are always treated in some way differently. Whether it's with anger and misunderstanding or over'understanding and  being treated like a child, a child with learning difficulties.   My counsellor told me i'm very self aware, and that most of the time i've figured out why i've done something or what's causing how i feel. She's told me that she doesn't think i even need counselling because i go there, tell her what i think and she just agrees or disagrees with me. But that's why i go, i don't go to talk or air everything out anymore. I go, so a professional can tell me if what i'm thinking and doing is right. So that i have some professional basic to battle against people who think they know better than i do, because they think i'm irrelevant now because i'm depressed and can't decide anything for myself.   Thus i'm stuck in this limbo of improving and becoming more and more mentally healthy, but in doing so, realising how utterly fucked everyone else is. How they hide from emotions and refuse to acknowledge what their actions may have caused to peoples emotions.   So pretty much, unless the whole world got counselling and more understanding of the brain and how it can and can't work. We are always going to be salmon Trying to swim up the river the wrong way. Because we're taught how to be mentally healthy. But mentally healthy, isn't healthy.  The end.   I'm also from the UK, if you PM me I'd he happy to chat :) and let you know how I deal with things etc it doesn't always work or help but it's definitely improved my life.    I think I'm a crazy chihuahua lady, she's my baby. Sometimes I just stare at her whilst smoothing her because I think she's so beautiful haha   We don't have a yard, but it's easier with such a tiny dog. I hope you get a pet really soon! X   So cute! I would love a car but we live in an apartment. My doggie is called Bailey and she's my whole world :)  	14
 Haha man I would totally ask someone to do it for me. I need to work on being upfront though, instead of letting people rule me. I mean she doesn't even sound like she wants to see me or the city, so whatever. I'll think about how to say it and not sound rude though ^^   You're right. And anyway, sounds like she doesn't even want to come so win-win for the both of us.   Exactly. I can't believe she can't even discern those people's hospitality. You're a stranger, and they're cool with you coming over. That should be enough to be extra thankful for.    (Hopefully the person in question doesn't know Reddit)  (edit) Crap I got the title wrong. I mean, the expression wrong. Spot the non-English speaker!   So I was trying to be nice to this "friend" from college. She's visiting the country, visiting as many cities as possible, and I was like "Hey! Come and stay at my place for a few days!" and she was all "Yes! Of course!"  To put everything into context: I live with a host family, who from the very beginning told me it would be okay to invite people to sleep at their place (I don't know why this topic came up, I never asked them because I never planned on inviting people). Fastforwards few months later, that friend tells me about her plans.   Fastforward to the past couple of days. One, she doesn't want to spend as much days as she originally planned. Ok cool. Whatever. Thought we were friends but whatever. Second, she's just told me that she may come at a later date to visit another city before. Um. No? I have told the host family I'm with that you were coming on a set date. Don't be changing it all the time. They are putting aside some of the things they have planned to welcome you, too. And then she asked me, and I fucking swear: What does they have to do with me?  WHAT? WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SLEEPING? This is not a fucking hotel!   I'm cool. I just need enough courage to tell the girl not to come. I don't deal with princesses.   Anyway. How was your day? I hope better than mine! :D    Lucky you! I can only imagine the view!    It does sound pretty great.    * yet! We never know ; ) (I mean it's not like you must found a place like that)    Yeah I guess not.    Oh wow. I can understand why this place is special to you.   Cool! Where is that?    Looks peaceful! I would love to see that during the fall!    Nice to know! Is there any way for you to go back there?    Some positive nostalgia haha. I hope you get to visit that place soon!    That looks great! Where is it?    Ah cool! What's so special about it?    Yes! [Dominoes but with three sides](http://jungmami.bplaced.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/07092012651.jpg). It's really fun, and a little bit more challenging since you can count points, and there are "special moves" (like three or four?).    True! Been here for only a year! : )   Man did not know Canada was that different. I mean, I can expect the territories to be different, but Calgary? Nice to know.   True. I was shocked to see that vegetables and fruits are free in some markets. I bought tostitos salsa, and it was considered a vegetable ... got it for free!    What? Where in Canada are you from? It's literally the same.   **If you don't have pictures to share, it's okay too!!**  I mean, like a secret not-so-secret place you love so much, you'd only allow the people you love or care about the most to know about it.   In Montreal, it used to be [this café](http://a141.idata.over-blog.com/4/38/24/30/cafe-neve-devanture.jpg) (here's an [inside look](http://www.ellequebec.com/img/photos/biz/ELLEQuebec/culture/Vie%20Culturelle/VC-CafeNeve-intro1.jpg), with the owner on the far right. i used to have the biggest crush on this guy), now I'm in Germany, and it's [this place](http://41.media.tumblr.com/100e2bd0c3cb3a85885e92bea1f9e349/tumblr_nox44hkLMD1r7qdrvo1_1280.jpg) (my picture, so yeah it doesn't really do it justice). Nothing special, but damn. I'm in love.   How about you? Show me those special locations!    Real talk, flour. Raw flour. If I control myself, I can eat one pound in four days. If I go batshit crazy, probably one pound in one day.   Other than that, I think tostitos come to a close second, though the saltiness would hurt the corner of my lips, so I'd stop before that I guess.    I connect with no one at all, so there's that. I don't see myself ever connecting with someone on Reddit. I don't feel like I really belong. On other websites, it has happened maybe ... twice. Which is good enough for me (but I've lost contact with those people).   I'm too strange. But oh well.    If I find someone to play with, absolutely. Though the last time I had the chance to play it, it was actually triomino.   loh-l. My first language is French so there's that.    Same here. I don't find motivation in anything, and I don't feel jealousy eh ... 60% of the time. I'm always super happy when someone finds genuine happiness. Like "Wow, you made it! Continue on! I'm proud of you! :')" type of happiness.    Definitely happens on Tumblr as well, but on a smaller scale. It's just easy to filter the bad things out, I think.    And you know what, I totally understand what you mean by not wanting to get help for it. But I do wish you don't sit through depression or anything else that may be harmful because it sucks! I hope one day it just gets better. Or maybe you get used to it so it stops bothering you? I don't know. Just hope you don't feel miserable.   And sure, we can talk if you wish! : )   I guess the fact that many people have different experiences proves that all websites are the same : ) Some people find legit comfort in Instagram or Twitter, and I have to figure out why. To me, those two apps/websites are cold. How do you bond with people? But to some, it's heaven on Earth. To me, my heaven on Earth is Tumblr. And honestly, I think it's easier to select who you want to deal with because you pick and choose who you get to see on your dashboard. For you, I guess it's Reddit.  But yeah. What bothers me with Reddit is that it seems to be the only website out of the few I named that really believes it's the best out there, by shitting on other websites. And sorry I didn't know most of reddit were young. I guess I spent too much time on subreddits where most people are (unless they're lying) like 25+ men.    I used to have a therapist actually. In college. It helped to have someone to talk with. That's all.  I took a gap year to do the thing I am doing now, which is childcare in exchange of free boarding in a foreign country (I chose Germany). Actually where I used to live, college is a thing you go to before university. I would have graduated this month. No regrets though. I am thinking of studying elsewhere since I would need to finish college if I were to go back to my province, and I feel like I've wasted enough time. I can go to uni (almost) anywhere else. I really don't want to study what I want, because like I said, I don't want to start hating it, and two, working with children doesn't mean working only with children. You're working with an entire system. I will never be alone doing my job, and I don't want to feel stressed out and not do anything.  And for games, I only play single-player games. Multi-player games is just. Stressful.   It's ridiculous. I wish I could be someone else and just start over with a new brain or something. Or have someone hit my head really hard, in hopes that not only do I get severe amnesia, but I also change personality, have no issues at all, etc. It's hard to explain to most people. They think you can just snap out of it. But you can't! It's like your brain has its own mind, and you can only go through whatever it puts you through. Like when I get attention, my brain just goes "this is stressful this is stressful they're looking at you you suck you're failing stop existing." or anything similar, literally non-stop, and I can't just shake it off because that's literally my brain telling me this. The thing that controls me from A to Z. I cannot go against it unless I kill myself. Or sleep I guess.   Anyway. Again, thank you. Sorry for making you go through these lengthy uninteresting paragraphs though.    Do you have a school counsellor? Though I personally think college counsellors are better, because they treat you more naturally. Where do you live? Maybe you can find help for free?    Yes. Anything where I have to "perform", I try to avoid. For instance, I want to learn the piano. The father I'm working for said he would teach me. Three weeks in, I gave up. I shake whenever I approach the piano now, because I feel like if I don't do good, I'm a huge failure and he'll be disappointed, etc.. Also, lately I bought a bike for fun (after years of not riding one), and on my first day with the bike, the family said they'd go on a bike tour with me. The entire time, the father was like "Go faster! Let's race! Catch up!" Now guess who hates to ride a bike now and who feels extremely nervous just knowing it's there. But sometimes, acknowledging my presence is enough to make me freak out. If a group and I were to go out for instance, I rather walk behind them because knowing that they're constantly acknowledging my presence by me being next to/in front of them stresses me out. I very rarely am with just one person for that reason. I can't handle someone's undivided attention.   And I would love to be a teacher to any children, any type of school, any topic. But for some reason, I am really interested in schools dedicated for children with problems, from attachment issues to Down Syndrome. I watched a documentary on a deaf-blind 'institute' in Germany, and wow. I would do that for free if I could. I even started learning ASL in hopes of working in such a place. But again, besides children (under the age of 10, I'd say) and animals, I cannot handle people's attention. If you look at me, I will automatically stop whatever I'm doing and just look boring so you can look away. I automatically do this and it drives me nuts! Sometimes, I could be talking to the child I am taking care of and then as soon as I hear the door open because a parent is back, I start whispering, then it slowly fades into silence.   And as for games, I like playing one game. I used to be so into it, I would spend 12+ hours a day on it (the other 12 hours I'd sleep, eat, take care of my hygiene and give my computer a short break because, you know. Overheating). Now I don't play because I rather play on a PC, but I have a Macbook. I lost interest in most other games. I used to be an avid nintendo DS player when the 'DS Lite' came out, then a couple of months ago I got another one because I thought I missed it. Turns out I don't, unfortunately. I can't find the fun anymore. I feel like I just tossed money out the window. Good thing I never bought myself something like an Xbox.   Hey, by the way, thanks for trying to help. I really appreciate it.    I guess the first one is the lie?    Maybe you should try seeing someone? I mean, if you want. But sometimes it can be really helpful to see a therapist. I know it's not the easiest thing to do.  Are you in college?    The thing I have legit interest in, I would hate to work into that. I hate doing things I like when there is stress or when it involves other people. Right now, I am taking care of a child (I love it), and when the parents are around, I literally just sit and watch the kid. As soon as they're gone, I turn into the cool friend/entertainer/teacher he might like. All this because I feel super anxious around people, but if I'm alone with children or animals, I'm totally okay. I could teach young children, but I obviously won't be alone with those kids. Funny thing is that I wouldn't mind being filmed at all. I almost hope the family I am working with has a nanny cam or mics somewhere, so they know I don't neglect their child.   I also like astronomy, but I suck in maths, never had proper science courses either. I would, again, hate to study it because yeah. I don't want to study it. I just want to lose my shit over the fact that we have a robot heading towards Pluto right now, or that we will eventually send another one on Venus, or we have a couple on Mars ... etc. I once took a geography course because I am into it, but after that course, despite doing really well (so to avoid the argument "maybe you hate it because you failed"), I hated geography for a while.   Hmmm what else. I like ... games? I actually like playing one game, but it's been a while since I last played it. I wish to start again, but I'm scared to lose interest.  That's about it. Other than that, I just waste time. All day long.   I meant more like, wanting to be muscular then succeeding, then looking in the mirror and being like "ugh. ew no."    That sounds cool! How did you figure out it was what you wanted to do?    No, I don't really have any hobbies. :/   Thank you! : )   I admire your positivity, but that last sentence, I don't think so. I don't see how I'll have friends and find someone if I literally never go out or talk to people and have no real social skills.    Oh my, I can totally relate! But have you seen someone for that depression?    I thought it would be like that for me too, and actually when I started college, I forced myself to be sociable. But after two months of ease and what I thought was happiness, I panicked. I hated it, in fact. And during that time, I would spend more and more time isolated, and it felt so good. But part of me keeps saying "Wtf is wrong with you?! Go out and do things!" But I hate doing things ... I don't know, sometimes I just feel like I've failed as a human being. The few things I like are seen as lazy, antisocial, blablabla.    Thank you so much! : )   I don't know. I just want to do things that seem to bring joy to people, even though 99% of said things, I find either stupid, useless, a waste of time ...   I have yet to find happiness in being, you know. What society would call a party pooper, dark cloud, antisocial, weird ... and whatever negative terms there is in contrast to people my age.    I'm sorry this makes no sense, but anyone else wants to be or have something they can't seem to actually enjoy? For instance, I really want to be the stereotypical young adult, but in reality, I hate going out, hate being sociable, hate drinking, hate the idea of hooking up, don't see myself in a relationship, etc.. And I hate hating it.  Anyone else?      Currently living in Germany, but am an American who has resided in Montreal from 2004 to 2015. Honestly, I feel really stuck. I wish I could just fastfoward to seven years from now, be done with school and have a job. Part of me wants to go to school so I can get a good paying job, but then I know I am not patient enough. I've been in school for 17 years! (if you don't include this gap year I took). I really want to advance with my life and be done with 'Chapter 1'. I want to have a paycheck, pay for things, do my taxes ... the whole deal. But I don't even know what job I would like to have. I have no passion at all.   As for the location, I'm just glad I had the chance of living in countries with pretty good social systems. My first years of life were lived in a really terrible country, though my family was well-off but you know. I had eyes and I could see that not everyone was as lucky as I was. I am not saying misery doesn't exist in Canada and Germany, but it's definitely more bearable and fixable compared to my country of origin, and the majority of countries in the world.    Nope, not yet. Conchita just stopped singing though. I guess it's next.    Yeah good thing you missed it. It was crap. Well, it was "good", which is bad. It was so formal, everyone or almost sang ballads. It was boring as hell. I'm a little bummed because it's my first time watching it live from Europe, and all the clips I'd see online were of silly people doing unholy or just batshit crazy things. Yeah. None of that this year.   The most exciting moment so far is Conchita Wurst's short wig. And she just appeared with it, and voting is already closed.    Same. And the omnipresence of pro-LGBT in the Eurovision. LGBT flags everywhere, same-sex people kissing live on stage, Conchita Wurst ... Today's a good day.    I am not disagreeing! I am just saying that I'm pretty sure everyone's opinion is biased because he is a guy. And I was talking about that. Didn't go into the whole creepy stuff because shit accusing someone of being creepy when you don't know anything is damaging. Also, English was obviously not his first language and maybe the way he writes came off as odd as well. Like damn. That's all I was saying.    Of course no one would be like "Yeah cuz you're a man, I think it's creepy." but if you read through the discussions happening, you'll see this point being brought up. And I commented on one of this discussions, saying that the majority of people and society think it's creepy because he's a man. That is literally what my comment was saying. That if he was not a man, I would not feel uncomfortable, like most people have admitted in this thread.    It's pretty boring right now. It's my first time actually watching the entire show (I usually watch bits from YouTube), and I've cheered more for Conchita than any other contestants. Oh except Serbia. Loved her.   But yeah, people are so serious this year. Some girl on social media say "Well, we have guests this year so we gotta behave" and honestly, I think it's that haha. I am not even European, but right now I am residing in Germany.    Because the entire thread is a gender situation, and my comment was about a gender situation. I don't know why then you would engage in a conversation with me if you're going to be talking about another topic.    I understand your point, but you also have to understand the hypocrisy of this. If it were a woman, we would be saying nothing at all. We would be applauding her, calling her generous, brave, etc. Actually that happens quite a lot. Think of teachers who grow fund of a student who happen to have a shitty life at home, etc. Yeah. We wouldn't be saying anything. But we're conditioned to be more aware of red flags when it's a man.  Not saying he *can't* be doing anything wrong, but from the little we know, I don't think it's wise to go directly to that conclusion.    Totally agree with you. The worst is that I felt uncomfortable too. I feel so hypocritical!  Anyway society has done a good job brainwashing. Funny thing is that if he legally adopted her, I wouldn't have thought about it too much. But the whole "from a stranger off the street" thing gets me.   Reminds of this kid in college who would take out his guitar and play before class. I was in a small program, meaning we shared many classes together. The kid was not even taking any music classes. He just liked to sing and play the guitar, which is cool, but not in a classroom when no one asked you to take care of the background music.    Oh I see. Sorry I misunderstood. But yeah it depends on the program. The things I would like to study would require me to speak the language. So I would need to be at a university level of German.    Thank you for your input! : )   I don't agree. Why live in a country if you don't try to speak the language? I am perfectly capable of doing it, so why not do it? My problem is if I want to stay here and lose two years of college, or not live here and go to school right away.   Also, there aren't that many courses taught in English. It depends on the program. Germany is not like Sweden.    Hey, did you know that New Horizons is weeks away from passing by Pluto (10 000 km away from it)! To put that a bit more into perspective, remember that the moon is 384 400 km away! However, we won't get good pictures before a while! First off, Pluto is far okay. Second, sending large images would take time. Third, sending thousands of images will take time. If I recall correctly, we will get all the informations ever taken by New Horizons some time in late 2016. However we will have plenty to be excited about by autumn/winter 2015.  What will be stressful will be the hiatus moment New Horizons will take before the flyby to take pictures. When it sends images to Earth, it cannot take pictures. When it is taking pictures, it cannot send them. Well, at some point it will be able to take a picture that will be sent almost instantaneously to Earth, but not in the very beginning.   The first of the last files it'll be sending before the flyby is sent in case New Horizons fails right before said flyby. The pictures won't be good, they'll be small, not very attractive (but still pretty cool!) It's called E Health. Then, for like an entire day or something, there won't be any news from New Horizons. It's busy taking as much infos and pictures as possible. Then, after a long work day (haha), the night of the flyby, New Horizons will send a file named Phone Home, just to tell scientists it did it. The next day, it'll send a file named First Look. It will have some important science data. Late July will be the beginning of an eight week long data sharing period. September, it will send all the images it ever took, which could take about 10 weeks. After that, it will send all science data it ever took, which is what will take a good year.   I'm super excited. Especially for the "Phone Home" call. It's like sending your child to college in another country 24 hours away by plane, and then finally getting an "I made it" text.   Are you into astronomy?    Hey! my day has not really started yet, but I've planned something. I am doing my laundry now, will put it in the dryer as soon as it's done, then I'll head out for a little stroll. I was thinking maybe eating out, then take the train for an hour (and just chill there, without any real destination) then I would buy a snack and get ready for the Eurovision too! : )   Ha, I am a bit biased too. I love the US, even though I never really lived there. I was born in Brooklyn, literally in the middle of the ghetto, and my family and I would visit 2-3 times a year for ten years, and oh my. I love this place with all my heart. However, reality hit. NYC is expensive as hell! Even Brooklyn, the freaking ghetto, is expensive! How am I going to survive?   And honestly, I don't have a hard time with Germany when it comes to the language. Probably because I am an hermit, and I stay home 99% of the time. The only people I have talked with are cashiers (besides the host family I live with). I speak it a little bit, but not at a university level. Germans (like most people) are not patient with people who don't speak their language anyway. Learning it is no big deal, but I don't know for how long I am willing to stay out of school.   As for my family, it's complicated. I can't just expect to have a peaceful life because I chose to. My culture is crazy. Parents don't have to respect their kids at all. They do whatever they want to you because you're the kid (even if you're like 50+), and they're grown. And I am not one who thinks that "Blood  Everything". So yeah. No thank you. No family for me. I mean, if we keep a distance, fine. But I feel like I can only control how much they can say or do to me only if I keep a distance. Like I wouldn't want them to spontaneously show up at my door one day. I know they won't do that if I live across the ocean.   Thanks for your input though : )   Yes we looked into that, and for some reason, we have not found a class yet. There is another school dedicated to learning German, and they suck! I mean, first of all, they are rude as hell. I had to leave once because the level of rudeness was out of control. Second time I came to take a placement test, they didn't give me a proper test, just talked for a few seconds, asked me how many classes I've had before, and that's it. There was only one class available for my level, and literally the day it was supposed to start, they cancelled it.   The other reliable language school won't have classes before August.   I guess I landed in the wrong city, at the wrong time.    Yeah I know, but I meant if I were to get into financial trouble, it would be nearly impossible to bounce back (as a kid in college). I don't know if it's that serious of a problem, since yes, people find it problematic but it doesn't seem to be something everyone is eager to change for some reason. I don't know. the US is messed up, but being a citizen and all, it would be so easy to just. Move there. (plus I guess nostalgia is making me miss America a little too much, and I kinda want to live there).    I understand. And yes, I have taken German classes for about a year and a half in college (Canada), and this summer I will be taking another class. It's surprisingly hard to find a German class that isn't too expensive here.   Thank you for your input! : )      I used to. I got into it way after it changed its shows into reality stuff. I stopped simply because I generally stopped watching television.  I don't understand why people hate reality TV so much. If it's not your cup of tea, cool. Of course it's not 100% reality, because not everyone has that exciting of a life, so those reality TV shows must show you things in a way or at a frequency that makes you believe "wow, cool".  I loved TLC because watching those shows about certain people was like checking on people you've gotten used to. Like ~~Jon and~~ Kate plus 8. "That lady who had six babies in one day, how is she doing?" Or "This couple suffering from dwarfism, have they had their child?" etc. I personally never liked the Duggars because one minute of this show and it was obvious what was going on. Those kids were brainwashed as hell, the older brother was always so obviously creepy, the father was even worse, and the sisters and youngest kids deserved so much better. I'm hoping those two who got married will somehow start a change because they are both so obviously intelligent and strong-minded. The little kids would benefit from a better lifestyle. I feel for them.  And I see a lot of people talking about how it used to be The Learning Channel. Well History channel used to be about history. National Geographic used to be about geography. Discovery Channel used to teach you a lot of stuff. Now it's like Pawnshop wars or BBQ wars or cars wars or whatever the actual titles are. TLC is not the only one that changed.   That's the thing. Reddit is no different than any other websites. You can find amazing communities just like those on Reddit on 4Chan, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr ... The problem is that Reddit seems to be the only one out of those that believes their communities are much better than the others, when it is literally the same. The only difference is that the majority of Reddit users are old men. Doesn't make them any smarter or mature. But they're convinced their age (even gender) is enough to prove they're better.   A bunch of people who think they're better than other websites, by behaving exactly like people from said other websites. e.g.: 4Chan, **TUMBLR**, Facebook, Instagram ...  Except this subreddit. This subreddit awesome.    Haiti! :D   Hello! Nice to hear from a fellow INFJ!    Hello, fellow human part of the 1%! :D   Same! Haha I don't think I'm inspiring, but maybe I can be convincing if the confidence is with me. A few times, I would be so deep in a debate and have no new arguments left, that I just repeat myself with other words and the people take it as new ones (then they're like wow, she came prepared!). Have you ever noticed, when you speak, people looking at you "You sound eloquent but that makes no sense to me!" It makes them second-guess their opinion, and I guess that counts as convincing.    Twin! I've found you!    Ah, thanks yes this makes more sense. Maybe we're more empathic. Though would you "feel" for strangers too? Like you see someone ranting about having a terrible day online, would you feel for them?    Yay! Let's celebrate being part of the cool kids of this world! : )   Yeah! But another comment has said maybe we're just empathetic easily, which I can agree with. If were were to see someone crying in the bus, maybe we would feel for them immediately (without really doing anything else)? Are you the same?    Hey!   14% F. which means sometimes, when logic fails me, I go with the flow. It's something I've been working on ever since I graduated high school. Can't say it is working for me though.   Somehow comforting. Of course, no one knows you better than you, but somehow knowing that you're a 'thing' (aka, describable) and that you're not the only one described a certain way, is really comforting. I mean, most of the things said, I knew it already about myself. But for a random website to "know" those descriptive terms and to share them with me, means I'm not an extremely alien type. There are other people out there, similar to me. Even though my group is just 1% of people, which explains why I personally always feel so odd, an outcast, and even "crazy". Asking for help when you're lost and so different from the majority can be difficult. But yeah. At least I'm not doomed! I know some people I can relate to personally have lived. I just need to know how to take advantage of my strengths and how to overlook my weaknesses.    Of course : )   I have to say though, many other facts might have led to these results despite me being completely different. I don't talk nor approach people (and I did let the test know that), so I find it weird that it would think that I find it easy to connect with people. Maybe if I were not socially anxious all the time, I would, but as of right now, not really.   And yeah, I agree! Some things were so accurate! Amazing!    ADVOCATE (INFJ-T). I half agree with it. For instance, it says that we take initiatives. I don't really. I mean, I would but some things are stopping me (anxiety). Also,   "INFJs **find it easy to make connections with others**, and have a talent for warm, sensitive language, *speaking in human terms, rather than with pure logic and fact.*"   That's false. 100%.   However,  People with the INFJ personality type are **unlikely to go for friendships of circumstance**, like workplace social circles or chatting up their local baristas, where the only thing they really have in common is a day-to-day familiarity. Rather, INFJs seek out people who share their passions, interests and ideologies, people with whom they can explore philosophies and subjects that they believe are truly meaningful.  That is so accurate, and it's so hard to explain this to other people. I don't want casual relationships. Others think it's a very asocial thing to be (well, it is I guess).    Hey, by the way that was really interesting. Thank you so much : )   YO. I live in a city that is a champion at that! It's in Germany, but I don't know how common it is. Dogs re extremely well behaved, as in most can walk without a leach. And I'm cool with that, as long as said dog is trained and not to nervous and very obedient. But the owners, they need seriously training.  I walked to a supermarket that is like 200 meters away from my place, and I saw 12 dog poop piles. TWELVE. I am still mad about it, honestly.   I miss my home city because people picked up their dog poop. And those who didn't were clever enough to have their dog poop on grass/mud. Not in the middle of the sidewalk.    The Haitian president is actually bald   I don't know if most people would consider it a hobby but, would you be into people watching? It's honestly fun. Just sit there somewhere at a café maybe (those with outdoor seats), and just watch people. Or, walk. If you're not into walking, take the train to wherever! Or just go from terminal to terminal.   I've personally lot motivation to do anything, and I think one of the reasons why I don't enjoy them is because doing things stress me out. And I don't enjoy stress very much. Walking, people watching or taking the train require no special ability or effort, so no stress for me.     South Korea, man. You'll have so much fun there, weather you're an introvert or an extrovert. This country, well at least Seoul, is perfect.    Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I'm not about this "don't make it too obvious" trend. Honesty is such a beautiful thing. Just be clear, honest, but not like. Creepy. By creepy, don't make her feel like she must go back to you, or something like that. Just share your feeling. See how she feels.    It's called Secrets d'Histoire. Once a month or so, they air a 1h30 ~ 2h00 long documentary, very often about a Royal, most often from France (well personally, I've only seen Royals from France, but since I have not seen all episodes, I don't know if they explore other countries or historical figures). Tonight, it was about Louis XVI, the last King of France. It's amazing how history is very ... how can I say this. Open to interpretation. I've seen a documentary about him many times before, and the last two times, he was described as a weak, fat, lazy man lacking libido and not really into his family life or his kingship. In that documentary, he was described as strong, cute, happy, nice, a great father, husband and king who tried his best for his people. His lack of libido was caused by a medical problem and how he was taught, his clumsiness was caused by his father and grandfather, and his brother's death, etc. What's funny is that those first documentaries were by Americans, so from a country Louis XVI helped, while that documentary was 100% French. Yet the French one (and you know, French people are not afraid to criticize) portrayed him so nicely. Honestly, I think he and his wife were extremely nice and great, just misunderstood and way too young to be Royals. Plus, he was not meant to be a King, so no one thought about teaching him anything about becoming a King so what did they expect?!  Anyway. I love this documentary so much. I think I'll go visit Versailles some time this autumn.   Sorry you only asked the title and I gave you an entire essay haha.    I'm about to watch an episode of one of my favorite documentary series!!  Btw, that sounds yum.   I'm pretty sure if you try hard enough, you'll find an African in your ancestry line. If you're from Mid-Westernish Europe, the Mediterranean, Northern Africa and the middle East, you'll find a Jewish person, garanteed.    Man even the governments doesn't care about individuals. They have millions of others so they don't care about the few that want to or will die.   Thanks! Hey, may I ask where do you usually go to? We probably aren't from the same location but just to get an idea haha. : )   This is really encouraging. I think I'd feel better if I brought some entertainment, that's for sure.   Thank you for sharing! I think I'll start doing that!    I've been thinking about this lately! I always say I want to be a mother, blablabla but lately I've been second-guessing my skills as a mother, so I don't know. Also, I'm finding out that I'm at my happiest when I don't do anything and when I'm alone.   I think I would just move to Paris and do nothing. Sounds bad, but it's honestly the most rewarding thing I could do. I'd wake up at maybe 9 or 10 am, watch TV while munching on cereals, then I'd go out to the market and buy whatever I need for the day, maybe flowers even. Then I'd go back home, watch some more TV while doing whatever: cleaning, laundry, folding clean laundry, learn something on the internet, whatever. Then I'd cook lunch/dinner. Later at night, I'd go out and walk around the city. People watching is a thing I enjoy a lot, so I would totally do that. Maybe I'd take a night train for a roundtrip. Not leaving the train, just sitting there and enjoying peace and quiet. Maybe I'll read, or play video games, or just chill and listen to music. Sometimes, if one of my favorite shows is being recorded, I'd go to said recordings. Right now, I really love a French TV Host who hosts a TV Show and a radio show, and I'd love to attend both. Or, I'd go and watch some theatre. Bigger theaters, smaller, independent artists. Whatever. Then if I get hungry, I'd go to one of those late-night cafés in Paris, and just eat whatever there is.   Then I'd go to bed at midnight or 1 am, and start all over again.   From time to time, I'd go to cities I like, rent an apartment, and do the same. New York some time during the winter, Seoul during the spring, maybe Vancouver a week during the summer? And back to Paris for the remainder fo the year.   Oh, and maybe I'd get a cat.    Yo be happy there's no equality when it comes to bathrooms because trust me. Girls' bathrooms are nasty as fuck. Men have to deal with unflushed (or smeared?) pee and poop. Us girls have to deal with pee and poop and blood. Sometimes all together. Like girls on their period who think it's totally okay not to flush their bloody diarrhea, or who clog the toilet with their tampons/pads, or who leave the bathroom looking like a murder scene, AND THEY WON'T CLEAN UP. I sympathize with my fellow girls because being on your period sucks, BUT COME ON.    I'm sorry, this is long.   I ~~usually~~ always talk about the negative, but let me talk about the positive. I was born in the US, but spent eight years, from 2 months to 8 years of age, on an island in the Caribbean. Mind you, my island used to be popular like most others, now it has a reputation of being "poor, dirty, broken, corrupted", which are all true, but it's not like the country has nothing to offer.  Anyway. I have to say, living on an island is pretty fun. We lived in the city, so the beach was not next door, but from my roof, we could see it. From time to time, my father would organize a trip to one of the most beautiful private-own beaches of the country. It was amazing! Also, the culture of my people may be too old-fashion and even barbaric at times, but other aspects are awesome. For instance, people are quite happy, despite the misery. And everyone is extremely lively and funny. One day, we were at a river, my dad's car got stuck in the mud, and while we were trying to get it out, two kids just ran towards the car to see what was happening. Those kids were obviously poor, not in school, but they climbed up the truck that was trying to pull my dad's car out the mud, and they had the time of their life. They tried helping (by directing the truck driver), they'd climb up and down ... at some point one ran out and came back with sugar canes to share with his pal to watch the show. In the end, my father gave them money and they were ecstatic. That money probably meant they'd finally have a real meal today (and it was 8 pm when we got stuck). Though this even took place way after I had moved out (I travelled there to visit), and I was no longer a child.   Another thing I'll always remember is the other kids I grew up with. Outside of school, most of my friends were poor people. But it didn't matter. A story my parents told me is that after church, I'd run back home with them and I'd share yoghurt. I loved yoghurt and I am guessing I wanted them to love the thing I love. Again, most were poor, so to them, it was a great opportunity to get a snack, while to me, it was a great opportunity to convert my friends to yoghurt-ism. The most "daring" things I've done in my life were done with them. For instance behind my house, we had this steep slope I was not allowed to go near. Well, one day I went down on it, and climbed back up. Twice. Or one of them lived next to us, and to get to his house you had to climb a ladder. I was never allowed to climb a ladder, until one day I followed my dad to their house, and he wasn't going to leave me alone so I climbed. Or that time my friends were too poor to buy a kite (on a specific day, everyone flies a kite), so they made one, and that day I learned how to build kites. Ok, I never managed to fly a homemade one because I couldn't remember which material they used, but it was still fun.  In my country, if you have a little more money, it's common for your terrain to be used by many, if you allow it. My father's job allowed him to own not only our house, but a church and a school, all on the same terrain. So, people working for the church and/or the school sometimes resided on the premises as well. My first two houses were like that, and my third house was a smaller terrain without a school or church, but my uncle's house and a boutique was there, too. So it's like sharing your backyard with a bunch of people, which is always fun.   Well, one day, I moved to my third house, which meant I'd leave behind most of my friends. However a couple of friends would still come over (those who could, meaning those who were fortunate enough), and I remember one day playing a video game on my N64 with one. We didn't speak English at all, but we tried to understand what to do in that game called Quest 64. At some point in the game, you get into a valley, and sometimes you encounter monsters. You can either escape (if you're far away enough) or fight them. Being terrified kids, we'd always escape if we could. So imagine two girls, scared to death, between the age of 6 and 8, screaming "ESCAPE!" with the most Caribbean-French accent in the world. (Pronounced kind of like: "Eh-skahp").   My main regret is to not have been more out there. I was quite sheltered, because both my parents grew up poor and they hated it, so since we were fortunate, they did not want me to associate too much with poor people (unless they're girls from the church we attended, because their mothers were nice or whatever). My grandmother was especially strict with that "rule". Before, they didn't care as much because we lived next to a school so of course kids would be everywhere. But when we moved for the third time, that was when the rule was 100% enforced. My uncle had adopted a boy my age, and they were kind of poor and I was not allowed to play with him at all because of that. They allowed me to play with my cousin sometimes only because we were blood relatives. Kinda sucks.  But yeah. There were those positives in my childhood. : )   I never take a cart when I go grocery shopping alone. So I always go through the isles like twenty times to see what I need and can just hold without looking weird. One time I went grocery shopping with my dog. I had to carry said dog and whatever I was buying. Yeah. ~~I can't even drive a damn cart straight.~~   Lately my anxiety has been quite ridiculous. For instance today, I have not left my room yet (it's 2:19 pm) and I am freaking out because later, I will have to go on a bike ride with some people. What has been working for you, when it comes to calming down when extremely nervous?   Thank you! : )   I have a thing for judge shows, and after weeks of Judge Judy and People's Court, [I'm all about Divorce Court now](https://41.media.tumblr.com/2a9c9759ed9d8f943361b39e1357da11/tumblr_nolfuosld31r7qdrvo1_1280.png).  I love Shooting Stars by Bag Raiders : )   You know, if right now you think you're bisexual, then you might as well be. Maybe three months later you'll realize that you're not. Maybe twenty years later you'll realize you're not, or the day before you 99th birthday is when you realize "wow, I've always been straight." Or, maybe you'll feel comfortable calling yourself bi for the rest of your life!  Knowing your sexuality is tough, like knowing yourself as a whole is quite difficult. It's a matter of how you feel and what makes you feel comfortable. That may or may not change as you learn about yourself as you grow older. So yeah. Don't worry about labels. It's nice to know where you "belong" but don't expect it to always be a rigid tag.    Yeah like OP said, some stereotypes are negative. My race and age group seem to only have negative stereotypes ... :/   Do you mean places like McDonald's or actual restaurants with a server coming at your table and taking your order? I would love to go to one on my own but I am terrified of stares and people potentially pitying me.   Pretty sure it was because of school? That's all I remember (and I remember running though the airport with my annoyed mother). I can't think of another reason tbh. Mother wasn't drunk and anyway it wasn't her. It was me who was stopped.   Long story short, when I was 5 or 6, a boarding agent refused to let me board my plane back home. Her reason? School was starting the next day, and I shouldn't miss any days. I was in Florida, and I am American but I never resided in the US. She didn't believe that we lived overseas, since "I was clearly American". What's weird is that since birth (and until the age of 9), I'd go to the US two or three times a year, and this has happened only once.  Almost missed our plane. People around us acted like it was "kind of her to be so considerate".   Anyway. Can this happen? This was in 2001 or early 2002.    It's a French band (they sing in English though). Their name is Stuck in the Sound and the song in question is Toy Boy.   Last summer I went to South Korea. Throughout the entire trip, I listened to one song on repeat. Now, whenever I listen to this song, I remember South Korea. I especially remember the flights though. Probably because it was on repeat non-stop for close to 20-24 hours?  	106
